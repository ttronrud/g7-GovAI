These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Qikiqtarjuaq Airport in Nunavut to ensure aviation safety by preventing developments or natural growth that could interfere with aircraft operations, signals, or communications. They define specific imaginary surfaces (such as approach, strip, outer, and transitional surfaces) and prohibit construction, vegetation growth, or activities that penetrate these surfaces, with limited exceptions like short-term open water reservoirs.
