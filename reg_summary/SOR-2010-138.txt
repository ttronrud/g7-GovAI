These regulations establish the circumstances under which waivers can be granted under Section 147 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, specifically in response to an actual or anticipated fuel shortage that affects national security, emergency responses, or military operations. The regulations come into force upon registration and are triggered when a fuel shortage occurs alongside specific government actions or declarations.
