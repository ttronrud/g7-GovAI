The Governor General, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, transfers the control and supervision of the National Search and Rescue Secretariat from the Department of National Defence to the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This reallocation enhances the coordination of search and rescue operations within the federal public administration.
