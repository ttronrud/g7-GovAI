These regulations require retail credit associations in Canada to clearly disclose all charges related to personal and non-personal deposit account services to customers and the public, including providing written statements at branches, points of service, and online, and notifying customers at least 30 or 60 days before any charge increases. The rules also mandate the availability of a public list of charges and the ability for customers to inspect it during business hours.
