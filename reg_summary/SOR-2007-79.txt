The Fort McKay First Nation Oil Sands Regulations establish a legal framework for oil sands mining activities on designated project lands, harmonizing Alberta’s environmental and industrial laws with the governance of the Fort McKay First Nation, while ensuring federal oversight and protecting Indigenous rights. The regulations specify which Alberta laws apply, adapt them where necessary, and exclude certain provisions, with key powers and duties reserved for the First Nation and the federal Minister.
