These regulations establish a government insurance program to cover up to 100% of losses (up to $13 million) on loans made by private lenders to Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc., ensuring the company can continue operations until completion of its icebreaker project. The insurance is funded through annual fees paid by private lenders, with the Minister's liability capped at the lesser of the insurance amount in force or 100% of the lender’s actual loss.
