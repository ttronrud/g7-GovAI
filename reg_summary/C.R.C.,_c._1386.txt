These Regulations establish the criteria and conditions for granting regional development incentives, including definitions of eligible assets, commercial operations, and job creation, and set limits on capital costs, equity requirements, and repayment obligations if facilities are damaged or operations fail to meet expectations. They also specify rules for loan guarantees in designated regions and require applicants to maintain employment, use eligible assets, and meet production thresholds to retain incentive payments.
