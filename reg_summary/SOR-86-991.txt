These regulations establish rules for the storage of goods in customs offices, allowing goods to be deposited in a place of safe-keeping if not removed within specified time limits—40 days for most commercial goods, four days for perishable goods, and 14 days for nuclear substances or certain restricted items—after being reported under the Customs Act. Goods not removed within those periods may be forfeited, and storage charges apply to most goods, with exemptions for mail-imported goods, strikes, court proceedings, or other unforeseen circumstances.
