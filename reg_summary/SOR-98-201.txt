These regulations establish the requirements for issuing and managing firearms registration certificates in Canada, including the need for verification of firearm details by an approved verifier, specific application forms and submission methods, conditions on firearm modifications, and requirements for permanently marking firearms with identification numbers. The regulations come into force on December 1, 1998, and apply to firearms legally in possession on that date.
