These regulations allow the Employment Insurance Commission to extend the 365-day deadline for requesting reconsideration of a decision only if there is a reasonable explanation, a continuing intent to request reconsideration, and a reasonable chance of success—without causing prejudice to the Commission or any party. The regulations came into force on April 1, 2013.
