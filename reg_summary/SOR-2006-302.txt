These regulations establish specific conditions under which insiders of trust and loan companies are subject to civil remedies, including a 10% voting rights threshold and defined circumstances for prohibited purchases or sales related to confidential information or take-over bids, and they come into force upon registration. The regulations align with definitions of "take-over bid" across various provincial securities acts to ensure consistent application.
