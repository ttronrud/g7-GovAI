This regulation establishes the method for calculating moisture shrinkage for grain that is artificially dried at a licensed elevator, requiring the shrinkage percentage to be based on the grain's moisture content before and after drying, with a minimum threshold to ensure it does not fall below the specified moisture limit for tough grades. The Order takes effect upon registration.
