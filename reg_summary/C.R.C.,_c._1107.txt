These regulations set maximum interest rates for loans under the National Housing Act (Act), with a reduced rate of 2¼% plus a calculated bond yield for loans made on or after July 1, 1969, and higher rates (17½% or 16%) for specific loan types under certain sections of the Act, all computed semi-annually and not in advance.
