The Electricity and Gas Inspection Regulations, enacted on January 25, 1986, establish standards for the inspection, verification, and accurate measurement of electricity and gas meters, including requirements for meter performance, record-keeping by owners, calibration procedures, and specifications for meter design and installation. The regulations also provide exemptions for certain broken seals and outline procedures for delegating administrative functions, ensuring accountability and accuracy in metering operations.
