This regulation establishes a compliance framework for the Canadian Payments Association, outlining procedures for investigating and addressing contraventions by members and non-members, including the referral of complaints to committees, investigation processes, sanctions such as reprimands, restitution, suspension, and penalties, and the requirement to file compliance reports and maintain a public record. It ensures fair, transparent, and impartial investigations while protecting parties from liability for good-faith actions.
