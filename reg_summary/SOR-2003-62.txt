These regulations restrict bank holding companies from acquiring control of or making substantial investments in entities that engage in certain information technology activities—such as developing or managing data transmission systems or information platforms—unless specific conditions are met, including limits on the combined balance sheet value and loan amounts, and prohibitions if the entity engages in activities that banks are not permitted to conduct. The regulations come into force upon registration.
