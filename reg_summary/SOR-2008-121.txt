These regulations establish safety requirements for inflatable vessels operating in Canadian waters to carry passengers on paid excursions, including equipment standards, personnel qualifications, safety briefings, and rescue plans, with specific enhanced requirements for class 3 or above waters, such as helmets, thermal protection, and swift-water rescue certifications. The rules apply to non-motorized rigid-hull inflatable vessels and require vessels to be in good condition, properly equipped, and operated under safe conditions, with records maintained for three years.
