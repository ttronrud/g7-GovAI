The Safety of Sperm and Ova Regulations establish comprehensive requirements for the processing, distribution, and storage of sperm and ova to ensure human health and safety, including registration of establishments, donor suitability assessments, quality management systems, record-keeping, and reporting of errors, accidents, or adverse reactions. The regulations also define key terms, outline procedures for exceptional and directed donations, and mandate strict documentation and accountability throughout the lifecycle of donated reproductive material.
