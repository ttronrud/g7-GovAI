This regulation grants a tax remission for imported demonstration aircraft (including helicopters) into Canada after December 31, 1990, provided the importer is a Canadian resident, certifies the aircraft will be used solely for demonstration, maintains complete records, and exports the aircraft if it is no longer used for demonstration. The remission applies under specific conditions and is subject to inspection and enforcement by the Department of National Revenue.
