This regulation establishes the geographical coordinates of points used to define baselines and the outer limit of the territorial sea for specific areas in Canada, as outlined in the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act. Baselines are defined as straight lines or low-water lines depending on the area and schedule, and for Area 3, it provides alternative methods for determining the territorial sea outer limit line using straight or geodesic lines.
