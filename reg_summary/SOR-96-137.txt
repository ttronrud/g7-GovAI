This regulation repeals the previous British Columbia Sport Fishing Regulations and replaces them with new rules governing sport fishing in Pacific Ocean and British Columbia waters, effective April 1, 1996. It sets specific limits on fishing methods, species, gear, and daily/annual catch quotas, with special provisions for tidal waters, salmon, trout, and shellfish, while also requiring licenses and conservation stamps for fishing in certain areas.
