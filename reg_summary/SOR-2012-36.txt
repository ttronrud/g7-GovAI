The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) enacted the Electronic Commerce Protection Regulations to ensure that commercial electronic messages include clear, prominent, and accessible information about the sender, their contact details, and an unsubscribe mechanism, while also establishing requirements for obtaining informed consent for electronic communications. These rules aim to promote transparency and consumer protection in electronic commerce.
