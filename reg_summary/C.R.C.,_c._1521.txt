This regulation outlines the terms under which exploratory oil and gas permits can be awarded in Canada, allowing tenders either for a cash bonus or an exploratory work bonus tied to specified expenditures. If a work bonus is required, the permittee must spend a defined amount on exploratory work, with only the allowable portion of the deposit returned, and the remainder forfeited, while permitting grouping of permit areas for work bonus fulfillment if they are near coastal waters.
