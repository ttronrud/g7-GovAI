This regulation authorizes the Minister of National Defence to lend defence materiel to Canadian contractors, at no cost to the Crown, to help fulfill foreign government orders, as long as the materiel is not needed for defence purposes and can be recalled if required for defence. The Department of Supply and Services administers the loans under conditions set by the Minister of Supply and Services.
