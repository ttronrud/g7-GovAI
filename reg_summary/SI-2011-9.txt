The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan has established rules to govern the filing, procedure, and administration of criminal appeals, ensuring an orderly and timely process for appeals from convictions, sentences, or acquittals, with specific timelines, factum requirements, service procedures, and provisions for self-represented parties and court-appointed counsel. These rules apply to both offender and Attorney General appeals and include detailed requirements for notices, facts, arguments, appendices, and hearing scheduling, while allowing flexibility through judicial discretion and practice directives.
