This regulation establishes the requirements for calculating and disclosing the cost of borrowing for retail credit agreements under the Cooperative Credit Associations Act, including the annual percentage rate (APR), required charges, and mandatory disclosure statements to borrowers. It specifies what information must be included in these disclosures, how they must be presented (clearly, simply, and in a standardized format), and when they must be provided—particularly before or at the time of entering into a credit agreement.
