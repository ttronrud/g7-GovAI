The Governor General in Council revoked the 1987 Frontier Lands Petroleum Royalty Regulations and introduced new regulations governing royalties on petroleum produced from frontier lands, establishing a tiered royalty structure based on production month and allowing deferral of royalties through a trust for abandonment and restoration costs. These regulations were later repealed in 2008.
