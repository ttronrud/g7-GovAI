These regulations set safety limits for lead and cadmium in children’s jewellery, requiring that such jewellery contain no more than 90 mg/kg of lead and no more than 130 mg/kg of cadmium under specific conditions, and come into force six months after publication in the Canada Gazette. The regulations are based on good laboratory practices and apply to jewellery designed primarily for children under 15 years of age.
