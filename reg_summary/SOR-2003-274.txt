This regulation establishes the delegation of authority by Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC) to Provincial Commodity Boards to administer federal and provincial chicken quotas, including allotting quotas to producers, subject to specific conditions and provincial rules, while revoking a prior administrative authority order. The Provincial Commodity Boards must forward all required reports and information to CFC and are prohibited from allotting quotas to producers not in good standing or to processors without valid market development licenses.
