These Ontario regulations establish a controlled marketing system for white pea and yellow-eye beans produced in Ontario, restricting sales to authorized dealers who act on behalf of the Ontario Bean Producers’ Marketing Board. Producers may only sell beans to dealers, who must inspect and sell them according to Canada Grain Act standards, with disputes resolved by a final decision from a Canadian Grain Commission inspector.
