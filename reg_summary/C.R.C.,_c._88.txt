The Kamloops Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions on buildings and structures near Kamloops Airport, limiting construction to the elevation of specific imaginary surfaces—such as approach surfaces, horizontal surface, outer surface, and transitional surfaces—designed to ensure safe aircraft operations. These regulations apply to lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, excluding areas that are formally part of the airport, and define precise geometric boundaries based on runways and reference points.
