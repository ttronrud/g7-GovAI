The Ontario Superior Court of Justice repealed previous criminal proceedings rules and enacted new Criminal Proceedings Rules, effective March 1, 2012, to standardize and streamline criminal proceedings in the court, ensuring fairness, simplicity, and efficiency while providing clear guidelines for filings, hearings, documents, and procedures. These rules apply to all criminal prosecutions, appeals, and applications within the Superior Court of Justice and are designed to be liberally construed to eliminate delay and expense.
