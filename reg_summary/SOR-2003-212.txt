The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) establishes cost recovery fee regulations to recover the full costs of regulatory activities for licensees and applicants of Class I nuclear facilities, mines and mills, waste nuclear substance activities, Class II facilities and equipment, dosimetry services, and certain nuclear substance and radiation device certifications. Fees are calculated based on direct and indirect regulatory costs, with annual fees adjusted after the fiscal year based on actual versus estimated costs, and initial applications requiring deposits that are later applied to fees.
