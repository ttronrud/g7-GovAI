These Regulations exempt certain railway employees, such as yardmasters, locomotive engineers, and brakemen, from specific hours of work provisions in Part III of the Canada Labour Code, allowing their hours to be scheduled and worked without regard to standard overtime limits. The regulations are known as the Railway Running-Trades Employees Hours of Work Regulations.
