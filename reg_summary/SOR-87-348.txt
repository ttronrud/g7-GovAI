These regulations establish the requirements for notifying the Competition Commission of certain transactions that may affect competition in Canada, particularly those involving asset securitization. They define key terms such as financial assets and asset securitization transactions, set out how to calculate the aggregate value of assets and gross revenues from sales, and specify the information that must be provided when a transaction is notified under Part VIII of the Competition Act. Notably, transactions that are part of an asset securitization are exempt from Part IX of the Act unless they result in the acquisition of substantially all of a business’s non-financial assets.
