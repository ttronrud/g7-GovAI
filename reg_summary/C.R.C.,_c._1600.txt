This regulation establishes the rules for distributing gratuities to infants or persons of unsound mind, specifying that payments go to surviving parents, guardians, or persons in loco parentis, with payments directed to the Canadian Pension Commission if the recipient is unfit to handle money. Payments may be made in lump sums or installments and must include a notice and clear statement of beneficiaries and amounts.
