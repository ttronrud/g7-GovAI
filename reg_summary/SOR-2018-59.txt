These regulations establish the framework for compensating shareholders and creditors of a federal member financial institution in the event of its winding up or restructuring, defining eligible parties, calculating compensation based on liquidation and resolution values, and outlining the process for offering and determining compensation, including provisions for appeals by assessors. Compensation is determined using a specific formula and must be offered uniformly for shares or liabilities of the same class, with payments made within a set timeframe unless an assessor is appointed to resolve disputes.
