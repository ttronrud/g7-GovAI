This proclamation designates the last Sunday in September each year as "Police and Peace Officers’ National Memorial Day" to honor the dedication, service, and sacrifices of Canadian police and peace officers, including those who died in the line of duty. It was issued by the Governor General in Council on September 24, 1998, and came into effect on that date.
