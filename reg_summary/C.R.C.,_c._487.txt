These regulations establish a customs drawback program for imported shirting fabrics used in the manufacture of shirts in Canada, allowing manufacturers to recover up to 100% of the customs duties paid on imported fabrics, provided they use at least 75% Canadian fabric in the production process during a specified drawback period. If Canadian fabric use falls below 75%, the drawback rate is reduced by two percentage points for each percentage point of shortfall, with claims required to be filed within four years of duty payment.
