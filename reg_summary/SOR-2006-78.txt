These regulations establish zoning restrictions around the Region of Waterloo International Airport to ensure aviation safety by preventing the construction of structures or objects that exceed specified elevation limits—such as approach, outer, and transitional surfaces—and by prohibiting activities that could interfere with aircraft communications or attract birds to the airport area. The regulations come into force when certain conditions under the Aeronautics Act are met.
