This regulation grants the Minister of National Defence authority to inspect defence materiel produced in Canada for allied, foreign, and Commonwealth governments, with inspections conducted at no cost to Canada when reciprocal arrangements exist or when costs are covered by existing resources. If additional costs arise without such arrangements, those costs are recoverable from the foreign government, and the Crown assumes no liability for the inspections.
