These regulations establish zoning restrictions around St. John’s (Torbay) Airport, limiting the height of any structures or natural growth to the specified approach, transitional, and outer surfaces to ensure aviation safety. They define precise boundaries and elevation limits for land adjacent to the airport, with specific dimensions for runways and surrounding areas, and prohibit the disposal of bird-attractive waste on affected lands.
