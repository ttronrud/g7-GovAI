The Governor General in Council has approved regulations that allow the National Energy Board to order substituted service of notices when personal service is impractical, provided that the Board is satisfied such service is feasible and likely to reach the intended recipient. Substituted service may be carried out by leaving the notice with an adult, sending it by registered mail, or publishing it in local publications, and the notice is deemed received the day after all methods are completed.
