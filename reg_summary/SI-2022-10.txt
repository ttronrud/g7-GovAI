This regulation withdraws a 2,000-square-kilometre tract of territorial lands on the northern portion of Bathurst Island, Nunavut, from disposal for 10 years to protect the area until the Nunavut Land Use Plan is approved, while excluding specific mineral-related activities that were already authorized before the Order was made. The lands are adjacent to Qausuittuq National Park and Polar Bear Pass National Wildlife Area and are described in detail by coordinates and topographic features.
