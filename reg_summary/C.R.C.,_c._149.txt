This regulation establishes a turkey marketing levy system in British Columbia, requiring producers to pay $0.05 per pound live weight on any turkey sold beyond their market allotment, with buyers responsible for deducting and remitting these levies to the Commodity Board. Producers must also pay any unpaid levies within 15 days of the following month.
