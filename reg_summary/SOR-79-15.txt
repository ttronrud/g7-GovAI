These regulations establish safety standards for handling carloads of explosives on railway team or spur tracks in Canada, requiring risk assessments based on danger factors such as quantity, frequency, and proximity to populated areas, and mandating approvals from the Canadian Transport Commission and local fire authorities. Railways must implement strict safety measures, including fire prevention, secure access, and immediate reporting of any incidents involving explosives.
