This regulation establishes the International Joint Commission Immunity Order, granting the International Joint Commission and its Commissioners, staff, and experts immunity from legal process in Canada for actions taken in their official capacities, as provided in the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities, except where immunity is expressly waived. Immunity does not apply to judicial proceedings initiated before this Order was enacted.
