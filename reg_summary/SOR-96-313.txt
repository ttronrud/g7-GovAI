This regulation establishes specific contraventions related to port and waterway activities, environmental protection, land use, and wildlife management, defining offences, their short-form descriptions, and corresponding fines. For contraventions involving young persons, fines are capped at $100, and if a quota or limit applies, only the first amount exceeding it is subject to additional penalties.
