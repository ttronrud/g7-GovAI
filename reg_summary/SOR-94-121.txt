These regulations establish zoning restrictions at St. Anthony Airport in Newfoundland to ensure aviation safety by limiting building heights and land use near the airport, defining specific surfaces (approach, outer, and transitional) that must not be exceeded in elevation, and prohibiting activities that interfere with aircraft operations or attract birds. The regulations apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point and prohibit structures or developments that exceed the defined elevation limits or disrupt air traffic communications.
