The Canadian government has repealed older plant quarantine and emergency infestation regulations and replaced them with the Plant Protection Regulations, which establish a comprehensive framework for preventing the importation, exportation, and spread of plant pests, including requirements for pest risk assessments, quarantine measures, inspections, permits, and the certification of plants and related materials. These regulations empower inspectors to take actions such as quarantining, restricting movement, treating infested items, and enforcing compliance to protect Canada’s agricultural and environmental interests.
