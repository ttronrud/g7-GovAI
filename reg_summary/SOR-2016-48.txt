These regulations govern the treatment of public service employees who transition from federal employment to the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de l’Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal (Centre) under a 2015 agreement, including pension and death benefits, contribution returns, and service periods, with key provisions taking effect on April 1, 2016. They ensure that such individuals are treated as if they had remained in public service for pension and benefit purposes, except for specific exclusions and re-employment cases.
