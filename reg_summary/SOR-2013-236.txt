This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2014, based on historical export or production volumes, with specific formulas and rules for primary producers and remanufacturers. Export allocations are determined by reference to a 2010–2013 period, and any relinquishment of an allocation must be formally notified by December 9, 2013.
