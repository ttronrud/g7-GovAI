These regulations designate certain persons—those who purchase or acquire imported goods after they are accounted for, or who sell or dispose of them after accounting—as "prescribed classes" under the Customs Act when a declaration of tariff classification is incorrect due to a failure to account for the goods. The regulations come into force on January 1, 1998.
