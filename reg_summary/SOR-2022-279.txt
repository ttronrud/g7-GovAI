The Canadian government has imposed economic sanctions on Roman Abramovich, a Russian national, by restricting access to $26.07 million held in a Citco Bank Canada account linked to the Manticore Fund (Cayman) LTD, pursuant to the Special Economic Measures Act. This measure is part of Canada’s response to the Russian Federation’s actions that constitute a grave breach of international peace and security.
