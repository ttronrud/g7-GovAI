This regulation grants remission of customs duties and sales tax on pet food imported solely for testing its palatability and nutritional adequacy, with the sales tax remission based on the difference between the original tax and what would be due if the duty-reduced value were used. Claims for remission must be made to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of importation.
