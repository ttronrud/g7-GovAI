This regulation repeals the 1985 Montreal Port Warden’s Tariff of Fees Order and establishes a new tariff of fees and charges for services provided by the Port Warden of the Harbour of Montreal, effective from 1988. The fees are specified in a schedule and apply to various vessel inspections, certifications, and services, with rates varying based on the type of cargo, vessel, and duration of services.
