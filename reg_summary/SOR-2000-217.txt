This regulation establishes rules for the possession, use, and handling of benzodiazepines and other targeted substances under Canada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, defining key terms and outlining who may legally possess or deal in these substances—such as licensed dealers, pharmacists, healthcare professionals, and law enforcement personnel—while also setting strict requirements for test kits, including registration, labeling, and use limitations to prevent diversion. It ensures that such substances are controlled and used only for legitimate medical, research, or enforcement purposes.
