This regulation repeals the previous Veterans Appeal Board Regulations and establishes new rules governing the procedure for applications and appeals to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, including requirements for notifying applicants of facts, allowing written responses, retrieving relevant records, and ensuring transparent, detailed decisions with appeal rights. It also outlines specific notification obligations and procedures for questions of interpretation and compassionate awards.
