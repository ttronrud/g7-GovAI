The Canadian Ballast Water Regulations implement and complement the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004, by establishing specific standards for ballast water management, including requirements for ballast water exchange and performance standards, with exemptions and special provisions for certain vessels and areas, particularly in the Great Lakes Basin. These regulations apply to Canadian vessels and non-Canadian vessels operating in Canadian waters, requiring compliance with ballast water management plans, record-keeping, and certification, while allowing for alternative methods under certain conditions.
