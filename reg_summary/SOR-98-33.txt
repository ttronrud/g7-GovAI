These regulations establish the rules for determining the origin of goods eligible for Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment, requiring that at least 50% of the production cost be incurred in a beneficiary country or Canada, and that the goods be finished in such a country and shipped directly to Canada. Excluded from the cost of production are various expenses like packing, profits, royalties, and post-manufacturing charges.
