These regulations allow individuals who previously performed full-time health care duties for the Canadian Forces under section 210.61 of the Queen’s Regulations and Orders to count those periods as pensionable service under the Public Service Superannuation Act, provided the service was before December 31, 1984. The regulations also permit such elections to be treated as made while employed, even if the election is made after leaving the Public Service, as long as it is within one year of the regulations coming into force.
