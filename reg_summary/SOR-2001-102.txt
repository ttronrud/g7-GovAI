These regulations establish the requirements for calculating and disclosing the cost of borrowing for Canadian insurance companies, including the annual percentage rate (APR) and mandatory disclosure of all borrowing costs such as interest, fees, and charges, in clear, simple language. They apply to credit agreements except those for business, non-natural persons, or student loans, and require lenders to provide borrowers with detailed, easily readable disclosure statements at key stages of the credit agreement.
