This regulation repeals outdated radio regulations and replaces them with updated rules governing radiocommunication services, radio authorizations, exemptions, and the operation of radio equipment in Canada, effective upon publication. It establishes clear definitions for various radiocommunication services, outlines eligibility for radio licences, and sets requirements for equipment certification, including technical acceptance certificates (TACs) for Category I equipment, while exempting certain devices and operations from licensing.
