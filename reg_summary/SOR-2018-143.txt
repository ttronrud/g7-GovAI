These regulations establish the rules for public servants who transition to new employers through government agreements, ensuring their superannuation rights are preserved, including eligibility for returns of contributions, transfer options, and death benefits, while defining key dates and service periods for pension and benefit calculations. The regulations come into force upon registration and apply to individuals who cease public service employment and begin work with a new employer, but not to those who return to public service or are covered under specific survivor benefits.
