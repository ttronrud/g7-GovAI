This regulation grants remission of customs duties for goods imported from Albania and the Sultanate of Oman, specifically for those imported between specified dates in 2001, where the duties paid exceed the Most-Favoured-Nation tariff rates. Remission is only available if a claim is made within two years of the order's registration and no prior refund or drawback has been granted.
