The Governor in Council has established the Work Place Harassment and Violence Prevention Regulations to address workplace harassment and violence in sectors such as transportation and oil/gas operations, requiring employers to conduct risk assessments, develop prevention policies, provide training, and establish a formal resolution process involving employees, designated recipients, and health and safety representatives. These regulations mandate joint actions by employers and workplace partners to identify risks, implement preventive measures, and ensure timely resolution of incidents, with protections for privacy, anonymity, and access to support services.
