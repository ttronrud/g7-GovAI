This regulation establishes the prescribed complaint information that insurance companies must provide to consumers, specifying that complaints can be directed to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) at its Ottawa office or through its website. The information must be included in a brochure, statement of account, or written statement, or in a separate document, as required under the Insurance Companies Act.
