This regulation discontinues the requirement for the Canada Revenue Agency to prepare and submit a specific annual report to Parliament, as it contains no additional information beyond what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates. The decision was made under section 157a of the Financial Administration Act, based on the determination that the report duplicates or provides less information than existing parliamentary documents.
