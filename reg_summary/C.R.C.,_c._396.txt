These Regulations establish the rules for calculating Canadian Forces service, pensionable earnings, and eligibility for superannuation benefits, including special provisions for reserve force members, service credit, and annuity entitlements, with key adjustments for service periods and eligibility thresholds, particularly for members transitioning between reserve and regular force status. They define how days of service are counted, set minimum service requirements for pension eligibility, and outline specific conditions under which service can be recognized or elections are void.
