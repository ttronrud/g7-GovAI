This regulation proclaims the entry into force of the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Kingdom of the Netherlands on April 1, 2004, establishing rules for the recognition and payment of social security benefits, including old age, invalidity, survivors’ insurance, and children’s allowances, across both countries. It ensures that eligible nationals and persons with ties to either country can receive benefits without reduction or cancellation due to residence in the other country, with specific provisions for creditable periods, totalization of contributions, and application to spouses and dependants.
