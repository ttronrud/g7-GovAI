The Governor in Council has declared that the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations do not apply in Saskatchewan, effective January 1, 2025, because Saskatchewan already has equivalent regulations in place under its own laws, as confirmed by a written agreement between the federal and provincial governments. This Order is repealed upon termination of the agreement.
