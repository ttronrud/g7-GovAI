This regulation establishes the criteria for insuring housing loans under the National Housing Act, setting minimum requirements for loan structure, borrower eligibility, debt service ratios, credit scores, property value, and loan terms—particularly for high-ratio and low-ratio loans—ensuring that only loans meeting specific financial and risk management standards can be insured by the Corporation. It also outlines special provisions for first-time home buyers, newly built properties, loan modifications, and government-sponsored housing programs.
