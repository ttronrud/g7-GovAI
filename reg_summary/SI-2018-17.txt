The Government of Canada has referred the status assessment of the Yukon Draba (Draba yukonensis) back to COSEWIC for reassessment due to new information about its range and population dynamics, and has approved adding a statement to the public registry explaining the referral. This action follows COSEWIC's 2011 designation of the species as endangered, based on its extremely limited range and threats from industrial activities, invasive species, and habitat loss.
