These regulations require non-resident registrants who supply certain publications (such as books, newspapers, and magazines) to include their registration number in specific places on the publication or its packaging, ensuring proper identification for tax purposes under the Excise Tax Act. The rules apply when the supply is deemed to have occurred in Canada, and the regulations were adjusted to reflect changes in tax terminology and to apply to non-resident persons.
