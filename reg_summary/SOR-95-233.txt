This regulation repeals the old Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations and replaces them with updated rules governing fishing in Saskatchewan, including licensing requirements, restrictions on fishing in specific areas and times, and provisions for Indigenous fishing rights. It establishes that only licensed individuals may fish, with certain exceptions for Indigenous persons fishing for personal or family use, and includes protections for fish conservation and proper management.
