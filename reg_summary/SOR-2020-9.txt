This regulation grants a fee remission to holders of medical cannabis licences who sell all their cannabis in Canada exclusively to clients or named responsible adults, or to individuals with a medical exemption under the Cannabis Act, and who meet specific submission requirements within defined timeframes. The remission applies to fees under the Cannabis Fees Order, with strict record-keeping obligations for seven years to support audit readiness.
