These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Holman Airport in the Northwest Territories, limiting the height of any structure or building on adjacent land to the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, ensuring safe aircraft operations. The boundaries and elevation limits are defined by specific geometric planes based on the airport’s runway and reference point, with the outer boundary extending 4,000 meters from the airport reference point.
