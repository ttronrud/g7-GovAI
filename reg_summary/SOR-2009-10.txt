This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for current softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2009, based on historical export and production volumes, with specific formulas and caps to ensure fair distribution. It also sets rules for how allocations are determined for primary producers and remanufacturers, including provisions for transfers, reserve pools, and Quebec-specific allocation criteria.
