The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, revokes the previous Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations and replaces them with new regulations that establish strict height and land-use restrictions around Moncton Airport to ensure aviation safety, including limits on structures, prohibitions on bird-attractive waste, and defined surfaces such as approach, outer, and transitional surfaces. These regulations apply to lands within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point and are based on specific geometric and elevation criteria detailed in the schedules.
