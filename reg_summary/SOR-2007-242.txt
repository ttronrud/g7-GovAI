These regulations establish the procedures for inspecting assessable property (such as reserve land) under First Nations property assessment laws, requiring assessors to provide written notice to the person on the assessment roll, conduct inspections between 9:00 and 17:00 local time, and, if necessary, assess property value without an occupant present. The regulations come into force upon registration and apply to inspections conducted in accordance with provincial or First Nation-specific assessment procedures.
