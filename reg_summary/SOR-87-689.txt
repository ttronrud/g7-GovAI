These regulations establish the conditions and fees for "special excise services" performed by officers outside regular working hours or at locations other than a distiller, brewer, tobacco manufacturer, or bonded facility. Fees are charged based on the time spent, with a base rate of $54 for the first two hours and $27 for each additional hour, plus additional costs for transportation or meals if not provided by the requester.
