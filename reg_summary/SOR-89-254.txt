These regulations define "local signal" and "distant signal" under the Copyright Act for terrestrial radio and television stations, specifying geographic areas of transmission based on signal strength and antenna height, with local signals being those that cover a station’s entire or partial service area, and distant signals being all others. The definitions are based on technical criteria such as field strength contours, height above average terrain (HAAT), and effective radiated power (ERP), using standardized methods and propagation curves to determine coverage areas.
