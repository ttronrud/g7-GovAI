This regulation reaffirms the status of a list of terrorist entities established in 2004, confirming that each organization on the list continues to be designated as a terrorist entity due to reasonable grounds to believe they have engaged in or supported terrorist activities. The designation remains in effect under the Criminal Code, specifically subsection 83.05(9), based on a review by the Solicitor General of Canada.
