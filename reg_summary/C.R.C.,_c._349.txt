These Regulations establish the Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance Program, providing shipbuilders in Canada with grants for eligible vessels—defined by gross tonnage and construction criteria—based on the approved cost of the ship, with grant amounts decreasing for larger vessels and varying by contract date. Grants are subject to strict eligibility conditions, including Canadian construction, use of Canadian materials, and audits, and are paid in progress installments with final payment after completion and audit.
