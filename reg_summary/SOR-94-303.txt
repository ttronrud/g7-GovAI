These Regulations outline the procedures for disposing of seized property under the Seized Property Management Act, allowing disposal through public tender or auction on an "as-is/where-is" basis, with specific rules for tenders, acceptance, deposits, and cancellation. They also specify how net proceeds are calculated, indemnification for contractors under certain conditions, and requirements for reporting changes in the location of seized property.
