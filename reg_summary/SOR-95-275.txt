The Canadian Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) Regulations ensure that air carriers and travel agents in Canada receive fair, neutral, and comprehensive information about passenger air services through computer reservation systems, prohibiting discrimination based on carrier identity and requiring transparency in pricing, displays, and service offerings. These regulations promote competition and consumer access by mandating equal treatment of all carriers, accurate information, and the availability of standardized, non-discriminatory displays in CRS systems.
