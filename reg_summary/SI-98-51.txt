This regulation establishes a mutual administrative assistance program between Canada and the United States to improve the efficiency and integrity of their social security programs, allowing each country to share administrative support in processing claims, while ensuring compliance with domestic laws, privacy protections, and cost-sharing principles. The program is governed by a Management Committee that reviews policies, coordinates operations, and resolves disputes, and is effective upon the entering into force of the Second Supplementary Agreement between the two countries.
