This regulation establishes levies or charges on beef cattle producers in Quebec who engage in interprovincial and export trade, requiring them to pay these fees to the Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec, with buyers in Quebec responsible for deducting and remitting the charges directly to the Commodity Board. The fees are outlined in a schedule and must be paid within specified time limits.
