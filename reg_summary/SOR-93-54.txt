This regulation revokes several outdated British Columbia fishery rules and replaces them with new, consolidated regulations effective February 24, 1993, to manage and control fishing activities in Canadian waters of the Pacific Ocean and British Columbia, including provisions on gear restrictions, licensing, catch limits, and off-loading requirements for salmon and herring. It establishes rules for net use, safety markings, and accountability in commercial fishing while excluding sport fishing, aquaculture, and fishing for marine mammals.
