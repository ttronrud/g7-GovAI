This regulation grants the Minister of Health authority to exempt certain prepackaged dairy products—such as cheese, yogurt, kefir, and buttermilk—from requiring nutrition symbols for saturated fat and sugars, or sodium, if each serving provides 5% or more of the daily value for calcium. The exemption applies only when the calcium content meets or exceeds this threshold.
