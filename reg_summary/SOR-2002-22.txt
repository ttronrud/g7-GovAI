These regulations establish licensing requirements for the interprovincial and export marketing of chicken in Canada, requiring producers, processors, dealers, retailers, and transporters to hold a valid licence, pay applicable fees, and comply with strict conditions related to quota limits, reporting, and product origin. Market development and specialty chicken licences come with additional obligations, including commitment forms, reporting on marketing volumes and end-uses, and proof of compliance with Canadian production and inspection standards.
