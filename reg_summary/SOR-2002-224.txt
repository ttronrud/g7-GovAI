This regulation grants a temporary exemption to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Forces from certain radiocommunication restrictions for a specific period and geographic area in Ontario, allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications for purposes related to security, safety, international relations, or national defence. The exemption is limited in scope, duration, and geographic boundaries to ensure minimal disruption to other radio services.
