This regulation grants a temporary exemption to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Forces from certain radio communication restrictions in a specific geographic area of Alberta, allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications for purposes of security, safety, international relations, or national defence during a defined period. The exemption is limited in scope and duration, with efforts required to minimize the impact on radio frequencies and geographic area.
