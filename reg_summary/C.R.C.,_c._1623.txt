This regulation establishes the Memorial Cross (World War II) to honor Canadian and Newfoundland service members who died during World War II or as a result of service, with the cross to be issued to the mother, widow, eldest child, father, or eldest sibling of the deceased, depending on eligibility, and only if they can provide verified proof of the service member’s death and service. The cross is specifically designed for sailors, soldiers, airmen, merchant seamen, and firefighters who served in recognized capacities during the war.
