The Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal repealed an old rule and adopted a new Rule 82—Criminal Appeal—effective January 1, 2012, which establishes detailed procedures for filing appeals, including notice of appeal, service, transcript requirements, and appeal book preparation, while applying to appeals under the Criminal Code and related provisions. The rule provides specific timelines, definitions, and procedures for both convicted persons and prisoners, including special provisions for prisoner appeals and cross-appeals.
