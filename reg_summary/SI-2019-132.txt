The Governor General, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, transfers the control and supervision of the Youth Secretariat and the LGBTQ2 Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Canadian Heritage under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This reallocation is part of a broader reorganization of federal public administration to enhance the delivery of youth and LGBTQ2+ services.
