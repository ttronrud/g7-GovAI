This regulation grants tax remission to Canadian citizens who are non-residents of Canada and work at Canadian embassies or consulates in the United States, covering the amount of Canadian income tax payable due to the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, up to the lesser of the tax added under subsection 120(1) of the Income Tax Act or the U.S. state-level income tax paid, provided the employee applies within two years of the filing deadline and meets eligibility requirements. The remission is only available if the tax has not already been refunded or credited elsewhere.
