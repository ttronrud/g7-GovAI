The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) adopted the Unsolicited Telecommunications Fees Regulations, which establish fees for individuals who subscribe to the National Do Not Call List, with fees based on subscription type and adjusted annually based on the CRTC’s telemarketing regulatory costs, and mandates refunds for overpayments. The regulations came into force on April 1, 2013, following a public consultation period.
