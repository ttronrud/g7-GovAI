This regulation revokes an old customs duty remission order and establishes a new one granting duty remission for vessels chartered by CN Marine Corporation to operate ferry services in the Atlantic provinces, including spare parts, under specific conditions. The remission is conditional on the Canadian Transport Commission's confirmation that no suitable vessel is available for the service.
