This regulation grants remission of customs duties and sales/excise taxes on personal and family-use items imported by U.S. diplomatic and consular staff in Canada, provided the items are imported on or after September 1, 1985, and proper applications are approved by the U.S. Ambassador. Remission also extends to the disposal of eligible items (except motor vehicles) within one year or motor vehicles within two years of importation, with special provisions for death or transfer of the importer.
