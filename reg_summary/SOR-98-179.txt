This regulation excludes employment at Ontario Hydro nuclear facilities from Part I of the Canada Labour Code, except for specific sections, and applies the Labour Relations Act, 1995 and related regulations to such employment. It also modifies certain definitions and provisions in the Labour Relations Act to align with nuclear facility operations and ensures continuity of existing proceedings.
