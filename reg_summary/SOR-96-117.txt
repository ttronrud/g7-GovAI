The Canada Oil and Gas Geophysical Operations Regulations establish detailed requirements for conducting geophysical operations (such as seismic, magnetic, and gravimetric surveys) in both onshore and offshore areas to locate oil and gas. These regulations set standards for safety, environmental protection, equipment maintenance, explosives handling, and operational procedures, including mandatory notification, authorization timelines, and specific distance requirements to protect infrastructure, communities, and the environment.
