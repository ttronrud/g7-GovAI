This regulation authorizes the Minister of Canadian Heritage to make one-time ex-gratia payments of $20,000 to individuals who were in conjugal relationships with deceased Chinese head tax payers or to designated beneficiaries, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria and were alive on February 6, 2006. The payments are made without admitting liability on the part of the Crown and are subject to application deadlines and evidence requirements.
