The Minister of Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction issued the Cannabis Tracking System Order under the Cannabis Act, requiring licensed cannabis cultivators, processors, medical sellers, and authorized public bodies to submit monthly detailed reports on inventory, sales, and distribution of cannabis products and unpackaged cannabis, including quantities, classifications, and book values. These reports must be submitted by the 15th day of each month through a dedicated government website, with specific reporting requirements based on the type of licence or entity, and records must be retained for at least two years.
