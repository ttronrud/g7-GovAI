The Minister of Industry has established a Code of Professional Conduct for Patent Agents and Trademark Agents under the College of Patent Agents and Trademark Agents Act, setting out standards of integrity, competence, confidentiality, and conflict of interest that licensees must follow. These standards require agents to act with the highest level of professionalism, maintain client confidentiality at all times, avoid conflicts of interest, and ensure they are competent to handle each matter, with exceptions only when authorized or when necessary to prevent harm.
