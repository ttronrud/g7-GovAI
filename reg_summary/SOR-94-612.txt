These regulations establish the framework for dividing pension benefits in Canada, defining key terms such as division annuity, retirement annuity, and reduction factors, and outlining the conditions under which a spouse, former spouse, or common-law partner can apply for a division of a member’s pension benefits. They specify the required application information, the period subject to division, and the details the Pension Benefits Division must provide in response to a request for information.
