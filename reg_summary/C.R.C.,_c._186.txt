These Ontario regulations govern the interprovincial and export marketing of flue-cured tobacco, restricting sales and purchases to the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board or licensed buyers with allocated marketing quotas, and requiring all tobacco transactions to occur only at designated tobacco exchanges operated by the Board. Tobacco must be marketed strictly on a quota basis, with no sales allowed beyond the allocated amount or to unauthorized parties.
