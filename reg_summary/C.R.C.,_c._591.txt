These regulations establish a method for determining the amount of tax deductions, refunds, or payments when it is difficult to determine the exact amount, by reducing the sale or contract price of goods by a percentage set by the Minister based on the goods' class and transaction details. The amount is determined only if the taxpayer consents.
