This 1983 regulation revokes a previous order and establishes a new remission of customs duty, excise tax, and sales tax for certain goods imported by foreign organizations to conduct meetings or conventions in Canada, including convention materials, advertising matter, souvenirs, and specific equipment, under specified conditions. Remission is granted only for goods used in or distributed at such events, with requirements for export, record-keeping, and security deposits where applicable.
