The Canada Disability Benefit Regulations, enacted under the Canada Disability Benefit Act, establish eligibility criteria, benefit calculation methods, and administrative procedures for individuals with disabilities to receive financial support, including income-based reductions, cohabiting partner requirements, and provisions for suspensions, appeals, and death benefits. The regulations emphasize inclusivity by involving persons with disabilities in their development and ensure that benefits are paid based on adjusted income, indexing, and residency requirements, with clear pathways for reconsideration and appeals.
