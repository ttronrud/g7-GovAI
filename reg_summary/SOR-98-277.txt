This regulation establishes the levies that wood producers in the Quebec Region must pay to the Quebec Wood Producers’ Syndicate for all wood marketed interprovincially or exported, as set out in specific regulations, and specifies how these levies can be paid—either directly by the producer, through deduction from the sale price, or by the buyer making a direct payment to the Syndicate. The Order came into force on May 1, 1998.
