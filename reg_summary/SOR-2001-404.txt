These regulations establish limits on insurance companies' investments in designated entities, prohibiting acquisitions or loans that would cause the total value of such investments to exceed 50% of the company’s regulatory capital, with specific exclusions for certain types of investments and transactions. The rules apply to entities exposed to market or credit risk and are designed to ensure financial stability by preventing excessive exposure to non-controlled investments.
