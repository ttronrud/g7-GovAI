This 1995 regulatory order grants a remission of customs duties and excise tax on specific printed materials imported by foreign airlines for promotional and operational use, provided the foreign country grants similar privileges to Canadian carriers. The remission applies to items such as brochures, maps, ticket forms, and advertising materials used exclusively in promoting air services.
