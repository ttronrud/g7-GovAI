These regulations establish a controlled snaring permit system for snowshoe hare harvesting in the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, limiting snaring to eligible individuals with specific qualifications, setting strict conditions on permit use, and ensuring sustainable management of the resource to protect ecological integrity. Only eligible persons may obtain a snare permit, which includes limits on the number of hares, snares, and areas, and requires compliance with reporting, tagging, and removal requirements.
