These regulations establish limits and monitoring requirements for the discharge of liquid effluents from meat and poultry processing plants, specifying allowable levels of biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended matter, and grease, as well as pH limits and sampling protocols based on plant size and type. Owners must regularly collect and analyze composite samples, measure effluent flow, report daily and monthly deposits, and conduct acute lethality tests using rainbow trout to ensure compliance with environmental standards.
