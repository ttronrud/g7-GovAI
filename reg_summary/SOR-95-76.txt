These regulations establish a framework for sharing proceeds from forfeited property, fines, and foreign state transfers among the Government of Canada and provincial or foreign jurisdictions, based on the contribution of each party to investigations and prosecutions. The sharing occurs no later than 90 days after the fiscal year-end when funds are credited, with contributions assessed and allocated using a tiered percentage system (90%, 50%, or 10%) and payments made to designated officials or provincial authorities under agreed arrangements.
