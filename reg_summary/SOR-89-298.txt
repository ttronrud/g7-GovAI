This regulation revokes an older set of rules regarding Bank of Canada notes and establishes new regulations effective July 1, 1989, specifying that the bank issues notes in denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. The notes must bear facsimiles of the Governor’s and a Deputy Governor’s signatures at the time of printing, with a backup signature if the Deputy Governor is unavailable.
