On June 30, 2012, the Government of Canada transferred several divisions from the Department of Health to the Public Health Agency of Canada, including key administrative and operational units, while also transferring two directorates from the Department of Health to the Public Health Agency of Canada to strengthen its capacity and accountability. This realignment aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health services by consolidating responsibilities under a single, dedicated agency.
