This regulation remits the visitor visa fees of $75 (for a single entry) and $150 (for multiple entries) for applicants participating in or volunteering as organizers for World Youth Day 2002, as determined by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. The remission is granted in the public interest to support the event's participation and administration.
