The Military Police Complaints Commission adopted the 2022 Rules of Procedure to ensure fair, efficient, and expeditious hearings by establishing clear guidelines for document service, filing, hearings, motions, interventions, and case management, while allowing flexibility and discretion to meet the needs of the proceeding and public interest. These rules govern all hearings under the National Defence Act and emphasize procedural fairness, transparency, and the effective use of resources.
