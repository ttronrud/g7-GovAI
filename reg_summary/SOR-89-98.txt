These Regulations establish requirements for ships entering Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) Zones in Canada, including mandatory radio communication, pre-entry and maneuver reports, and reporting of hazards or changes in conditions, with specific provisions for larger vessels, those carrying pollutants or dangerous goods, and towing operations. The regulations apply to ships 20 metres or longer, or those towing objects of certain sizes, and require timely reporting to marine traffic regulators to ensure safe navigation within designated VTS zones.
