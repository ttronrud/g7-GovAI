This regulation establishes and maintains preferential customs duty rates for goods imported from Australia and New Zealand into Canada, extending reduced duty rates to specific tariff items effective from January 1, 1995, with gradual reductions over time. The rates are set under the "Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff" heading and are applied to goods under specified tariff codes, with some items becoming duty-free after certain dates.
