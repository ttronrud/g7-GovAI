These regulations establish the requirements for issuing safety fitness certificates to extra-provincial motor carrier undertakings, including mandatory safety ratings, insurance coverage, and the maintenance of motor carrier profiles, all in accordance with the National Safety Code and the Motor Vehicle Transport Act. Provincial authorities may only issue such certificates if the carrier meets specific safety standards, holds minimum liability insurance, and provides verified documentation.
