These regulations define when a cooperative credit association is considered a "distributing association" under the Cooperative Credit Associations Act, primarily based on whether it is a reporting issuer under provincial or federal securities legislation or has filed a prospectus, is listed on a stock exchange, or results from certain corporate transactions involving a reporting issuer. Associations exempted by provincial securities laws or regulatory orders are not considered distributing associations.
