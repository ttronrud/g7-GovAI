These regulations establish tariff preferences for originating products from Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (CUKTCA) beneficiaries, allowing them to benefit from the United Kingdom tariff when imported into Canada without passing through non-beneficiary countries, provided certain documentation is available. The regulations come into force on April 1, 2021, or upon registration if later.
