The Hay River Airport Zoning Regulations establish strict height limits and land-use restrictions around Hay River Airport to ensure aviation safety, prohibiting any structure or natural growth from exceeding designated approach, transitional, or outer surfaces. These regulations apply to specific lands adjacent to the airport, defined by a detailed boundary description and geometric surfaces, and are enforced by the Minister of Transport.
