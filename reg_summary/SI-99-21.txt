This regulation grants tax remission to registrants who made eligible supplies between January 1, 1991, and April 23, 1996, by reducing their net tax liability for those periods based on a specific formula, and also provides remission of interest and penalties related to the remitted amounts. The remission is only available if an application is submitted within two years of the Order's issuance and certain conditions regarding unpaid tax and assessments are met.
