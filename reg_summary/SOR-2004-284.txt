This regulation exempts the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from certain radiocommunication restrictions in specific geographic areas of Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia for a limited period (November 30, 2004, to December 2, 2004), allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radio communications solely for purposes of security, safety, or international relations. The interference is strictly limited in scope, duration, and geographic area to ensure minimal impact on other communications.
