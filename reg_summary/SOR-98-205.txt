These regulations adapt the Firearms Act to accommodate the cultural and traditional practices of Aboriginal peoples in Canada by allowing oral statements, interpreter assistance, and community-based recommendations from elders or leaders when applying for firearm licences. They ensure that Aboriginal individuals, particularly those engaged in traditional hunting, can access firearms in a manner consistent with their cultural practices and community recognition.
