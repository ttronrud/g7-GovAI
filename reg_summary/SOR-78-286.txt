These regulations establish the framework for a contract between the Minister of Transport and VIA Rail Canada Inc. for railway passenger services, outlining requirements for approval, financial oversight, fare-setting, service quality, and payment structures that are based on estimated costs and incentives, with strict limits on expenditures and ministerial oversight. The contracts ensure transparency, accountability, and alignment with government objectives while preventing the Minister from being obligated to pay for costs beyond those defined by specific compensation methods.
