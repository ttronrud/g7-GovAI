These regulations establish investment limits and valuation rules for cooperative credit associations, particularly regarding their interests in real property and equity, with specific thresholds (such as 35%, 70%, or 100% minus equity or real property percentages) determining regulatory capital requirements based on the association’s business activities and ownership structure. The rules define what constitutes an "interest in real property" and how such interests are valued—using book value or net realizable value—especially in cases involving loans, guarantees, or security interests.
