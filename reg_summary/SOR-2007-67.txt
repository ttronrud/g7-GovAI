This regulation grants the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, and its officials, specific privileges and immunities in Canada, including those equivalent to diplomatic immunity under the United Nations Convention and the Vienna Convention, while excluding tax liabilities for Canadian citizens or residents. The Order comes into force upon registration and does not limit the Canadian government’s ability to restrict entry of officials for national security reasons.
