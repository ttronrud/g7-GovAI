This regulation designates specific areas in Quebec and Ontario as "special areas" due to their lack of productive employment opportunities, and approves a comprehensive plan to promote economic expansion and social adjustment in those regions. The designated areas, defined by census subdivisions, are entitled to government assistance under existing industrial renewal regulations for a four-year period from April 8, 1982, to March 31, 1986.
