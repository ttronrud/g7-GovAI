The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, has revoked several outdated marine machinery regulations and replaced them with the new Marine Machinery Regulations, which establish modern standards for the construction, installation, and inspection of marine machinery, including requirements for safety, material testing, component marking, and steering gear performance. These regulations apply to most ships but exclude certain pleasure yachts and non-passenger vessels under specific conditions.
