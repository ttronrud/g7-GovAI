This regulation establishes safety standards for cribs, cradles, bassinets, and accessories in Canada, specifying requirements for structural integrity, material safety, dimensions, and child protection to prevent injuries such as suffocation, entrapment, and exposure to harmful substances. It mandates that products meet strict limits on lead, mercury, and other chemicals, have safe angles, no accessible parts that can cause pinching or shearing, and must be designed to prevent children from getting trapped or injured during use.
