This regulation revokes an old order and establishes a new framework allowing the remission of customs duties and excise taxes for non-commercial imports—such as defective or low-quality goods—when they are destroyed or exported under specific conditions, or when replacement goods are imported within strict time and value limits. Remission is only granted if the importer submits an application to a customs officer within 90 days and meets conditions related to the nature of the goods, cost bearing, and timing of importation or exportation.
