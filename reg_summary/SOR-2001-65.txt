These regulations establish a deduction for provincial rebates on goods and services, specifically outlining eligible items such as children’s clothing, footwear, diapers, feminine hygiene products, printed books, qualifying food and beverages, and certain educational or heating-related products, with specific rules for tax treatment under Canada’s harmonized sales tax (HST) system. The rebates are designed to support provincial governments by allowing businesses to claim a refund or credit equivalent to the HST paid on these items, with adjustments to ensure compliance with the new HST framework and eligibility criteria.
