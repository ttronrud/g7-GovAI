This regulation establishes the conditions under which certain minor works—such as erosion protection, aerial and submarine cables, pipelines, outfalls, water intakes, and dredging—can be carried out in navigable waters without requiring full environmental or navigation impact assessments. The Minister of Transport designates these works as "minor" if they meet specific criteria regarding size, location, and impact on navigation, and requires owners to notify authorities, ensure safe navigation, and restore the waterbed to avoid interference with vessel traffic.
