The Joint Use of Poles Regulations allow authorized telephone, telegraph, power, and other corporations to share poles and structures for their lines and facilities, provided they enter into written agreements that meet specific safety, clearance, and level requirements, with liability between the parties governed by those agreements. These agreements must include minimum clearances between conductors and adhere to standardized levels for different types of lines, with all joint use being subject to the terms and conditions outlined in sections 5 to 11.
