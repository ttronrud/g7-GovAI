This regulation excludes a portion of the critical habitat for the Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida) Ontario populations—specifically within the Long Point National Wildlife Area—from a proposed order under the Species at Risk Act, due to its designation as a protected area for Indigenous bands. The Order, made by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, ensures that the critical habitat remains protected while respecting Indigenous lands and uses, and comes into force upon registration.
