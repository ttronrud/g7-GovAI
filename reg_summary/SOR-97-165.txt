These regulations govern the treatment of public servants who transition to employment with a provincial government under a labour market development agreement, including eligibility for pension benefits, survivor benefits, and contribution returns, and specify how service and age are calculated for superannuation purposes. The regulations came into force on April 1, 1997, and apply only to those who cease public service employment and begin work with a new employer under such an agreement.
