These regulations establish limits on bank holding companies' investments in designated entities, restricting acquisitions or increases in substantial investments, as well as loans or guarantees to such entities, if such actions would cause the total value of those exposures to exceed 50% of the bank holding company’s regulatory capital. The rules also allow for certain exceptions and define key terms like "designated entity" and "value" to ensure compliance with risk management requirements under the Bank Act.
