These regulations establish a coordinated vaping duty system under the Excise Act, imposing excise duties on vaping products based on where they are manufactured, imported, or consumed, with key provisions phasing in by July 2024 and April 2025 to allow provinces like New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Alberta to join the system. The duties apply to unmarked products in specified provinces, with exemptions and transitional rules for products stamped or imported before certain dates.
