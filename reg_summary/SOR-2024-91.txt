Canada has enacted special economic measures targeting Israeli extremist settlers and their associates, prohibiting Canadian individuals and entities from engaging in transactions involving property or financial services related to those individuals or entities, due to their involvement in violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories. The regulations list specific individuals, families, and organizations, and include provisions for appeals, disclosure requirements, and exemptions for certain transactions.
