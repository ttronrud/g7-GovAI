The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to list five beluga whale populations, the porbeagle shark, and two white sturgeon populations in Canada due to insufficient evidence of imminent threat, potential negative socioeconomic impacts, and the importance of existing management practices and traditional knowledge. The assessment for the Verna’s flower moth is being referred back to COSEWIC for further information due to gaps in data on its distribution, abundance, and threats.
