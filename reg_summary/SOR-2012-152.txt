These regulations establish a system for collecting and remitting deductions from cash purchase tickets for wheat and barley in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the Peace River District of British Columbia, with specific rates and requirements for remittance and refunds. The Alberta Barley Commission manages the funds, uses them for research, marketing, and technical assistance, and must provide an annual report detailing expenditures and refunds to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
