The Mont-Joli Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions on all land adjacent to or near Mont-Joli Airport, prohibiting any structure or object from exceeding the elevation of designated approach, horizontal, or transitional surfaces. These limits apply to specific parcels of land and parts of the St. Lawrence River, as precisely described in the schedule, with the airport reference point set at 150 feet above sea level.
