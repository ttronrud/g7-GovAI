The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, increases the pilotage tariffs of the Laurentian Pilotage Authority by 8.9% to ensure a self-sustaining financial basis, as required by section 64 of the National Transportation Act, 1987, and in line with comparable tariffs in other pilotage regions. This adjustment follows the Authority's consistent financial shortfalls since 1983 and its inability to operate without government funding.
