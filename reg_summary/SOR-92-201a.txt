This regulation approves the exclusion of certain temporary employees—those appointed on or after April 9, 1992, for periods of less than three months totaling less than six months in any 12-month period—from the Public Service Employment Act during a specific timeframe (April 9, 1992, to April 30, 1994) in designated categories within the Department of National Defence. It allows such temporary appointments to be made without being subject to the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act.
