These regulations establish requirements for the Canadian Payments Association’s nominating committee to ensure that directors, particularly those nominated under specific criteria, possess the necessary skills, experience, and independence to serve effectively. The committee must verify independence by assessing a candidate’s relationships with the Association, its members, or affiliates, and must confirm independence before reporting to the Board, with specific rules on when independence can be affected or reduced.
