This regulation discontinues the requirement to prepare and submit annual reports from the Canada Industrial Relations Board and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council to Parliament, as these reports contain no additional information beyond what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates. The decision was made under section 157a of the Financial Administration Act, based on the assessment that the reports provide redundant or insufficient information.
