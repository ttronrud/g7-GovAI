The Government of Canada is referring the status assessments of three mountain caribou populations—Northern, Central, and Southern Mountain—to COSEWIC for further review due to uncertainties in population delineation, insufficient genetic data, lack of Indigenous knowledge integration, and recent changes in herd sizes. The Minister of the Environment has approved adding a statement to the public registry explaining these reasons for the referral.
