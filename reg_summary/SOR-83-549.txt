These regulations establish a framework under which the Government of Canada may provide insurance up to $5 million for loans made by approved private lenders to Pêcheurs Unis du Québec, with the purpose of supporting the co-op’s growth and Canadian trade expansion. The insurance is only available if the loan serves those objectives and is subject to specific application and repayment conditions.
