The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has adopted the Broadcasting Fees Regulations, which establish a new fee structure for broadcasting undertakings based on their fee revenue, with fees calculated using a formula that includes an initial amount and an annual adjustment tied to the Commission’s regulatory costs. The regulations come into force on April 1, 2024, and apply to most broadcasting undertakings, excluding certain community and Indigenous stations, while requiring annual fee returns and payments, with adjustments based on actual versus estimated regulatory costs.
