This regulation authorizes the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to make one-time ex-gratia payments of $20,000 to eligible persons or entities who were beneficiaries of deceased Chinese head tax payers or those in conjugal relationships with such payers, where no prior application was submitted. Payments are limited to applications made by March 31, 2008, or under exceptional circumstances before March 31, 2009, and are not considered an admission of liability by the Crown.
