These regulations define what constitutes a "distributing company" or "distributing insurance holding company" under the Insurance Companies Act, primarily based on whether the company is a reporting issuer under provincial or federal securities legislation or meets certain corporate transaction criteria, with exemptions for companies not subject to reporting requirements. The regulations come into force upon registration.
