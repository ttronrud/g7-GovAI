This regulation establishes the Memorial Cross (World War I) to honor sailors and soldiers who died during World War I, with the cross to be issued to the mother, widow, eldest child, father, or eldest sibling of the deceased, provided they meet eligibility criteria and furnish proper documentation of the individual’s service and death. The Cross is awarded only to those who died in action, while on active service, or from service-related causes, and is not issued to individuals who were divorced or separated from the sailor or soldier at the time of death.
