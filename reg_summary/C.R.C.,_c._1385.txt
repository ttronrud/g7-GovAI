These Regulations outline the conditions under which payments can be made under the Railway Relocation and Crossing Act for the preparation of transportation or urban development plans, specifying that only additional costs beyond normal operations—approved by the relevant minister—are eligible, and that interest on borrowed funds is excluded. Payments require prior ministerial approval of the plan’s terms, compliance with inspection and audit requests, and Treasury Board approval for amounts exceeding $250,000, with joint allocation of funds when both plans relate to the same study area.
