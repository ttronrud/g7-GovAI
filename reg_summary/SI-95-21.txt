This regulation remits the net total of income tax liabilities for the 1987 to 1995 taxation years, excluding certain provisions of the Income Tax Act related to the Canada Pension Plan, if the pension amounts owed under section 63.1 had been received in the preceding year rather than the year they were actually received. The remission applies without penalties or interest.
