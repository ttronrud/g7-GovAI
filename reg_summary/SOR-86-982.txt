The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission revoked the previous radio broadcasting regulations and introduced the Radio Regulations, 1986, which establish requirements for Canadian content, including minimum percentages of Canadian musical selections by type and language, restrictions on offensive or misleading content, and specific rules for commercial advertising, especially of alcoholic beverages and during election periods. The regulations also define key terms and apply different content obligations based on the type of station (e.g., commercial, community, ethnic, or campus).
