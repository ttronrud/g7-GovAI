These rules govern the procedure for appeals from summary conviction courts in New Brunswick under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, effective from May 1, 1980, and specify requirements for notices of appeal, service, filing, transmission of trial materials, hearing procedures, and the rights of parties to appear or submit written arguments. They also outline circumstances under which an appeal may be dismissed or heard in the absence of a party, and provide for the Clerk to manage case scheduling and delivery of appeal outcomes.
