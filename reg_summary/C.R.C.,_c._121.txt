These regulations establish height restrictions for buildings and structures near Victoria International Airport, limiting construction to the elevation of specified surfaces—such as a horizontal surface, approach surfaces, and transitional surfaces—defined by precise geographic boundaries and measurements. The restrictions apply to specific lands and waters adjacent to the airport, as described in a 1966 plan, with the goal of ensuring safe aircraft operations by preventing obstructions in flight paths.
