This regulation revokes an earlier order and establishes the current criteria for awarding the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal, recognizing voluntary service during World War II for members of the armed forces, merchant mariners, civilian support personnel, and others, including posthumous awards and bars for specific overseas service or battles. The medal is awarded based on qualifying service periods, with specific rules for eligibility, service calculation, and the wearing of the medal and associated bars.
