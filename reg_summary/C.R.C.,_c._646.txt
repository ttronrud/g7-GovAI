This regulation establishes the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency to manage the marketing of domestic hen eggs across Canada, including setting quotas, enforcing pricing standards, and implementing a licensing and levying system to ensure fair market practices and cover administrative costs. The Agency operates under the Farm Products Agencies Act, with members appointed by provincial boards, industry organizations, and the Consumers Association of Canada, and is required to maintain cooperation with existing provincial marketing boards.
