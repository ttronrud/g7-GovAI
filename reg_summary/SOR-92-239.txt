This regulatory order grants a partial remission of customs duties on the drilling rig Rowan Gorilla III imported for the Cohasset/Panuke Oil Development Project, calculated as the difference between duties based on a 1/120th value and duties that would apply if the rig had been imported annually on January 1. The remission is subject to a claim being made to the Minister of National Revenue within two years after the rig exits Canadian customs waters.
