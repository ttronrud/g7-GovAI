These regulations establish the superannuation rights of employees who transition from Watson Lake Hospital (a former Yukon Government entity) to a new employer under a government agreement, ensuring continuity of benefits such as pensions, survivor benefits, and options for returning contributions. They came into force on April 1, 2010, and define key provisions for pensionable service, eligibility for returns of contributions, and the treatment of age and service periods for public service superannuation purposes.
