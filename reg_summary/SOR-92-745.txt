The Government of Canada has revoked the previous Personal Property Loan Regulations and introduced the Public Property Loan Regulations to govern the lending of public property (excluding real property). These regulations require written loans with specific terms, including consideration, indemnity, inspection rights, loan duration, and security, and allow emergency loans with a written acknowledgment if deemed necessary.
