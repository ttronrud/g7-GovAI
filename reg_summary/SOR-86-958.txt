These regulations authorize military personnel to conduct inspections and searches within defence establishments to ensure safety, security, and compliance with service standards, requiring individuals to submit to searches upon entry or exit without a warrant, with certain restrictions on the use of force and gender-based search requirements. Searches are permitted only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that safety or security is at risk.
