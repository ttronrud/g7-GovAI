These regulations allow Canadian Forces dental officers to provide emergency dental treatment to civilians in specific situations—such as emergencies, isolated areas without civilian facilities, or at the request of a provincial dental body—without interfering with military dental services. Fees are generally set according to the provincial dental association's schedule, with the Minister of National Defence having the authority to determine fees when no standard fee exists or when discretion is needed, and all fees are paid to the Receiver General.
