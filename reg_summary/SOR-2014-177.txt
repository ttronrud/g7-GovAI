These Regulations establish the requirements for applications to dispose of waste at sea under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, including detailed information on the substance, vessel, disposal site, and alternatives, as well as environmental and health assessments, and come into force on a specified date. They require applicants to submit comprehensive forms and supporting data, including chemical, physical, and environmental information, and to justify the use of disposal at sea over other practicable alternatives.
