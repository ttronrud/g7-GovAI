The Governor in Council has revoked the previous Manitoba Egg Order and replaced it with a new order granting the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the marketing of eggs in interprovincial and export trade, including the power to impose and collect levies based on producer groups. The order defines key terms and authorizes the board to manage marketing, create reserves, and adjust revenues among producers.
