The Public Service Staff Relations Board revoked its 1990 Regulations and Rules of Procedure and replaced them with the 1993 version, which sets out detailed procedures for handling applications, complaints, hearings, and other proceedings under the Public Service Staff Relations Act, effective upon publication in the Canada Gazette. The 1993 Regulations establish rules for filing documents, conducting hearings, managing time limits, allowing for amendments, and providing for review of decisions, while ensuring procedural fairness and flexibility.
