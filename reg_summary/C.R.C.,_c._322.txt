These Regulations establish the framework for development and redevelopment taxes levied by municipalities on real property within designated areas, with specific provisions allowing the federal government to provide grants in lieu of such taxes for federal property, adjusted to account for federal funding of related infrastructure services. The grants are limited to the tax that would have been payable and are subject to deductions based on federal contributions to capital services in the area.
