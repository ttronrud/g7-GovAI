The Governor General in Council, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, amalgamates the Privy Council Office with the Federal-Provincial Relations Office under the Prime Minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet, as authorized by paragraph 2(b) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This consolidation streamlines federal governance by combining key offices responsible for advisory functions and intergovernmental relations.
