These regulations establish strict requirements for the storage, display, and transportation of firearms by businesses in Canada, mandating that firearms be unloaded, stored in secure locations with appropriate locks and alarm systems, displayed in a safe and inaccessible manner, and transported in opaque, tamper-evident containers under specific conditions. The rules apply to all firearms except those being shipped by post within Canada or stored in accordance with special authorities, and they come into force on December 1, 1998.
