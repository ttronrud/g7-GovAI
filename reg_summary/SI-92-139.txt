This regulation revokes previous Orders in Council and withdraws specific parcels of land in Nunavut from disposal to facilitate the settlement of native land claims, effective until June 30, 1995 or the ratification of the land claims agreement, whichever comes first, while preserving certain existing rights and interests. The withdrawals apply to lands identified in various agreements between the Inuit of Nunavut and the Canadian government, including those related to Type 1 and Type 2 lands, and specific communities such as Cambridge Bay, Coppermine, and Pangnirtung.
