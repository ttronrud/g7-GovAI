The Governor General in Council has approved Regulations that require carriers and terminal operators in Canada to provide comprehensive training to employees and contractors on how to assist persons with disabilities during all stages of travel, including embarking, disembarking, and movement within facilities. The training must cover policies, the needs of persons with disabilities, mobility aid handling, service animals, and special equipment, with initial training completed within 60 days of employment and periodic refresher sessions required to maintain competency.
