The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, enacted the Wage Earner Protection Program Regulations under the Wage Earner Protection Program Act to establish rules for the payment of eligible wages and benefits to employees of bankrupt or receiver-controlled employers, including definitions of eligible wages, eligibility criteria, application timelines, and payment allocation priorities. The regulations also outline requirements for applications, information reporting by trustees or receivers, and adjustments to fees and expenses based on the consumer price index.
