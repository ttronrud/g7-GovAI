This regulation establishes a General Import Permit authorizing Canadian residents to import specified wheat and barley products up to a determined import access quantity over a 12-month period, with importation limited to goods classified under specific tariff items and subject to accounting requirements. The permit, issued under the Export and Import Permits Act, expires when the allocated quantity is filled and applies only to goods accounted for or stored in bonded warehouses under specific conditions.
