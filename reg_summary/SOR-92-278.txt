These regulations restrict cooperative credit associations from engaging in certain securities dealings in Canada, such as primary distributions, secondary market trading, and acting as selling agents for mutual funds, except in specific authorized cases involving government, public utility, or international securities, or in private placements and syndicated loans. Associations are permitted to trade securities for their own account or for clients, and to provide investment counselling or portfolio management services.
