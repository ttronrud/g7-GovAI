The Governor in Council varied Telecom Decision CRTC 2006-15 by replacing local forbearance regions (LFRs) with local exchanges as the appropriate geographic component of a relevant market, setting new criteria for forbearance based on market competition, quality of service standards, and the presence of independent facilities-based providers, and removing key regulatory safeguards on promotions and winback rules to promote market competition. This change allows incumbent local exchange carriers to operate with greater flexibility in competitive markets where conditions demonstrate sufficient rivalry to protect consumer interests.
