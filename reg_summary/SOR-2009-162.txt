The Chromium Electroplating, Chromium Anodizing and Reverse Etching Regulations establish environmental controls on the use of hexavalent chromium in industrial processes, requiring facilities using 50 kg or more of chromium trioxide per year to control emissions through point sources, surface tension limitation, or tank covers. The regulations specify strict limits on hexavalent chromium emissions, require regular release testing, inspection and maintenance plans, and detailed record-keeping to ensure protection of human health and the environment.
