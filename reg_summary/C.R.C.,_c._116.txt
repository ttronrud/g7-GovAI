The Sudbury Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions on buildings, structures, and natural growth near Sudbury Airport to ensure aviation safety, defining specific surfaces—such as approach, outer, and transitional surfaces—that no object may exceed in elevation. These regulations apply to lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, as described in the schedule, with violations subject to enforcement by the Minister of Transport.
