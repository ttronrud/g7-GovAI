This regulation establishes a general export permit allowing Canadian suppliers to export usual and reasonable quantities of consumable stores—such as fuel, lubricants, provisions, and medical supplies—to vessels and aircraft departing Canada for use during their voyage or flight. Exported items must be accompanied by a customs entry form endorsed with "Exported under the authority of General Export Permit No. Ex. 3" or its French equivalent.
