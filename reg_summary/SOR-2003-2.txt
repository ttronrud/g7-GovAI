This regulation establishes emission standards for on-road vehicles and engines in Canada, aligning with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and defines key terms related to vehicle types, emissions, and testing procedures. It sets limits for exhaust and evaporative emissions, applies different standards based on vehicle class and model year, and incorporates EPA-certified groupings and test procedures while excluding certain discretionary or alternative standards.
