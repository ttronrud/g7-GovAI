This regulation establishes marketing levies for Ontario grape producers who market grapes in interprovincial and export trade, requiring buyers to deduct and remit both a general levy and a research and industry development levy to the Grape Growers of Ontario. The levies are applied to specific grape varieties listed in the schedule and must be forwarded within 30 days of the end of each month.
