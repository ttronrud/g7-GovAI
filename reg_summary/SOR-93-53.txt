The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked two previous regulations and introduced the Fishery (General) Regulations, effective February 24, 1993, to establish comprehensive rules for fishing activities, fish habitat protection, and the administration of penalties and forfeiture proceeds under the Fisheries Act. These regulations apply to Canadian fisheries waters and related activities, with specific provisions for licensing, vessel registration, reporting requirements, and the authority to vary fishing restrictions by regional officials.
