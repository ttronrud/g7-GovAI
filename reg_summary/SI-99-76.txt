This regulation proclaims the official entry into force of the Canada–Trinidad and Tobago Agreement on Social Security on July 1, 1999, establishing reciprocal rights to social security benefits, including retirement, disability, survivors’, and death benefits, for individuals who have worked or resided in either country. It outlines rules for creditable periods, totalization of contributions, and the conditions under which benefits are payable, regardless of where a person resides, while ensuring that benefits are not reduced solely due to residence in the other country.
