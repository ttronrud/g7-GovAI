This regulation grants a partial remission of customs duties and sales tax for certain vessels temporarily imported into Canada, based on the difference between duties and taxes paid, reduced by a monthly fraction for each month the vessel remains in Canada. Remission is only allowed if the vessel is essential for a specific service and cannot be replaced by a suitable Canadian-registered vessel, and the vessel must be exported or removed beyond Canada’s territorial sea before the temporary importation period ends.
