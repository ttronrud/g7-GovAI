The Government of Canada revoked the previous Mail Receptacles Regulations and issued new regulations governing the delivery and collection of mail to and from buildings, including requirements for mail boxes, letter chutes, mail dispatching facilities, and access conditions. These regulations establish standards for mail reception in commercial buildings, apartment complexes, and rural areas, ensuring safe, accessible, and efficient mail handling while requiring owners to provide suitable facilities or face non-delivery of mail.
