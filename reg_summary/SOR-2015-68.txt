The Treasury Board establishes Low-value Amounts Regulations under the Financial Administration Act, setting a threshold of 99 cents for certain pensions and benefits and two dollars for all other payments, with accumulated amounts up to 12 months after payment becoming payable, subject to specific conditions and exclusions. These regulations come into force on April 1, 2015.
