These regulations authorize Export Development Canada to lease certain property, acquire equity interests in entities, and enter into domestic financial or insurance transactions, but require ministerial approval under specific conditions—such as when transactions involve businesses with less than 50% export or foreign market activity, or when lease or acquisition thresholds are exceeded. The regulations ensure these activities align with Export Development Canada’s mandate to support Canadian businesses engaged in international trade.
