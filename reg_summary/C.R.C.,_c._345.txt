These regulations establish that interest at 1% per quarter is payable on certain superannuation contributions that have been in the account for at least two years and are no longer available for their original purpose, starting from the first day of the quarter after the contribution was made and ending before the contribution is withdrawn. Interest does not apply to contributions made before April 1, 1967, unless specifically requested by the contributor to the President of the Treasury Board.
