The Treasury Board revokes the old Debt Write-off Regulations and replaces them with new regulations that outline when and how debts due to Her Majesty can be written off, including strict conditions such as exhaustion of collection efforts, lack of collection potential, and financial insolvency, while also requiring formal review processes and record retention. These regulations do not apply to disputes over debt amounts, negotiations, or debts owed to Crown corporations.
