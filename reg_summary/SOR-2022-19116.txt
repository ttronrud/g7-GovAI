These regulations define when a residential condominium unit in a building with four or more units is considered "prescribed property" under the Underused Housing Tax Act, based on ownership and use for continuous residency. They also establish prescribed areas and conditions for tax exemption, including residency use for at least 28 days or use by employees, officers, or contractors in a business-related location, and specify the application timeline for the rules starting in 2022.
