These regulations define "prescribed deposits" — specifically, deposits under $150,000 from certain entities such as governments, international organizations, or financial institutions — and establish rules for trust and loan companies that receive such deposits, with the aim of ensuring financial stability and oversight. The regulations come into force on the date specified in the 2007 Statutes of Canada, or upon registration if later.
