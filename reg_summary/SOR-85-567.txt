These Regulations, known as the Deficient Postage Regulations, establish rules for handling mail with insufficient or no postage, requiring such items to be returned to the sender unless they meet specific conditions—such as bearing no return address, being redirected, or being accepted by the addressee under a written agreement. In those cases, the addressee is responsible for paying the deficient postage plus a specified rate, except for mail delivered outside Canada, where the deficient postage rate does not apply.
