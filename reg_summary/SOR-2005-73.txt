These regulations establish rules for the safe and responsible use of Canadian harbours, prohibiting activities that obstruct navigation, harm the environment, or endanger persons and ships, and require prompt reporting and mitigation of incidents. Harbour officials have authority to authorize certain activities under specific conditions, particularly in emergencies, and may require measures to prevent prohibited outcomes or impose penalties for non-compliance.
