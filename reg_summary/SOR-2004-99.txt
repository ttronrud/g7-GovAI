This regulation establishes the Tax Court of Canada’s Rules of Procedure respecting the Customs Act (Informal Procedure), which govern appeals under Part V.1 of the Customs Act, including filing requirements, service of documents, expert witness rules, costs, and procedures for extending time to file objections or appeals. The rules are effective upon publication and apply to informal appeals, with provisions for judgment, costs, witness fees, and contempt, while allowing flexibility for the Court in special circumstances.
