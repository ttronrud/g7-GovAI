These regulations designate specific energy conservation equipment—such as thermal insulation, wood-burning stoves, wind deflectors, waterwheels and pumps, loading dock seals, and power factor correction capacitors—as exempt under section 9 of Part XVIII of Schedule III to the Excise Tax Act. The exemptions aim to promote energy efficiency by allowing these items to be excluded from excise tax.
