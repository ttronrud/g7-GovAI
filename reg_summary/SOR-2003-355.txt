This regulation establishes emission standards for off-road small spark-ignition engines in Canada, aligning them with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, and sets limits on hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and toxic substances like benzene. It applies to engines of 2005 and later model years with a displacement of 1,000 cm³ or less, requiring compliance with specific emission controls, fuel system requirements, and testing procedures.
