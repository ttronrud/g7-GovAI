These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Prince Albert Airport, limiting the height of any structures or objects to the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces defined in the plan, and prohibiting the disposal of bird-attractive waste. The regulations are based on a detailed geometric description of the airport’s boundaries, runways, and surrounding areas, and apply to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.
