These regulations establish the requirements for financial institutions in Canada to provide advance notice before closing a retail deposit-taking branch, with specific timelines and content obligations based on whether the branch is in an urban or rural area. The notice must include key details such as the closure date, alternative service locations, and customer contact information, and may be accompanied by community consultations or meetings if certain conditions are met, with exemptions available in specific circumstances like temporary closures or restructuring transactions.
