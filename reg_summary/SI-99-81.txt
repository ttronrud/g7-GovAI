This regulation grants a tax remission to the Director of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation for the period from September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997, equal to the difference between the tax actually paid and the tax that would have been payable if the Director had been entitled to diplomatic agent exemptions under the Vienna Convention. The remission is made under the Financial Administration Act to promote the public interest.
