These regulations implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) by establishing a framework to identify and restrict individuals and entities linked to terrorism, prohibiting financial transactions with listed persons, and providing mechanisms for judicial review and exemptions under specific circumstances. They enable Canadian authorities to enforce international anti-terrorism measures, including freezing property and restricting financial dealings, while ensuring due process and appeal rights for affected individuals.
