This regulation exempts certain fishing licences and authorizations related to sportfishing and national park fishing from Section 32 of the Species at Risk Act for one year, specifically to protect the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Alberta population) listed as at risk. The exemption applies to specific provisions of the Alberta Fishery Regulations and National Parks of Canada Fishing Regulations during that period.
