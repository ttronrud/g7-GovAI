The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has designated the critical habitat for the threatened Black Redhorse (Moxostoma duquesnei) under the Species at Risk Act, based on its recovery strategy and public registry, and has consulted with Indigenous authorities as required. The Order comes into force upon registration and does not affect reserves set apart for the use of a band.
