The Canadian government has enacted special economic measures targeting individuals and entities linked to Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, prohibiting Canadians from engaging in transactions involving their property or financial services, while providing avenues for appeals and clarifications. These measures are based on the Special Economic Measures Act and apply to specific individuals, including senior Hamas figures, and associated entities, with exceptions for certain legitimate financial and personal obligations.
