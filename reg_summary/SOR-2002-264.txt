These regulations require banks and authorized foreign banks operating in a province to designate a specific office (one of their branches) for serving enforcement notices and to publicly disclose that office’s name and address in the Canada Gazette and local newspapers, as well as maintain an updated online list. The enforcement notice must include either a person’s social insurance number or date of birth to identify them.
