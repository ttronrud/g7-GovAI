This regulation designates the critical habitat for the endangered Round Hickorynut (Obovaria subrotunda) under the Species at Risk Act, following consultation with Indigenous authorities, and comes into force upon registration. The designated habitat is not located within a reserve set aside for a band's use, and the order is made under specific provisions of the Act to support species recovery.
