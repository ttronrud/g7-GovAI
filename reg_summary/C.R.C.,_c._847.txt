These regulations govern fishing activities in Canadian waters adjacent to the Northwest Territories and in Ontario and Manitoba, defining terms such as sport fishing, commercial fishing, and subsistence use, and establishing licensing requirements, restrictions on methods and seasons, and specific rules for gill nets, vessel registration, and fish possession. They also provide exceptions for Indigenous peoples, beneficiaries under the Inuvialuit Agreement, and residents for subsistence or recreational fishing without a licence.
