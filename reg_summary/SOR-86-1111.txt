This regulation establishes levies on wood producers in the Lower St. Lawrence region of Quebec for wood marketed interprovincially or exported, including a general administration levy, a research levy, and a working fund levy based on wood type and measurement. Producers must pay these levies within 30 days after marketing, with the Syndicate or the buyer responsible for deduction and remittance if the levy is not paid directly.
