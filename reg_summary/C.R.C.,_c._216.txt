This regulation establishes a marketing levy system in Ontario where cream producers must pay $1 per pound of butterfat sold or delivered beyond their allocated quota to the Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Board. The plant operator is responsible for deducting these levies from payments to producers and remitting them to the Board by the 15th day of the following month.
