These regulations establish fees for the assessment of new substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, with fees based on a notifier’s annual sales in Canada, subject to caps and reductions for certain circumstances like matched or consolidated notifications. The fees apply to information submitted under specific schedules of the New Substances Notification Regulations, but do not cover certain chemicals, organisms, or substances regulated under other acts.
