The St. Anns Bank Marine Protected Area Regulations designate a specific marine area off Canada’s coast, encompassing the seabed, subsoil to five metres, and water column above, and divide it into four management zones with strict prohibitions on activities that harm marine life, allowing only authorized fishing, navigation, and approved scientific, educational, or tourism activities under a formal application and monitoring process. The Minister must approve such activities based on environmental safeguards and public benefit, with a requirement to submit detailed activity plans and provide post-activity reports.
