This regulation approves the exclusion of certain temporary employees hired by Statistics Canada between April 1, 1995, and March 31, 1997, for the 1996 Census of Population, from the Public Service Employment Act, and establishes specific employment terms for those individuals. It allows these temporary staff members in designated service groups to be employed without being subject to the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act during the census period.
