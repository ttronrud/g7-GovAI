These regulations restrict insurance holding companies from acquiring control of or making substantial investments in entities that engage in certain information technology activities—such as developing or managing data transmission systems or information platforms—unless specific conditions are met, including limits on the combined balance sheet value and loan amounts. The restrictions also prohibit investments in entities that engage in prohibited financial activities like accepting deposits or dealing in securities, unless expressly permitted under the Insurance Companies Act.
