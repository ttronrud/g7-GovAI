These regulations allow former members of the Aveos Fleet Performance Inc. pension plan to transfer their plan assets into either a locked-in registered retirement savings plan (LRSP) or a life income fund, with specific conditions on how the funds can be used and protected. The transfer must be requested in writing within 90 days, and the administrator must provide detailed information on the risks, including potential reductions in retirement income due to investment performance, and must obtain consent from the former member or their spouse/common-law partner if applicable.
