These regulations, effective June 1, 1992, define how property and casualty or marine insurance companies calculate their total debt obligations and total assets for compliance with section 476 of the Insurance Companies Act, setting a 2% limit on debt obligations relative to total assets. Specifically, debt obligations are calculated by summing the company’s and its prescribed subsidiaries’ debt obligations, minus the company’s stated capital, while total assets are determined based on the company’s balance sheet under prescribed accounting principles, excluding assets of non-prescribed subsidiaries.
