These regulations set fire safety standards for mattresses in Canada, requiring that during a cigarette test, melting or charring must not extend more than 50 mm from the ignition point, and combustion must not continue for more than 10 minutes after the cigarette is extinguished in more than one test specimen. The regulations come into force upon registration.
