These regulations prohibit anti-competitive practices by air carriers operating domestic services, such as charging fares below avoidable costs, pre-empting essential airport facilities or slots, using inducements or loyalty programs to eliminate competitors, or altering schedules to impede competition. They define essential facilities and services necessary for competitive air service and apply to activities that restrict market access or harm competition under the Competition Act.
