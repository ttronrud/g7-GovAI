These regulations establish a standardized method for determining the portion of financial activities conducted by foreign banks or Canadian entities that fall within specific categories, using a formula based on the ratio of assets and revenue derived from those activities relative to total assets and revenue. The calculations apply both within and outside Canada, and the regulations come into force on the date section 978 of the Bank Act is enacted.
