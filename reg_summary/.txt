This regulation establishes a remission program for individuals who were erroneously determined eligible for the Canadian Dental Care Plan due to incorrect income calculations or inaccurate co-payment determinations, or who received dental services for which they should not have been charged. It provides financial relief by remitting the amounts paid to dental professionals for such services, with specific eligibility criteria based on application dates, coverage periods, and access to dental insurance.
