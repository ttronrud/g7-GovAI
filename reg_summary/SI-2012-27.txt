This regulation approves the exclusion of certain provisions of the Public Service Employment Act from applying to indeterminate employees whose work units are relocated and who do not wish to relocate or whose services are no longer needed—especially when they have not received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer. The decision is based on the Public Service Commission’s determination that applying these provisions would not be practicable or in the public interest.
