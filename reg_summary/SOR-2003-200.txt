These regulations establish the conditions under which non-duty-paid packaged alcohol can be returned to an excise warehouse, requiring the alcohol to remain in its original, unopened container or be opened only for analysis. They also allow for the refund of special duty on returned imported spirits under specific conditions, and the regulations take effect on July 1, 2003.
