This regulation, now repealed, established fishing restrictions in Canadian Atlantic and Pacific fisheries waters, including prohibitions on foreign vessels fishing in specific areas and during certain times, limits on incidental catches, mesh size requirements for trawl nets, and size limits for certain species like swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin tuna, and bluefin tuna. It also defined key terms such as stock areas, fishing zones, and gear types, and outlined conditions under which foreign fishing vessels could operate, including licensing and inspection requirements.
