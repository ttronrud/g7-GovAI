This regulation establishes controls on the production, import, export, and possession of Class A and Class B precursors under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, requiring licenses, permits, and end-use declarations for certain transactions. It defines key terms, outlines exemptions for specific uses (e.g., pharmaceuticals, food additives, pest control), and ensures secure handling and traceability of precursors to prevent diversion to illicit markets.
