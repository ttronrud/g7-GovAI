These regulations establish a financial assistance framework for Baie Verte Mines Inc., allowing the Canadian government to provide up to $13 million in loans and a $1 million loan guarantee for reactivating an asbestos mine in Newfoundland, with conditions including employment targets, environmental compliance, and oversight by a Monitoring Committee. The loans carry simple interest and are repaid through a percentage of the company’s pre-tax profits, with the agreement terminating on March 31, 1987.
