This regulation revokes an older set of fishery rules and establishes new fishing regulations for inland and coastal waters in Newfoundland and Labrador, primarily governing angling practices, catch limits, size restrictions, and prohibited methods in rivers and inland waters. It sets specific daily and yearly quotas, length limits, and restrictions on gear use, particularly in rivers and during certain times, to protect fish populations and ensure sustainable fishing.
