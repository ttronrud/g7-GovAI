These Regulations establish the powers of the Deputy Minister of Veterans Affairs to assume guardianship over property and moneys of veterans or their dependants, including those receiving care under the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, and to manage, dispose of, or administer such assets for their benefit. The Deputy Minister may also designate officers to act as trustees, deposit funds in a special account, and authorize interest payments on held moneys, with all actions under guardianship being binding and dischargeable upon proper receipt.
