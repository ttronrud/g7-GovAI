These regulations establish the federal marketing quotas for chicken in interprovincial and export trade, setting limits on how much chicken producers can market based on provincial allocations and compliance with rules set by provincial Commodity Boards. They define different types of quotas—federal, market development, and specialty—and ensure that total chicken marketing does not exceed provincial caps to maintain market stability.
