This regulation establishes the Quebec Rules of Practice for applications to reduce the number of years of imprisonment without parole eligibility under section 745.6 of the Criminal Code, outlining requirements for filing, service, evidence presentation, and judicial procedures, including the preparation and review of a comprehensive parole eligibility report. The rules came into force 15 days after publication and supersede earlier rules, while maintaining continuity for prior applications.
