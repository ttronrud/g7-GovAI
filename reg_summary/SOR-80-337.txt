These regulations establish a customs drawback program that allows Canadian manufacturers to recover up to 100% of customs duties paid on imported toy skins used in making stuffed toys, provided that a certain percentage of Canadian fabric is used in production and a claim is filed within four years. The drawback rate increases by 2% for each percentage point above 55% Canadian fabric cost, and decreases if Canadian fabric usage falls below 45% of the duty-paid value.
