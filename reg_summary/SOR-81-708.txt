The Governor General in Council has approved the replacement of the old Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Regulations with new regulations that establish strict height limits for structures and natural growth near the airport, based on defined approach, transitional, and outer surfaces to ensure aviation safety. These regulations apply to lands adjacent to the airport and prohibit any construction or vegetation that exceeds the specified elevation limits, with specific geometric definitions for runways, approach surfaces, and surrounding zones.
