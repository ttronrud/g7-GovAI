The Chatham Airport Zoning Regulations establish height and land-use restrictions around Chatham Airport to ensure aviation safety, prohibiting structures that exceed specified approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, and banning activities that interfere with aircraft communications or attract birds. These regulations apply to lands surrounding the airport as defined in the zoning plan and were enacted after public notice and opportunity for comment.
