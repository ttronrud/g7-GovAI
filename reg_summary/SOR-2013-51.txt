These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" (goods not imported for sale or industrial use) acquired in Panama, stating that such goods are considered to originate in Panama and qualify for Panama tariff benefits if they are marked according to Panama’s marking laws or lack any indication of non-origin. The regulations come into force on the date section 38 of the Canada–Panama Economic Growth and Prosperity Act takes effect, or upon registration if later.
