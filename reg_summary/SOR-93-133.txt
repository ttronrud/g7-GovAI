These Regulations establish the criteria and procedures for adding or deleting patents and certificates of supplementary protection to a public register, ensuring that only patents related to approved medicines—specifically those covering the medicinal ingredient, formulation, dosage form, or use—may be included, and that such inclusion is contingent upon the issuance of a notice of compliance for the corresponding drug submission. The Minister maintains and manages the register, subject to eligibility requirements and public access, and ensures that any patent or certificate not meeting these standards is removed, particularly when the patent has expired, been invalidated, or when a new drug submission or supplement is made.
