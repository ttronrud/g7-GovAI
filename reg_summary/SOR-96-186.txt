This regulation repeals an older allocation method for beef and veal imports and establishes a new one, allocating 75% of the import access quantity to processors and retailer-processors based on their processing of non-FTA-origin beef and veal, and 25% to distributors based on their imports during the prior year. The allocation is adjusted for under-utilization, with reduced allocations for those who use less than 90% of their granted amount, and includes specific provisions for the 2015 allocation based on defined base periods.
