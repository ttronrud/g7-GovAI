This regulation remits tax amounts that would have been remitted under a specific provision of the Indian Income Tax Remission Order, based on a recommendation from the Minister of National Revenue and the public interest, under the Financial Administration Act. It effectively applies a similar tax remission provision found in another Act referenced in the Order.
