This regulation establishes a central registry in Ottawa, Ontario, to track divorce proceedings across Canada by maintaining a centralized database of divorce applications and outcomes, ensuring courts can determine jurisdiction and avoid duplicate proceedings. It mandates that courts assign unique divorce registry numbers, provide detailed information to the registry upon filing or transfer, and that the registry notifies relevant courts if other proceedings or divorces are already pending or have been granted.
