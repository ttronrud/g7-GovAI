The Manitoba Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board revoked the previous interprovincial and export regulations and introduced a new order to control the marketing of certain vegetables (potatoes, parsnips, onions, carrots, and rutabagas) in Manitoba, requiring all sales and transportation to be through the Commodity Board, with strict rules on packaging, tagging, and distribution to producers. The order ensures fair distribution of proceeds based on quantity, quality, and other factors, while allowing limited exemptions for specific manufacturing agreements.
