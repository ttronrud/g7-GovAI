This regulation establishes marketing levies for turkey producers in Alberta who sell turkeys beyond their allocated market quotas, with different levy rates based on turkey type (broiler, hen, tom, or unsexed flock). These levies must be paid to the Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Board either by buyers deducting them at purchase or directly by producers, within 15 days of the following month.
