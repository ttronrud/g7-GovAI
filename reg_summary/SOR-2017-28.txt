This regulation grants a remission of anti-dumping duties on gypsum board products, reducing the duties by the amount by which they exceed a calculated threshold based on reference and import values, with specific conditions for eligibility and annual indexing of the reference value. The remission is available to importers who meet strict requirements, including timely claims and compliance with audits by the Canada Border Services Agency.
