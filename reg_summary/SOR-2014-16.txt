The Iqaluit Airport Zoning Regulations establish strict limits on land use and development around Iqaluit Airport to ensure aviation safety by preventing structures, objects, or activities that could interfere with aircraft operations, communications, or signals. These regulations define specific imaginary surfaces—such as approach, strip, transitional, and outer surfaces—within a defined geographic area, and prohibit any construction, vegetation growth, or wildlife-related activities that would penetrate these surfaces or disrupt aeronautical services.
