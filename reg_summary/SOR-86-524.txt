These regulations establish a loan insurance program in Atlantic Canada to support commercial projects in designated sectors and regions, providing up to 90% (or 95% in exceptional cases) insurance on loans for eligible projects, with specific requirements regarding project viability, capital costs, and borrower eligibility. The program aims to promote economic development in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and the Gaspé Peninsula by enabling businesses to access financing through government-backed insurance.
