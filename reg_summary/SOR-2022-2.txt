This regulation excludes specific areas—Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area and several bird sanctuaries—from the critical habitat designation for the Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) St. Lawrence River population, as required by the Species at Risk Act. The remaining critical habitat is formally designated under the Order, which comes into force upon registration.
