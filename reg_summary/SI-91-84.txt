This regulation revokes an older order and establishes a new framework granting a one-time remission of duties and taxes on household effects imported by seasonal residents for personal use, provided the items were owned before their first arrival in Canada, are not used for commercial purposes, and are not sold within one year of importation. The remission applies only once per resident and requires the household effects to be declared on a customs accounting document at the time of first entry or marked as to follow.
