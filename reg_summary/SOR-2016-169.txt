This regulation establishes safety standards for children’s sleepwear in Canada, requiring loose-fitting sleepwear to meet specific flame resistance and toxicity criteria, including limits on char length and restrictions on flame retardant exposure that could cause acute toxicity, irritation, sensitization, mutations, or cancer. It also mandates labeling, testing procedures, and laundering requirements to ensure the continued safety and performance of treated sleepwear.
