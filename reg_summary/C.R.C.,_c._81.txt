The Edmonton International Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions on lands adjacent to the airport, prohibiting any structure or object from exceeding specified surfaces such as approach, transitional, or outer surfaces to ensure aviation safety. These regulations apply to lands within or directly under approach surfaces, and also prohibit the disposal of bird-attractive waste.
