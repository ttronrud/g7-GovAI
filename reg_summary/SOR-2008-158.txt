These regulations establish conditions under which affiliates of banks or bank holding companies may use names or identifying marks without being deemed to engage in deposit-taking or misleading the public about their liabilities, provided they do not accept deposits, misrepresent their instruments as deposits, and disclose key information when borrowing publicly. The rules do not apply to certain entities like trusts, cooperatives, insurance companies, or those primarily engaged in securities dealing.
