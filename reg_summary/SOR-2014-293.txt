The Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has established Standing Orders (General Administration) to govern the operation of messes and lounges, define membership and responsibilities, and regulate representation and assistance for members, ensuring no conflicts of interest and requiring written authorization for representation. These orders come into force upon registration and replace references to "Force" with "RCMP" in relevant legislation.
