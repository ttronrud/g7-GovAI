These regulations require financial institutions to clearly and simply disclose key terms of deposit-type instruments—such as interest rates, fees, redemption terms, and insurance eligibility—both orally and in writing before and during the investment period, with specific rules for telephone, electronic, and mail-based agreements. The regulations also mandate transparency in advertising and ensure consumers can cancel certain instruments within 10 business days of issuance, coming into force on November 1, 2011.
