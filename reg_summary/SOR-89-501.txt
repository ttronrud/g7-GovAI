The Governor General in Council has revoked the previous phosphorus concentration regulations and introduced new rules limiting phosphorus levels in laundry detergents, dish-washing compounds, and household cleaners, with stricter caps for commercial products and mandatory record-keeping for manufacturers and importers. These regulations aim to reduce nutrient pollution, particularly in water bodies, by restricting phosphorus content in consumer cleaning products.
