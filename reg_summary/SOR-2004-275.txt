These Firearms Marking Regulations require manufacturers and importers of firearms to permanently mark firearms with "Canada" or "CA," the manufacturer's name and serial number (for manufactured firearms), or the last two digits of the import year (for imported firearms), with specific requirements for legibility and visibility. The regulations come into force on December 1, 2025, and provide exemptions for certain firearms, such as those imported temporarily, protected, or used in media productions.
