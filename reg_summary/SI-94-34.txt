The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board, has discontinued the requirement for certain annual reports to be laid before Parliament because they contain no more information than what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates. This decision is made under section 157 of the Financial Administration Act to reduce duplication and streamline parliamentary reporting.
