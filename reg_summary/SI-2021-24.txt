This regulation grants fee remission for the issuance, replacement, or addition of observations to travel documents, permanent resident cards, and citizenship certificates that include an "X" as a sex or gender identifier, provided the application was made between specified dates and the document being replaced was valid for at least six months. The order aims to support gender inclusivity by removing financial barriers for individuals identifying with non-binary or gender-diverse options in official documents.
