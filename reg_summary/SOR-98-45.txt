This regulation establishes the procedures for verifying the origin, tariff classification, and value of imported goods, particularly when the Least Developed Country Tariff is claimed, and outlines the types of reviews, questionnaires, and inspections that may be conducted. It specifies which parties and premises are involved in these verifications, including importers, owners, accountants, exporters, and producers, and provides that the regulation is not required to be published due to its connection with a prior public announcement.
