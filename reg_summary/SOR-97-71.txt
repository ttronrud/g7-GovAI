These regulations require exporters and producers of commercial goods to maintain detailed records for six years relating to the origin, costs, materials used (including indirect materials), and production processes, as well as advance rulings and producer representations, in compliance with CIFTA and other free trade agreements. The records may be kept on machine-sensible data media or microfilm and must be available for inspection upon request by a customs administration of a free trade partner.
