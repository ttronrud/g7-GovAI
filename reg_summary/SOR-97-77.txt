This regulation establishes General Import Permit No. 193, allowing Canadian residents to import cut roses and rose buds from Israel or other CIFTA beneficiaries, subject to an annual quota of 90,000 dozen roses, and requires importers to state the permit number on accounting forms. The permit is valid from January 1, 1997, and applies only to roses classified under specific tariff headings.
