These regulations establish the requirements for a federal credit union to convert into a bank with common shares under the Bank Act, including detailed provisions for a transparent and fair conversion proposal, valuation, member disclosures, restrictions on payments and share issuance, and oversight by the Superintendent. The process ensures that members and shareholders are fully informed and that the conversion is in their best interests, with specific rules on timing, disclosures, and financial transparency.
