These Regulations establish the criteria and procedures for compensating Canadian farmers whose agricultural products suffer losses due to pesticide residues, limiting compensation to a maximum of 80% of the product’s market value and requiring that the product be produced in Canada. Compensation is only paid if the Minister determines the loss was caused by pesticide residue and that the costs of mitigating the loss would exceed the compensation available under the regulations.
