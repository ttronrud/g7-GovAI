The British Columbia Tree Fruit Marketing Board revoked the previous export regulations and established new rules governing the export marketing of tree fruit from the province, designating B.C. Tree Fruits Limited as the sole agency for export marketing, with limited exceptions for designated persons or those operating under Board authorization. These regulations require detailed reporting, inspections, and strict controls on the transportation and marketing of tree fruit for export.
