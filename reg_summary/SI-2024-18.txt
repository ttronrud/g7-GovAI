This regulation grants a fee remission for individuals affected by the 2021 British Columbia floods, allowing them to apply for replacement identity or travel documents without paying fees if the original document was lost, damaged, or destroyed due to the flooding and they meet specific residency and application conditions. The remission applies to certain documents and fees under specific regulations, provided the applicant can prove their connection to a flood-affected area during the specified period.
