These regulations establish a framework for First Nations to impose property taxes on railway right-of-way areas within their reserves, ensuring tax rates are predictable, comparable to provincial laws, and equitable—while maintaining fairness and compliance with principles of natural justice. The tax rates are capped based on provincial assessment rates and adjustment factors, and all by-laws must be reviewed by the First Nations Tax Commission before enactment.
