These transitional regulations ensure that the Canadian Energy Regulator applies the former National Energy Board's cost recovery rules as if it were the National Energy Board, including continuing and initiating cost recovery calculations for periods before and after the regulator's establishment. The regulations provide for adjustments in cost attributions to reflect the new regulatory mandate and ensure continuity in cost determinations.
