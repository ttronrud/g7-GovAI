This regulation allows the Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, to remit interest owed by taxpayers (other than promoters) for tax years before 1985, specifically related to disallowed deductions under the Overseas Credit and Guaranty Corporation limited partnerships, where the disallowance was accepted in a letter to the Chief of Appeals and falls within the terms of a settlement offer or minutes of settlement. The remission is made in the public interest under section 23(2) of the Financial Administration Act.
