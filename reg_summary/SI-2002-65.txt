This regulation grants rent remissions to leaseholders in certain national parks for specific periods, based on differences between rental rates at the beginning and end of lease terms, or a fixed annual rate in the Town of Jasper, to alleviate financial burdens on leaseholders. The remissions are authorized under the Financial Administration Act and apply to leases fixed in 2000 and 2002, with specific calculations based on rental rate variations.
