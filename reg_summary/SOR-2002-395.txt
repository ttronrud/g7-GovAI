This regulation establishes the rules of origin for goods under the Canada–Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement (CCRFTA), defining when a good is considered "originating" based on production location, changes in tariff classification, and regional value content requirements. A good originates if it is produced entirely in a CCRFTA country using originating materials, or if non-originating materials undergo a change in tariff classification or meet specific value-content thresholds (such as 35% or 25% regional value content), with special rules for certain product categories like automotive goods.
