These regulations establish probationary periods and notice periods for public service employees, specifying that probation lasts either 2 weeks (for employees employed for 1 year or less) or 1 month (for those employed longer), and that notice periods follow similar timelines, beginning when the deputy head provides notice. The periods exclude certain types of leave and are tailored to specific employee categories, including those in training programs or with disabilities requiring accommodations.
