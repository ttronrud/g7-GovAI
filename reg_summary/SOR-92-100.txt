This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Igloolik Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria. The regulations apply to lands surrounding the airport and are based on the 1989 zoning plan, with the airport reference point at 46.1 meters above sea level and a 4,000-meter radius boundary.
