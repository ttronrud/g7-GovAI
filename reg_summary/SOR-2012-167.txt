The regulation establishes a performance standard limiting carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from coal-fired power units to no more than 420 tonnes per GWh of electricity produced, with provisions for exceptions, unit substitutions, and deferrals for retired units. It also sets out reporting requirements, quantification methods, and specific rules for standby and old units, with the performance standard delayed until January 1, 2030, for standby units.
