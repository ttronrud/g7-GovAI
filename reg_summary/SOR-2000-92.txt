This regulation establishes levies and additional charges on broiler hatching eggs based on the province of production and the type of trade (interprovincial or export), with higher rates for non-signatory provinces and for sales exceeding allocated quotas. The levies are collected by provincial Commodity Boards and must be remitted within specified timeframes, with penalties for non-compliance.
