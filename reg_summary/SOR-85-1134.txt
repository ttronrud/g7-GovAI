This regulation approves the revocation of the previous tariff and establishes a new fee structure for services provided by the Port Warden of the Harbour of Quebec, including fees for inspections, surveys, and certificates, with specific rates and conditions based on vessel type, service type, and time of day. Fees are due from vessel owners or operators at the time services are performed, with additional charges for services conducted outside standard hours or on holidays.
