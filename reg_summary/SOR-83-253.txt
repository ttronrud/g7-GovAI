The Governor General in Council has approved the revocation of the previous Abbotsford Airport Zoning Regulations and the adoption of new regulations that establish strict height limits for structures and natural growth near Abbotsford Airport, ensuring safety by defining approach, transitional, and outer surfaces based on runway orientation and elevation. These regulations apply to specific lands surrounding the airport, prohibiting any construction or vegetation that exceeds the defined surfaces, with the airport reference point set at 50.6 meters above sea level.
