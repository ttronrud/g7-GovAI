The Vessel Fire Safety Regulations, made under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, establish fire safety standards for Canadian vessels that are complementary to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), particularly for passenger and cargo vessels of certain sizes and types, including those carrying dangerous goods or operating on specific voyages. These regulations require vessels to meet specific structural fire protection, fire safety system, and equipment standards, with some exemptions for older vessels or those undergoing modifications.
