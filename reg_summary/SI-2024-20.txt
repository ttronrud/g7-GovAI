This regulation grants fee remission for certain identity and travel document fees to Canadians and permanent residents who were forced to travel urgently due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and to Ukrainian nationals who applied for documents during a specific period, provided their applications were submitted to Canadian missions in Warsaw, Bucharest, Budapest, or Vienna. The remission applies to fees associated with passports, citizenship certificates, travel documents, and emergency travel documents under specified conditions and timeframes.
