These regulations exempt certain bank or bank holding company acquisitions of control or substantial investments in intragroup service entities from approval requirements, provided the entity’s financial intermediary activities exposing it to market or credit risk are limited to serving the bank or its group exclusively. The exemptions apply under specific sections of the Bank Act and come into force upon registration.
