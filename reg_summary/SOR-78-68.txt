These rules establish the procedures for criminal appeals and bail applications in the Northwest Territories, outlining notice requirements, filing procedures, time limits, evidence submission, and hearing practices, including provisions for written arguments and the handling of documents and transcripts. They also specify that all appeals must be filed within 60 days of a conviction, acquittal, or relevant finding, and that applications for release from custody must be made to an Appellate judge and accompany a notice of appeal or leave application.
