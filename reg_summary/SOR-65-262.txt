This regulation revokes an earlier order and establishes a new Pensionable Service Order, which recognizes certain service periods as pensionable under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act if specific payment requirements are met—either by full payment of required contributions or by paying the difference in a lump sum. The required contribution rate is five per cent of the contributor's aggregate pay during the service period.
