On July 1, 2006, the control and supervision of the Regulatory Affairs and Orders in Council Secretariat (except the Orders in Council Division) was transferred from the Privy Council Office to the Treasury Board, pursuant to the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This reallocation aimed to enhance the Treasury Board's oversight of regulatory functions within federal public administration.
