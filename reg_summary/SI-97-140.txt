The Supreme Court of British Columbia enacted the Criminal Rules in 1997 to streamline and ensure fair, efficient, and just criminal proceedings, with provisions for pre-trial conferences, service of documents, appeals, and flexibility in court procedures—all designed to eliminate unnecessary delays and expense. These rules repeal prior rules and apply to all criminal cases in the province, coming into force on December 1, 1997.
