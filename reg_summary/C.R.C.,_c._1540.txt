This regulation withdraws approximately 870 square miles of land along the South Nahanni River in the Northwest Territories from disposal, setting it aside for future development as a national park, including all underlying minerals, while preserving existing mineral claims and permits. The land is precisely described by a series of survey points and coordinates based on the 1927 North American datum.
