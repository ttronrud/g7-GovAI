These regulations establish export charges for certain dairy products in Canada, requiring exporters to pay a fee based on the amount of product exported and the available export access quantity for the dairy year, with charges calculated differently depending on whether export demand exceeds or meets the allowable limit. The regulations come into force on a specified date, either under the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act or upon registration.
