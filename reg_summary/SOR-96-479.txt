These regulations implement the transfer of civil air navigation services from the public service to NAV CANADA under an agreement dated April 1, 1996, and establish specific rules for pensionable service, eligibility for options, death benefits, and contributions for employees who transition to NAV CANADA as a result of the divestiture. They also provide special provisions for those who exercise options under certain conditions, including extended timeframes and defined valuation days, and clarify how operational service and retirement benefits are calculated post-divestiture.
