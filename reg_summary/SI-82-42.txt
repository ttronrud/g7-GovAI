This regulation grants a remission of customs duty on unfinished leather imported between July 1, 1984, and June 30, 1985, provided it is used to manufacture finished garment leathers within three years of importation and a claim is made to the Minister within that timeframe, along with required documentation. The remission covers the difference between duties paid on imported leather and those that would otherwise apply to finished garment leathers.
