This regulation grants remission of customs duties for certain goods imported between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005, that were previously eligible for the Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff rate but are no longer eligible due to changes in tariff rules. The remission amounts to the difference between the duties payable under the Most-Favoured-Nation or General Preferential Tariff rates as of January 1, 2003, and the duties that would have been payable under the Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff rate at that time, provided a claim is made to the Minister of National Revenue within four years of importation.
