This regulation grants the Minister of Health an exemption from vitamin D labeling requirements for certain dairy-based yogurt and kefir products, provided they meet specific vitamin D concentration thresholds. The exemption applies to plain and fruit/flavoured varieties of yogurt and kefir, with defined minimum and maximum levels of vitamin D per 100 g or mL, and takes effect upon registration.
