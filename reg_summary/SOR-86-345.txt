These Regulations establish a framework for the controlled access to unclassified technical data in Canada that disclose critical technology, limiting such data to certified Canadian contractors who meet strict eligibility and compliance requirements. Certified contractors must demonstrate that the data will be used for legitimate business activities—such as government contracts or commercial operations—and agree to strict restrictions on disclosure, with oversight by the Joint Certification Office and the ability to suspend or revoke certification based on violations of export control laws or misuse of data.
