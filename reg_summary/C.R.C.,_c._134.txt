The Alberta Turkey Order authorizes the Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys, including the power to impose and collect levies or charges on turkey producers based on predefined groups, with the funds used for reserves, expenses, loss payments, and equalizing revenues among producers. This Order was previously revoked by SOR/80-90.
