This regulation exempts certain fishing licences, authorizations, and regulations from specific provisions of the Species at Risk Act for one year, specifically relating to white sturgeon populations in the Fraser, Nechako, Upper Columbia, and Kootenay Rivers, to allow continued recreational fishing and Aboriginal communal fishing activities. The exemption applies only to the extent that these activities are authorized under existing regulations and is effective upon registration.
