This regulation revokes an old pension adjustment order and establishes new rules for annually adjusting pensions and allowances, effective January 1, 1992, specifying precise decimal rounding methods for both pension amounts and the percentage adjustment based on a specific ratio. The adjustments ensure consistency and accuracy in calculating pension increases under the Pension Act.
