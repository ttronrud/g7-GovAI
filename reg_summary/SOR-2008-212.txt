This regulation designates Manitoba as a province subject to the Criminal Code's interest rate provisions, specifically section 347.1, to apply only when the province's consumer protection laws—particularly the Payday Loans Regulation and relevant amendments—are in force. The order comes into effect on the first day those laws are active, which occurred on October 18, 2010.
