This regulation establishes the terms and conditions under which telegraph and cable companies transmit messages, limiting their liability for transmission errors, delays, or failures to the amount paid for the service, except in cases of negligence where a written claim is made within 60 days. It also allows for message accuracy through written contracts and premium payments, and clarifies that the company is not liable for actions of other companies or for messages not accepted at a transmitting office.
