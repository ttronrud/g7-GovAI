These regulations establish mandatory safety standards for railway rolling stock, including specifications for hand brakes, running boards, ladders, handholds, and uncoupling levers, with specific requirements based on the date of construction or service. They require all box and house cars built or rebuilt after October 1, 1966, and all caboose cars with platforms in service after December 31, 1982, to comply with detailed design and safety criteria, and mandate that railway companies submit progress and final reports on modifications to ensure compliance.
