This regulation establishes the framework for marine transportation security in Canada, implementing the Marine Transportation Security Act by defining key terms, setting security levels (MARSEC 1–3), and outlining requirements for vessel and facility operators to maintain minimum security measures at all times. It also details procedures for issuing, suspending, or cancelling marine security documents, and provides a review and appeal process for operators if a document is suspended or cancelled.
