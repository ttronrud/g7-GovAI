The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has issued regulations under the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law) to prohibit Canadians and individuals in Canada from engaging in certain activities involving a list of foreign nationals suspected of committing corrupt acts, including those linked to human rights abuses or corruption. These regulations come into force upon registration and apply immediately before publication in the Canada Gazette.
