These Regulations allow members of the Canadian Forces who mistakenly failed to elect as contributors under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act due to erroneous advice to make a one-time election within one year of being informed by the Minister of their right to do so, with specific payment terms and documentation requirements. The election must be made in writing on Form CFSA 109 and may include lump-sum or installment payments, especially if the member previously received a gratuity under the former Act.
