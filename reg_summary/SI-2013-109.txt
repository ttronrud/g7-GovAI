On October 7, 2013, the Minister of Health assumed all of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food's powers and duties related to food safety under existing laws and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, excluding non-food safety responsibilities, and later took full control of food safety functions under the Safe Food for Canadians Act upon its coming into force. This transfer consolidated food safety responsibilities under the Ministry of Health.
