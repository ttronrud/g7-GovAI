These regulations establish the procedures for electing council members in Cree and Naskapi bands in Quebec, including nomination, voting, ballot counting, and election of the chief and councillors, with provisions for advance or travelling polls, recounts, and the requirement that one councillor be elected deputy chief if no election occurs. The process ensures transparency, accessibility, and adherence to electoral standards, including secret voting, verification of eligibility, and the right to vote for electors with disabilities or mobility issues.
