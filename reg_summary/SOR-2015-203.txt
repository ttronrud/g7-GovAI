The Canadian Judicial Council enacted these by-laws to establish a clear, structured process for investigating complaints against superior court judges, including the formation of a Judicial Conduct Review Panel to determine whether an Inquiry Committee should be established, and outlining the procedures for conducting inquiries, ensuring fairness, and making recommendations on potential removal of a judge. The process includes public hearings, confidentiality protections, and strict rules on participation, with the Council requiring a quorum of 17 members to deliberate on removal decisions.
