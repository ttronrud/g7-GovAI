This regulation establishes the application of provincial laws to contraventions (minor offences) in Canada, effective August 1, 1996, with specific adaptations to align provincial statutes with the Contraventions Act. It modifies key terms such as "offence" to "contravention," "prosecutor" to "Attorney General," and "fine" to a prescribed amount set by the Governor in Council, while excluding certain provisions and ensuring that laws related to parking violations are treated consistently across jurisdictions.
