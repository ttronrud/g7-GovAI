This regulation approves the 1986 Pipeline Arbitration Committee Procedure Rules, which establish detailed procedures for conducting public hearings under the National Energy Board Act, including requirements for notices of arbitration, replies, service of documents, proof of service, document production, issue formulation, and hearing scheduling—while allowing the Committee flexibility to modify or adapt rules for efficiency and fairness. The rules were later revoked in 1993.
