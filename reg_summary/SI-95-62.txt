This regulation remits income taxes, penalties, and interest to certain taxpayers and transferor corporations involved in property exchanges with Queens Quay West Land Corporation, providing relief if the tax liability exceeds what would have been owed if the proceeds from the exchange had equaled the original cost basis of the disposed property. The remission is conditional on specific requirements related to the timing of the exchange and the cost basis of acquired properties.
