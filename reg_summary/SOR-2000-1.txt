These regulations, effective January 1, 2000, establish the superannuation treatment for public service employees who transition from the public service to new employers—specifically, entities that take over the operations of former Local Port Corporations or Non-Corporate Port of Canada Ports Corporations. They define key terms, extend certain benefits (such as death benefits and allowances) to employees employed by these new employers, and ensure that pensionable service and eligibility for options under the Public Service Superannuation Act are appropriately adjusted during the transition.
