This regulation revokes the previous Citizenship Regulations and replaces them with new rules governing citizenship applications, adoptions, and the oath of citizenship, with specific provisions on international adoptions, language and citizenship knowledge requirements, and procedures for taking the oath—both in Canada and abroad. It also establishes criteria for assessing the validity of adoptions based on whether they comply with the Hague Convention and other legal standards, and includes rules on the surrender of duplicate or outdated citizenship certificates.
