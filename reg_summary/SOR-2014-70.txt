This regulation increases certain Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) pension benefits by 1.2% annually for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 plan years, effective April 1, 2014, and adjusts residual death benefits with escalating deemed contribution increases based on the year of the widow’s death. The adjustment is made to address a surplus in the pension fund and ensure adequate future payments.
