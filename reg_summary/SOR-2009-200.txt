These regulations establish the tariff preferences for agricultural products originating in Iceland, Norway, or Switzerland/Liechtenstein under the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement, specifying the conditions under which such products can be shipped to Canada and still qualify for preferential tariff treatment, including requirements for shipping documentation and customs control. The regulations come into force on July 1, 2009, or on the date of registration if registered later.
