This regulation establishes marketing levies for Nova Scotia hog producers selling hogs interprovincially or abroad, requiring a $0.25 levy on weanlings and a $2.00 levy on stags, cull boars, feeder hogs, market hogs, and cull sows. Producers must remit these levies and submit quarterly reports detailing the number of each type of hog sold.
