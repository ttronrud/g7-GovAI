These Newfoundland Rules of Practice establish the procedure for applications to reduce the number of years of imprisonment without parole eligibility, outlining requirements for filing, service, hearing conduct, evidence presentation, and judicial discretion. The rules ensure a fair and structured process where only the applicant and the Attorney General may present evidence, and a jury is empanelled to consider the application under specific procedural guidelines.
