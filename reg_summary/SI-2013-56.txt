On July 2, 2013, the Government of Canada transferred key operational units of Passport Canada from the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, reorganizing the administration of passport services to better align with respective departmental mandates. This reallocation included major divisions related to policy, operations, human resources, and technology, with specific exceptions for certain regional units.
