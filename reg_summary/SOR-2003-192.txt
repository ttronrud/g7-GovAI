These regulations establish the official boundary line between the offshore areas of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, based on an arbitration settlement from 2002, and define the offshore area of Newfoundland and Labrador for petroleum resource purposes. The line runs from a starting point in the north to a terminal point in the south, following specific geodesic paths and terminating at the edge of the continental margin as defined by international law.
