These regulations prescribe specific formulas for determining the value of imported goods, vessels, and certain equipment for duty purposes under the Excise Tax Act, particularly in cases of temporary imports, where duties are reduced, remitted, or relieved, and where goods are processed or re-imported. The value is typically calculated based on the goods’ value for duty, the duration of their stay in Canada, and the remaining duties payable.
