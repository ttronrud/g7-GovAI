This regulation revokes an older tax remission order and establishes a new one that grants a sales tax remission on Canadian civil aircraft, aircraft engines, flight simulators, and their parts when repaired abroad, based on the difference between the original tax and the tax on the repair cost, under specific conditions. The remission applies only if the goods were exported under customs supervision, no drawback was claimed, and no prior tax relief was requested.
