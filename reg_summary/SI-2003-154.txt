This proclamation, issued by the Governor in Council on August 25, 2003, formally declares the draft electoral boundaries for Canada’s provinces—specifically Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia—as in force, effective on the first dissolution of Parliament at least one year after the proclamation. The order defines the geographic boundaries and populations of each electoral district based on the 2001 census and existing territorial divisions.
