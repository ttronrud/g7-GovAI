The Annuities Agents Pension Regulations establish a pension scheme for government annuity agents who are under 65 years of age at the time of engagement, providing annuities based on years of service and earnings, with different benefits for current and past service, and specific rules for disability, death, and widow's allowances. Contributions are made at 5% of earnings, and annuities are calculated using specified mortality tables and percentage formulas, with options for immediate or deferred payments and a return of contributions for those with less than five years of service.
