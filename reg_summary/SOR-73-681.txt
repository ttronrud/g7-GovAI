These regulations establish the framework for determining and paying claims by Canadian citizens against the Government of Czechoslovakia related to pre-1973 nationalizations or expropriations, with awards limited to $1 million per claim and funded from specific moneys received under a 1973 agreement. Claims must be submitted by June 22, 1973, and eligibility requires Canadian citizenship at key times, with compensation from other sources deducted before any award is made.
