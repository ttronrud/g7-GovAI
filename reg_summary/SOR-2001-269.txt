This regulation establishes requirements for the labeling, hazard classification, and safety of consumer chemical products and their containers in Canada, including definitions of hazardous ingredients, hazard categories, and mandatory information such as first aid statements and hazard symbols. It mandates that responsible persons determine hazard categories and sub-categories using scientific data, ensure containers meet safety standards (e.g., leakage, child resistance), and display required information clearly on the container, with specific requirements for flammable, corrosive, toxic, and quick skin-bonding adhesives.
