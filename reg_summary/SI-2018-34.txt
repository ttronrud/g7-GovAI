The Alberta Court of Appeal Criminal Appeal Rules, approved in 2018, establish a structured process for criminal appeals, including requirements for permission to appeal, filing notices of appeal, preparing and serving the Appeal Record and factums, and setting deadlines for each stage—while excluding certain civil rules that do not apply to criminal matters. The rules ensure consistency, transparency, and efficiency in the administration of criminal appeals, with specific provisions for self-represented appellants, sentence appeals, and appeals involving convictions or interim release decisions.
