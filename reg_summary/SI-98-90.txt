This regulation remits fees and interest owed by corporations for corrected certificates issued between October 3, 1991, and June 8, 1992, under the Canada Business Corporations Act, as it would be unreasonable to collect them. The remission is made under the Financial Administration Act and applies to fees under the Canada Business Corporations Regulations.
