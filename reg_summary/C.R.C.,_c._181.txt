The Ontario Egg Order authorizes the Ontario Egg and Fowl Producers’ Marketing Board to establish and collect levies or charges on egg marketers engaged in interprovincial and export trade, based on predefined groups, to cover expenses, losses, and create reserves for equalizing profits among producers. These levies may be used to support the marketing of eggs and ensure fair distribution of revenues among egg producers.
