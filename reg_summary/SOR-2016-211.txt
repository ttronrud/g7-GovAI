The Canadian government has issued an emergency order to protect the Western Chorus Frog (Great Lakes / St. Lawrence — Canadian Shield population) by prohibiting harmful activities such as soil disturbance, vegetation removal, drainage, and pesticide use in designated areas of Quebec. These protections are necessary to ensure the species' recovery due to imminent threats to its survival.
