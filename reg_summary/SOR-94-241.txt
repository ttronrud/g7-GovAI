The Governor General in Council revoked the previous Halifax International Airport Zoning Regulations and introduced new regulations that establish strict height and land-use restrictions around the airport to ensure aviation safety, including limits on buildings, structures, and natural growth near approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. These zones are defined by specific geometric surfaces and boundaries based on the airport’s runway layout and elevation.
