The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, officially renames the Canadian Armed Forces Naval Jack as the Canadian Naval Ensign. The new ensign features a fouled anchor with an eagle above it, surrounded by a naval coronet and a canton of the National Flag of Canada, and is approved for use by the Canadian Forces.
