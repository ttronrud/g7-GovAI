This regulation revokes the International First Class Mail Regulations and establishes new International Letter-post Items Regulations, setting standards for the size, weight, labeling, and posting of international letters, cards, and postcards, including requirements for customs declarations when the value exceeds $500. It specifies dimensions, weight limits, and labeling rules, such as the use of green CN22 labels or customs forms, and outlines conditions for air mail and international delivery.
