These Regulations limit carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from natural gas-fired electricity generation in Canada, applying to boiler and combustion engine units with a capacity of 25 MW or more that began operating on or after January 1, 2019 (boiler units) or January 1, 2021 (combustion engine units), based on specific conditions related to natural gas use, heat-to-electricity ratios, and grid electricity sales. Emission intensity limits are set at 420 or 550 tonnes of CO₂ per GWh, depending on unit type and capacity, with additional restrictions on older units based on performance test results and annual compliance requirements.
