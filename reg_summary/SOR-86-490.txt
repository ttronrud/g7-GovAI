This regulation revokes the 1985 Cree-Naskapi Long-Term Borrowing Regulations and replaces them with updated rules that specify requirements for long-term borrowing by Cree and Naskapi bands, including details on lenders, interest, revenue sources, repayment obligations, and security. It also prohibits band officials from misusing funds intended for repayment and establishes penalties for violations.
