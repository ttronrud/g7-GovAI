These regulations establish a system to control the use of specific solvents in degreasing processes by requiring users to obtain consumption units for each kilogram of solvent used beyond a set threshold. If usage exceeds the threshold, users must have a valid consumption unit issued by the Minister, and they are required to submit annual reports detailing solvent usage, transfers, and waste management, with strict recordkeeping requirements.
