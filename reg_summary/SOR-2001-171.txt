The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, adopts the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations under the Excise Tax Act to establish rules for attributing GST/HST liabilities to selected listed financial institutions, including definitions of key terms such as investment plans, permanent establishments, and plan members, and to determine when a financial institution is deemed to have a permanent establishment in a province for tax purposes. These regulations provide a framework for calculating and allocating tax responsibilities based on the nature and structure of financial institutions and their operations.
