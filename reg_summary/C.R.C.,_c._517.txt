These regulations establish that certified seed potatoes imported under tariff item 7120-1 must carry a tag issued by the producing country's authorized authority, certifying compliance with official seed potato standards for use as seed. The tag must be attached to each bag or container and verify that the potatoes were grown and approved specifically for seed use.
