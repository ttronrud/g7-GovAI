The Government of Canada has determined, based on reasonable grounds, that several terrorist entities—including Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, Al-Ashtar Brigades, the Fatemiyoun Division, Islamic State – Khorasan Province, Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, Al Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, and Al Shabaab—have knowingly engaged in or supported terrorist activities, and therefore has confirmed their continued listing under the Criminal Code. This decision was made by the Administrator in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.
