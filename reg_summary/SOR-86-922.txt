The Service Equipment Cars Regulations, enacted by the Canadian Transport Commission in 1986, establish rules for the safe marshalling, movement, and operation of service equipment cars in rail trains, including requirements for spacing, speed limits, securement of equipment, communication, and safety measures to protect personnel and prevent accidents. These regulations ensure the safe handling of non-revenue service cars, particularly in relation to dangerous goods, passenger trains, and train operations involving heavy or hazardous materials.
