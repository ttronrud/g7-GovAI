This regulation establishes a General Export Permit allowing the export of specific types of wood logs from Canada, such as peeled poles, posts, or boomsticks, provided they meet size and type criteria and are accompanied by a customs certificate. Exported goods must be reported with the statement “Exported under the authority of General Export Permit No. Ex. 5” or its French equivalent.
