This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial lands in Nunavut—approximately 12,150 km² around Bathurst Island and the Berkeley Group—from disposal for five years to establish Qausuittuq National Park, while excluding specific Inuit-owned lands, surface leases, and mineral rights subject to existing agreements or regulations. The withdrawal applies to surface and subsurface rights, but does not affect mineral claims, leases, or discoveries made prior to the order’s issuance.
