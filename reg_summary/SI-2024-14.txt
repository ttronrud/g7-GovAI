The Governor General, acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, remitted $3,181.38 and $4,488.69 to correct annual adjustments that should have been made to Canada Gazette insertion fees under the Service Fees Act, due to an unreasonable collection of those amounts. These amounts were retroactively adjusted to reflect proper charges under section 17 of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act.
