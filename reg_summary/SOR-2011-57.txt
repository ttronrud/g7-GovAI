This regulation establishes a credit for provincial relief (HST) allowing registrants in Ontario to apply for a credit equal to qualifying amounts of tax credited to a person under a sales tax harmonization agreement or the Ontario regulation for First Nations. It outlines the conditions for claiming the credit, the timing of payments, penalties for late claims or misreporting, and rules that prevent double-counting of tax benefits related to the qualifying amounts.
