These Regulations establish how interest is calculated for individuals reinstated under the Indian Act, based on the principal amount outstanding, using the quarterly average interest rate from Bank of Canada Treasury bills, and accruing from specific dates depending on the reinstatement circumstances. Interest is calculated quarterly on the average month-end balance and applies only to the principal amount outstanding, with withheld or repaid amounts first applied to the principal and then to accrued interest.
