These regulations implement the Non-smokers’ Health Act by establishing rules that prohibit smoking in most workspaces and allow smoking only in designated areas, such as specific rooms or areas with strict access and ventilation requirements, while also setting limits on the amount of seating that can be designated for smoking on aircraft and ships. The regulations include clear signage requirements, define eligible smoking areas, and impose fines for violations, with provisions that allow exceptions for certain transportation services and agreements.
