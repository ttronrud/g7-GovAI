These regulations establish the framework for licensing and ordering the exportation or importation of oil and gas in Canada, defining classifications of crude oil, setting measurement standards, and outlining detailed requirements for applications, including supply, market, transportation, and environmental information. The National Energy Board (NEB) must approve licenses for gas exports and imports, as well as heavy crude oil exports, and may issue orders with specific terms and conditions, including volume limits, environmental requirements, and compliance obligations.
