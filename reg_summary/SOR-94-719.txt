This regulation repeals the Alberta Milk Order and replaces it with a new order granting the Alberta Milk Control Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of milk produced in Alberta, including the power to impose levies and charges on milk producers and marketers. The Board may use these funds for operational expenses, reserve creation, and equalizing revenues among producers.
