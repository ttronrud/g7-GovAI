This regulation establishes streamlined accounting methods under the Excise Tax Act, allowing eligible registrants to calculate their net tax using a "quick-method rate" based on their sales and expenses, with rates varying by province and the location of their permanent establishment. The method applies to specified supplies (non-financial, non-capital assets) and provides simplified tax computation for registrants who meet certain criteria, such as not being involved in financial services or acting as a charity or non-profit.  

*(Note: The regulation has been repealed as of SOR/2006-162, s. 6 and further amendments, and thus is no longer in force.)*
