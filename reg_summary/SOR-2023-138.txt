These regulations establish administrative monetary penalties under the Canada Marine Act, setting specific fines for violations based on the severity of the breach, the violator's history of non-compliance, the harm caused, economic gains, and mitigating factors, with higher penalties for corporations and ships than individuals. Penalties are calculated using a formula that considers baseline amounts and adjustable factors, and notices of violation are served through specific methods with defined service rules and payment deadlines.
