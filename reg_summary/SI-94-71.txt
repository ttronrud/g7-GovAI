This regulation grants tax remission to Indians and the War Lake First Nation Band for income taxes and goods and services tax (GST) related to the Ilford Indian Settlement, where the settlement is not considered a reserve, by reducing the tax liability to the amount that would have been payable if the settlement had been a reserve. Remission is only granted if an application is submitted within four years of the tax payment.
