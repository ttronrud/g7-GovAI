These regulations establish the requirements for reporting exported goods in Canada, specifying who must report (exporters, carriers, and customs service providers), when reports must be submitted based on the mode of export, and exceptions for certain types of goods such as personal items, small-value items, or goods exported under specific arrangements. The regulations also include provisions for reporting restricted goods, live animals, and goods subject to suspicion of illegal export, with specific timelines and reporting obligations.
