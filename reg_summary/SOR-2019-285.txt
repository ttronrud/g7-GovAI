These regulations designate specific physical activities—such as constructing new mines, pipelines, infrastructure in national parks or marine conservation areas, and certain military or energy projects—as requiring environmental assessment under Canada’s Impact Assessment Act, with special provisions for national parks, marine areas, and large-scale mining or energy developments. The regulations come into force on the date the Impact Assessment Act is enacted and apply to projects that meet defined thresholds in size, location, or environmental impact.
