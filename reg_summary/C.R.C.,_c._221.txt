This regulation establishes turkey marketing levies in Ontario, requiring producers to pay $0.05 per pound live weight on turkeys sold beyond their market allotment, with buyers required to deduct and remit these levies to the Ontario Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board. Producers must also pay any unpaid levies by the 15th day of the following month.
