This regulation establishes mandatory reporting requirements for air carriers in Canada, specifying the types of financial, operational, and passenger-related data that must be submitted to Transport Canada, including details on flights, passenger itineraries, cargo shipments, and aircraft operations. The information must be provided electronically and varies by carrier type (e.g., level I to IV, foreign carriers, general aviation) based on size, service type, and revenue thresholds.
