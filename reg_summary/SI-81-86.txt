This regulation revokes the previous Canadian Passport Regulations and establishes a new framework for issuing Canadian passports, outlining eligibility, application requirements, identity verification, and grounds for refusal or revocation, including security and legal concerns. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is responsible for administering the rules, which include provisions for electronic processing, biometric data use, and the authority to restrict or revoke passports based on national security, criminal activity, or best interests of minors.
