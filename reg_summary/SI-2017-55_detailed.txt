---

**1. Legal Authority and Background**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S. c. F-11)**. The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) determines that it is in the **public interest** to provide a remission (i.e., waiver or reduction) of certain fees associated with the processing of temporary resident visa applications for individuals participating in the **2017 Invictus Games**.

The Invictus Games, a global sporting event for wounded, injured, and sick service members and veterans, was held in Toronto in 2017. Given the significance of the event and its focus on rehabilitation, inclusion, and national pride, the Government of Canada recognized the need to facilitate access for participants and their related personnel without financial barriers.

  participating in the 2017 Invictus Games.
