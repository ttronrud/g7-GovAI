This regulation grants the Ontario Onion Growers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of onions produced in Ontario, allowing it to exercise the same powers it has for local marketing under Ontario’s Farm Products Marketing Act. The Order enables the Board to manage onion marketing beyond provincial borders, including enforcing regulations related to pricing, quality, and distribution.
