The Governor General in Council has revoked previous regulations on the protection of securities for trust and loan companies and replaced them with the Protection of Assets (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations, which establish comprehensive requirements for the secure handling, recording, and insurance of company assets. These regulations mandate written procedures for asset safeguarding, secure custody of securities, daily deposit of transaction proceeds, registration of securities, and mandatory insurance against loss due to fraud, theft, or damage.
