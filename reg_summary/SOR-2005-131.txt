These regulations establish a compensation program under the Plant Protection Act to reimburse farmers for losses incurred due to the presence of plum pox virus, covering costs related to tree removal, soil preparation, and replacement with tested or certified trees, with specific eligibility and application requirements. Compensation is limited to certain types of trees and cannot be claimed if already received under other programs or insurance.
