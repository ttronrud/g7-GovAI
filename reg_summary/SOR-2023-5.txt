This regulation replaces the old New Brunswick Translated Documents Regulations with updated rules governing the status and admissibility of translations made by Official Translators in criminal proceedings. It establishes that translations certified by an Official Translator are admissible in evidence and carry the same weight as the original document, with specific procedures for challenging translations in court.
