These regulations implement a framework for verifying the origin of goods exported from Canada to EFTA states, allowing customs authorities to conduct verification visits, review questionnaires or letters, or use other information to confirm eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement. The regulations came into force on July 1, 2009, following an amendment to the Customs Act and a public announcement.
