The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, revoked two previous regulations on security interests and introduced the Registration of Bank Special Security Regulations, effective June 1, 1992, to establish a standardized system for registering security interests in banks, including notices of intention and certificates of release, with specific procedures, fees, and annual reporting requirements. These regulations replace older rules and provide a clear framework for the registration, cancellation, and management of security interests under the Bank Act.
