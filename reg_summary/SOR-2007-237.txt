These Ontario Fishery Regulations, 2007, establish rules for sport fishing, including restrictions on gear, species, size limits, and catch quotas, and prohibit fishing with certain methods like snaggers or spears in most areas. They also define prohibited activities, require the release of prohibited fish, and set conditions for licences, including special provisions for invasive species, specially protected fish, and specific lakes like Lake Nipigon.
