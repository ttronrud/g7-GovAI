The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2015-94" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 94 of 2015 has been formally repealed.

However, without the full title or subject matter of the original regulation (which would normally be included in the reference), a detailed summary cannot be provided. Statutory instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation introduced under the authority of an Act of Parliament, and SI/2015-94 would have been a piece of such legislation.

In this case, the notation "Repealed, SI/2015-94" means that:

1. **The regulation was formally repealed** — it is no longer in force.
2. **The repeal was enacted by another statutory instrument or legislation** — typically, a later SI or an amendment to an enabling Act.
3. **The repeal date is likely 2015**, as the SI was issued in that year.
4. **The original regulation may have addressed a specific area of law**, such as environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, or administrative procedures — but without the full title or content, the precise subject remains unknown.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
- The full title of SI/2015-94 (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2015").
- The enabling Act under which it was made.
- The key provisions or objectives of the original regulation.
- The reason for its repeal.

For example, if SI/2015-94 had been the *Regulation of Agricultural Machinery Safety 2015*, a detailed summary might include:
- Requirements for safety inspections.
- Provisions for manufacturer certification.
- Compliance timelines for existing machinery.
- Penalties for non-compliance.

But in the absence of such details, the only accurate summary is:

> **Summary**: SI/2015-94 has been repealed and is no longer in force. The repeal signifies that the regulation was formally withdrawn by a subsequent legislative or administrative action. The specific subject matter, provisions, and reasons for repeal are not available without the full title and content of the original instrument. For a detailed understanding, access to the original regulation or the repeal instrument (e.g., SI/2016-123) is required.

If you can provide the full title or context of SI/2015-94 (e.g., from a government database or legal document), I can offer a more precise and detailed summary.
