The Indian Oil and Gas Regulations, made under the Indian Oil and Gas Act, establish rules for the exploration, development, and management of oil and gas on First Nation lands, including definitions of key terms, environmental and safety requirements, reporting obligations, contract terms, and provisions for Indigenous consultation and participation. These regulations ensure accountability, transparency, and environmental protection while balancing the rights of First Nations and contract holders.
