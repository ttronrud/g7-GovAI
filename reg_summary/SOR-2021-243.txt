The Canadian Transportation Agency has established the Accessible Transportation Planning and Reporting Regulations under the Accessible Canada Act, requiring regulated transport entities to develop, publish, and maintain accessibility plans and progress reports tailored to their size (based on average number of employees), ensure accessibility in both digital and print formats, and provide timely access to these documents in various formats for persons with disabilities. The regulations also mandate public feedback mechanisms, clear communication of processes, and periodic reporting with specific deadlines based on entity class.
