These regulations govern the interprovincial and export marketing of Prince Edward Island turnips, restricting sales to the Prince Edward Island Vegetable Growers Cooperative Association (Agency) and requiring all marketing activities to follow strict rules on packaging, transportation, and distribution. The Agency controls the sale and distribution of vegetable, collects fees from growers, and ensures compliance with quality, labeling, and permit requirements through oversight by the Commodity Board.
