These regulations establish the procedure for calculating and transferring Nova Scotia's share of offshore sales tax collected by Nova Scotia on behalf of Canada, with calculations required within five working days of enactment and on the first and fifteenth of each month thereafter, and provide for adjustments, overpayments, and underpayments to be recovered or paid accordingly. The regulations are made under the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act and apply to tax payments related to offshore oil and gas sales.
