This regulation grants a tax remission to Indigenous individuals for taxation years between 1982 and 1992, reducing their income tax, interest, and penalties by the amount attributable to income from reserve-based employment, certain pension or retiring allowances, and training allowances received while residing on a reserve. The remission applies to income that would otherwise be taxable but is deemed reasonably attributable to reserve duties or services.
