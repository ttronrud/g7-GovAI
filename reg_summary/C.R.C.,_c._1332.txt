These Regulations establish the procedures for public servants in Canada to report inventions to the appropriate Minister, including the required forms and information to determine whether the invention is vested in Her Majesty. They also outline the process for ministerial determinations, patent filings, appeals, and the rights of inventors—both public servants and non-public servants—regarding patent ownership and priority.
