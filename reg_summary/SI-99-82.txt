This regulation grants Telesat Canada a tax remission for the 1996 and subsequent taxation years, equal to the difference between the actual tax owed and the tax that would have been owed if a specific interpretation of the Income Tax Act had applied to the disposition of its Anik E1 satellite and the acquisition of replacement property. The remission is subject to conditions requiring Telesat to treat the replacement property in a particular way for tax purposes, including not claiming a cost deduction unless allowed under the specified interpretation of the Act.
