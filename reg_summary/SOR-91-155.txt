This regulation establishes new national emission standards for lead particulate matter released into ambient air by secondary lead smelters, setting limits of 0.046 grams per normal cubic metre for blast furnaces and reverberatory furnaces, and 0.023 grams per normal cubic metre for other operations, with additional provisions for lead content and temporary exceedances during equipment malfunctions. It replaces previous regulations and includes requirements for regular reporting, sampling, and compliance monitoring.
