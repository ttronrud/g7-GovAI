This regulation establishes the Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC) agency by proclamation, authorizing it to manage the marketing of chicken in interprovincial and export trade where no existing federal regulation applies. The agency is empowered to implement a quota system, set marketing rules, impose levies, license marketers, and prevent predatory pricing, all while coordinating with provincial commodity boards to ensure fair and orderly trade.
