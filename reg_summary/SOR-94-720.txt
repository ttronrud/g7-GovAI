This regulation repeals the Quebec Milk Order 1989 and replaces it with a new order granting the Régie des marchés agricoles et alimentaires du Québec and the Fédération des producteurs de lait du Québec authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of milk produced in Quebec, subject to specific conditions and exclusions. It allows these bodies to exercise powers similar to those used for local milk marketing, including setting levies and charges on milk producers, with funds used for reserves, expenses, and producer equalization.
