These regulations establish a $0.50 per hog service charge payable by producers and small processors to the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission for interprovincial and export hog trade, with the charge deducted from payments to producers and remitted monthly, except in specific exempt cases such as hogs for personal consumption, breeding stock, or sales to designated research processors. The regulations apply only to hogs marketed outside Saskatchewan or exported, and exclude certain types of hog sales and specific exemptions.
