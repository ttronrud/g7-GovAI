The Canadian government has enacted the Clean Fuel Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to reduce air pollution from liquid fossil fuels by setting carbon intensity standards for fuels, promoting the use of low-carbon-intensity alternatives like renewable natural gas, biofuels, and hydrogen, and establishing a compliance system to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time. These regulations require fuel producers and importers to meet specific carbon intensity limits and participate in a compliance-credit transfer system to achieve emissions reductions.
