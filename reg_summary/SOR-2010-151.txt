This regulation implements a new harmonized value-added tax (HST) system in Canada, establishing specific rules for provincial investment plans and stratified investment plans, including how tax is calculated on imported taxable supplies and internal/external charges based on the location of consumption or use of property or services. It also defines key terms, adjusts tax rates for certain provinces, and provides exemptions or reduced rates for specific transactions involving vehicles or specified items.
