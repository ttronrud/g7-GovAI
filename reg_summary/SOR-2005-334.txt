This regulation establishes priority appointment rights for various groups of public service employees, including those released from the Canadian Forces or RCMP due to medical reasons, employees with disabilities, spouses or common-law partners of deceased employees, and those on leave due to spouse relocation, ensuring they are given priority in hiring when they meet essential qualifications. It also excludes certain appointments—such as acting appointments and incumbent-based processes—from standard priority rules and includes specific entitlement periods tied to eligibility and return-to-work certifications.
