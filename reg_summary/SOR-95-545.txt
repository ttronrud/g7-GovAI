These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Fort Resolution Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations by limiting the height of any structures or natural growth near the airport. Specifically, no building or object may exceed the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria based on the airport’s reference point and runway layout.
