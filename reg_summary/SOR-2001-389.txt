This regulation establishes the framework for financial leasing entities in Canada, defining their activities, restrictions, and financial requirements, including rules on residual value, return on investment, and prohibited practices such as leasing personal household property or vehicles below a certain weight. It ensures that financial lease agreements provide a reasonable return to the entity and include warranties from manufacturers, while limiting the total estimated residual value of leased assets to 10% of their acquisition cost.
