This regulation revokes the previous lease and licence of occupation rules for national parks and introduces new rules governing leases and licences of public lands within national parks, particularly focusing on residency, business use, and occupancy restrictions. It establishes eligibility criteria for residents, sets rental rates based on appraised value, and includes provisions for quotas, renewal limits, and requirements for residency and occupancy to ensure public land use aligns with conservation and community interests.
