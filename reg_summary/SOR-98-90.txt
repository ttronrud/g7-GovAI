This regulation grants customs duty remissions to Canadian manufacturers of outerwear fabrics for imports used in producing outerwear apparel, with remission rates decreasing over time (full remission initially, then 75%, 50%, and 25%), and subject to specific eligibility and claim deadlines. The order applies to imports between 1998 and 2012, with a cap on total remitted duties based on 1995 levels and requires claims to be filed within three years of import.
