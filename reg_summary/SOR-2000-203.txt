This regulation establishes radiation protection standards under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, setting dose limits, defining key terms, and outlining requirements for monitoring, record-keeping, and worker notification, particularly for nuclear energy workers and pregnant or breastfeeding individuals. It mandates that licensees implement radiation protection programs, maintain dose records, and take action when dose limits are approached or exceeded, while exempting certain medical exposures and emergency responses.
