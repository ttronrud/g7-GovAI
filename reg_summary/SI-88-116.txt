This regulation amends a previous Order in Council by removing an outdated paragraph and designating the Minister of Western Economic Diversification as the responsible minister for grant, contribution, loan, and guarantee programs in Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan—specifically for projects with eligible capital costs not exceeding twenty million dollars—except as provided in section 3 of the Industrial and Regional Development Act.
