This regulation discontinues the requirement for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Parks Canada to prepare and submit annual operational reports to Parliament, as these reports contain no additional information beyond what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates. The decision was made under section 157a of the Financial Administration Act, based on the determination that the reports provide redundant or insufficient information.
