The Government of Canada has referred the status assessment of the Striped Bass (St. Lawrence River population) back to COSEWIC for further review, as the existing classification—particularly regarding the distinction between the historic population and stocked fish—requires clarification. This referral follows COSEWIC’s determination that the currently present fish in the St. Lawrence River are not part of the original population, and thus, a more comprehensive assessment is needed before any final listing decision can be made under the Species at Risk Act.
