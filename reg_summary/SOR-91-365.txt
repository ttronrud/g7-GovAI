The Minister of Agriculture revoked the previous Race Track Supervision Regulations and introduced new regulations to govern pari-mutuel betting at racecourses, including rules on betting systems, pool calculations, and the prohibition and regulation of drug use by horses and personnel. These regulations require associations to obtain a permit, operate with approved systems and facilities, and meet specific conditions related to licensing, revenue sharing, and public reporting.
