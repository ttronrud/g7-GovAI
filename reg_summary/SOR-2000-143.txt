These regulations establish the rights of public servants who cease employment with a "withdrawing employer" — an entity removed from the public service superannuation schedule — including entitlements to death benefits, survivor allowances, and pensionable service credits, and clarify key definitions and application dates. They come into force upon registration and apply only to individuals who are employed by the withdrawing employer on the day the order is made, with specific provisions for children born or adopted during the period of withdrawal.
