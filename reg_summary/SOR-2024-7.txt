This regulation exempts certain Canadian government personnel, including members of the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces, and approved contractors from restrictions on jammer use for purposes such as national security, defence, and public safety, provided they meet strict conditions including training, documentation, and minimization of radio interference. The exemption is limited in scope and expires five years after coming into force.
