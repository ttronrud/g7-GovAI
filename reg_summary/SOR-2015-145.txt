The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission issued the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015, to establish safety standards for the packaging and transport of nuclear substances, aligning with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines while exempting certain low-activity or medically relevant materials from regulation. These regulations apply to the design, use, and transport of packaging and nuclear substances, with specific requirements for reporting and characterization when radiation alarms are triggered during transport.
