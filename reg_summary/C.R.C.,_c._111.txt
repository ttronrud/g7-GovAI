The St. Hubert Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions on land surrounding St. Hubert Airport, prohibiting any structure or object from exceeding the elevation of designated surfaces—such as approach, transitional, and outer surfaces—designed to ensure aviation safety. The regulations define specific land boundaries and apply to all parcels adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, with natural growth exceeding these limits subject to removal by the Minister.
