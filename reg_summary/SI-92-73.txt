This regulation withdraws specified lands in the Yukon Territory from disposal, including all mineral and forest resources, for a period ending December 31, 1993, to facilitate native land claims settlement, while preserving existing mineral claims, oil and gas rights, and surface rights. The withdrawal applies to lands marked as "RURAL LANDS" and "AREAS FOR SITE SPECIFIC SELECTIONS" on approved maps, except for tracts already leased or subject to sale agreements.
