This regulation establishes the rules for determining the origin of goods eligible for preferential tariffs under Canada’s trade agreements, specifying that goods originate in a beneficiary country, beneficiary-plus country, or least developed country based on production, material content, and processing requirements, with specific thresholds (40% or 80% value of non-originating materials) and conditions for maintaining origin status during transport. The rules apply to certain tariff items and come into force on January 1, 2025, replacing previous regulations.
