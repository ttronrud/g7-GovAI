This regulation establishes rules for aircraft access in Canadian national parks, prohibiting take-offs and landings in most parks unless a permit is held, with specific exceptions for emergencies, recreational use, or official park management activities. Permits are issued by the park superintendent after evaluating safety, environmental impact, and visitor enjoyment, and are subject to conditions and possible suspension or revocation.
