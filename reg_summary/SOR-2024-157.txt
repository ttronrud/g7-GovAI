These regulations establish rules for qualifying residential units and taxable supplies of residential complexes in Canada, particularly focusing on renovations and conversions, and provide specific rebate amounts based on location, timing of construction or renovation, and unit floor space. The rebates are calculated as a percentage of the total tax payable, with decreasing percentages over time (e.g., 100% down to 30%) depending on when the renovation or conversion is completed, and are available only if certain conditions related to unit standards and use as a residential complex are met.
