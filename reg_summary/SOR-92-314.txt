These regulations allow cooperative credit associations to permit their subsidiaries, specifically those that are regulated securities entities, to hold shares of the association, with the aggregate value of such shares not exceeding 1% of the association's regulatory capital, except when the subsidiary is acting as a securities underwriter in a share distribution, in which case the limit is temporarily lifted until the distribution ends. The regulations were made under section 463(h) of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act and came into force on June 1, 1992.
