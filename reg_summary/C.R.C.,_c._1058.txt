The Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations establish detailed accounting requirements for oil pipeline companies, including definitions of key accounting terms, mandatory record-keeping, and specific rules for capitalizing costs related to plant acquisition, construction, and additions. These regulations apply to companies authorized by the Commission to construct or operate oil pipelines, with distinct requirements for Group 1 and Group 2 companies, and emphasize transparency, accuracy, and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.
