These regulations, enacted on June 1, 1992, define the scope of banking activities related to insurance in Canada, limiting banks to administering specific "authorized types" of insurance (such as credit-related, travel, or life insurance) and personal accident insurance, while restricting promotion and sharing of customer information with insurance companies, agents, or brokers. They also prohibit banks from promoting non-authorized insurance products or providing access to promotional content for non-authorized insurers, with exceptions for general advice and certain group policies.
