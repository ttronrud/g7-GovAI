These regulations define which banks and bank holding companies are considered "distributing banks" or "distributing bank holding companies" under the Bank Act, primarily based on whether they are reporting issuers under Canadian or foreign securities legislation or have participated in certain corporate transactions involving such entities. The regulations come into force upon registration and reference specific definitions of "reporting issuer" under various provincial and federal securities acts.
