This regulation excludes a portion of the critical habitat of the endangered Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Inner Bay of Fundy population—specifically within Fundy National Park—from the official designation under the Species at Risk Act, as required by law and following consultation between the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and the Environment. The Order comes into force upon registration and applies to the species' critical habitat, excluding the area in Fundy National Park as specified in the Canada National Parks Act.
