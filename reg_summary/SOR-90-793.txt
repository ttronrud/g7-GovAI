This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Arviat Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all of which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria based on the airport's reference point. The regulations apply to lands adjacent to or near the airport and are designed to ensure safe aircraft operations by maintaining clear airspace and visual approach zones.
