The National Energy Board issued regulations requiring companies operating hydrocarbon processing plants to ensure safe, environmentally responsible design, construction, operation, and abandonment of such facilities, including mandatory safety programs, risk assessments, employee training, emergency preparedness, and reporting of incidents or hazards. These regulations apply to processing plants within the scope of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act but exclude well-site and field facilities.
