The Governor in Council revoked previous asbestos emission standards and introduced new regulations limiting asbestos fibre releases from mines and mills to two fibres per normal cubic centimetre of air, with specific measurement requirements and temporary exceptions for equipment malfunctions. These regulations establish strict monitoring, reporting, and compliance procedures for asbestos mining and milling operations.
