The Governor General in Council, based on recommendations from the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, remitted certain fee adjustments for passport and travel document services during the period from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2023, because the collection of those amounts was deemed unreasonable. This decision is made under specific provisions of the Financial Administration Act and the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations.
