This regulation establishes the prescribed percentages used to calculate automobile operating expense benefits for individuals employed by or as shareholders in registrants, based on the individual’s location and the registrant’s business size, with varying rates depending on province of residence or employment and whether the registrant is classified as a "large business." The rates are adjusted annually, with lower percentages applied to large businesses and specific changes introduced for certain provinces and years.
