This regulation grants remission of overpayments from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit to individuals who would have been eligible if their self-employment income had been counted, and who filed income tax returns for 2019 and 2020 by December 31, 2022. Remission is only granted if the individual makes a written claim to the Minister of Employment and Social Development, and the order comes into force on the date it is made.
