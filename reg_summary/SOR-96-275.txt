These regulations allow a cooperative credit association to enter into specific transactions—such as issuing conversion rights, purchasing or redeeming shares or debt obligations, or making payments related to capital reduction—with a related party, provided such transactions are not otherwise permitted under the association’s terms and conditions. The regulations are made under section 424 of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act and are intended to ensure transparency and fairness in dealings with related parties.
