These regulations establish a method for calculating American consumption of softwood lumber based on Canadian exports, U.S. imports from non-Canadian sources, and net U.S. shipments, using data from Statistics Canada, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Western Wood Products Association. They define key metrics such as expected monthly consumption, market shares, and consumption adjustments for the purposes of the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006.
