These regulations set safety limits for lead and cadmium release in glazed ceramics and glassware used for food storage, preparation, or serving, requiring products to meet specific migratable limits based on their type and design, with special provisions for drinking vessels with decorative patterns near the rim. Products not intended for food may exceed these limits if they have clear design features or display a permanent warning stating they contain lead or cadmium and should not be used for food.
