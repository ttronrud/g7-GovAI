This regulation grants a tax remission to residents of India for royalties or fees received from Canada after December 12, 1988, by reducing the amount of income tax, interest, and penalties owed by the amount that would have been saved if the 30% tax rate in the Canada-India tax agreement had been interpreted as 20%. The order is known as the Residents of India Remission Order.
