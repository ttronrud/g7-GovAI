This regulation establishes General Import Permit No. 2, allowing individuals to import chickens or small quantities of poultry (up to 9 kg per shipment) for personal use or household consumption, with specific conditions and customs form endorsements required. The permit was later revoked by Statutory Instrument SI/83-181.
