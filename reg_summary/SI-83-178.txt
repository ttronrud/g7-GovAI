This regulation grants remission of customs duties and a portion of the sales tax on official airline guide catalogues imported by Professional Courier Limited after June 1, 1983, under specific conditions and time limits. The sales tax remission is calculated based on the difference between the tax owed and what would be owed if the reduced customs duty value were used.
