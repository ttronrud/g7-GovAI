The Federal Child Support Guidelines, established under the Divorce Act, provide a fair, objective, and consistent framework for determining child support amounts based on both spouses’ incomes and the number of children, aiming to ensure children receive stable financial support while reducing disputes and promoting efficient court proceedings. The guidelines apply to various types of child support orders, include provisions for shared parenting, extraordinary expenses, and undue hardship exceptions, and require courts to consider specific factors such as parenting time, income, and the best interests of the child.
