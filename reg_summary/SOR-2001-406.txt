These regulations set limits on trust and loan companies' investments in designated entities, prohibiting acquisitions or loans that would cause the total value of investments—excluding certain exceptions—to exceed 50% of the company’s regulatory capital, with specific rules for control and risk exposure. The regulations came into force on the date section 459 of the Trust and Loan Companies Act was enacted.
