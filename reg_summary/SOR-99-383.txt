The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation exempts interest on deposits from insurance coverage under specific conditions, with interest determined either by an index as per the Interest Payable on Certain Deposits By-law or by the deposit contract terms, while adjusting the interest termination or maturity date to the payment date. This by-law came into force on October 15, 1999.
