This regulation establishes a remission of overpayments for certain Canada Pension Plan disability pensions, post-retirement disability benefits, and related benefits when a determination is made after January 1, 2021, that the pension ceased to be payable, and specific procedural delays and lack of timely notification occurred. It also provides remission for retirement pension overpayments resulting from the erroneous continuation of disability pension payments.
