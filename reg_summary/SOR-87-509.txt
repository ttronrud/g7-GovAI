This regulation revokes the previous Manitoba Fishery Regulations and introduces new rules for managing recreational and commercial fishing in the province, setting limits on fish size, possession, and catch quotas, specifying permitted gear and methods, and outlining licensing requirements, including provisions for Indigenous fishing rights and the proper handling and release of fish. It also establishes procedures for varying fishing restrictions and requires fishers to carry and produce their licences upon request.
