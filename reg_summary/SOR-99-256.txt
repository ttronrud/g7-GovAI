This regulation establishes definitions and requirements under the Canada Cooperatives Act, including criteria for what constitutes a "distributing cooperative," rules on the use of cooperative names (including prohibitions on confusing, deceptively misdescriptive, or inappropriate names), and provisions for electronic document delivery, record retention periods, and voting rights thresholds. It also outlines specific conditions under which certain name conflicts or similarities do not prohibit a cooperative name from being used.
