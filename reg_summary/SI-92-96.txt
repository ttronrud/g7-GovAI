This regulation grants a remission of income tax, interest, and penalties for Saskatchewan Liquor Board employees who received strike pay during the 1979 strike, as those amounts were improperly included in their taxable income. The remission applies to members of the Saskatchewan Government Employees’ Union who did not object to the tax assessment.
