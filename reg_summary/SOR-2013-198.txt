This regulation establishes safety standards for motor vehicle tires in Canada, requiring specific compliance with technical standards (TSD 109, 119, and 139) based on tire type, load, and use. It mandates clear labeling, including a permanent tire identification number with manufacturing date and size information, and requires manufacturers and importers to maintain records and provide safety information to consumers.
