The Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador — Court of Appeal adopted the Criminal Appeal Rules (2002) to govern the filing, service, and procedure of criminal appeals, including deadlines for notices of appeal, requirements for transcripts, rules on prisoner appeals, and procedures for extensions, interventions, and the handling of trial records. These rules apply to appeals under the Criminal Code and ensure consistency in appeal processes while allowing flexibility for special circumstances.
