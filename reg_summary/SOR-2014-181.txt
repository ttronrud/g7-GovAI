This regulation establishes a limited right to equitable remuneration for certain countries under the Rome Convention or WPPT, specifying which performances or communications of sound recordings are covered, and excludes certain types of uses—such as non-commercial broadcasts, background music, or specific internet transmissions—depending on the country of origin. It also provides special provisions for Hong Kong and Macao, where rights are granted to both performers and makers, while excluding other countries like China, Barbados, and Vietnam from certain remuneration rights.
