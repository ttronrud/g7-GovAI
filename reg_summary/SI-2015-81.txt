The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick adopted updated Criminal Procedure Rules to standardize and streamline the handling of criminal proceedings, emphasizing fairness, efficiency, and access to justice by setting clear guidelines for filings, service, notices, briefs, hearings, and pre-trial conferences. These rules apply to all criminal cases within the court’s jurisdiction and are designed to ensure timely, uniform, and just outcomes while allowing flexibility where necessary in the interests of justice.
