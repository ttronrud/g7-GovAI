This regulation revokes an old order and establishes a new one that grants a fee remission for applications for a certificate of citizenship when the applicant is a minor or a citizen aged 18 or older who has been invited by a club or organization to participate in a citizenship promotion ceremony. The remission applies under section 32 of the Citizenship Regulations.
