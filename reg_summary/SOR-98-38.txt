This regulation exempts imported goods temporarily diverted or consumed in response to emergencies—such as medical emergencies, fires, floods, or other disasters—from the application of a customs tariff provision that would otherwise require them to be re-exported or subject to duties. The exemption applies for the duration of the emergency response and comes into force on January 1, 1998.
