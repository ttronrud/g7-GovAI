These regulations set limits on cigarette ignition propensity, requiring all cigarettes (except biddis, cigars, little cigars, or kreteks) to burn their full length no more than 25% of the time when tested under ISO 12863 standards, with the rules coming into force 180 days after registration. The regulations do not apply to cigarettes imported for research or laboratory testing.
