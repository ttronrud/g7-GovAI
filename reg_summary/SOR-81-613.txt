These regulations establish strict rules for the protection of wildlife and domestic animals within Canada’s National Historic Parks, prohibiting hunting, feeding, or disturbing wildlife, restricting firearm use, and regulating the keeping of domestic animals to prevent nuisances or harm to people, wildlife, or the environment. The Superintendent may issue permits for scientific purposes or wildlife management and has authority to remove or impound animals that violate the rules.
