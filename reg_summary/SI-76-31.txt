This regulation establishes a framework for compensatory payments to for-hire highway transportation companies, non-federally regulated railway companies, and water transportation companies that suffered revenue losses due to the rail rate freeze in 1973 and 1974. Companies must file claims within specific timeframes providing detailed information about affected shipments, and the Canadian Transport Commission determines compensation based on audited claims, with total payments capped at $10 million for highway companies and $3 million for rail and water transport companies.
