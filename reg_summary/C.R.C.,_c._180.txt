The Ontario Chicken Order establishes the regulatory framework for the marketing of chickens in Ontario, authorizing both the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Chicken Producers’ Marketing Board to regulate interprovincial and export trade, with powers equivalent to those they hold for local marketing. This includes oversight of marketing plans and activities involving chickens produced in Ontario and under six months of age.
