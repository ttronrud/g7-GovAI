This regulation designates the Îles de l’Estuaire as a National Wildlife Area in Quebec, assigning administrative responsibility to the Minister of the Environment for wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation, and amends relevant land schedules to reflect these changes. The area includes specific islands and parcels in the St. Lawrence River, with certain exclusions for navigational or private uses.
