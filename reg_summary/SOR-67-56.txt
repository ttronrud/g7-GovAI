These regulations transfer the Sydney Pilots’ Pension Fund and its assets to the Public Service Superannuation Act, ensuring pensions for pilots who ceased employment before October 1, 1966, are paid from the Superannuation Account under terms equivalent to those in the old by-law. Pilots employed on or after that date are deemed contributors under the Act, with their prior service credited under specific calculation rules based on contributions, salary, and interest.
