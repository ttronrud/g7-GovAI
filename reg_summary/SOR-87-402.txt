This regulation revokes the previous Government Contracts Regulations and introduces new rules governing the procurement process for federal government contracts, including requirements for bid and contract security, transparency in bidding, and prohibitions on bribery and improper payments. It applies to most goods, service, and construction contracts but excludes certain types, such as those involving legal services or national security, and includes strict conditions for when bids may be solicited or waived.
