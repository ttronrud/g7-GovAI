The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources revoked the 1986 Airborne Remote Sensing Services Fees Order and replaced it with a new 1989 order that establishes specific fees and charges for airborne remote sensing services, such as data processing, product registration, and film or tape production, based on output metrics and service type. This Order, which may be cited as the *Airborne Remote Sensing Services Fees Order, 1989*, sets detailed payment rates per unit of output or service provided.
