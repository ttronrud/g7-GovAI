These regulations establish the standards for collecting, analyzing, storing, and destroying samples of bodily substances—such as breath, urine, blood, hair, and saliva—required by offenders under specific court orders, including probation, conditional sentences, or recognizance conditions. Only qualified medical practitioners or technicians may collect blood samples, and all samples must be destroyed within one year of collection, with strict requirements for equipment and containers.
