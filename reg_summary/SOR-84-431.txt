This regulation revokes the 1982 Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Regulations and replaces them with updated rules to determine the Canadian ownership rate and control status of entities, effective June 1, 1984. It establishes definitions for key terms such as "measured block," "equity-related persons," and "formal equity," and outlines specific criteria for calculating ownership, including thresholds, exclusions, and the treatment of units, partnerships, and forward equities.
