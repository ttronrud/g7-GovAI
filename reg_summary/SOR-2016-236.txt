This regulation establishes levies on the sale and importation of beef cattle and beef products in Canada, requiring sellers, purchasers, and importers to pay specific fees based on the type and quantity of cattle or products involved, with funds going to the Canadian Beef Cattle Research, Market Development and Promotion Agency to support research and promotion. The levies are collected through designated provincial collectors, and all parties must maintain records for seven years, with the order set to expire on June 30, 2026.
