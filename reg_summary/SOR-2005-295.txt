The Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area Regulations designate specific zones within Gilbert Bay to protect marine habitats by prohibiting disturbances to living marine organisms and their habitats, while allowing limited fishing, infrastructure maintenance, and approved scientific or educational activities. These regulations come into force upon registration and require advance approval for scientific or educational activities that do not pose a risk to the area’s ecological integrity.
