This regulation establishes safety standards for the loading, carrying, and unloading of cargo, including bulk and dangerous goods, on vessels in Canadian waters, based on international maritime conventions such as SOLAS and the IMDG Code. It mandates clear marking of heavy packages, specific handling procedures for incompatible or hazardous materials, and compliance with international codes for vessel stability, cargo stowage, and safety, particularly for solid bulk cargoes and vessels with certain structural designs.
