This regulation establishes the Spence Bay Airport Zoning Regulations, setting height restrictions for all structures near the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, with limits defined by approach, transitional, and outer surfaces based on specific geometric and elevation criteria. No building or structure may exceed the height of these defined surfaces, which are anchored to the airport reference point at 16.5 meters above sea level.
