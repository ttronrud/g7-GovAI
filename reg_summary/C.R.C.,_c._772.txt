This regulation grants tax remission to employees or their legal representatives who receive a settlement due to the termination of employment, reducing their income tax liability by the amount by which the tax they would have paid without the settlement exceeds the tax they would have paid if the settlement had not been received, plus the tax on the salary or pension that was lost, minus any taxes already paid on those amounts, and including any applicable interest. The remission applies to the widow or child of an employee as circumstances require.
