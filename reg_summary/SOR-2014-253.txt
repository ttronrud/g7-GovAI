The Public Service Commission issued regulations allowing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to appoint casual workers for more than 90 days in a year for major investigations, major events, or operations due to unforeseen circumstances. These regulations came into force on November 28, 2014, when sections 59 and 60 of the Enhancing Royal Canadian Mounted Police Accountability Act were enacted.
