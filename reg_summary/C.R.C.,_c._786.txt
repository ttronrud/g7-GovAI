This regulation grants tax remission for imported samples of goods of negligible value, provided they are used solely to solicit orders, consist of no more than one sample per kind or quality, and are supplied directly from abroad. A sample is deemed of negligible value if the applicable taxes and duties would not exceed two dollars.
