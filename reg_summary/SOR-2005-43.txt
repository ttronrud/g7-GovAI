These regulations establish the framework for sex offender registration in Yukon under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, designating the Yukon Sex Offender Information Registration Centre (YSOIRC) as a central registration point and authorizing RCMP members and certain RCMP employees to collect and register information. The regulations come into force upon registration and apply to all sex offenders residing in Yukon, who may notify the YSOIRC by telephone.
