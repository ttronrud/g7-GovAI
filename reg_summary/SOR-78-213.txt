This regulation revokes the old National Parks General Regulations and establishes new rules for the control and management of national parks in Canada, outlining restrictions on activities such as camping, firewood use, watercraft mooring, entry into caves, removal of flora or natural objects, pollution of watercourses, and public behavior. It grants the superintendent authority to designate restricted areas, issue permits, and enforce compliance to protect natural and cultural resources while allowing limited activities under specific conditions.
