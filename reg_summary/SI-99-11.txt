This regulation establishes that the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Grenada enters into force on February 1, 1999, allowing citizens of both countries to access social security benefits (such as pensions, invalidity benefits, and survivors’ benefits) under the other country’s legislation, with creditable periods and residency rules applied in a reciprocal manner. It ensures that benefits are not reduced or denied solely due to residence in the other country and provides for coordination between the competent authorities to determine eligibility and calculate benefit amounts.
