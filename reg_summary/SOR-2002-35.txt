This regulation establishes a system of marketing levies on chicken produced and marketed in interprovincial or export trade, with different rates by province, and imposes additional levies on producers and processors who exceed their federal quotas or market chicken outside specified conditions. The levies are collected by processors or dealers and remitted to Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC) or provincial Commodity Boards, with provisions for dispute and assessment.
