This regulation grants a tax remission to certain First Nations in Manitoba for taxes, interest, penalties, and related costs associated with the supply of qualifying land, cancellation of third-party interests, or acquisition of tangible personal property on such land, under specific agreements and conditions. The remission is only available if the taxes or penalties have not previously been refunded and must be claimed in writing within two years of the tax payment or the Order’s coming into force.
