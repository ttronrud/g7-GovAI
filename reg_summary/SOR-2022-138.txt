The Governor in Council has enacted the Single-use Plastics Prohibition Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, banning the manufacture, import, and sale of certain single-use plastic items, including checkout bags, cutlery, foodservice ware, straws, and stir sticks, with limited exemptions for commercial use and in-transit or export-related items. The regulations establish specific definitions, compliance requirements, record-keeping obligations, and phased implementation dates.
