This regulation grants customs duty remission for certain goods imported between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002, by reducing the duties paid to the difference between the Most-Favoured-Nation or General Preferential Tariff rates (as of January 1, 2002) and the Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff rate (as if eligible). The remission is subject to a claim being made to the Minister of National Revenue within four years of importation.
