This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States, based on historical export or production volumes, with priority given to applicants who submit export permit applications first. It also sets rules for relinquishing allocations, transfers of export rights, and ensures a minimum 7.5% allocation to remanufacturers in Quebec.
