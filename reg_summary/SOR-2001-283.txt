This regulation establishes the rules for judges in Canada to elect an optional survivor annuity, which provides a portion (30%, 40%, or 50%) of their annuity to a spouse or common-law partner upon their death. The election must be made within one to two years of marriage or cohabitation, and the annuity is calculated based on actuarial assumptions and demographic data, with specific requirements for documentation and proof of relationship.
