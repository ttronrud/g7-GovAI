This regulation establishes the definition and scope of "eligible financial contracts" under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, specifying types of financial agreements—such as derivatives, securities lending, repurchase agreements, and master agreements—that are recognized as eligible for treatment in bankruptcy proceedings. The rules come into force upon the enactment of subsection 91(2) of the Budget Implementation Act, 2007.
