These Regulations establish requirements for textile labelling and advertising in Canada, mandating that all prescribed consumer textile articles display a disclosure label showing the textile fibre content, dealer name and address, and country of origin (if applicable), in clear, prominent, and easily legible form. The label must be applied in a way that is accessible to consumers and withstands normal use, with exemptions for certain items like second-hand goods, mail-order sales, or items sold to institutions, and specific provisions for piece goods, remnant fabrics, and advertising.
