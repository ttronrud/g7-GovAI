The Minister of Public Works and Government Services has established detailed regulations under the Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act to streamline dispute resolution in construction projects, including requirements for proper invoicing, eligibility and duties of adjudicators, procedures for appointing and conducting adjudications, and time limits for resolution. These regulations ensure impartial, efficient, and transparent dispute resolution through a certified adjudicator process, with clear rules on documentation, participation, and decision-making.
