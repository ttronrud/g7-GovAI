This regulation designates certain water control structures, bridges, ferry cables, causeways, and aquaculture facilities as "major works" under the Canadian Navigable Waters Act, requiring environmental and navigational assessments due to their potential to substantially interfere with navigation. The Order comes into force on a specified date, or upon registration if later.
