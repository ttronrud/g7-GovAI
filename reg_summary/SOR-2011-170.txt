The Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal adopted revised Rules of Procedure to govern its proceedings, ensuring informal, expeditious hearings while respecting the rights of parties, incorporating security and confidentiality considerations from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and providing clear procedures for filing, service, disclosure, and evidence. These rules also establish timelines for submissions, allow for motions on procedural or evidentiary matters, and permit hearings to be conducted via electronic means when appropriate.
