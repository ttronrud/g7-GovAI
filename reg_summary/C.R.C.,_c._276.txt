These regulations establish requirements for the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs in Saskatchewan, including record-keeping, inspection rights, and reporting obligations for producers, processors, and assembly yard operators. Small processors and assembly yard operators must submit weekly reports detailing hog purchases, processing, and auction sales to the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission.
