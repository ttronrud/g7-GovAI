This regulation approves the revocation of previous Indian Economic Development Regulations and establishes new terms and conditions under which the Canadian government can guarantee loans to Indigenous individuals, bands, or corporations for economic development purposes. The Minister may guarantee loans only if they support a business enterprise that contributes to Indigenous economic development, meet specific criteria including borrower scrutiny, loan terms, and repayment timelines, and do not exceed aggregate limits of $500,000, with additional approvals required for larger or high-risk loans.
