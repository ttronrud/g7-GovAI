These Regulations, known as the Health of Animals Regulations, establish definitions and standards for the import, handling, and inspection of animals, animal products, and veterinary biologics in Canada, with a focus on ensuring animal health and preventing the spread of diseases. They define key terms such as animal by-product, disease, quarantine, and approved facilities, and outline the roles of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, veterinarians, and various types of animal establishments.
