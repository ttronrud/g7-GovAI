These regulations limit the nicotine concentration in vaping products sold in Canada to 20 mg/mL, as measured by the ISO 20714 standard, and prohibit packaging that displays a nicotine concentration exceeding this limit. The rules apply to all vaping products intended for retail sale, with a temporary exemption allowing retailers to sell products with non-compliant packaging for 15 days after the regulations come into force.
