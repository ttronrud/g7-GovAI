The Vessel Safety Certificates Regulations amend the Navigation Safety Regulations, 2020, by establishing additional safety standards for Canadian vessels that align with and supplement the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), particularly regarding vessel structure, machinery, fire protection, life-saving equipment, and navigation systems. These regulations require vessels to hold applicable safety certificates, undergo regular inspections, maintain records, and comply with specific operational restrictions based on voyage type and environmental conditions.
