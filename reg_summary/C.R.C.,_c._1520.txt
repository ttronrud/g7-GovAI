This regulation establishes the terms under which oil and gas leases can be offered for tender on undisposed Canada lands, specifying three types of lease conditions: a cash bonus, an exploratory work bonus, or a cash bonus plus a drilling commitment. It outlines the requirements for lease grants, including expenditure rules, forfeiture provisions, and conditions for lease cancellation, while ensuring lessees meet eligibility criteria under the Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations.
