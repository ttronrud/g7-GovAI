This regulation proclaims that the Agreement on Social Security between Canada, Jersey, and Guernsey enters into force in Canada on January 1, 1994, establishing reciprocal social security benefits for residents of these territories, including rules for creditable periods, benefit eligibility, and the treatment of periods of residence or employment. It ensures that individuals and their dependants are eligible for benefits in another jurisdiction under the same conditions as if they were residents, without reductions due to residency in a different territory.
