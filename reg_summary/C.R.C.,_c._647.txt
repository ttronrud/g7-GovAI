This regulation establishes the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency to oversee the marketing of turkeys produced in eight Canadian provinces and shipped between them, implementing a quota system to manage supply and prevent price undercutting. The Agency is empowered to set marketing rules, establish pricing protections, impose levies, license marketers, and collaborate with provincial boards to ensure fair trade practices and stable market conditions.
