These regulations exempt certain small manufacturers or producers from paying consumption or sales tax on goods they manufacture or sell, provided their annual sales or production value does not exceed $50,000, or they fall within specific categories such as blacksmiths, opticians, portrait photographers, or those producing custom items by hand without using repetitive machinery. The exemption ends if a manufacturer's sales exceed $50,000 in a calendar year.
