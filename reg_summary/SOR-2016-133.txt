The National Energy Board has established regulations requiring pipeline companies to implement strict damage prevention measures, including timely responses to locate requests, providing written consent with conditions, conducting inspections during ground disturbances, maintaining detailed records, and ensuring public awareness of pipeline safety. These obligations are designed to protect pipelines, ensure public safety, and promote responsible construction and land use activities near pipelines.
