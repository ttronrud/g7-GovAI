This regulation establishes the oath of office for the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, which must be taken before the Clerk or Assistant Clerk of the Privy Council, and includes a specific sworn affirmation of loyalty and duty. The oath of allegiance, prescribed under the Oaths of Allegiance Act, is also required, though both have been repealed by 2014 legislation.
