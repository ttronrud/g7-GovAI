This regulationproclaims that the Supplementary Agreement to the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Austria enters into force on December 1, 1996, amending key provisions related to coverage, benefit calculations, and residency requirements for social security purposes, with certain retroactive effects. It establishes that individuals working in one country are subject only to that country’s legislation, modifies how periods of coverage are counted, and adjusts rules for pension and benefit entitlements, particularly for self-employed persons and those with periods of coverage under both Canadian and Austrian laws.
