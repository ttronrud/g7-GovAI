This regulation exempts the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from certain radiocommunication restrictions for a specific period and geographic area in British Columbia, allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radio communications solely for purposes of security, safety, or international relations. The interference is strictly limited in scope, duration, and geographic area to ensure minimal impact on other radiocommunications.
