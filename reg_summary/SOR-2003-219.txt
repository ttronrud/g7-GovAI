These regulations establish the requirements for commercial carriers and charterers to provide detailed passenger information—such as names, travel documents, reservation details, and itinerary—electronically to Canada’s Customs and Border Services Agency (CBSA) at specific times before a commercial conveyance departs and arrives in Canada. The information must be submitted in a standardized electronic format, with updated or changed details reported promptly if modifications occur after initial submission.
