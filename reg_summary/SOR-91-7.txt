The National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations, effective January 1, 1991, establish a framework for recovering certain costs from pipeline and power line companies based on their size and type of operations. Larger companies (e.g., large oil, gas, or power line companies) are required to pay annual cost recovery charges or administration levies, with provisions for relief if a company's actual costs exceed estimates, and the Board must annually review and adjust these costs based on actual expenditures and operational data.
