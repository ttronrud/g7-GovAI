This regulation revokes the 1994 Air Transportation Tax Order and replaces it with a new order setting specific tax amounts for air travel, effective May 1, 1995. The tax rates differ based on whether the flight is a single segment without stops or returns, the date of travel, and whether a ticket is restricted to such a segment, with lower rates for eligible single-segment trips and higher rates for others or charter agreements.
