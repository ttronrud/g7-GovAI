This regulation establishes a levy system in Saskatchewan requiring turkey producers to pay $0.22 per kilogram of live weight on any turkeys sold beyond their market allotment, with buyers required to deduct and remit these levies to the Commodity Board, or producers to pay unpaid levies by the 15th day of the following month. The levies are collected to support turkey marketing and are administered by the Saskatchewan Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board under the Natural Products Marketing Act.
