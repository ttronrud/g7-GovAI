The Public Service Labour Relations Board establishes rules for the filing, processing, and management of labour relations proceedings under the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, including requirements for initiating documents, timelines, notice provisions, party participation, and certification applications, with specific rules for employee representation, opposition, and hearings. These regulations ensure procedural fairness, transparency, and timely resolution of disputes involving public sector employees and employers.
