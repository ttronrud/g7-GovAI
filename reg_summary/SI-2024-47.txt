This regulation grants rent and fee remissions to the Municipality of Jasper and certain lessees and licence holders in Jasper National Park, primarily in response to the July 2024 wildfires, with varying percentages of rent relief based on cottage habitability and financial impact, and includes provisions for deferral and recovery of deferred payments. The remissions are authorized under the Financial Administration Act and apply to specific lease and occupation agreements for the periods beginning April 1, 2024, and extending through March 31, 2028.
