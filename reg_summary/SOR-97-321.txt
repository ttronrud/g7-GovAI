This regulation grants remission of customs duty on distilled spirits imported in bulk into Canada after July 5, 1997, for bottling in bond, provided the spirits are eligible under U.S., Mexico, or Chile tariffs and are stored in compliant warehouses. The remission is subject to a claim filed within two years of accounting and the submission of required information to the Minister of National Revenue.
