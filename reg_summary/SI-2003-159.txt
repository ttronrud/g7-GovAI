This regulation establishes the formal entry into force of the Canada-Hungary Agreement on Social Security, which enables the mutual recognition and coordination of social security benefits, including pensions and disability benefits, for individuals residing in or working between the two countries. It outlines rules for creditable periods, eligibility, benefit calculations, and cross-border cooperation between Canada and Hungary, ensuring that benefits are not reduced or denied due to residence in the other country.
