These regulations adapt the Employment Equity Act to accommodate the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) by introducing special provisions that protect national security information during compliance audits, tribunals, and document handling. They establish strict controls on the access, review, reproduction, and disclosure of national security information, ensuring that such information is safeguarded while allowing necessary compliance and legal proceedings to proceed.
