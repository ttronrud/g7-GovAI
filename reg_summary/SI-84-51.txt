This regulation grants a partial remission of customs duty and sales tax on laminated glass dinnerware imported on or after January 1, 1988, with the sales tax remission based on the difference between the original tax and what would be due if the customs duty value were reduced by the remitted amount. A claim for remission must be made to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of importation.
