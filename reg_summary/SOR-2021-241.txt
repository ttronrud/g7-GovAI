These regulations implement the Accessible Canada Act by setting out requirements for regulated entities to develop and publish accessibility plans and progress reports, ensure accessibility in digital and physical formats, provide accessible feedback mechanisms, and maintain records for seven years. They also establish exemptions for small entities and bands, define timelines and accessibility standards (including WCAG Level AA), and outline penalties for non-compliance based on violation severity and gravity.
