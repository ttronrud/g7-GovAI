This regulation grants tax remission on goods imported for use in side shows or concessions at fairs, exhibitions, or rodeos, with remission amounts varying based on the type of event and duration, and provides specific conditions for eligibility, including written applications, usage details, and export requirements. The remission is reduced by half if the goods were similar to unavailable local alternatives and are used in Canada for less than two months.
