The London Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions for buildings and structures near London Airport, limiting their elevation to the approach, outer, and transitional surfaces defined by specific geometric measurements and boundaries. These restrictions apply to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, except those officially part of the airport, and prohibit any structure from exceeding the designated surfaces, with the Minister having authority to require removal of naturally growing vegetation that exceeds these limits.
