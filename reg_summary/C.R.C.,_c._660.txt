These regulations establish licensing requirements for individuals involved in the marketing of turkeys in Canada, including producers, processors, dealers, hatcherymen, and retailers, requiring them to hold an appropriate licence and pay annual fees, with specific reporting obligations based on their role. The rules apply to interprovincial and export trade, with exemptions for small-scale producers in certain provinces based on annual turkey output.
