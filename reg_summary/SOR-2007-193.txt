This regulation exempts the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from certain radio communication restrictions in a specific geographic area of Ontario and Quebec for a short period in 2007, allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications solely for purposes of security, safety, or international relations. The interference is strictly limited in scope, duration, and area to achieve those objectives efficiently and with minimal impact.
