These Standing Orders establish a formal process for members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to request review of decisions related to the classification of their positions, including group allocation, rating, level, rank, or effective date. The process involves a review committee composed of trained professionals, with a final decision made by the Commissioner or a designated decision maker, and the decision is final and binding.
