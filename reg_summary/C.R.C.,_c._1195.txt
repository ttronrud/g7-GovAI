These Regulations establish rules for the construction and maintenance of communication and supply lines across or near railways in Canada, requiring consent from railway owners or the Commission, adherence to safety and technical standards, and liability protections for any damage or injury caused. They also mandate that lines be constructed to avoid interference with railway operations and include provisions for dispute resolution, indemnification, and compliance with approved standards such as the Canadian Standards Association’s C22.3.
