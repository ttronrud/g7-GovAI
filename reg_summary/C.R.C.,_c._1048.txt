These Regulations establish the framework for managing the service estates of deceased members of the Canadian Forces, defining what constitutes a service estate and outlining the priority payment of service debts, with the Director of Estates having the authority and powers of a court-appointed executor to administer the estate. The Director of Estates must act independently and is responsible for distributing assets according to legal principles, with no claims allowed against the estate except as provided.
