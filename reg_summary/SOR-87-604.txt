This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Dauphin Airport in Manitoba, limiting the height of structures and natural growth to comply with approach, outer, and transitional surfaces defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria, and prohibits the disposal of bird-attractive waste on affected lands. It formally adopts the proposed rules after public consultation, ensuring safety and operational requirements for aircraft landings and takeoffs.
