These regulations prescribe specific physical injuries that qualify as "serious injury" under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, including substantial loss of mobility, loss of function or vision/hearing, disfigurement, fractures of major bones, and severe burns, cuts, or lacerations to major body areas—where medical attention was sought from a licensed medical or nursing professional. The regulations come into force upon registration.
