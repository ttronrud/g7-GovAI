This regulation excludes a specific portion of the Redside Dace's critical habitat from the Order due to its location in a place designated under subsection 58(2) of the Species at Risk Act, and establishes the remaining critical habitat under the Act's provisions. The Order comes into force upon registration and ensures that only the eligible portion of the species' critical habitat is protected, in accordance with the recovery strategy and legal requirements.
