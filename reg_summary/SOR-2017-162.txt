This regulation grants specific privileges and immunities to official delegates, including defence ministers and their representatives, and officials from international organizations attending the United Nations Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial Conference in Vancouver in 2017, during a defined period, as provided under the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities. The Order ensures these individuals can carry out their functions in Canada without undue interference, with rights comparable to diplomatic agents for senior officials and standard immunities for others.
