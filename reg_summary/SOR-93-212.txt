These regulations establish the procedures for registering and protecting integrated circuit topographies in Canada, outlining requirements for applications, including documentation, agent and representative appointments, and confidentiality provisions, while also defining how correspondence is handled and when materials may be filed or amended. They are effective May 1, 1993, and ensure that all filings are in one of Canada's official languages, contain necessary technical details, and are properly managed by the Office of the Registrar of Topographies.
