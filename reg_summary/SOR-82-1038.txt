These Regulations implement the International Convention for Safe Containers by requiring all containers used in international transport (except those for air) to have a valid Safety Approval Plate, be periodically examined, and be maintained in safe condition. They also establish procedures for container approval, repair, inspection, and detention by inspectors, and authorize certain organizations to conduct testing and inspections, with oversight by the Board of Steamship Inspection.
