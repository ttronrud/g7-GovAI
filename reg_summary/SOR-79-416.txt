This regulation establishes restrictions on foreign ownership of agricultural and recreational land in Alberta, prohibiting ineligible persons or foreign-controlled corporations from acquiring interests in such land beyond specific limits—such as owning more than two parcels totaling 20 acres—unless exempted for purposes like infrastructure, residential development, or public use. It also provides exemptions for certain transactions and includes provisions for divestment, lease terms, and special rules for corporate ownership and succession.
