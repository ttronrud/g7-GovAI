These regulations establish the requirements for marking precious metal articles in Canada, specifying which parts are exempt from assay, the methods and content of quality marks (including gold and silver purity, plating thickness, and base metal identification), and ensuring that marked articles meet minimum quality standards—particularly regarding the actual gold or silver content relative to what is represented. The rules also provide exemptions for certain items sold outside Canada and for articles manufactured or imported before specific dates.
