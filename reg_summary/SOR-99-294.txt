The Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999 establish comprehensive safety, security, and environmental protection requirements for the design, construction, operation, and abandonment of onshore pipelines in Canada, mandating compliance with Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standards and requiring companies to implement a detailed management system that includes hazard identification, risk assessment, employee training, incident reporting, and annual performance reviews. These regulations aim to ensure the safety of personnel, the integrity of pipelines, and the protection of the environment.
