This regulation grants remission of fees to certain individuals who have a reasonable but mistaken belief they are Canadian citizens, have lived most of their lives in Canada, and had an application for citizenship in process or submitted after January 24, 2007, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria and are not permanent residents or barred from citizenship. The remission applies to fees related to applications for citizenship or resumption of citizenship under the Citizenship Act.
