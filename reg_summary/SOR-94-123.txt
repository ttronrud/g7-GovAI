These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Peterborough Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting the height of structures, prohibiting activities that interfere with aircraft communications, and restricting waste disposal that attracts birds. The boundaries and elevation limits—such as approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and an outer surface—are defined with precise geometric and geographic descriptions to prevent obstructions to air traffic.
