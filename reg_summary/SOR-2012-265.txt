This regulation mandates that federal credit unions provide detailed, clear, and non-misleading prospectuses before distributing securities to members, including specific disclosures about risks, governance, financial statements, and the non-insurability of the securities. It also requires oral or electronic communication of key information to members and establishes rules for advertising and online disclosure to ensure transparency and informed decision-making.
