These Firearms Fees Regulations, made under the Firearms Act, establish fees for issuing or renewing licences for non-restricted, restricted, or prohibited firearms, with waivers and reductions for individuals under 18, those hunting or trapping for subsistence, and those with short-term licences. Fees for businesses and authorizations are also defined, with specific waivers for certain activities or circumstances, and replacement fees set at $10 or $25 depending on the type of document lost or destroyed.
