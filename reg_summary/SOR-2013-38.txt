These regulations define what constitutes borrowing by the Government of Yukon under the Yukon Act, including loans, capital leases, sale-leasebacks, and loan guarantees, and specify how to calculate their values for disclosure purposes in the Yukon Public Accounts. The regulations come into force when Division 4 of Part 4 of the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act comes into force or upon registration if later.
