The Governor General in Council approved the Immigration Appeal Division Rules, 2022, which establish procedures for handling appeals in immigration matters, including requirements for notice of appeal, submission of documents, language preferences, appeal records, and timelines for filings and communications. The rules emphasize informal, efficient, and fair resolution of appeals while allowing flexibility in procedural matters.
