The Timber Marking Rules outline the requirements for applying to register a timber mark, including form, content, and submission standards, such as using specific paper sizes, clear typewritten or printed documents, and proper drawing specifications. The application must be submitted in duplicate, signed by the applicant or their authorized agent, and include a description and drawing of the mark, with no title or descriptive matter on the drawing itself.
