The Competition Tribunal, with approval from the Governor in Council, has adopted the Competition Tribunal Rules to govern the procedures for hearings, filings, service, and conduct of proceedings under the Competition Act. These rules establish standardized procedures for electronic and paper filings, service of documents, public access to records, and the conduct of hearings, while allowing flexibility for exceptional circumstances or specific case needs.
