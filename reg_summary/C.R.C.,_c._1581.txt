These Regulations establish eligibility and provisions for vocational, educational, and rehabilitative training for pensioners who are unable to work due to disability, with specific allowances, travel expenses, and compensation protections for accidents or industrial diseases during training. The Minister may approve training programs tailored to the pensioner’s needs, including vocational, on-the-job, or correspondence courses, and may pay related fees, travel costs, and living expenses, while ensuring that training benefits do not interfere with other veteran benefits.
