This regulation exempts certain employees in key sectors—such as road transportation, marine, rail, air, banking, telecommunications, and broadcasting—from specific hours of work provisions in the Canada Labour Code, including rest and break requirements, while modifying those provisions to allow for shorter or more flexible breaks and rest periods where applicable. These exemptions are granted because applying the standard rules would be unduly prejudicial to employees or seriously detrimental to the operation of the industrial establishments.
