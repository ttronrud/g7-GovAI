This regulation proclaims that the Canada-Chile Agreement on Social Security enters into force on June 1, 1998, allowing citizens and residents of both countries to access social security benefits (such as pensions and disability benefits) under reciprocal rules, including the totalization of creditable periods and the payment of benefits in the other country without reduction. It also establishes specific conditions for eligibility, benefit calculation, and medical evaluations, while ensuring that existing bilateral agreements do not override these provisions.
