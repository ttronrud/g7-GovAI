The Electronic Commerce Protection Regulations, enacted in 2010, establish exemptions from commercial electronic message restrictions for messages sent in specific contexts—such as within organizations, in response to requests, for legal obligations, through secure accounts, or by charities and political entities—and define criteria for personal and family relationships to determine when messages are exempt. Section 6 of the Act, which governs commercial electronic messaging, comes into force on January 15, 2015, while the rest of the regulations come into force on July 1, 2014.
