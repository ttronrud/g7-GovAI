The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food established compensation regulations for chickens, ducks, and geese destroyed in British Columbia due to avian influenza, setting specific formulas to determine market value based on age and type of bird, with maximum compensation amounts defined for each species. These regulations apply in the designated control area and ensure farmers receive financial compensation under section 55a of the Health of Animals Act.
