This regulation transfers the powers and duties of the Minister of International Trade—specifically regarding Canada-U.S. trade to the Minister of State (U.S. Trade), and all other trade responsibilities to the Minister of Foreign Affairs—under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The transfer reflects a reorganization of trade responsibilities to better align with bilateral and international diplomatic priorities.
