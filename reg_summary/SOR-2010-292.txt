The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) adopted data and system requirements by-law to ensure member financial institutions can provide timely, accurate, and usable data about deposit liabilities, including depositor information, account details, and interest accrual, within strict timeframes—particularly during insolvency events—so CDIC can fulfill its insurance and protection responsibilities. Institutions must develop policies, comply with data reporting timelines, and achieve full compliance within 18 months of becoming a member or assuming liabilities.
