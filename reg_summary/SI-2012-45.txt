The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to add the Laura’s Clubtail, Coast Manroot, or Four-leaved Milkweed to Canada’s List of Wildlife Species at Risk, citing their extremely limited ranges in Canada, lack of significant contribution to global conservation, and existing protections under provincial laws. The decision prioritizes efficient allocation of resources to species where Canada can make a more meaningful impact.
