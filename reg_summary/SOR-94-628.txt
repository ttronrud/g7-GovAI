This regulation repeals the old Prince Edward Island Milk Order, 1988, and replaces it with a new order granting the Prince Edward Island Milk Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of milk produced in the province, including the power to impose levies and charges on milk producers and use those funds for operational and equity purposes. The Board’s powers are limited to marketing regulation within the province and do not include functions previously held by the Canadian Dairy Commission.
