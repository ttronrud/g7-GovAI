The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has referred the status assessment of the Shortfin Mako Atlantic population back to COSEWIC due to new evidence indicating a more negative status than previously assessed. This referral allows COSEWIC to reassess the species' status in light of updated information from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
