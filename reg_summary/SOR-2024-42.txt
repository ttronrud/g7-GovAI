These regulations establish the requirements for electronic security agreements under the Customs Act, mandating that security be provided through a specified electronic system and specifying the terms, conditions, and obligations of security providers, including payment obligations upon default by a debtor. They also outline procedures for demand, dispute resolution, and termination of security agreements, while exempting certain pre-existing security arrangements from the new rules.
