The Treasury Board adopts the Payments to Estates Regulations, 1996, which establish that payments to a deceased person’s estate are made to the estate unless a beneficiary can apply for payment directly, subject to limits based on whether the deceased left a will and the amount involved. Applications for direct payment must be made in a specific form, signed by the applicant and witnesses, and include a release from other entitled persons if applicable.
