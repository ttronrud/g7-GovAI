This regulation re-applies the Public Service Employment Act to certain previously excluded positions within the Canadian public service, while also excluding from the Act individuals employed outside Canada in diplomatic, consular, or military support roles subject to foreign laws. The decision was made after consultation with employers and based on the determination that applying the Act to these roles would not be practicable or in the public interest.
