These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Bagotville Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting the elevation of structures, natural growth, and prohibited land uses near the airport. They define specific surfaces—such as approach, transitional, and outer surfaces—that buildings and objects must not exceed in height, and prohibit the use of land for activities that pose bird hazards to aircraft.
