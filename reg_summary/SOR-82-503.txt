These regulations establish the tax rules under the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act, defining key terms such as Canadian exploration and development expenses, prescribed projects and reservoirs, and prescribed royalties, while setting specific deductions and exemptions related to oil and gas production, particularly in relation to bituminous sands and projects on Indigenous reserves or in Ontario. They also prescribe how certain expenses and income are treated for tax purposes, including rules on renunciation of expenses, timing of deductions, and instalment bases for tax payments.
