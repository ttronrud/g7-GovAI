This regulation outlines the types of transactions a trust or loan company may enter into with a related party, including tax agreements, share or debt transactions, and derivative financial instruments, while also limiting certain transactions by foreign banks or their controlled financial institutions to ensure financial stability and transparency. Specifically, it permits short-term deposits with a foreign bank or its controlled financial institution up to 50% of the company’s regulatory capital, provided the deposits are for liquidity management and do not exceed 30 days.
