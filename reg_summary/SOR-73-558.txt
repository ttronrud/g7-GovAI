These regulations authorize the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to provide a housing loan to Rosabel Jeanette Pryce, a member of the Skidegate Band, to purchase a condominium unit off-reserve, with the Indian Off-Reserve and Eskimo Re-Establishment Housing Regulations applying to the loan. The loan is governed under specific appropriations and is intended to support housing acquisition for an Indigenous individual outside a reserve.
