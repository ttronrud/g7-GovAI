These regulations establish mandatory safety management system (SMS) requirements for Canadian vessels and foreign vessels operating in Canadian waters, requiring ship managers to develop, implement, and maintain documented safety and environmental protection systems tailored to vessel class (Class 1 to 5). The system includes certification requirements, regular audits, corrective actions, and compliance checks, with specific provisions for different vessel types and operational conditions.
