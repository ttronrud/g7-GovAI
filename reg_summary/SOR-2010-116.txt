This regulation exempts the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from certain radio communication restrictions for a specific period and geographic area in Ontario, allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications solely for purposes of security, safety, or international relations. The exemption is strictly limited in scope, duration, and geographic boundaries, and requires that interference be minimized to the essential extent needed.
