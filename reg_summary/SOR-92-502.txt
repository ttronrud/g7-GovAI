The Government has revoked several outdated regulations governing the acquisition and disposition of federal real property and replaced them with new, comprehensive regulations under the Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act, which streamline and modernize the processes for acquiring, leasing, selling, and managing federal land and immovables, while establishing clear rules for ministerial authority, financial arrangements, and record-keeping. These regulations apply to most dispositions and acquisitions but include specific exemptions for Crown corporations, security-related activities, and transfers involving provinces.
