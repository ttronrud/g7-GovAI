The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has adopted accessibility reporting regulations under the Accessible Canada Act, requiring regulated broadcasting and telecommunications entities to develop, publish, and maintain accessible accessibility plans and progress reports in accessible formats, including on their main digital platforms, with specific timelines and accessibility standards based on entity size and class. These regulations ensure public access to plans and feedback processes, with provisions for requests in various formats and timely responses, particularly for individuals with disabilities.
