This regulation establishes a levy system under which Manitoba hog producers must pay $0.20 per weanling hog and $0.85 per other hog when marketing hogs interprovincially or for export. The levies are due within seven days of receiving an invoice from the Manitoba Pork Est. (Producer Board), and the order comes into force on September 16, 1998, repealing a previous version.
