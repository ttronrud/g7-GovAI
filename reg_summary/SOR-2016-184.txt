These regulations establish safety standards for pacifiers in Canada, requiring them to be free from harmful substances, prevent choking or injury hazards, and meet specific structural and material requirements, including limits on volatile nitrosamines and testing procedures for durability and integrity. The regulations come into force upon registration and prohibit any claims or advertising that could lead to misuse or failure to meet safety requirements.
