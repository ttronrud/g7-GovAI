This regulation establishes strict controls on the production, use, acquisition, and possession of Schedule 1 chemicals in Canada, requiring licenses for most activities and limiting annual production to 10 kg per facility. It authorizes certain activities—such as research, medical, or protective uses—at a single small-scale facility without a license, provided specific safety and reporting conditions are met.
