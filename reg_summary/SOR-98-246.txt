This regulation establishes the Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998, which define fishing terms, set limits on fishing methods and gear, and restrict fishing in certain areas and times to protect fish populations. It applies to sportfishing and commercial bait fishing, prohibits snagging and certain types of gear, and outlines rules on fish possession, release, and licensing, all under the authority of the Fisheries Act and Alberta’s provincial fishery legislation.
