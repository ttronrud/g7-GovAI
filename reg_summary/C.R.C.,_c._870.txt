The Food and Drug Regulations establish standards for the composition, quality, and labeling of food and drugs in Canada, including requirements for safety features, language use, label clarity, and proper handling of samples and imports. They also mandate specific hazard warnings for pressurized containers and require that certain drugs be sold in security packages to prevent tampering.
