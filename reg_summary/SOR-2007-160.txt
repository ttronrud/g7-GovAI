These regulations, made under the Energy Monitoring Act, define which oil and gas-derived products are considered energy commodities and establish how to calculate the gross annual revenues and assets of energy enterprises using guidelines from the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA Handbook), while exempting all energy enterprises from filing returns under the Act. The regulations come into force upon registration.
