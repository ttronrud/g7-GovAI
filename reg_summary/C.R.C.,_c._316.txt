These Regulations establish a pre-retirement benefit program for textile and clothing workers in Canada who are laid off and meet specific eligibility criteria, including age, years of employment, and earnings history. The benefit, capped at 66⅔% of average weekly insurable earnings, is paid by the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission and is adjusted annually for inflation, with payments suspended or reduced if the employee earns income or is found ineligible.
