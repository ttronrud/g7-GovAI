These regulations establish the criteria and limits for financial contributions under the Industrial and Regional Development Act, outlining eligible costs, types of projects (such as manufacturing, research, and infrastructure), and contribution rates based on geographic tier groups (I to IV), with higher support for projects in less-developed regions. Contributions are conditional on technical feasibility, commercial potential, and specific thresholds, and are repayable in some cases upon successful commercial exploitation.
