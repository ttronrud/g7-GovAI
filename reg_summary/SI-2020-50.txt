This regulation grants a fee remission for employers who requested an Employment and Social Development Canada assessment before April 4, 2020, and withdrew their offer of employment due to the impact of COVID-19, provided no work permit was issued or is being processed. The remission applies only if the assessment is no longer needed or cannot be used.
