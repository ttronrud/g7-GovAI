The Lieutenant-Governor in Council of New Brunswick enacted the New Brunswick Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations to define key terms, authorize RCMP and police officers to collect information, and designate specific registration centres for sex offender information under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act. These regulations come into force upon registration.
