The Energy Efficiency Regulations, 2016, require energy-using products—such as clothes dryers, refrigerators, and air conditioners—to be labelled with a verification mark issued by a certified body or province, ensuring compliance with minimum energy efficiency standards. The regulations also mandate that dealers provide specific product and performance information to the Minister before importation or interprovincial shipment, with exemptions for certain products or situations involving modifications or exports.
