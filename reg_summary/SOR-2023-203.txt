The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has enacted the Online Undertakings Registration Regulations, requiring operators of online broadcasting services to register within 30 days of launching their service or within 60 days if the service began before the regulations came into force, by providing detailed information such as the service name, operator details, and broadcasting services offered, with all submissions to be made electronically.
