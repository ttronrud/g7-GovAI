The Attorney General of Canada revoked an earlier order and issued a new Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Order, effective December 4, 1985, approving specific breath analysis devices—such as the Intoxilyzer 5000 C, BAC Datamaster C, Alco-Sensor IV-RBT IV, and others—for use in measuring blood alcohol concentration under section 258 of the Criminal Code. This order ensures that only approved instruments may be used in alcohol-related traffic enforcement.
