The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked several previous marine mammal protection regulations and replaced them with new regulations effective February 24, 1993, to manage and control fishing for marine mammals in Canada, including licensing, conservation measures, and restrictions on fishing for specific species and in specific areas. These regulations also establish rules for handling, transporting, and recording marine mammal catches, with special provisions for Indigenous peoples and protection of vulnerable species and calves.
