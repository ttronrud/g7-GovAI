These Regulations establish payment programs for the transportation and storage of specific feed grains in Canada, with transportation costs paid at varying rates depending on the timing and destination, and storage payments made only for feed grain grown in Canada and stored in Eastern Canada, subject to conditions such as proper documentation and feeding to livestock. Payments are generally phased out after January 9, 1996, and require detailed records and audits to ensure compliance.
