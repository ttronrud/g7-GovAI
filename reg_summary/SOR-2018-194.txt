This regulation declares that the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations do not apply in Quebec, as Quebec has equivalent environmental provisions under its own laws, including the Environment Quality Act and related regulations, and a government agreement on wastewater management. The Order ensures that effluent from certain wastewater systems is not subject to federal regulations if it is governed by Quebec’s laws or authorized under those laws.
