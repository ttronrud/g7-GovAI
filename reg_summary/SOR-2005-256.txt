These regulations establish the procedures for issuing advance rulings on the tariff classification of goods under the Customs Act, effective April 1, 2003, and require that rulings be based on consistent facts, provided in writing with reasons, and remain binding unless modified or revoked due to changes in facts, law, or court decisions. The rulings apply to goods imported on or after the effective date and may be postponed or modified if circumstances change or if the applicant fails to provide sufficient information.
