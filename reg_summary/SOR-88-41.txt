These regulations establish rules for the interswitching of rail traffic between terminal carriers and shippers, setting service standards, eliminating charges for empty car deliveries, and defining distance-based zones to determine rates, while exempting certain railway companies based on their revenue sources from interswitching. The regulations aim to reduce costs by allowing bulk transfers of cars and ensuring fair, cost-effective service for all parties involved.
