This regulation reaffirms the status of a list of terrorist entities established in 2002, confirming that each organization on the list continues to be designated as a terrorist entity under Canadian law due to reasonable grounds to believe they have engaged in or facilitated terrorist activities. The designation remains in effect despite eight years having passed since the original listing, based on ongoing assessments by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.
