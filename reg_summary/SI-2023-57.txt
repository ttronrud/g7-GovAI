This proclamation, issued by the Governor General of Canada on September 22, 2023, officially declares the new electoral boundaries for all provinces except Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the specific representation order for Newfoundland and Labrador, effective on the first dissolution of Parliament at least seven months after the proclamation. The boundaries are based on the 2021 census and are designed to ensure fair representation in the House of Commons, with detailed geographic descriptions for each electoral district.
