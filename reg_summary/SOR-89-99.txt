This regulation revokes the previous Eastern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations and establishes new rules governing vessel traffic in the Eastern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone, requiring shipmasters to submit detailed reports before entering, while in, or departing the zone, and in response to certain emergencies or navigational hazards. The reports must include information such as ship details, route, cargo, and safety conditions, and must be submitted to ECAREG CANADA in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
