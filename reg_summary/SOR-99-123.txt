This regulation establishes zoning restrictions around Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting building heights, prohibiting interference with aircraft communications, and restricting land use that could attract birds. Specifically, all structures and natural growth within designated areas must not exceed the height of approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, which are defined by specific elevation and slope criteria based on runway approaches.
