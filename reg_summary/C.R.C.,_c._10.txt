These regulations establish a compensation framework for employees and civil aviation inspectors who die or are injured in non-scheduled flights or flights related to their duties, paying compensation equivalent to the pension they would have received under the Pension Act, adjusted for peace-time service, with specific rules on recovery of damages and funeral expenses. Claims are adjudicated and paid by the Canadian Pension Commission.
