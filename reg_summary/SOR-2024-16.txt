These regulations establish the employment rules for "locally engaged staff" — Canadian government personnel appointed and working outside Canada in diplomatic, consular, or military support roles, subject to host country laws. Appointments must be based on merit, with provisions for temporary staffing (up to 125 days per year), lay-offs, resignations, and transitional protections for employees and processes under the previous regulations, which are fully repealed upon implementation.
