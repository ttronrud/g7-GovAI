This regulation directs the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to establish a sustainable and equitable broadcasting system that prioritizes Canadian content, supports Indigenous participation and storytelling, promotes diversity among equity-seeking and ethnocultural groups, ensures accessibility for persons with disabilities, and fosters innovation and inclusivity through outcome-based, flexible, and digitally adaptive regulatory tools. It also mandates public engagement, regular reporting on progress, and a two-year review period to ensure ongoing alignment with the goals of the Broadcasting Act.
