This 1982 regulatory order grants income tax remission to certain non-residents and residents of Canada who earned income in Quebec, particularly those who did not reside in Canada, by adjusting the amount of income tax payable based on a modified definition of income earned in Quebec. It also provides remission of penalties and interest where applicable, and applies to taxation years from 1979 to 1983.
