These regulations establish the conditions for licensing the removal of boundary waters in bulk across international borders, requiring detailed environmental, economic, and technical information in applications, and apply only to specific water basins under the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act. They exclude certain uses, such as ballast, firefighting, or non-commercial short-term projects, from the licensing requirements.
