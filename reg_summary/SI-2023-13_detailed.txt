The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Below is a detailed summary of its content, context, and implications:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under Section 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* – Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is made under **Section 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the scientific assessments of wildlife species at risk conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The Governor General in Council formally acknowledges receipt of the assessments prepared by COSEWIC for specific species listed in the **annexed schedule**. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of species—such as whether they are endangered, threatened, or of special concern—based on scientific data and expert analysis.

2. **Trigger for Legal Action:**  
   The making of this Order is contingent upon the completion and submission of the COSEWIC assessments under subsection 23(1) of SARA. This step is a procedural requirement that formally initiates the process of determining a species’ status under Canadian law.

3. **Species Covered:**  
   The regulation refers to a **schedule** (not included in your text) that lists the species for which COSEWIC has completed its assessments. These species are typically those identified as being at risk of extinction in the wild. The list may include mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants.

4. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent, scientific body that evaluates the status of wildlife species in Canada. Its assessments are critical because they provide the scientific foundation for government decisions under SARA. The assessments consider factors such as population size, distribution, trends, threats, and habitat conditions.

5. **Government Response:**  
   Upon receiving these assessments, the federal government (via the Minister of the Environment) uses them to determine whether a species should be listed under SARA. This Order serves as the official government recognition that the assessments are now available and accepted for use in the legal and policy framework of the Act.

6. **Purpose and Impact:**  
   - This Order marks a key step in the **formal listing process** under SARA.  
   - It enables the government to proceed with potential protective measures, such as development of recovery strategies, protection of critical habitats, or regulation of trade and activities that may threaten the species.  
   - It ensures transparency and scientific rigor in species management decisions.

7. **Legal Effect:**  
   While this Order does not itself list species, it **validates and formalizes** the scientific basis for future listing decisions. It may lead to the eventual listing of species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under SARA, which triggers legal obligations for federal and provincial governments.

**Context and Background:**

- The *Species at Risk Act* was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) to protect species at risk in Canada through a combination of conservation measures, recovery planning, and public awareness.
- Section 23(1) of SARA mandates that COSEWIC assessments be submitted to the Minister of the Environment, and upon receipt, the government must acknowledge them. This ensures that decisions are based on up-to-date, peer-reviewed science.
- This Order is typically issued annually or as new assessments are completed, reflecting the dynamic nature of species conservation.

---

**Significance:**

- This regulation is a **critical procedural step** in Canada’s species conservation framework.
- It ensures that scientific assessments are officially recognized and used as the basis for policy and legal action.
- It strengthens accountability and public trust in the government’s conservation decisions.

**Note:**  
Although the original text does not list the species in the annexed schedule, such schedules are typically published as part of the full regulation. To identify the specific species involved, one would need to refer to the full version of the regulation as published in the *Canada Gazette* or through official government databases (e.g., Government of Canada’s Species at Risk Public Registry).

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally recognizes the completion and scientific validity of COSEWIC assessments for specific species at risk. It serves as a foundational step in the process of determining conservation status under the *Species at Risk Act*, enabling the federal government to take appropriate action to protect biodiversity in Canada. It underscores the integration of science and policy in environmental governance.
