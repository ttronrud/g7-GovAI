This regulation establishes the requirements for businesses to obtain authorizations to export or import firearms and other goods under the Firearms Act, including detailed information to be provided, conditions attached to authorizations (such as bill of lading and copy of authorization), and procedures for refusal, revocation, and customs handling. It also specifies that certain export and import permits are deemed authorizations and outlines the rules for disposal of detained or forfeited goods, with the regulations coming into force when section 43 of the Firearms Act is enacted.
