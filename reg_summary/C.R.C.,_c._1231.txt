The Navigable Waters Bridges Regulations govern bridges over navigable waters in Canada, requiring lights and markings, specifying navigation rules for movable spans, and establishing procedures for vessel passage, span operation, and safety. These regulations apply to bridges constructed after November 17, 1923, with exceptions for canals and public harbours, and include provisions for vessel signals, responsible personnel, and ministerial oversight.
