These regulations establish the process for recovering overpayments made to former Members of Parliament, requiring notice of the amounts due and giving the recipient 45 days to choose between paying in a lump sum or making monthly deductions from their benefits, with specific rules on the order of recovery and hardship protections. The regulations also specify that deductions must follow a defined schedule and may be adjusted if financial hardship occurs, with reconciliation and adjustments required annually or upon certain events.
