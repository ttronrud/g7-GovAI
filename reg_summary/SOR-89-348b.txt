This regulation establishes special employment terms for temporary workers in the Department of Forestry, allowing appointments for periods of less than six months in any 12-month period, excluding them from the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act. It grants the Deputy Minister authority to recruit, select, and terminate such temporary employees with one day’s notice for cause or due to lack of work.
