These regulations establish specific conditions under which a trust and loan company can issue "delivery shares" to a particular subsidiary for acquisition, ensuring the shares are issued at fair market value, traded on a Canadian exchange, and transferred to shareholders of another foreign corporation, with strict requirements on residency and arm’s-length dealings. If any condition is not met, the trust and loan company must cancel the shares, return the consideration, and remove the entry from its capital account within 30 days.
