This regulation exempts certain personal health information custodians in Nova Scotia from Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) when handling personal health information, as the Personal Health Information Act (SNS 2010) already governs such information. The exemption applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal health information within Nova Scotia and comes into force upon registration.
