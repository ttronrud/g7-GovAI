This regulation transfers control and supervision of specific public service programs—such as the Family Violence Prevention Division, Children’s Bureau, and several related initiatives—from the Department of Employment and Immigration back to the Department of National Health and Welfare, pursuant to the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The transfer reflects a reallocation of responsibilities to better align with the programs' focus on health and social services.
