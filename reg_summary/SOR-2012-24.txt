These regulations require financial institutions in Canada to make funds deposited by cheque or other instruments available for withdrawal within strict timeframes—no more than four or five business days for cheques up to $1,500, and no more than seven or eight business days for larger cheques—depending on the method of deposit, with certain exceptions for high-risk or fraudulent deposits. Institutions must also clearly disclose these policies to customers and the public in writing, including at branches, points of service, and online, and must provide notice of any changes to these rules.
