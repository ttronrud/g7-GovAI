These British Columbia HST Regulations, enacted in 2013, establish specific tax rates, adjustments, and exemptions related to the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) system, including a 0% tax rate for certain property, modifications to tax calculations for supplies made before or after April 1, 2013, and provisions to prevent tax avoidance through transactions that reduce or defer tax, particularly during the transition from the HST system. The regulations also adjust rebate and pension rebate calculations and apply special rules to ensure fair treatment of tax liabilities in the context of property and service supplies.
