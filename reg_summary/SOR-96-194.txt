These regulations, enacted on July 1, 1996, authorize the issuance of base metal coins with compositions different from those specified in the Royal Canadian Mint Act, as long as they meet specified standard weights and tolerance limits. Coins in circulation are not considered to fall below the standard weight due to normal wear and tear.
