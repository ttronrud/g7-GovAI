These Brewery Departmental Regulations outline the requirements for excise supervision, record-keeping, and duty calculation in breweries, including the need for excise officers to oversee key operations, detailed reporting of beer production and movement, and the eligibility for duty drawbacks on exported beer. Excise duty is charged per production day and can be reduced by duties on exported beer, returned beer, or granted drawbacks, with brewers required to submit regular returns detailing production, exports, and duty payments.
