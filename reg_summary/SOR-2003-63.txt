These regulations restrict Canadian societies from acquiring control of or making substantial investments in entities that engage in certain information technology activities—such as developing or managing data transmission systems—unless specific conditions are met, including limits on total exposure based on balance sheet value and loan amounts. The restrictions also prohibit investments in entities involved in high-risk financial activities or prohibited business operations under the Insurance Companies Act.
