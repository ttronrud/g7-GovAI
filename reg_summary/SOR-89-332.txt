This regulation revokes the previous Esquimalt Graving Dock Regulations and establishes new rules for the management and operation of the Esquimalt dry dock, outlining requirements for vessel entry and exit, safety standards, dock charges, and responsibilities of agents and the Manager. It includes provisions for authorization, safety measures (such as gas hazard controls and explosive material restrictions), vessel cleanup, block handling, and financial obligations, including dock charges calculated based on gross tonnage and adjusted annually.
