These regulations impose restrictions on foreign banks and their associated entities from acquiring control of or making substantial investments in Canadian entities that engage in certain information technology activities, such as developing or managing data transmission systems or information platforms, unless the combined value of shares, ownership interests, and loans does not exceed 5% of the foreign bank’s regulatory capital or $1 billion. The regulations also prohibit such acquisitions if the Canadian entity engages in activities that are otherwise prohibited for banks under the Bank Act.
