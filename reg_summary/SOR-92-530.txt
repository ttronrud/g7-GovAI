These Regulations define the regulatory capital of trust and loan companies in Canada, specifying that it consists of shareholders' equity, minority interests, and subordinated indebtedness, adjusted for goodwill, with specific requirements for the subordination and terms of debt instruments. For insurance companies and securities dealers, certain investments, loans, and minority interests are excluded from regulatory capital to ensure accurate risk assessment.
