These regulations define what constitutes borrowing by the Northwest Territories government for purposes of financial disclosure under the Northwest Territories Act, including loans, capital leases, sale-leasebacks, and loan guarantees, while excluding certain internal transactions and specific Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation loans. The value of these obligations is determined based on accounting standards and thresholds, and the regulations come into force on a specified date or upon registration.
