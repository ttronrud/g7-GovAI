This regulation establishes the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Order, granting the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of flue-cured tobacco produced in Ontario. They may impose levies or charges on tobacco producers and marketers, classify them into groups, and use the collected funds for operational expenses, loss payments, reserve creation, and equalizing revenues among producers.
