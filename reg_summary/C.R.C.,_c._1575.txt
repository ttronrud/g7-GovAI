These regulations establish the rules for collecting unemployment insurance premiums, defining insurable earnings, allocating earnings to pay periods, and determining premium amounts based on earnings levels, with specific rules for different pay frequencies (weekly, semi-monthly, monthly). Employers must remit premiums to the Receiver General within specified deadlines, and premiums are calculated using tiered rates based on insurable earnings up to a maximum threshold.
