This regulation grants tax remission to Indigenous individuals or bands living on the Camp Ipperwash Indian Settlement for taxes paid on or after 1985, and for goods and services tax (GST) paid on supplies made to the settlement after January 1, 1991, based on the assumption that the land had been a reserve throughout the relevant period. The remission applies only until the land is officially set apart as a reserve by the Governor in Council.
