The Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions for structures near the airport, limiting all buildings and constructions to remain below specified approach, outer, and transitional surfaces to ensure aviation safety. These regulations apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point and are based on precise geometric surfaces defined in the zoning plan.
