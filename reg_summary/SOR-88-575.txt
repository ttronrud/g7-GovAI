This regulation grants the Commonwealth of Learning, as an international agency, specific privileges and immunities in Canada, primarily drawn from the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities, as supplemented by an agreement between the Agency and Canada. It extends these rights to representatives, senior officials, and experts, including diplomatic-level immunities for the President and Vice-President and their families, while excluding taxation based on residence during official duties.
