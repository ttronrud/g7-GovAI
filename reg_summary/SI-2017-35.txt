This regulation grants a fee remission to certain foreign nationals who applied for work permits, temporary resident permits, or restorations of temporary resident status between September 1, 2014, and September 27, 2016, under specific circumstances involving a refusal based on distance learning coursework and subsequent related applications. The remission applies only if the initial work permit refusal was made without considering full coursework or transfer credits, and if related applications for a permit or status restoration were submitted and refused during the specified period.
