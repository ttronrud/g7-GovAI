This regulation proclaims the amendment to the Canada-Indonesia Convention on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, which came into force on December 31, 1998. The amended protocol replaces the 1979 protocol, updates definitions and tax rules, and modifies provisions on income taxation, permanent establishments, dividends, interest, royalties, gains from property alienation, professional services, and pensions, while also introducing new rules to prevent double taxation and exclude certain entities from the convention’s scope.
