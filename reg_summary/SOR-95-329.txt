This regulation, enacted on August 1, 1995, establishes the rules for providing student loans and other financial assistance under the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, defining key terms such as full-time and part-time students, loan types, eligibility criteria, and repayment obligations. It outlines the conditions under which students can receive direct or risk-shared loans, including enrollment verification, interest accrual, and the process for reclassifying former full-time students as full-time students upon re-enrollment.
