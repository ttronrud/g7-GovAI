These regulations establish the terms and conditions for home buyer grants administered by the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, providing up to $500 to eligible individuals who purchase or build a housing unit in Canada, with the grant amount decreasing as the purchase price exceeds a specified threshold. Eligibility requires first-time occupation after October 31, 1974, a valid land interest, compliance with building codes, and (for mobile homes) adherence to specific Canadian Standards Association standards.
