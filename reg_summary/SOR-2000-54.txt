These regulations define "prescribed deposits" — specifically, deposits of less than $150,000 from certain entities (such as governments, international agencies, or large financial institutions) to banks not covered by deposit insurance — and establish rules for how such deposits are treated under the Bank Act. The regulations come into force upon registration and apply to deposits that facilitate lending, foreign exchange, or securities transactions.
