### 7. **CREDITABLE PERIODS AND ELIGIBILITY (KEY TO BENEFIT CALCULATION)**

#### A. For Old Age Security Act (Canada):
> **Residence in Lithuania counts as residence in Canada** for:
- The person
- Their spouse or common-law partner
- Their dependants (who are not subject to Lithuania’s legislation due to employment/self-employment)

✅ **Condition**: Only if the person **makes contributions** under Canada’s CPP or provincial pension plan during that time.

> ❌ **Exception**: If the person is only subject to Lithuania’s legislation during their time in Canada, that period **does not count** toward Canadian residence for CPP or OASA eligibility.

#### B. For Lithuania’s Legislation:
> **Creditable periods in Canada** are treated as follows:
- A **calendar year** with **at least 3 months** of creditable periods under CPP → counts as **one full creditable year** in Lithuania.
- A **month** of creditable periods under OASA (not part of a CPP year) → counts as **one month** of creditable periods in Lithuania.

> ⚠️ **Disability, survivor, or orphan’s pensions**: A full calendar year of CPP creditable periods = **12 months** of creditable periods in Lithuania.

#### C. Totalizing of Creditable Periods:
- If a person does **not** meet eligibility due to insufficient creditable periods, eligibility is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Creditable periods under Canada and Lithuania
  - Creditable periods under **third countries** with which both parties have social security agreements allowing period totalization.

> ❌ **Exception (Non-Eligibility Clause)**:
> If total creditable periods under a Party are **less than one year**, and **no right to a benefit exists under that Party’s law**, then **no benefit is payable under this Agreement** for those periods.

  > (Flat-rate portion under CPP) × (Ratio of CPP contributions / minimum qualifying period)
  > ✅ **Maximum ratio = 1.0** (i.e., no more than full flat-rate benefit)
