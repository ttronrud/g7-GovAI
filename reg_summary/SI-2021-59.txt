This regulation grants remission to certain individuals who were enrolled in error in the Public Service Health Care Plan, specifically those employed by the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation or the Canadian Wheat Board and who are now receiving superannuation benefits, or who would have been eligible as dependants of such employees. The remission covers reimbursements for eligible health care expenses, less contributions paid, during the period from the date of erroneous enrollment until the date of death or the issuance of the Order.
