These regulations establish rules for granting duty abatements on imported goods that have suffered damage, deterioration, or loss in volume or weight, with specific provisions for perishable goods, sugar products, and bulk wines or spirits. Abatements are calculated based on the proportion of value or volume/weight lost, subject to limits and exclusions, such as losses due to expiration, rust, or package-only damage.
