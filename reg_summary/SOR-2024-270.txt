The Governor in Council has declared that the federal regulations on reducing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector do not apply in Saskatchewan, as equivalent provisions already exist under Saskatchewan law, effective from the date of the agreement between the federal and provincial governments. This declaration ends on the termination of the agreement between the governments.
