These Alberta Rules of Practice establish the procedural framework for applications to reduce a prisoner’s sentence without eligibility for parole, outlining requirements for filing, service, jury empanelment, evidence presentation, and judicial oversight. The rules ensure a fair and structured hearing where the applicant presents evidence first, followed by the Attorney General, and the judge makes determinations based on the evidence and applicable legal standards.
