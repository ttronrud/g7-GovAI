These regulations allow foreign banks and their associated entities to use the terms "bank," "banker," or "banking" in descriptions of corporate relationships, provided they disclose that the foreign bank is not regulated in Canada as a financial institution, bank holding company, or insurance holding company. The rules do not apply if the foreign bank is an authorized foreign bank.
