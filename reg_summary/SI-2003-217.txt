This regulation transfers control of passenger and initial import inspection services at airports and other border points (excluding import service centres) from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to the Canada Border Services Agency, effective December 12, 2003. The transfer is part of a broader public service restructuring under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
