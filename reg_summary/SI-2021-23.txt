This Canadian government order remits fees for the replacement of identity and travel documents, permanent resident cards, and certificates of citizenship for Indigenous persons who underwent imposed name changes in Canada or are descendants of such individuals, provided the application is made between May 31, 2021, and May 30, 2026, and includes valid documentation of the name reclamation. The remission applies to specific document types and ensures that the new document has the same validity period as the one being replaced.
