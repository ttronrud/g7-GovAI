The Sulphur in Diesel Fuel Regulations, enacted under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, set limits on sulphur concentration in diesel fuel to reduce air pollution. Specifically, sulphur levels are capped at 15 mg/kg for diesel fuel used in on-road vehicles, off-road engines, and most stationary engines, with higher limits (up to 1000 mg/kg) for certain large stationary and vessel engines, effective after May 31, 2014, and require producers and importers to report sulphur concentrations and maintain records for five years.
