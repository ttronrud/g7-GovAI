This regulation revokes the old Ontario Hog Producers’ Marketing Order and replaces it with the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Order, granting the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs, including the power to impose levies or charges on hog producers and use the collected funds for reserves, expenses, and loss compensation.
