The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has established compensation regulations under the Health of Animals Act to reimburse owners for reasonable costs associated with the destruction or disposal of animals required to be destroyed due to health concerns, including transportation, labour, slaughtering, and disposal costs, with specific limits and conditions based on the type of animal and method of disposal. Compensation is also available for certain related items such as animal food, equipment, and feed troughs, and the maximum compensation is determined by the value of the carcass, either before or after condemnation.
