These regulations allow non-residents of Canada to temporarily import baggage and conveyances for personal use under specific limits and conditions, including restrictions on alcohol, tobacco, and vaping products, with the imported items remaining in Canada for a set period depending on the visitor’s or temporary resident’s status and purpose of stay. The Minister may extend the retention period or require security if compliance is impractical.
