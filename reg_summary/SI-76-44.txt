The Governor General in Council designated the Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women as a department under two acts and amended the Financial Administration Act's schedule to change its ministerial responsibility from the Minister of National Health and Welfare to the Minister of Communications. It also designated the Co-ordinator of the Office as the deputy head under the Public Service Employment Act. [Note: This regulation was later repealed by SI/95-113.]
