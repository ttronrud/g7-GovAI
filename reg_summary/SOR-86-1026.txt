This regulation revokes the previous Ferry Cable Regulations and establishes new rules governing the installation, operation, and safety of ferry cables in navigable waters. It requires approval from the Minister before laying or maintaining a ferry cable, mandates specific safety measures including visible lights to indicate the cable's position, and prohibits vessel navigation when red lights are on, with penalties for violations.
