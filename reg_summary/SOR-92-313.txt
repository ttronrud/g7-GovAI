These regulations allow banks to permit their subsidiaries that are regulated securities entities to hold up to 1% of the bank's regulatory capital in shares, with a temporary exception allowing higher holdings during a share distribution. The rules are designed to ensure transparency and financial stability while enabling subsidiaries to participate in securities underwriting activities.
