This regulation increases Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) pension benefits by 2% for widows, children, and lump sum death benefits effective April 1, 2011, and in subsequent years, and provides a substantial deemed increase in contributions (1,173% to 1,224%) for residual amounts payable to widows upon death in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. The order is issued by the Treasury Board based on a report indicating the pension fund was substantially overfunded.
