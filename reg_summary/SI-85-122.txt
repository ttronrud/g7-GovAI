This regulation revokes previous orders and grants remission of customs, duty, excise duty, and sales tax on alcoholic beverages sold to visiting forces and their personnel in Canada, provided certain conditions are met, including reimbursement of taxes and proper documentation of purchases. The remission applies to beer, spirits, and wine sold by licensed liquor boards or brewers, with specific requirements for claims and use of the beverages.
