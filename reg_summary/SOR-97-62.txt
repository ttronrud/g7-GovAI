These regulations define what constitutes "imported from Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary" for customs purposes under the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, specifying conditions for shipments that bypass third countries, including restrictions on processing and value changes. The definitions apply to ensure eligible goods maintain their tariff treatment under CIFTA, with specific rules depending on whether goods pass through a non-Party country or undergo processing.
