These regulations establish the definition of a bank’s interests in real property and prescribe how such interests are valued for the purposes of investment limits under the Bank Act, particularly focusing on real property holdings, loans, guarantees, and security interests involving related entities, with values determined based on book value or net realizable value depending on the type of interest. The regulations apply to banks and their designated entities, and do not trigger certain restrictions (such as those under sections 476 to 478) for banks with equity of $1 billion or more under specific ownership conditions.
