The regulation re-applies the Public Service Employment Act to positions previously excluded under Order in Council P.C. 2010-1113b, while simultaneously excluding specific positions (00025450 to 00025460) in the Office of the Governor General’s Secretary from most provisions of the Act, retaining only certain key sections and definitions. This decision was made by the Public Service Commission after determining it is neither practicable nor in the public interest to apply the full Act to those positions.
