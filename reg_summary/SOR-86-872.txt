These Regulations require importers of certain fabrics into Canada to submit a sample of each quality or style of fabric imported, with specific size and content requirements, except for fabrics listed in the schedule or imported for personal use, in limited quantities, or for specific types such as long pile, terry, or coated fabrics. The regulations are designed to ensure proper identification of imported fabrics for customs purposes.
