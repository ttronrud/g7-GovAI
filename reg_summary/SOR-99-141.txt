The Canada Small Business Financing Regulations establish rules for loans to small businesses, including definitions, loan classifications, eligibility criteria, security requirements, interest rate limits, and registration and reporting obligations. The regulations ensure transparency, due diligence, and accountability in lending practices, with provisions for loan renewal, security, and loss compensation when compliance is inadvertently breached.
