These Regulations restrict how insurance companies and foreign companies can use customer credit information in Canada, allowing such use only for specific "authorized types of insurance" and only under strict conditions—such as when promotions are directed to cardholders or credit customers and do not involve promoting insurance directly to individuals. Exceptions are permitted if the company ensures the information will not be used for insurance promotion and provides written undertakings to the Superintendent.
