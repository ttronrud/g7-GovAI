The Cosmetic Regulations, enacted in 2024, establish safety, labelling, and manufacturing standards for cosmetics in Canada, including definitions of key terms, restrictions on hazardous ingredients (such as mercury, chloroform, and coal tar dyes), requirements for ingredient disclosure using INCI names, and mandatory warning labels for products with avoidable hazards. They also specify labelling requirements for pressurized containers, flame projection, and products intended for sensitive areas, while ensuring that all information is clearly presented in both English and French.
