The Federal Halocarbon Regulations, 2022, prohibit the release of halocarbons from air-conditioning, refrigeration, solvent, and fire-extinguishing systems, mandate proper handling, recovery, and recycling, and require certification for personnel performing services. These regulations apply to systems and containers on federal or aboriginal lands, with specific exemptions and reporting requirements for leaks, installations, and charges of halocarbons listed in Schedule 1.
