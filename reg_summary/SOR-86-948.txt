These Regulations establish the conditions under which Canadian manufacturers or producers can claim a tax drawback on goods supplied as ships’ stores for use in equipping, repairing, or reconstructing ships or aircraft, or for laying or repairing oceanic telegraph cables abroad. A drawback is only granted if the goods are used exclusively outside Canada, meet specific eligibility criteria, and the claimant waives any rights of other parties to claim a refund.
