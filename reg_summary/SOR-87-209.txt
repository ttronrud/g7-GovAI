This regulation establishes a quota system for the interprovincial and export marketing of broiler hatching eggs in Canada, setting limits on how many eggs producers in signatory provinces can sell outside their province or abroad, based on allocations approved by provincial Commodity Boards. The quotas are designed to ensure that total marketing does not exceed specified provincial limits and are effective from April 1, 1987.
