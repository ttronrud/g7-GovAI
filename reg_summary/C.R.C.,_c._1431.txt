The Hull Construction Regulations establish safety standards for the construction and subdivision of ships, including requirements for watertight bulkheads, double bottoms, stability, and compartmentalization, with specific provisions based on ship class, size, and type of voyage. These regulations apply to new and existing ships, with exemptions allowed by the Board of Steamship Inspection under certain conditions, and require compliance with international safety standards for vessels engaged in international voyages.
