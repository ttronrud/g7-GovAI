This proclamation declares the Canada-Jamaica Social Security Agreement in force effective June 3, 1983, establishing reciprocal rights to old age, survivor, invalidity, and other social security benefits for citizens and residents of both countries, with specific rules on residence, contribution periods, and benefit calculations. It ensures that benefits are payable in the territory of the other party without reduction or cancellation due to residency, and includes transitional provisions for periods of residence and contribution credits.
