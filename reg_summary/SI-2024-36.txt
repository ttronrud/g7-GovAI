This regulation grants a fee remission for individuals affected by wildfires in Canada between April 1, 2024, and November 30, 2024, who lost, damaged, or had their documents rendered inaccessible due to the fires, allowing them to replace travel or citizenship documents without paying the associated fees. To qualify, applicants must prove their residency or presence in a wildfire-affected area at the time of the incident and submit a declaration and supporting evidence, with fees not previously remitted.
