This regulation revokes outdated part-time employment rules and establishes new exemptions, allowing certain part-time public servants—those working less than one-third of the standard hours or up to 15 hours per week—to be excluded from the full application of the Public Service Employment Act, effective January 1, 1981. It also replaces the old Part-time Employees Exclusion Approval Order and Part-time Employment Regulations with updated rules governing part-time work in the public service.
