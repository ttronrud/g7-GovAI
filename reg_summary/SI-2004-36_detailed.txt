**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Transfer of Public Service Control and Supervision under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (the "Act")

**Subject Matter:**  
The transfer of control and supervision of a specific public service function within the Department of the Environment.

**Scope of Transfer:**  
The control and supervision of the **Crown Corporation Secretariat** within the Department of the Environment — specifically, that portion of the public service responsible for the administrative and operational oversight of the following three Crown corporations:

1. **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)**  
2. **Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC)**  
3. **Queens Quay West Land Corporation (QQWLC)**

**Transfer From:**  
Department of the Environment

**Transfer To:**  
Office of Infrastructure of Canada

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

- **Functional Transfer:** The regulation does not transfer ownership or assets of the Crown corporations themselves, but rather the *public service functions* related to their administration, policy coordination, staffing, and operational support — specifically those managed by the Crown Corporation Secretariat.

- **Purpose of the Transfer:**  
  This reorganization aims to align public service responsibilities with broader government priorities, particularly those related to infrastructure development, land management, and housing policy. By transferring oversight to the Office of Infrastructure of Canada, the government seeks to:
  - Improve coordination between infrastructure planning and housing and land use policy;
  - Enhance efficiency and accountability in managing Crown corporation operations;
  - Strengthen integration of housing, land, and infrastructure decision-making across federal departments.

- **Implications:**
  - The Office of Infrastructure of Canada will now assume responsibility for policy, administrative, and supervisory functions related to the three Crown corporations.
  - The Department of the Environment will no longer have direct control or oversight over the administrative operations of these entities.
  - The Crown corporations themselves will continue to operate independently in their core business functions (e.g., mortgage financing, land acquisition, land development), but their administrative and public service support will now be under the purview of the Office of Infrastructure.

- **Legal Justification:**  
  The transfer is authorized under paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which permits the government to reassign public service functions between departments to improve governance, service delivery, and interdepartmental coordination.

**Effective Date:**  
Not specified in the provided text; however, such transfers typically take effect upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon ministerial direction.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal public service. It reflects a strategic shift to centralize infrastructure-related oversight and to strengthen the integration of housing, land, and infrastructure policy under a single, coordinated office — the Office of Infrastructure of Canada. The transfer ensures that the administrative management of key Crown corporations is now aligned with national infrastructure and land-use goals, improving policy coherence and operational efficiency.
