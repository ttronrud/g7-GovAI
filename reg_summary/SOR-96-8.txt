The Governor in Council varied Telecom Decision CRTC 95-21 by maintaining a rate rebalancing plan that includes local rate increases of $2 per month for Stentor companies (excluding Maritime Tel & Tel), while eliminating long-distance rate reductions and rejecting requests to change the rate of return calculation or rescind the rebalancing. The decision emphasizes sustaining investment in telecommunications and ensuring universal access through a revised contribution charge to local services.
