These Regulations establish standards for work-integrated learning activities under the Canada Labour Code, defining the requirements for educational institutions, documentation, and employer responsibilities, while adapting key labour standards—such as hours of work, leave, and medical leave—to apply specifically to students participating in work-integrated learning programs. They ensure that such students are protected under labour laws, with clear record-keeping obligations and modified provisions to reflect the nature of their work-based learning.
