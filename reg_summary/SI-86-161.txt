This regulation provides for a partial remission of customs duty on multi-level railway rolling stock imported from the U.S. before December 31, 1983, that were diverted to domestic service for over 90 days prior to 1984. The remission reduces the duty by $400 per car for each year of diversion and an additional $33 per month of temporary domestic service, with payment due within 90 days of notice.
