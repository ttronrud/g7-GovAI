This regulation amends the Canada-Barbados Double Taxation Agreement by clarifying residency rules, adjusting tax treatment of gains from property alienation, modifying tax credits and deductions, and expanding the scope of information exchange between the two countries, all with the aim of preventing double taxation and ensuring fair tax treatment for residents of both nations. The amended agreement enters into force on January 1, 2014, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
