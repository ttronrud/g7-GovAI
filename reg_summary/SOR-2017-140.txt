These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" (goods not imported for sale or industrial use) acquired in Ukraine, determining that such goods originate in Ukraine and qualify for Ukraine tariff benefits if they are marked according to Ukrainian marking laws or lack any indication they are not Ukrainian-made. The regulations came into force on August 1, 2017, or upon registration if later.
