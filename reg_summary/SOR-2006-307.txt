These regulations define what constitutes a "going-private transaction" under the Bank Act, specifically targeting amalgamations or transactions that terminate the rights of holders of participating securities in a bank or bank holding company without their consent and without replacing those rights with equivalent interests. The regulations come into force upon registration and apply to banks and bank holding companies, excluding federal credit unions, to ensure that participants are protected in such transactions.
