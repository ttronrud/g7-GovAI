This regulation establishes a retirement compensation arrangement effective December 15, 1994, allowing certain public service employees to contribute to a separate retirement fund in addition to their existing superannuation plans, with contributions based on salary and service periods, and benefits calculated in a specific manner that accounts for prior pensionable service. The arrangement applies to specific categories of employees, including deputy heads and those who were deemed employed in the public service before December 15, 1994, and provides for the transfer of accrued benefits to eligible employers or payment to participants in the event of a transfer or termination.
