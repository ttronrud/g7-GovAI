This regulation grants tax remission to Indigenous individuals and bands living on certain Indian Settlements for income tax and goods and services tax, based on the difference between taxes paid and what would have been payable if the settlement were treated as a reserve. Remission is subject to specific conditions, including timely written applications to the Minister of National Revenue.
