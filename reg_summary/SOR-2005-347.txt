These regulations establish rules for appointing public servants to bilingual positions, allowing non-imperative appointments for those excluded from bilingual roles due to language proficiency, with requirements for language training and reassignment if proficiency is not achieved within two years. They also permit extensions of the two-year language proficiency period under specific unforeseen circumstances, such as operational needs, personal issues, or disabilities.
