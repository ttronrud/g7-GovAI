On July 1, 1990, the Governor General in Council designated the National Capital Region—as defined in the National Capital Act—as the headquarters location for the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the Canadian Museum of Nature, and the National Museum of Science and Technology. This decision was made under section 25 of the Museums Act, based on the Prime Minister's recommendation.
