These Regulations establish the conditions and terms for capital subsidies to be provided for the construction of eligible commercial and fishing vessels in Canada, with the subsidy amount decreasing over time based on the completion date of the vessel. For non-fishing vessels, the subsidy ranges from 25% to 17% of the approved cost depending on when construction was completed, while fishing vessels receive up to 35% of the approved cost, and shipowners are required to maintain ownership and active use of the vessel for at least five years after completion.
