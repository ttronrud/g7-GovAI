This regulation approves the re-application of the Public Service Employment Act to positions previously excluded under Order P.C. 2012-437b, and excludes certain provisions of the Act from applying to indeterminate employees whose work units are relocated or whose services are no longer needed, particularly when they have not received a reasonable job offer. The decision was made after consultation with employers and based on the determination that applying these provisions would not be practicable or in the public interest.
