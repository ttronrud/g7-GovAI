This regulation revokes a previous order that granted remission of customs duties and sales tax on aircraft servicing equipment imported into Canada, but only if the foreign country or territory providing the service grants a similar privilege to Canadian-registered aircraft. The remission applies to machinery and equipment used exclusively to service foreign-registered aircraft at Canadian international airports, with sales tax reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission.
