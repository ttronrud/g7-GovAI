This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2010, based on historical export or production volumes, with specific formulas and conditions for primary producers and remanufacturers. It also creates a reserve pool to distribute any unallocated quantities and sets rules for relinquishing or transferring export allocations.
