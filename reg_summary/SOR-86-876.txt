These Regulations establish that goods exported to Canada from a country that pass through another country are deemed to be shipped directly to Canada if the journey is uninterrupted and the importer complies with relevant customs requirements. Importers must provide a bill of lading or other documentation when requested by a customs officer to verify the country of export.
