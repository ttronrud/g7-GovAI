This regulation establishes how the gratuity or unpaid balance of a deceased or former member's dependants' allowance is distributed—either to a single eligible person or divided among multiple persons in proportion to their monthly allowance. If not all eligible individuals apply, only those who do apply receive their share, based on what they would have received if all had applied, and injustice may be addressed in individual cases.
