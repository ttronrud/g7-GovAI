This regulation grants a remission of import duties and related taxes for household and personal effects imported by settlers from countries with capital transfer restrictions, provided the goods are purchased with funds on deposit in the country of emigration. The remission is conditional on the settler retaining the goods for at least 12 months; if sold or disposed of within that period, duties are immediately due and payable.
