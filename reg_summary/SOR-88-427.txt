These rules establish the procedures for pre-hearing conferences in criminal cases in the Yukon Territory, allowing judges to conduct informal meetings to discuss issues such as disclosure, potential resolutions, trial duration, and evidentiary matters, with the goal of promoting a fair, just, and expeditious trial. The conference may result in a report and recommendations, and the judge may direct further proceedings or motions, all while preserving the rights of the parties.
