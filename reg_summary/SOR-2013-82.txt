The Canada Employment Insurance Commission established the Social Insurance Number Regulations to govern the application, issuance, and management of Social Insurance Numbers, including requirements for identity verification, registration procedures, and validity periods—particularly for non-citizens and individuals with numbers beginning with "9." These regulations came into force on April 30, 2013, and include provisions for replacing lost cards, extending validity, and updating numbers upon changes in status or citizenship.
