This regulation authorizes Canadian residents to import margarine for personal use, with a limit of 3 kg per importation or up to 12 kg if accompanied by a medical prescription, under a general import permit issued by the Secretary of State for External Affairs. The permit applies to specific tariff classifications and requires importers to report the goods with a designated statement.
