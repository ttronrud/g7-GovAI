This regulation grants a remission of income tax to certain lenders and financing entities that provided loans to Telesat Canada, based on the difference between the taxes they would have paid under Canadian tax rules and the taxes they would have paid if a tax treaty between Canada and France had been in effect from October 30, 1987. The remission applies to amounts paid or credited by Telesat Canada under a specific loan agreement signed in 1987.
