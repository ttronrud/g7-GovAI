These regulations establish the timing and procedures for the federal government to credit amounts into the Nova Scotia Offshore Revenue Account based on specific petroleum-related revenues and for the subsequent payment of those amounts to the Province of Nova Scotia. Credits are made within 10 or two working days depending on the type of revenue, and payments to Nova Scotia are made monthly or within three working days after each credit.
