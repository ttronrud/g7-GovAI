These regulations establish the methodology for calculating Crown share adjustment payments to Nova Scotia for offshore petroleum projects, based on project revenues, costs, and profits, with specific definitions and formulas for provincial share percentages, gross revenues, capital and income tax obligations, and interest calculations. The payments are determined annually, with adjustments for inflation, project-specific forecasts, and fiscal incentives, and are subject to review and approval by both federal and provincial ministers.
