This regulation revokes a previous order and establishes a new withdrawal from disposal of certain lands in the Kelly Lake area of the Northwest Territories, pursuant to the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, to protect and set aside the lands for cultural and environmental purposes. The withdrawal applies for a period until those lands are designated as a territorial park, while preserving existing rights, permits, and interests—except for mining and mineral rights, which are specifically reserved.
