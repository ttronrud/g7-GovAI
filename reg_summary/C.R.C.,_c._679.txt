This regulation establishes the Canadian Forces Laundries Order, permitting the use of military laundries to launder, dry clean, or press personal property of Canadian Forces personnel, their dependents, and civilian employees when civilian facilities are unavailable and the service does not exceed capacity or increase costs. It also outlines specific pricing, including half-price pressing, and sets procedures for settling claims related to loss or damage, based on claim amount and whether negligence is involved.
