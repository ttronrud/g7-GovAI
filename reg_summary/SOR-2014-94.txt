The Canadian Transportation Agency has established Rules of Procedure for Rail Level of Service Arbitration to ensure a fair, efficient, and impartial resolution of disputes between rail parties, with procedures that promote settlement, confidentiality, and procedural flexibility. These rules govern key aspects of arbitration, including pre-hearing meetings, evidence submission, witness examination, hearing conduct, and decision timelines, while allowing the arbitrator discretion to adapt procedures as needed.
