This regulation designates the critical habitat for the endangered Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Northeast Pacific southern resident population, based on the species' recovery strategy and public registry, and comes into force upon registration. It is issued under the Species at Risk Act, following consultation with wildlife management boards, and repeals a previous order on critical habitat for the same species.
