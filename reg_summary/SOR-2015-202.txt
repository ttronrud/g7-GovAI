These regulations implement the Red Tape Reduction Act by establishing a method to calculate the administrative burden of regulations, requiring that regulations imposing new burdens be amended or repealed within 24 months, with exemptions for tax-related, legally binding, or emergency regulations, and mandating an annual report on changes in administrative costs and regulatory amendments.
