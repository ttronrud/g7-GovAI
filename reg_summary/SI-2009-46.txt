This regulation repeals Order in Council P.C. 2008-799 and specific paragraphs of the Public Service Employment Act, effective July 1, 2009, and January 1, 2016, respectively, thereby removing outdated provisions related to department and deputy head definitions. The changes were made under the authority of the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
