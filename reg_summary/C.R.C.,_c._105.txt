These Regulations establish height limits for buildings and structures near Regina Airport, Saskatchewan, restricting all constructions to stay below specified surfaces—such as the horizontal surface, approach surfaces, and transitional surfaces—defined by precise geographic boundaries and elevation criteria. The horizontal surface is a 150-foot plane above the airport reference point, and no structure may exceed its elevation, with exceptions for natural growth and bird-related waste disposal restrictions.
