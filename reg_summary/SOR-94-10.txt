The Minister of National Revenue has revoked the 1985 Marking of Imported Goods Regulations and replaced them with updated regulations effective when section 133 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) Implementation Act came into force, requiring imported goods to be marked with their country of origin in a legible, permanent manner, with specific language and marking requirements depending on whether the goods originate from CUSMA or non-CUSMA countries. These regulations also establish rules for marking iron or steel pipes, paper products, and containers, and allow for marking in Canada under certain conditions.
