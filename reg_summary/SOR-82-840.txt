These regulations allow Canadian residents to temporarily import conveyances (such as vehicles or aircraft) for specific purposes, including commuting between Canada and the United States or transporting household goods, with strict conditions on use and export timelines. The conveyance must be used solely for personal or business-related travel, not for hire, tourism, or transporting goods, and must be exported within a specified time frame—either by the declared date or within 30 days, with possible extensions of up to 60 days if needed.
