These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Mayo Airport in the Yukon Territory, prohibiting the construction of any structure or object whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all of which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria around the airport. The regulations apply to all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, as outlined in the zoning plan, to ensure safe aircraft operations.
