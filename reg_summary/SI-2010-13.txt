This regulation establishes the Convention on Social Security between Canada and Morocco, which enters into force on March 1, 2010, to ensure equal treatment and coordination of social security benefits (such as old age, disability, and survivors' pensions) for residents of both countries. It allows for the totalization of insurance periods and residence periods to determine eligibility and benefit amounts, while ensuring benefits are paid without reduction due to residency in the other country.
