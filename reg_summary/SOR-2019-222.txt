These regulations clarify that certain activities—such as brokering transactions between affiliated corporations involving non-scheduled goods for end-use by affiliates, or brokering by Canadian citizens or permanent residents abroad on behalf of non-Canadian employers—do not constitute brokering under the Export and Import Permits Act. The regulations come into force on the date specified in the enabling statute or upon registration, whichever is later.
