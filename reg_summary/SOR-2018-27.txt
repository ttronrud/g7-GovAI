The Quebec Hog Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order establishes a levy system requiring pig producers in Quebec to pay a per-kilogram fee based on the net weight of hogs (at least 65 kg) and a flat fee of $8.97 per sow or boar sold interprovincially or exported, with payments due by the 15th of each month. The order comes into force upon registration and repeals the previous version.
