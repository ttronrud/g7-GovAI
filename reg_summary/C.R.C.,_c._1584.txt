These Regulations establish the procedures for administering the service estates of deceased Canadian veterans, defining what constitutes a service estate and outlining the priority payment of service debts, the distribution of assets to executors or beneficiaries, and the handling of financial instruments and insurance proceeds. The Estates Officer manages the estate, with certain assets directed to the Receiver General for credit to the deceased’s account, and compliance with these regulations discharges officials from liability for proper administration.
