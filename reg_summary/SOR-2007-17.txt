These regulations establish export limits and exemption conditions for certain softwood lumber producers under the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006, based on production levels and reference prices, with exemptions granted only if annual exports do not exceed export limits by more than 0.5% over four consecutive years. If an excess occurs, the exporter’s limit is reduced progressively—by the excess amount, twice, or three times—depending on the number of exceedances.
