The Canadian government established standardized Specifications for electronic railway track scales used in in-motion weighing, ensuring accuracy, safety, and proper operation through requirements for wheel detectors, dynamic and static modes, tare weight limitations, data integrity, and clear labeling. These specifications apply to all such scales used in trade and mandate features like velocity limits, anti-fraud measures, and proper documentation to ensure reliable and legally valid weight measurements.
