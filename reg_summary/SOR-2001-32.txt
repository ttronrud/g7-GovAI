This regulation establishes the framework for registering individuals and businesses that handle "controlled goods" under the Defence Production Act, requiring security assessments, detailed record-keeping, and strict conditions on the examination, possession, and transfer of such goods. It also provides exemptions for certain individuals, such as those working under U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations or government officials, and outlines procedures for temporary workers, international students, and visitors to apply for exemption from registration.
