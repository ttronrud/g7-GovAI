This regulation grants tax and customs duty remission for commercial samples imported into Canada for temporary exhibition or demonstration purposes, provided certain conditions are met, including the importer's non-resident status or role as a foreign supplier’s agent, the sample's ownership remaining with a non-resident, proper documentation and record-keeping, and export within one year (extendable by six months if necessary). Failure to comply with these conditions results in the sample being entered for consumption.
