This regulation proclaims the entry into force of the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Slovak Republic on January 1, 2003, establishing rules for the mutual recognition and calculation of social security benefits, including old age, invalidity, and survivor’s pensions, based on creditable periods of contributions, residence, and employment. It ensures that eligible individuals, regardless of where they reside, can accumulate and receive benefits under either country’s social security system without reduction or suspension due to cross-border residency.
