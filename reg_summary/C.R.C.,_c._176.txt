The Ontario Bean Order establishes the authority of the Ontario Bean Producers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board) to impose and collect levies or charges on producers and marketers of beans in Ontario for interprovincial and export trade, with the funds used to create reserves, cover expenses, and equalize revenues among producers. These levies are applied based on producer groups and may be adjusted over time to ensure fair distribution of marketing proceeds.
