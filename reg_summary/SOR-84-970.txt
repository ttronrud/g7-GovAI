These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Watson Lake Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting the height of structures, natural growth, and waste disposal near the airport, with specific surfaces—such as approach, transitional, and outer surfaces—defined to control elevations around runways and airport boundaries. No structure or natural growth may exceed the prescribed elevation limits, and waste that attracts birds is prohibited.
