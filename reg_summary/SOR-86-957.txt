The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, revoked previous trespass regulations and introduced the Defence Controlled Access Area Regulations to govern access, exclusion, and conduct within defence establishments, work sites, or materiel areas. These regulations require passes for entry, restrict unauthorized access, mandate compliance with security directives, and prohibit disruptive behaviour, alcohol, and unauthorized equipment to ensure safety and security.
