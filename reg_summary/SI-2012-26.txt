This regulation repeals an old order and establishes a new framework for the Interim Federal Health Program, outlining who is eligible for health care coverage and medical examinations, including protected persons, refugee claimants, and resettled refugees, while setting limits based on public health, safety, and existing provincial or private insurance coverage. It grants the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration authority to pay for certain health services and medical exams under specific conditions, with provisions for exceptions in exceptional circumstances.
