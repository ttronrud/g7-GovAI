These regulations define the regulatory capital of insurance companies in Canada, specifying that it is calculated based on minority interests, subordinated indebtedness, excess of assets over liabilities, and certain deferred capital gains (for life companies), plus goodwill, all determined according to prescribed financial reporting standards. Regulatory capital is only included for securities that are subordinate to policy and other liabilities, are fully paid up, and meet specific terms such as a minimum five-year term or no term, with no redemption or purchase in the first five years.
