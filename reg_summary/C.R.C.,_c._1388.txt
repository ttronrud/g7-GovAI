These Regulations establish the criteria and conditions for granting development incentives in Canada, specifying eligible assets and operations, defining key terms such as commercial operation and initial processing, and setting requirements for capital costs, job creation, equity contributions, and compliance with public interest and regional development goals. They also outline procedures for application, approval, monitoring, and the conditions under which incentives may be amended or withdrawn.
