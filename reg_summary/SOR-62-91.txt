These regulations extend pensionable service eligibility to certain support organizations and positions in the South African and British Royal Navies, allowing members to count full-time service in these roles as pensionable service under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, provided they elect to do so within one year of becoming a contributor. Contributions for such service are set at the same rate and paid in the same manner as for other specified elective service periods.
