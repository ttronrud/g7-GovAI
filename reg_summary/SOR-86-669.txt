These regulations establish a service charge system for Ontario producers of certain fresh fruits, requiring a $0.0035 per pound charge for plums, prunes, or pears and a $0.0078 per pound charge for peaches, which must be paid to the Ontario Tender Fruit Producers’ Marketing Board either by the producer directly or deducted by dealer-shippers and remitted within 21 days.
