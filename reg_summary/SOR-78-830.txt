This regulation revokes outdated game hunting rules in Wood Buffalo National Park and establishes new, detailed guidelines for hunting, trapping, and wildlife protection within the park. It restricts hunting to specific seasons, limits game take, prohibits certain activities near sensitive areas or wildlife habitats, and mandates permits for all hunting and trapping activities, with strict rules on possession, use, and renewal of permits.
