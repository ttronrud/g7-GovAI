This regulation grants a remission of customs duties and sales tax on imported computer carrier media (such as software) imported on or after January 1, 1985, based on the difference between duties and taxes paid on the media and those that would apply to the physical carrier excluding the value of stored data. Remission is only available if a claim is filed within two years of import and if the claimant provides required reports and information to the Minister of National Revenue.
