This regulation grants remission of customs duties for certain goods imported between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004, by reducing the duties paid to the difference between the Most-Favoured-Nation or General Preferential Tariff rates (as of January 1, 2003) and the previously eligible Chile Tariff rate. The remission must be claimed within four years of importation.
