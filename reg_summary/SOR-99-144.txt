These regulations, enacted on April 1, 1999, govern the transition of public service employees who moved from the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority to a new employer, ensuring their superannuation rights are protected, including pension eligibility, death benefits, and allowances, while defining key terms and timelines for applying those rights. They apply to individuals who ceased public service employment and began working with the new employer on or after April 1, 1999, and establish specific rules regarding service credit, eligibility periods, and benefits.
