These regulations establish the framework for sex offender registration in the Northwest Territories, authorizing RCMP officers and designated personnel to collect and register information, with reporting requirements including telephone submissions where applicable, and setting the NWTSOIRC as the central registration center for the territory. The regulations come into force on the later of the date the parent Act takes effect or the date of registration.
