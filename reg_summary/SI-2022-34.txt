This regulation proclaims that the Canada-Albania Agreement on Social Security enters into force on August 1, 2022, establishing rules for the recognition and calculation of social security benefits, including old age, invalidity, and survivors’ benefits, based on creditable periods of contribution or residence in either country. It ensures that individuals who have worked or resided in both countries are eligible for benefits under the same conditions as citizens of either country, with provisions for benefit totalization, no reduction based on residency, and mutual administrative cooperation.
