This regulation grants the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the marketing of pullets—female chickens under 20 weeks old—both within Manitoba and in interprovincial and export trade. The Board may establish levies or charges on producers, classify them into groups, and use the collected funds for operational expenses, reserves, and equitable distribution of profits among producers.
