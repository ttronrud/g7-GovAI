These regulations establish a framework for compensating eligible importers of crude oil and petroleum products into Canada, based on changes in transportation costs and tax paid costs, with compensation subject to eligibility criteria, price maintenance undertakings, and specific exclusions for exported or non-Canadian-use fuel. Import compensation is capped at $0.90 per barrel and may be supplemented by special payments if the Board determines that strict application would cause undue financial hardship.
