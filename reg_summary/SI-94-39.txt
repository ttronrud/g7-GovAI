This regulation grants a partial refund of certain fees paid under the Atomic Energy Control Act when a licence or approval is revoked, changed, or its fee is reduced, based on the proportion of the fee period remaining after the change. The refund is calculated as a fraction of the original fee, determined by the number of days remaining in the fee period relative to the total days in the period.
