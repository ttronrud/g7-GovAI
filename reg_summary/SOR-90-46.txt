This regulation establishes a new method for electing chiefs and councillors in specified Indigenous bands, mandates the division of certain reserves into electoral sections for voting purposes, and revokes previous election rules under the Indian Act. It applies to specific bands, including Frenchmans Head, Kejick Bay, Whitefish Bay, and Canoe River, and ensures that councillors are elected by a majority of electors, with the chief elected either by band-wide vote or by elected councillors.
