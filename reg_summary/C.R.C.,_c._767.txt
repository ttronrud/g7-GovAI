This regulation grants remission of customs duty and taxes on preferential tariff goods that are transhipped into Canada due to circumstances beyond the importer's control, but only if direct shipment was not possible and evidence is provided. The remission equals the difference between the duty and taxes under the British Preferential Tariff and those that would apply under the standard tariff of the transhipment country.
