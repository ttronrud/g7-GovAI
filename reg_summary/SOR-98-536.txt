This regulation grants remission of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on charitable food donations imported into Canada by registered charities, provided the food is for charitable distribution, not for sale, and a remission claim is filed within two years of accounting. The Order applies to food for human consumption and comes into force upon registration.
