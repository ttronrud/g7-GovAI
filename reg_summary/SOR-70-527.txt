These regulations establish the framework for determining and paying claims by Canadian citizens against the Government of Hungary or Hungarian citizens, based on specific historical events such as nationalization, pre-1947 insurance debts, and treaty obligations, with payments drawn from the Foreign Claims Fund. The Commission evaluates claims, determines eligibility and award amounts, and ensures payments are made only to Canadian citizens or their legal heirs under strict conditions, including timely notice and no compensation from other sources.
