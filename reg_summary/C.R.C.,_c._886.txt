The Airport Traffic Regulations establish rules for the operation of motor vehicles, parking, and pedestrian movement on Canadian airports, defining key terms and imposing restrictions on speed, access, and vehicle use, with penalties for violations. These regulations apply to airport areas outside those specified in Schedule I or II, and require drivers to comply with speed limits, traffic signs, and parking rules, including obtaining permission to park on aprons or in restricted areas.
