This regulation grants the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its authorized agents exemption from customs duties and sales tax on printed matter, official publications, and production materials imported into or purchased in Canada, provided they meet specific certification requirements. The exemption applies only when the goods are used for genuine UNESCO purposes and are accompanied by valid certificates from senior officers or authorized agents.
