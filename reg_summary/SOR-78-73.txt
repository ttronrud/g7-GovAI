This regulation revokes an old order relating to gold francs and establishes new rules for converting gold francs into Canadian dollars under the Canada Shipping Act, using a two-step process: first converting gold francs to Special Drawing Rights (S.D.R.) at a fixed rate of 15.075 gold francs per S.D.R., and then converting S.D.R. to Canadian dollars at the rate set by the International Monetary Fund.
