These regulations establish the conditions under which duties paid on imported new motor vehicles or imported goods used in processing such vehicles in Canada can be refunded (drawback) if the resulting vehicles are temporarily used in Canada and subsequently exported. A drawback is only granted if the vehicle is sold to a Canadian purchaser before export, remains owned and used solely by that purchaser for non-commercial purposes, and meets specific timelines and usage requirements.
