These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Chesterfield Inlet Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all of which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria around the airport. The regulations apply to lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport and are based on a 1988 zoning plan, with the airport reference point set at 6.0 meters above sea level.
