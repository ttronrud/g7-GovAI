These regulations designate two marine protected areas in Bonavista Bay—Eastport–Duck Island and Eastport–Round Island—prohibiting activities that disturb or destroy marine life or habitats, with limited exceptions for Aboriginal fishing, public safety, and approved scientific or educational activities. Scientific or educational activities require a 60-day plan submission and Ministerial approval based on environmental impact assessments, with strict conditions to prevent harm to marine ecosystems.
