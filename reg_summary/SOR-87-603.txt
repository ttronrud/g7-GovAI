This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at La Ronge Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations by limiting structures and natural growth to specific elevation boundaries defined by approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. It prohibits any construction or growth exceeding these surfaces and applies to lands within defined outer limits adjacent to the airport.
