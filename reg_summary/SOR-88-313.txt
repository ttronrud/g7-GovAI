The Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee established these Rules of Practice and Procedure to govern how grievances, disciplinary appeals, and other matters are reviewed, including requirements for submissions, hearings, conflict of interest disclosures, record filing, and procedural conduct. The Rules ensure transparency, fairness, and consistency in the Committee’s proceedings while providing clear timelines, notice requirements, and procedures for hearings and record production.
