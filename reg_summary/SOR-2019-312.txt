The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) has adopted a by-law requiring member financial institutions to disclose detailed information about co-owned deposits, trust arrangements, and special income arrangements (such as RRSPs and TFSA) on their records before a specified "determination date." This includes identifying co-owners, trustees, beneficiaries, and their interests, as well as ensuring nominee brokers and professional trustees provide accurate, up-to-date information in writing or electronically, with specific requirements for attestations and compliance notifications.
