This regulation establishes rules for mortgage insurance arrangements between financial institutions (such as banks, trust companies, and insurance companies) and insurers, defining what constitutes the "actual cost" of mortgage insurance and prohibiting payments or benefits related to marketing, advertising, or promotional activities. It comes into force on July 1, 2010, and applies only when the institution or its affiliates do not charge borrowers for the insurance.
