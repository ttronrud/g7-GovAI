This regulation establishes a system under which prescribed railway companies in Canada must pay out excess revenue from grain transport—either 5% or 15% of the excess, depending on its size—to the Western Grains Research Foundation if their grain transport revenues exceed their maximum revenue entitlement for a crop year. The payment must be made within 30 days of receiving a decision from the Canadian Transportation Agency and must be sent via certified cheque, money order, or bank draft.
