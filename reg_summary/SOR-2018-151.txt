These regulations establish exemptions for police officers and military police from certain cannabis-related offences and restrictions when they handle cannabis during a particular investigation, provided they are acting in the course of their duties. They also outline reporting requirements for the possession, transfer, disposal, and loss of seized cannabis, ensuring accountability and transparency in law enforcement operations under the Cannabis Act.
