This regulation establishes the geographical coordinates of points from which baselines are determined for Canada’s territorial sea in Area 7, the Canadian Arctic Islands and Mainland, effective January 1, 1986, under the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act. It defines baselines as straight lines, low-water lines along the coast, or low-water lines of islands and low-tide elevations, depending on the schedule to which the coordinates belong.
