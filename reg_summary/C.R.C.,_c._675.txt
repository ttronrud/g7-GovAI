These Regulations establish the rules for assigning Crown debts under the Financial Administration Act, specifying the forms and documentation required for notices of assignment, including requirements for corporations, partnerships, and foreign assignments, and designate specific paying officers. They also define certain types of moneys—such as veterans’ land compensation, expropriation payments, excise rebates, and mortgage insurance guarantees—as classes of Crown debts subject to assignment.
