The Governor in Council has discontinued the requirement for certain annual departmental reports to be prepared and submitted to Parliament, as they contain no additional or equivalent information to that already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates. This decision was made under section 157 of the Financial Administration Act, based on recommendations from the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board.
