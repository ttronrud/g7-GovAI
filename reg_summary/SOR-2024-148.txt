These regulations establish fees for applications to construct, alter, or rebuild various types of works in navigable waters under the Canadian Navigable Waters Act, with fees based on the type of work and the submission period, and require a $66,000 fee for exemption applications. The fees are payable to the Minister of Transport and apply to each individual work when multiple works are involved.
