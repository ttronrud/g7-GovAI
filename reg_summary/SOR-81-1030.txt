This regulation establishes the framework for corporations exempt from real property tax, frontage or area tax, and business occupancy tax under the Municipal Grants Act to make payments in lieu of these taxes, based on their property value, dimension, or occupancy. The payments must be at least equal to the applicable tax rate multiplied by the property’s value or dimension, with certain deductions allowed for special arrangements or service costs, and disputes resolved by designated ministers or the Minister of Public Works and Government Services. 

*(Note: The regulation was repealed in 2001 and 2006, and thus is no longer in force.)*
