This regulation authorizes Canadian inspectors under the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Act to issue certificates attesting to the age and origin of distilled spirits produced or packaged in Canada, provided certain conditions are met, such as verifiable records and proper labeling of storage containers. These certificates are only issued for spirits meeting specific domestic content requirements—particularly a minimum of 75% Canadian-origin spirits—when the product bears references to "Canadian" in its name or designation.
