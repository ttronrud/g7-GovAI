This regulation establishes mandatory fire and boat drills for Canadian self-propelled vessels requiring safety certificates, requiring masters to maintain and post muster and rescue boat lists, provide emergency instructions to passengers, and conduct regular drills—such as fire and survival craft drills—at least monthly, with specific requirements based on vessel type, crew participation, and passenger presence. It also outlines procedures for passenger safety, emergency communication, and equipment readiness during drills and actual emergencies.
