These regulations, enacted on November 29, 1991, adapt provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act and the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act to ensure pension protection for employees of Petro-Canada Limited, aligning retirement years and pensionable service periods with employment at Petro-Canada rather than the Public Service. Specifically, they treat Petro-Canada employment as part of pensionable service and adjust retirement years and contribution cessation dates to reflect employment with Petro-Canada.
