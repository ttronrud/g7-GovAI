These regulations establish minimum pricing for asparagus produced in Ontario that is sold interprovincially or exported, prohibiting any sale or purchase below the price set by the Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing Board. The rules apply to producers with at least half an acre of land and who have grown asparagus for at least two years.
