This regulation strengthens controls on nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) by restricting their sale to approved dosage forms, prohibiting flavours associated with confectionery or beverages, banning marketing that could appeal to young people or mislead about use, and requiring clear warnings about nicotine’s addictive nature. It also establishes specific labeling and advertising requirements, with a six-month grace period for compliance.
