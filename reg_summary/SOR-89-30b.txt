This regulation establishes the framework for appointing target group members (including Indigenous peoples, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities) to positions within employment equity programs in the Public Service from January 1, 1989, to March 31, 1993, allowing appointments based on qualifications and capacity, while revoking previous exclusion orders and regulations that limited such appointments. It also provides that appointments to non-equity-program positions may be made for an indeterminate period for individuals who previously served in training roles under equity programs, and that these Regulations supersede conflicting provisions in the Public Service Employment Regulations.
