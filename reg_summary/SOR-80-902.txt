The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, has approved the revocation of the previous Vancouver International Airport Zoning Regulations and replaced them with new regulations that establish strict elevation limits for structures and natural growth near the airport to ensure aviation safety. These limits define approach, transitional, and outer surfaces around the airport, restricting any construction or vegetation that exceeds specified heights.
