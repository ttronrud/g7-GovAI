This regulation grants remission of certain unemployment insurance premiums paid by employees of the Cape Breton Development Corporation who received a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan, but only to the extent that the premium amount exceeds any severance benefit paid to the individual. The order is specifically for employees whose insurable employment was under the corporation’s Pre-Retirement Leave Plan and who received a disability pension before June 8, 1989.
