This regulation grants a customs duty remission for certain goods imported between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002, by reducing the duties paid to the difference between the Most-Favoured-Nation or General Preferential Tariff rates (as of January 1, 2002) and the previously available Chile Tariff rate. The remission is subject to a claim being made to the Minister of National Revenue within four years of import.
