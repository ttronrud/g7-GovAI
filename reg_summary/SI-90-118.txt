This regulation grants a remission of income tax to Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company, Limited for the 1989 and subsequent taxation years, based on a specific tax treatment of its lease agreement with Ontario Hydro and power rights acquisition, provided certain conditions are met, including the proper accounting of costs and compliance with the Power Rights Agreement. The remission applies when the actual tax liability exceeds what would be payable under specific provisions of the Income Tax Act if the lease and power agreement were treated as a business property transfer.
