This regulation directs the discontinuation of annual reports on the Canadian Centre for Management Development and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, as these reports contain no additional information beyond what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates, pursuant to section 157a of the Financial Administration Act. The reports are no longer required to be prepared or laid before Parliament.
