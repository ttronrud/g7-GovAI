This regulation establishes a provincial levy on eggs marketed interprovincially or exported, with different rates for each province, and authorizes the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency to collect and distribute these levies through provincial commodity boards. The levies are designed to support the implementation of the Agency’s marketing plan, with specific provisions for excess quotas and deductions at grading stations.
