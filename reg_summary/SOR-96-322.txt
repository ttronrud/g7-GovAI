The Governor in Council varied a previous CRTC decision to allow independent telephone directory publishers access to non-confidential residential listings for publishing telephone directories, without reselling or disposing of the data, and directed the CRTC to report on privacy protections for subscriber listings across emerging telecommunications services by December 30, 1996. This change supports fair competition and strengthens privacy safeguards while ensuring cost-effectiveness and neutrality in the market.
