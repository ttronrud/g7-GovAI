The Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations establish requirements for labeling prepackaged products in Canada, including the mandatory display of net quantity, identity, and principal place of business on the principal display panel, with specific formatting and language rules. Certain products, such as those for export, industrial use, or specific categories like textiles or replacement parts, are exempt from full labeling requirements, and special provisions apply to local, test market, and specialty products regarding language use and exemptions.
