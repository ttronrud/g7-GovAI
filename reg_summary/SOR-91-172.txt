These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Thompson Airport in Manitoba, defining elevation limits for buildings and structures to ensure aviation safety, with specific surfaces (approach, transitional, and outer) that no structure may exceed in height. The regulations apply to lands within a defined boundary and prohibit the disposal of bird-attractive waste, while allowing removal of natural growth that exceeds these limits.
