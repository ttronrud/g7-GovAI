These regulations establish specific conditions under which insurance companies or insurance holding companies can issue "delivery shares" to a particular subsidiary for acquisition, ensuring the shares are issued at fair market value, traded on a Canadian stock exchange, and transferred to shareholders of another non-Canadian entity, with strict requirements on residency and arm’s-length transactions. If conditions are not met, the shares must be canceled, the consideration returned, and the capital account entry canceled within 30 days.
