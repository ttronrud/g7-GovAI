The Tax Court of Canada revoked the previous Tax Review Board Rules and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Award of Costs, effective January 1, 1991, and replaced them with new Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and (Informal Procedure), which came into effect on the same date. These rules govern the procedural aspects of proceedings in the Tax Court, including filing, time limits, document handling, and court conduct, and are designed to ensure fair, efficient, and cost-effective resolution of tax disputes.
