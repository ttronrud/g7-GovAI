This regulation is a proclamation by the Governor General of Canada announcing that the Protocol to the Convention on Social Security between Canada and Spain entered into force on May 1, 1997. It establishes specific provisions for the treatment of non-contributory social security benefits for Canadian citizens in Spain, modifies key articles on contribution periods and benefit calculations, and ensures that benefits awarded prior to the Protocol’s entry into force can be reviewed or recalculated without reducing the amount received.
