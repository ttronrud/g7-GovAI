These regulations establish the requirements for persons exporting or importing oil, gas, or electricity to submit monthly reports to the National Energy Board, detailing quantities, prices, destinations, and other relevant information. The reports must include specific data by licence or order, with exceptions for certain transfers (e.g., border accommodation) that require reporting every six months, and all measurements must comply with standardized conditions for accuracy and consistency.
