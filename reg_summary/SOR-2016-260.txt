The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, has established the Port of Prince Rupert Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities Regulations under the Canada Marine Act, designating liquefied natural gas and related activities at the port as a class of undertaking subject to British Columbia’s incorporated laws, with specific adaptations to align with provincial regulations and the governance of the Prince Rupert Port Authority. These regulations apply to processing, storage, and pipeline operations at the port, with key provisions governing enforcement, penalties, land use, and the interpretation of BC laws, while excluding certain federal and port authority powers.
