These Regulations establish the administration and registration of offshore interests and instruments in the Newfoundland offshore area, setting out the procedures for registering interests, maintaining records, and handling notices, cancellations, and changes, all under the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act. They designate the Registrar to oversee the system, require detailed abstracts of interests, and ensure transparency through public access to records and certified copies.
