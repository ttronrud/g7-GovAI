The Governor in Council decided not to list the Cultus and Sakinaw populations of Pacific sockeye salmon, polar bears, the Northwestern grizzly bear, and the Western wolverine due to the severe economic and social impacts on the south coast British Columbia fishing sector and First Nations communities, and referred the speckled dace assessment back to COSEWIC for further review due to inconsistencies and incomplete documentation in the original assessment.
