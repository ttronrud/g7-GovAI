These regulations establish the framework for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce to provide loans and insurance to Canadian manufacturers for restructuring purposes, particularly to help them compete internationally, adjust to foreign market changes, or avoid serious injury from increased imports. The loans and insurance are subject to strict conditions, including requirements for financial viability, specific restructuring activities, and limits on the total amount of assistance provided.
