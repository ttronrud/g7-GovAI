This regulation re-applies most provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to student employment programs (such as the Federal Student Work Experience Program and co-op/internship programs), while excluding specific sections that relate to employment conditions, hiring, and disciplinary matters, effective from May 12, 2010. The exclusion is made after consultation with the Public Service Commission and allows student participants to be governed by a modified version of the Act tailored to their temporary, educational roles.
