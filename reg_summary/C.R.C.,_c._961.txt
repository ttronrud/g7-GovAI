The Indian Timber Regulations govern the cutting of timber on surrendered and reserve lands in Canada, requiring a licence for all timber harvesting and establishing rules on dues, measurement, payment, and enforcement. Violations carry fines or imprisonment, and the Minister has broad authority to manage timber operations, enforce compliance, and seize unmeasured or illegally harvested timber.
