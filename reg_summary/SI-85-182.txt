This regulation revokes an old order and replaces it with a new one that grants remission of customs duties and excise taxes on certain imported goods transported by courier, with specific value limits and exclusions, including cannabis products, alcoholic beverages, and publications. Remission applies to goods valued at $20 or less (except from Mexico or the U.S.), with higher thresholds for goods from those countries, and claims must be made within two years of importation.
