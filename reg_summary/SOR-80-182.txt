These Regulations establish the procedures for the winding-up of livestock pedigree associations incorporated under the Livestock Pedigree Act, including voluntary winding-up by members, court-supervised winding-up in cases of insolvency or disputes, and the distribution of remaining assets according to the association’s by-laws or incorporation documents. The Minister may terminate the winding-up process upon satisfaction that all obligations are discharged and no property remains, and a final certificate of termination is issued.
