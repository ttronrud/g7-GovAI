This regulation establishes temporary employment terms for individuals in specific groups within the Department of Forestry, allowing appointments for periods of less than three months (totaling less than six months in any 12-month period) without being subject to the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act. It grants the Deputy Head authority to recruit, appoint, and terminate such temporary staff with one day’s notice for cause or due to lack of work.
