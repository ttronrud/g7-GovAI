This regulation cancels an old import permit for turkeys and turkey products and replaces it with a new general permit allowing Canadian residents to import one turkey or up to 10 kg of turkey products for personal use, effective when certain WTO implementation laws came into force. The permit specifies eligible turkey products and requires importers to report the import under a designated statement.
