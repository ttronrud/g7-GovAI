The Minister designates the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (ICCRC) as a body under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that allows its members in good standing to represent or advise individuals in immigration proceedings. Members of the former Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants are automatically deemed members of the ICCRC for up to 120 days after the regulations come into force, during which time they are exempt from paying membership fees.
