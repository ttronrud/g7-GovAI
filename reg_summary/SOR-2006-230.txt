The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, has established interest rate regulations under the Excise Tax Act, setting different interest rates for various payments based on a quarterly basic rate derived from Treasury Bill yields. The basic rate is calculated as the average yield of three-month Treasury Bills auctioned during the first month of each quarter, and interest rates are adjusted accordingly depending on whether the interest is paid to the Receiver General, individuals, corporations, or in other cases.
