This regulation outlines the types of moving and related expenses eligible for a removal allowance under the Judges Act, including travel, storage, temporary stays, mortgage differences, and losses due to unsold properties, with specific rules on eligibility, documentation, and fair market value determination through independent appraisals. It also establishes time limits for selling the former residence and provides mechanisms for extending those periods in cases of market difficulties.
