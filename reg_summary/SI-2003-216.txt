On December 12, 2003, the Canada Border Services Agency assumed control of the Customs Branch, key investigative and appeal divisions, and regional customs administration functions from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, excluding collection-related responsibilities. This transfer was made under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act to streamline border enforcement and customs operations.
