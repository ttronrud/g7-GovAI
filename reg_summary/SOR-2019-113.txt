This regulation establishes comprehensive security requirements for the transportation of certain dangerous goods by rail in Canada, mandating that railway carriers and railway loaders implement written security plans, conduct visual inspections, report potential threats to Transport Canada, designate a rail security coordinator, and provide regular security and awareness training to employees. These requirements apply specifically to security-sensitive dangerous goods listed in Schedule 1, with exemptions for certain low-risk or exempted goods.
