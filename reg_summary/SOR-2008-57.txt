These regulations establish specific conditions under which a bank or bank holding company can issue shares to a subsidiary for acquisition, ensuring the shares are issued at fair market value, traded on a Canadian stock exchange, and transferred to shareholders of another non-Canadian entity, with requirements for arm’s length transactions and non-residency. If conditions are not met, the shares must be canceled, the consideration returned, and the capital account adjusted within 30 days.
