These regulations govern the payment of reasonable travelling and other expenses to Parliamentary Secretaries for duties performed away from Ottawa or their ordinary residence, and allow for accountable advances that must be accounted for monthly. Upon leaving office, a Parliamentary Secretary must submit an accounting within 30 days for any outstanding advances, detailing the purpose, itinerary, and amounts spent on trips and related expenses.
