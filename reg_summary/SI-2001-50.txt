This regulation grants rent remission to leaseholders in national parks for leases fixed in 2000, where the remission amount equals the difference between rental rates in the second year and the last year of a ten-year period, or the sum of two rate differences for a two-year period. The remission is made under the Financial Administration Act to support the public interest in managing national park leases.
