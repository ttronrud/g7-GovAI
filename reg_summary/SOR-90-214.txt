The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked the previous Quebec Fishery Regulations and introduced the Quebec Fishery Regulations, 1990, which came into effect on April 1, 1990, to establish rules for fishing in Quebec, including definitions of gear, species, and fishing areas, and to regulate fishing activities for both commercial and sport purposes. These regulations apply to freshwater and anadromous/catadromous fish in provincial and tidal waters, with specific exemptions for national parks, aquaculture sites, and certain Aboriginal fishing activities.
