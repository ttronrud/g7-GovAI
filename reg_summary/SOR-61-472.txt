These regulations implement the transfer of pension rights from employees of the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (C.O.T.C.) from prior pension plans (Standard Life and United Kingdom Plans) to the Public Service Superannuation Act, effective November 1, 1961. Employees could elect not to join the new superannuation system, but could later revoke that election, and in such cases, their service under the old plans would be counted as pensionable service, with the Corporation making specific payments based on salary and years of service.
