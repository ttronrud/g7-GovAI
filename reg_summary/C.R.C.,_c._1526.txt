This regulation allows Government of Canada officers or employees to hold shares in a corporation that purchases territorial land, provided the shares are listed on a prescribed Canadian stock exchange and the officer's sole interest is as a shareholder; however, such holdings are prohibited if they create a conflict of interest or enable direct or indirect benefit from government contracts. The rule applies to shares acquired before or after August 13, 1975.
