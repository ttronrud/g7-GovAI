These regulations define when a life insurance company is considered "widely held" for regulatory purposes following a conversion into a company with common shares, and specify that certain life companies with assets under $7.5 billion in Canada as of December 31, 1991 are exempt from the requirements of subsection 407(4). The regulations come into force upon registration.
