This regulatory order authorizes Petro-Canada and its wholly-owned subsidiaries to undertake specific transactions in 1991, including the formation, acquisition, asset purchases, and disposal of subsidiaries, all subject to a cap of 0.5 per cent of Petro-Canada’s consolidated gross assets as of the end of its 1990 financial year. The authorization is made under section 91 of the Financial Administration Act and is intended to facilitate corporate activities consistent with Petro-Canada’s objectives while limiting exposure to significant investments or disposals.
