This regulatory order grants remission of certain cost recovery fees paid under previous AECB regulations, specifically refunding portions of fees when a licence or approval is revoked, amended, or reduced in fee, or when a fixed fee is changed to an hourly rate. The remission amounts are calculated based on the proportion of the fee period remaining at the time of the change or reduction.
