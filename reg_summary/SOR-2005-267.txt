These regulations establish administrative monetary penalties for violations of financial institutions' laws, with fines ranging from $100 to $500 depending on the severity of the violation and the size of the financial institution. Minor violations are subject to tiered penalties based on asset size, and repeated violations are treated as separate infractions with reduced penalties per occurrence.
