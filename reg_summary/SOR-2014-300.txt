These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" imported from Korea, defining when such goods are considered to originate in Korea and are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act. Goods are deemed to originate in Korea if they are marked in accordance with Korean marking laws indicating they are made in Korea or Canada, or if they lack any mark suggesting otherwise.
