This regulation replaces the previous Domestic First Class Mail Regulations with new Letter Mail Regulations, effective January 1, 1989, establishing rules for the posting, size, weight, and formatting of letter mail in Canada, including requirements for addressing, postage, and prohibited items. It sets specific standards for envelope dimensions, content, and labeling while defining rates and restrictions for different types of mail items.
