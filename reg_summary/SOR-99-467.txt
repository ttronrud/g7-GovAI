These regulations establish the conditions under which Canadian institutions can obtain indemnity agreements to cover losses or damage to objects in travelling exhibitions, requiring a minimum fair market value of $500,000 and setting specific criteria for exhibition content, safety, and security, while also defining claim procedures, deductible amounts, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The indemnity coverage is limited to the uninsured portion of the object’s value and lasts up to two years, with possible extensions under certain conditions.
