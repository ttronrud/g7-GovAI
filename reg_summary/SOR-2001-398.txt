These regulations establish investment limits for trust and loan companies under the Trust and Loan Companies Act, defining what constitutes an interest in real property and how such interests are valued, while exempting certain large or well-capitalized entities from specific restrictions. They also specify the conditions under which a company or its controlled entities may hold or guarantee interests in real property, with values determined based on book value or net realizable value.
