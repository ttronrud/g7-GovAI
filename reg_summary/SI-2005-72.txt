The Governor in Council has decided not to add the plains bison, Porsild’s bryum, Peary caribou, and the Dolphin and Union population of barren-ground caribou to Canada’s List of Wildlife Species at Risk, citing economic concerns for the bison industry and the need for further consultation with Nunavut and Indigenous stakeholders, while referring the polar bear and dwarf woolly-heads assessments back to COSEWIC for updated analysis incorporating new scientific and traditional knowledge.
