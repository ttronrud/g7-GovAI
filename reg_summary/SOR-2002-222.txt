This regulation establishes limits on effluent discharge from metal and diamond mines in Canada, requiring operators to monitor and control the concentration of deleterious substances like arsenic, copper, cyanide, and suspended solids, ensuring effluents are not acutely lethal to aquatic life and maintain a pH between 6.0 and 9.5. It also mandates regular environmental monitoring, reporting of mine details, and compliance with specific testing and sampling procedures.
