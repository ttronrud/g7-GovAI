The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to add the Beluga Whale (Eastern High Arctic and Baffin Bay population), Striped Bass (Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence population), and Cusk to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk under the Species at Risk Act, as there are no significant threats within Canadian waters, existing management measures are effective, and listing would result in significant socio-economic impacts without substantially improving the species' recovery. The decision is supported by scientific assessments and ongoing management under the Fisheries Act, including bycatch controls, enforcement, and habitat protections.
