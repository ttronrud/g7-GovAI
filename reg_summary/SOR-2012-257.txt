These rules establish the procedures for filing and perfecting appeals before the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, including requirements for notices of appeal, appellant and minister records, submissions, and responses, with specific formatting, timing, and content standards. They also outline procedures for interventions, extensions of time, and decisions on appeals—either by written materials or with a hearing—ensuring consistency and transparency in the appeal process.
