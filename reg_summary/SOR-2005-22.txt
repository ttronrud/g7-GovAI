These regulations establish the specifications for denatured and specially denatured alcohol, defining the required proportions of denaturants (such as petroleum distillates, naphtha, or chemical additives) mixed with spirits, and specify minimum alcohol strength and safety requirements for each grade. The regulations also outline exact formulations for different denatured alcohol grades to ensure proper denaturing and compliance with safety and quality standards.
