The Vessel Construction and Equipment Regulations establish safety and construction standards for Canadian vessels, including passenger and cargo vessels 24 meters or longer, based on international conventions like SOLAS and MLC 2006, with specific adaptations through Canadian modifications and recommendations. These regulations include grandfathering provisions for certain older vessels and allow for equipment substitutions if equivalent safety is demonstrated, while also outlining exemptions for pleasure craft, fishing vessels, and vessels engaged in oil and gas operations in designated areas.
