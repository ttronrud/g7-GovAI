This regulation designates the critical habitat for the endangered Northern Madtom (Noturus stigmosus) under the Species at Risk Act, based on its recovery strategy and public registry, and comes into force upon registration. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issued the order after consulting with Indigenous authorities, as required by law, and confirms that no portion of the designated habitat falls within lands set aside for First Nations use.
