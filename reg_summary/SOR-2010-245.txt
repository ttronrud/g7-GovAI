This regulation establishes the solvency funding requirements for the Canadian Press pension plan, mandating specific payments to address a solvency deficiency as of December 31, 2009, with initial funding on December 1, 2010, followed by monthly contributions to meet long-term solvency standards, while also setting conditions for benefit reductions, employer obligations, and compliance. The regulations apply only if certain conditions are met within 30 days of coming into force and expire on January 1, 2024.
