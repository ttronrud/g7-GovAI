This regulation grants customs duty remission for certain textile and apparel goods imported from Chile, effective August 26, 1998, based on the Canada–Chile Free Trade Agreement, but only up to annual quantitative limits and subject to specific certification and declaration requirements by importers. The remission covers apparel, fabric and made-up goods, and spun yarn, reducing the duty paid to the difference between Most-Favoured-Nation rates and Chile's applicable tariff rates.
