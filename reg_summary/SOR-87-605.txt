This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Yorkton Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations by limiting structures and natural growth that could interfere with approach and flight paths. It defines key surfaces such as approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, sets maximum elevation limits for buildings and objects, and prohibits waste disposal that attracts birds, all within designated land boundaries.
