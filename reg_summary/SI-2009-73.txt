This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial lands in the Northwest Territories, including surface and subsurface rights, from disposal to support the eventual addition of these lands to the Salt River Reserve, effective from the date of enactment until August 31, 2014. Notably, specific mining and mineral-related activities, such as claim location, leasing, and licensing, are exempt from this withdrawal for claims or permits established prior to the Order’s issuance.
