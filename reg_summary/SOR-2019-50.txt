The Banc-des-Américains Marine Protected Area Regulations designate a specific marine area off the coast of Canada, encompassing the seabed, subsoil, and water column, and establish management zones with restrictions on activities that could harm marine life. Activities such as fishing and scientific research are permitted under strict conditions, including the submission and approval of detailed activity plans, and are subject to environmental safeguards to protect biodiversity and ecosystem health.
