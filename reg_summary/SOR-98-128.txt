The Treasury Board enacted the Receipt and Deposit of Public Money Regulations, 1997, to establish rules for how public money must be recorded, deposited, and managed, including specific timelines for deposits (daily, weekly, or monthly) and requirements for issuing receipts. The regulations also authorize service providers to withhold fees or commissions from public payments if those fees are legally or contractually determined.
