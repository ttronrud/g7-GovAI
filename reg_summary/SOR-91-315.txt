The Manitoba Milk Producers’ Marketing Board revoked the previous milk marketing levies order and introduced a new 1991 levy structure to fund the marketing of milk and cream produced in Manitoba, with different rates based on whether the product is within or beyond permitted quotas, and whether the producer has a quota allocation. Levies are imposed on milk and cream marketed in interprovincial and export trade, with specific rates per hectolitre or per kilogram of butterfat, and must be paid within seven days of marketing.
