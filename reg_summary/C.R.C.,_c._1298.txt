These regulations establish the rules for handling undeliverable and redirected mail in Canada, specifying when mail may be redirected to a forwarding address, returned to the sender, or destroyed, with particular provisions for international mail, special types of mail (like incentive or advertising mail), and cases involving incorrect addresses or legal restrictions. They also outline procedures for handling mail that cannot be delivered due to insufficient address information or legal prohibitions, and include provisions for detention of mail for up to 30 days when necessary.
