This regulatory order approves the re-application of the Public Service Employment Act to certain temporary positions in Statistics Canada, while excluding specific provisions—such as definitions of deployment and internal appointment processes and certain sections relating to employment rules—from applying to positions that provide administrative, management, or data processing support specifically for census and survey activities. The exclusion applies to personnel appointed on a specified term basis for these functions, except for those mentioned in the Statistics Act.
