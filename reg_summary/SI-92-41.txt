The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, has ordered the withdrawal of specified lands in the Northwest Territories and North Baffin Island from disposal to establish a National Park, including all minerals, construction materials, and timber, while preserving certain existing rights and interests such as mineral claims, surface leases, and permits. This action excludes only lands subject to active leases or agreements for sale under the Territorial Lands Act or Regulations.
