These regulations allow judges in Canada to elect to increase their spouse or common-law partner’s survivor annuity to 60% or 75% of their own annuity, provided they meet specific documentation and timing requirements. The election must be made within 180 days of either the start of the annuity or the end of the judge’s service, and the annuity reduction is adjusted based on demographic and financial assumptions, with the enhanced survivor benefit taking effect upon the judge’s death.
