This regulation exempts certain Quebec-based organizations, excluding federal entities, from Part 1 of Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) when handling personal information, because Quebec’s own privacy law (R.S.Q., c. P-39.1) already applies to them. The exemption applies to organizations conducting enterprises under Quebec’s Civil Code and comes into force upon registration.
