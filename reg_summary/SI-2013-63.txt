This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial lands in the Northwest Territories' South Slave Region from disposal for three years to support the negotiation and conclusion of Aboriginal land agreements, while excluding specific mineral-related activities and claims that were already established or authorized prior to the Order. The withdrawal includes both surface and surface-subsurface rights as defined on specific reference maps developed by a Land Working Group.
