The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2016-47"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2016/47** has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Title**: The exact title of the regulation is not provided in your query. However, SI/2016/47 is a Statutory Instrument issued in the United Kingdom in 2016.  
- **Status**: The instrument is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent legislative or regulatory action.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through a later Statutory Instrument or legislation, typically published in the *Statutory Instruments (SI) list* of the UK government. The specific repeal date is not included in your input, but such repeals are usually published in the *Statutory Instruments* (SI) series and may be found in the *List of Statutory Instruments* for the relevant year (e.g., 2016 or later).
- **Purpose of the Original Instrument**: Without the full text of SI/2016/47, the original purpose cannot be precisely determined. Statutory Instruments of this type often relate to areas such as:
  - Environmental regulation
  - Health and safety
  - Licensing or permitting
  - Transport or infrastructure
  - Consumer protection
  - Employment or workplace standards
- **Reason for Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant
  - A more comprehensive or modern regulation has been introduced
  - They conflict with new legislation
  - They create administrative or legal complexity

### Example Context (Hypothetical):
If SI/2016/47 had been a regulation on "the control of noise from construction sites," its repeal might have been due to the introduction of a broader environmental noise regulation under the Environmental Noise (Control) Act 2015, which provides a more comprehensive and updated framework.
