These regulations extend the application of the Public Service Employment Act to all permanent officers and employees of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration, except seasonal or term employees, despite provisions in the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act that would otherwise limit its scope. The regulations allow for the consistent application of public service employment standards to the administration's permanent workforce.
