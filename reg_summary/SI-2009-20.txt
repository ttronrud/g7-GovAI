The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, refers the assessment of the Northern Fur Seal back to COSEWIC for further review, due to new scientific information indicating that the species may represent a single population with a less severe decline than previously estimated. This includes updated data on movement between rookeries, lack of genetic differences, and more accurate population abundance estimates.
