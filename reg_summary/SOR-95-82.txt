This regulation grants duty remission on certain scientific equipment, spare parts, and tools imported by scientific or exploratory expeditions for use in Canada, provided the goods are used exclusively for field studies, properly documented, and either destroyed or exported within two years (or with a possible extension) after importation. The remission applies to goods used in scientific or exploratory activities conducted by non-resident participants and sponsored by eligible organizations, with the condition that all information obtained is made available to the Government of Canada.
