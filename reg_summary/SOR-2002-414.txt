This regulation establishes the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation as a band under the Indian Act, including individuals of Canadian Innu ancestry who were residents of Sheshatshiu on November 19, 2002, or are related by blood or adoption to such residents, and designates a specific parcel of land in Newfoundland and Labrador as the band's reserve. The Order comes into force upon registration and recognizes Innu custom in matters of adoption.
