This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Toronto/Buttonville Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting the height of buildings, structures, and natural growth near the airport. It defines specific elevation surfaces—approach, outer, and transitional surfaces—around runways and prohibits any construction or waste disposal that could pose a hazard to aircraft operations.
