These regulations establish specific conditions under which a cooperative credit association can issue "delivery shares" to a particular subsidiary for acquisition, ensuring the shares are transferred to shareholders of another body corporate, with requirements related to fair market value, stock exchange trading, arm’s length dealings, and non-residency in Canada. They also outline procedures for canceling shares and returning consideration if conditions are not met, and come into force on a specified date.
