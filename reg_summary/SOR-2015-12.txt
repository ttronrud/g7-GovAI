This Canadian regulation prohibits Canadian entities from complying with specific U.S. federal environmental regulations related to alterations or improvements to premises leased by Alaska from the Prince Rupert Port Authority, as those provisions are deemed to adversely affect Canadian trade and commerce. The order comes into force upon registration and applies retroactively to actions taken before publication, but only if further compliance occurs after the order's effective date.
