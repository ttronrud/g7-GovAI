These regulations establish a 90-day period during which stakeholders, including First Nations, the Tlicho Government, and the Review Board, may enter into an agreement to jointly establish a review panel for proposed projects under the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act. The period begins either when the proposal is referred to the Minister of the Environment or when an environmental impact review is ordered, and the regulations come into force upon registration.
