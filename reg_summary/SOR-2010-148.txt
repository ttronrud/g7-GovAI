These regulations establish the rules for student employment programs in the Canadian public service, outlining eligibility, hiring priorities, and restrictions on internal appointments, while exempting participants from most provisions of the Public Service Employment Act except specific ones. Canadian citizens and permanent residents are given priority for appointments, and participants must complete their post-secondary or vocational training before being eligible for internal appointments or transitioning to regular public service roles.
