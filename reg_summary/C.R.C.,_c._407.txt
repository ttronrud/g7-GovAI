These regulations require producers or importers in Canada of certain liquid fuels (such as aviation gasoline, kerosene, and diesel) in quantities exceeding 400 cubic metres per calendar year to report specific fuel and additive information to the Minister, either electronically or on paper, with deadlines depending on the type of report. Additional reporting is required for any new additive used in the fuel, with updates to previously submitted information to be reported within 60 days of a change.
