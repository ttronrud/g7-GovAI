The Treasury Board has established regulations to govern indemnification and advances for directors and officers of Crown corporations, outlining the conditions, requirements for requests, approval thresholds based on the amount involved, and obligations for reimbursement. Requests must be made in writing and include detailed information about the action or proceeding, with decisions made by different levels of the Treasury Board depending on the total amount sought, and all approvals are subject to specific conditions and reporting requirements.
