This regulation grants tax remission to non-resident individuals and entities for interest paid or credited on government and long-term corporate debt, specifically when the tax liability under the Income Tax Act would have been higher if the year "1986" in certain tax provisions had been read as "1987." It also provides remission to tax deductors or withholders who overpay tax under these conditions.
