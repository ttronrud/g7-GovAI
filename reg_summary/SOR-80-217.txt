The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has revoked the previous National Parks Garbage Regulations and replaced them with new rules that establish detailed guidelines for the collection, storage, and disposal of garbage in Canadian national parks. These regulations define what constitutes garbage, specify requirements for container use and storage, outline rules for owners and collectors, and establish a system of fees based on lot size, usage, and volume of waste generated.
