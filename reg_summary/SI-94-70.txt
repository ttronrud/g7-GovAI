This regulation grants tax remission to certain Indians and the Webequie Band for income taxes and goods and services taxes that would have been payable if the Webequie Indian Settlement were classified as a reserve, with applications required to be submitted within four years of tax payment. The remission applies to taxes paid or payable for the 1992 taxation year and subsequent years, based on the difference between actual taxes paid and those that would have applied if the settlement were a reserve.
