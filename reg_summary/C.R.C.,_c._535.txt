This regulation requires imported goods of certain types to be marked in legible English or French to indicate their country of origin, with the marking being permanent and visible, except for specific exemptions such as charitable donations, antiques, used goods (with limited exceptions), and goods under certain tariff headings. It also lists numerous categories of goods—such as bakeware, clothing, and paper products—that are exempt from the marking requirement.
