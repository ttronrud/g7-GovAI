These regulations establish the requirements for exporting cultural property from Canada, including detailed application forms, required documentation, and conditions for export permits, general permits, and the return of exported objects. Export permits are issued for specific cultural items listed in the Control List, with strict conditions on identification, purpose, and compliance, while general permits streamline exports for businesses with regular activity, requiring a formal declaration before shipment.
