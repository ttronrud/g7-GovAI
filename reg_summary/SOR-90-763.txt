This regulation establishes a fee of $0.30 per page for copies of public information returns filed by registered charities, with the first twenty copies requested in a fiscal year being free of charge. Copies requested after March 1990 but before the Order's coming into force are counted toward the twenty-free-copy limit for the fiscal year ending in 1991.
