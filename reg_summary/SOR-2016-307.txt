This regulation establishes reporting requirements for persons who receive or export certain types of oil and hazardous cargo by sea, mandating the filing of annual information returns if thresholds of 150,000 metric tons (for oil) or 17,000 metric tons (for non-persistent oil or specific hazardous substances) are exceeded, with specific details to be included in the returns. It also sets a fee of $98 for the issuance of certain certificates under the Marine Liability Act.
