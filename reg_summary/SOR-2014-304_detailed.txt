**Detailed Summary of the *Samples of Bodily Substances Regulations* (S.C. 2011, c. 7, s. 3(2), 5(2), 11; R.S., c. C-46)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Samples of Bodily Substances Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under the *Criminal Code of Canada* (the "Code") to establish standardized procedures for the collection, analysis, storage, handling, and destruction of bodily substances provided by offenders as part of specific court-ordered conditions. These regulations apply in three distinct legal contexts:  
1. **Probation orders** under section 732.1(3)(c.1) or (c.2)  
2. **Conditional sentence orders** under section 742.3(2)(a.1) or (a.2)  
3. **Recognizance conditions to keep the peace** under various provisions of section 810 (e.g., 810(3.02)(b), 810.01(4.1)(f), etc.)

The regulations ensure consistency, safety, and legal compliance in the handling of bodily samples across Canada, while also providing provincial and territorial authorities with flexibility to manage such processes within their jurisdiction.

### **Applicability by Court Order Type**

The regulations apply to samples provided by offenders under the following court-ordered conditions:

#### 1. **Probation Orders (Section 732.1(3)(c.1) or (c.2))**
- Applies when a court imposes a probation order requiring the offender to provide samples of bodily substances.
- The regulations govern the collection, analysis, storage, and destruction of these samples.

#### 2. **Conditional Sentence Orders (Section 742.3(2)(a.1) or (a.2))**
- Applies when a court imposes a conditional sentence (a form of alternative to imprisonment) that includes sample-provision conditions.
- Same requirements as probation orders apply here.

#### 3. **Recognizance Conditions to Keep the Peace (Section 810.3(1))**
- Applies when a defendant is released on recognizance with conditions to keep the peace, including obligations to provide bodily samples.
- Examples include conditions under:
  - 810(3.02)(b), (c)
  - 810.01(4.1)(f), (g)
  - 810.1(3.02)(h), (i)
  - 810.2(4.1)(f), (g)

> In all three contexts, the prescribed bodily substances are the same.

### **Prescribed Bodily Substances**

The following substances are legally recognized and regulated for collection under the relevant Code provisions:

- Breath  
- Urine  
- Blood  
- Hair  
- Saliva  

These are the only substances permitted under the regulations for use in compliance with the specified court orders.

### **Requirements for Sample Collection**

#### **Blood Sample Collection**
- **Only authorized personnel** may collect blood samples:
  - A **qualified medical practitioner** or a **qualified technician** (as designated by the Attorney General).
- A **qualified medical practitioner must assess** that taking the blood sample would **not endanger the person’s life or health** before proceeding.
- This requirement ensures patient safety and medical ethics are upheld.

#### **Breath Sample Analysis**
- Must be analyzed using one of two approved methods:
  1. An instrument approved under the *Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Order*, or  
  2. A screening device approved under the *Approved Screening Devices Order*.
- This ensures accuracy, reliability, and standardization of breath testing.

#### **Blood Sample Storage**
- Blood samples must be stored in a **container approved under the Order Approving Blood Sample Containers**.
- This prevents contamination, degradation, or tampering and ensures forensic integrity.

---

### **Destruction of Samples**

- In all three contexts (probation, conditional sentence, recognizance), a sample of bodily substance must be **destroyed within one year** of the date it was provided.
- This applies to:
  - Breath
  - Urine
  - Blood
  - Hair
  - Saliva
- Destruction ensures privacy, protects individual rights, and prevents misuse or retention of sensitive biological data.

> This one-year rule applies regardless of the type of order or substance.

---

### **Provincial/Territorial Notification Requirement**

Before any province or territory:
- Proposes to designate **qualified technicians** or make **specifications** (e.g., protocols, equipment standards) under subsections **732.1(8)**, **742.3(6)**, or **810.3(1)** of the Code,
- **Must notify the Attorney General of Canada in writing** that:
  - The province or territory has the **technical and operational capability** to:
    - Take samples  
    - Analyze samples  
    - Store samples  
    - Handle samples  
    - Destroy samples  

> This requirement ensures national consistency and oversight, preventing jurisdictions from operating without proper infrastructure or capacity.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day the **Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in *R. v. Shoker*** comes into force.
- If the regulations are registered after that date, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provision links the regulations to a significant judicial decision (R. v. Shoker, 2011 SCC 54), which addressed the constitutionality of certain sample collection practices and emphasized the need for clear, fair, and lawful procedures.

> *Note: As of March 31, 2015, these regulations were in force (SI/2014-105).*

| **Legal Compliance** | Aligns sample collection with specific provisions of the Criminal Code, ensuring procedural legitimacy. |
| **Safety & Medical Ethics** | Requires medical assessment before blood draws and mandates safe handling. |
| **Standardization** | Uses approved instruments and containers to ensure reliability and consistency across jurisdictions. |
| **Privacy & Data Protection** | Mandates destruction within one year to minimize long-term retention of personal biological data. |
| **National Oversight** | Requires provincial/territorial notification to the AG of Canada to maintain uniform standards and accountability. |

### **Significance and Implications**

- The regulations provide **clear, enforceable standards** for sample management in criminal justice settings.
- They balance **public safety** (e.g., monitoring offenders) with **individual rights** (e.g., privacy, bodily autonomy).
- They reflect the **judicial interpretation** of the *R. v. Shoker* decision, which emphasized the need for procedural fairness and safeguards in sample collection.
- They empower provinces and territories to operate locally while remaining within national legal and operational boundaries.

### **Conclusion**

The *Samples of Bodily Substances Regulations* establish a comprehensive, safe, and legally sound framework for the collection, analysis, storage, and destruction of bodily substances (breath, urine, blood, hair, saliva) by offenders under specific court-ordered conditions. By setting strict requirements for personnel, equipment, and timelines—while requiring national notification of operational capacity—the regulations ensure both **legal compliance** and **procedural fairness**, all within the broader context of justice reform and individual rights protection.

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s modern criminal justice system, reflecting a balance between effective offender monitoring and the protection of fundamental rights.
