These regulations establish specific thresholds and circumstances under which insiders of insurance companies or insurance holding companies may be subject to civil remedies, including a 10% voting rights threshold and defined situations related to take-over bids and transactions made with or without confidential information. The regulations come into force upon registration and align with definitions of "take-over bid" across various provincial and federal securities acts.
