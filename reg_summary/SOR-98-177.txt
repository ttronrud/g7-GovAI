These regulations prohibit the bringing into or keeping of most domestic animals in Canadian national parks, with limited exceptions for dogs used in search and rescue or polar bear detection, and for grazing in specific cases with permits. They require all domestic animals to be kept under physical control and impose strict conditions on their presence, movement, and health to protect wildlife, public safety, and park integrity.
