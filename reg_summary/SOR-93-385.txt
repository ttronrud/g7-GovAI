These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Aklavik Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure or object whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all of which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria. The regulations apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point and were adopted after a public consultation period.
