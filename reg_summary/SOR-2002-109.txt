These regulations establish the conditions under which timber can be harvested on First Nation lands in Canada, requiring a licence for most cutting activities, with exceptions for band councils and certificate holders cutting timber for use on reserve lands. Unauthorized harvesting is prohibited, and illegally cut timber can be seized and forfeited after 30 days without challenge.
