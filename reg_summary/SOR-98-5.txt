These regulations establish fees for dealer’s licences related to controlled drugs and narcotics for veterinary use in Canada, with a reduced fee for applicants who have not completed a full calendar year of operations. Remission of the fee is available if the applicant’s actual gross revenue exceeds 1.5% of the fee, based on a financial statement, though remission is denied if additional information is not provided or if the applicant holds an establishment licence.
