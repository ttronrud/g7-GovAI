This regulation establishes the rules for the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys in British Columbia, requiring all producers, processors, and marketers to register, obtain licenses, and comply with strict controls on pricing, transportation, packaging, and distribution. It mandates that turkeys be processed, packed, and labeled with "Turkey grown in British Columbia," limits marketing outside the province to authorized quotas, and prohibits certain sales practices to ensure fair and orderly market operations.
