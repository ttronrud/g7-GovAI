These regulations establish strict limits on retail associations' specialized financing activities, prohibiting investments in certain types of entities (such as motor vehicle leasing or insurance brokerage firms), setting caps on balance sheet values and regulatory capital exposure, and restricting ownership of specialized financing entities to prevent excessive risk concentration. They also impose a 13-year limit on holding control or substantial investment in any entity and require compliance with specific financial thresholds to ensure prudent risk management.
