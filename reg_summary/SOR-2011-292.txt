These regulations establish the procedures for mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by service providers, designating the Canadian Centre for Child Protection as the designated organization responsible for receiving, verifying, and forwarding reports to law enforcement. The organization must maintain a secure online system for reporting, determine if material constitutes child pornography, share relevant details with law enforcement, and submit annual reports on its activities and compliance.
