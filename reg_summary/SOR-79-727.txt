This regulation establishes the Quebec Hog Marketing Order, granting the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board and the Fédération des producteurs de porc du Québec authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs in Quebec, including the power to impose and collect levies based on producer groups. The Commodity Board may use these levies for reserves, expenses, loss payments, and to equalize revenues among hog producers.
