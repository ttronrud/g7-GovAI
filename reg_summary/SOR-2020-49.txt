The Canadian Energy Regulator issued regulations requiring holders of permits and certificates for international or interprovincial power lines to implement damage prevention programs, including public awareness initiatives, timely responses to locate requests, marking of power lines, and reporting of damages or safety concerns. These rules also mandate annual reports on contraventions, damage incidents, and safety concerns, and require record-keeping of all ground disturbances and construction activities for the life of the line.
