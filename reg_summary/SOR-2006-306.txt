These regulations define what constitutes a "distributing company" under the Trust and Loan Companies Act, primarily based on whether a company is a reporting issuer under federal or provincial securities legislation or has filed a prospectus or is involved in certain corporate transactions involving reporting issuers. The regulations come into force upon registration and reference the definitions of "reporting issuer" in various provincial and federal securities acts.
