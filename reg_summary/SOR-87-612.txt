These regulations, enacted under the Canada Labour Code, establish occupational safety and health standards for employees involved in oil and gas exploration, drilling, production, and transportation on Canadian lands. They mandate safety requirements for equipment, work environments, emergency preparedness, fall protection, and hazard control, with specific provisions for offshore and onshore operations, and apply to both employees and certain non-employee workers performing related duties.
