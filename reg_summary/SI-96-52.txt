On July 1, 1996, the Government of Canada transferred food inspection responsibilities from the Minister of National Health and Welfare to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, moved the Food Inspection Division and related units to the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, and retained control of the Animal Health Bacteriology Centre in Guelph with the Department of National Health and Welfare. This reallocation reorganized food safety oversight within the public service to improve efficiency and expertise.
