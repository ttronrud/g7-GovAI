**Detailed Summary of the "Residents of India Remission Order" (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview**

The *Residents of India Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under subsection 23(2) of the *Financial Administration Act*. This Order provides a mechanism for the remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of income tax, interest, and penalties owed by certain residents of India in respect of royalties or fees received from Canada for technical services.

The Order is designed to promote international tax cooperation and to prevent double taxation between Canada and India, particularly in cases involving technical services and royalty payments. It is rooted in the bilateral tax agreement between Canada and India, specifically the *Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income* (the "Agreement").

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Income Tax Act* of Canada. This is the primary legislation governing the taxation of income, including royalties and technical service fees.

2. **Agreement**  
   Refers to the bilateral tax treaty between Canada and India, formally titled:  
   *"Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income"*,  
   which is set out in **Schedule III to Chapter 7 of the Statutes of Canada, 1986**.  
   This treaty establishes rules for taxing income earned by residents of one country in the other, and includes provisions to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion.

3. **Person**  
   Defined as the class of individuals or entities that fall within the meaning of **paragraph 1(c) of Article 3 of the Agreement**.  
   This typically includes individuals or entities who are considered "residents" of India under the treaty's definition, which may include those who are domiciled in India, have a permanent home there, or are engaged in economic activities within India.

4. **Remission**  
   The cancellation or forgiveness of income tax, interest, and penalties that would otherwise be payable under the *Income Tax Act* in respect of certain royalty or technical service payments.

### **Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies to **residents of India** (as defined in the Agreement) who receive:

#### 1. **Royalties**  
- For rights or property granted **after December 12, 1988**.  
- The royalty payments must be made or credited to the Indian resident.

#### 2. **Fees for Technical Services**  
- Under a contract that is **signed after December 12, 1988**.  
- The fees must be paid or credited to the Indian resident.

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission is granted **only when** the following condition is met:

> The amount of remission is equal to the **excess** of:
> - The aggregate of the taxes, interest, and penalties payable under the *Income Tax Act* on the amount received,  
> **over**  
> - The aggregate of the taxes, interest, and penalties that would have been payable **if the reference to a 30% rate in paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Agreement had been read as a 20% rate**.

---

### **Explanation of the Key Provision**

This is a **tax relief mechanism** based on a **treaty interpretation adjustment**:

- Under **paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Agreement**, the tax rate on royalties or fees for technical services is generally set at **30%**.
- However, the Order allows for a **reduction in tax liability** by assuming that the applicable rate is **20%** instead of 30%.
- The difference between the 30% and 20% rate is used to calculate the **remission amount**.

#### Formula for Remission Amount:
\[
\text{Remission} = (\text{Actual Tax, Interest, Penalties under Act}) - (\text{Tax, Interest, Penalties at 20% rate under Act})
\]

This means:
- If the Indian resident would have been taxed at 30% under Canadian law, but the treaty allows for a 20% rate, the difference (10 percentage points) is applied to the amount of the royalty or fee.
- The remission compensates the resident for the **tax burden imposed by the higher treaty rate**.

---

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Order was made **in the public interest** to:
- Promote equitable tax treatment between Canada and India.
- Encourage investment and technical cooperation between the two countries.
- Prevent double taxation of income earned from technical services or royalties.
- Support the implementation of the Canada-India tax treaty by addressing a specific point of discrepancy in the interpretation of the royalty tax rate.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is issued under **subsection 23(2) of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to make orders for the remission of taxes, interest, or penalties when it is in the public interest.

---

### **Effective Date and Application**

- The Order applies to payments made or credited **after December 12, 1988**.
- It is retroactive only insofar as it applies to amounts received or credited after that date.
- It does not apply to earlier payments or contracts.

---

### **Key Implications**

1. **Tax Relief for Indian Residents**  
   Indian residents receiving royalties or technical service fees from Canada will receive a refund or remission of the difference between what they would have paid under the 30% rate and what they would have paid under a 20% rate.

2. **Alignment with Treaty Provisions**  
   The Order ensures that Canadian tax treatment of income from Indian residents aligns more closely with the treaty's intended tax rates, especially in cases where the 30% rate may be seen as excessive or inconsistent with the treaty's spirit.

3. **Encouragement of International Cooperation**  
   By reducing tax burdens, the Order supports Canada’s efforts to foster economic and technical collaboration with India.

4. **No Change to the Treaty Text**  
   The Order does not alter the actual text of the Agreement. Instead, it interprets the treaty in a way that allows for a lower tax rate (20%) for calculation purposes, resulting in a tax relief.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- Does **not apply** to payments made before December 12, 1988.
- Does **not apply** to income from sources other than royalties or technical services.
- Does **not cover** all types of income — only those specified in the Order.
- Remission is **not automatic** — it must be claimed and approved in accordance with the procedures set out in the Income Tax Act and related regulations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Residents of India Remission Order* is a targeted, treaty-based tax relief measure that provides financial relief to Indian residents who receive royalties or fees from Canada for technical services, provided those payments were made or credited after December 12, 1988. By adjusting the applicable tax rate in the calculation from 30% to 20% under the Canada-India tax treaty, the Order reduces the tax, interest, and penalty burden on these residents. This promotes fairness, strengthens bilateral tax cooperation, and supports economic ties between Canada and India.

It is a practical implementation of the principles of the double taxation avoidance agreement and reflects Canada’s commitment to equitable international tax treatment.
