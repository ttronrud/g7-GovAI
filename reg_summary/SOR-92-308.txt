The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, revoked the old rules for public inquiries under the Bank Act and approved new rules governing proceedings when objections are made to proposed bank incorporations, continuances, or amalgamations. These rules outline procedures for notice, participation, submissions, witness calls, public access, and reporting of inquiry findings.
