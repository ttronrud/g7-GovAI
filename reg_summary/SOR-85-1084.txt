These regulations establish the official form of the Instrument of Cession that must be used when a Cree or Naskapi Band transfers land rights to Quebec under Part IX of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act, specifying requirements for approval by electors, conditions of cession, and the effective date of the transfer. The instrument must be executed in four copies and approved by at least 65% of Band members in a referendum, with the cession becoming effective upon Quebec’s acceptance of the transfer.
