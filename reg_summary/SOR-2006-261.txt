These regulations require pest control product registrants to annually report detailed sales information, including quantities sold by province and to specific users or manufacturers, and to maintain records for six years. The reports must be submitted by June 1 of the following year, with additional reporting required in emergency situations or upon ministerial request, and registrants may be required to submit audited reports if sales data is deemed inaccurate.
