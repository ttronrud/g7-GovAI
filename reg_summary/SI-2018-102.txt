Despite identifying imminent threats to the survival of the Southern Resident Killer Whale population—such as prey scarcity, noise and disturbance, and contaminants—the Government of Canada, after evaluating recovery measures and considering broader social, economic, and public interest factors, declined to issue an emergency order under the Species at Risk Act. Instead, it continues to implement a range of coordinated actions across fisheries management, vessel regulation, pollution control, and research to support the population's recovery.
