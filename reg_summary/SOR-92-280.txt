These regulations restrict insurance companies from engaging in certain securities dealings in Canada, such as primary distributions and secondary market trading of shares or debt, acting as selling agents for mutual funds, or participating in general secondary market trading. However, exceptions are allowed for government-related securities, certain debt instruments, internal dealings, and specific types of mutual fund or underwriting activities.
