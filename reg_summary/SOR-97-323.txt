These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" imported from Chile under the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, stating that such goods are deemed to originate in Chile and qualify for Chilean tariff benefits if they are marked according to Chilean marking laws or lack a mark with no evidence showing otherwise. The regulations came into force on July 5, 1997.
