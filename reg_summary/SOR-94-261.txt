These Regulations establish rules for masking the explicit chemical or biological names of substances to protect confidential information, allowing the replacement of distinctive elements with non-descriptive terms or removal of locants, while ensuring the masked name still accurately reflects the substance’s generic identity. The masking is limited to the minimum necessary to maintain confidentiality and applies differently depending on whether the substance has a structural diagram or is a biological entity.
