These regulations establish emission standards for locomotives in Canada to reduce nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and smoke, with specific requirements for testing, compliance, and exemptions based on locomotive type, age, and operational context. They align with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, particularly for new locomotives covered by an EPA certificate, while providing flexibility for certain types of locomotives, such as switch or remanufactured units, and for railway companies with lower revenues or operating under incidental conditions.
