These regulations prescribe specific ancillary activities that are considered reasonable and permissible for insurance companies, Canadian societies, and insurance holding companies when they acquire control or substantial investments in other entities, with the key condition that such activities must be reasonably ancillary to the core insurance business. The regulations come into force upon the enactment of section 495 of the Insurance Companies Act.
