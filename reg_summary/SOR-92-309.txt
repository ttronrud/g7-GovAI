These regulations, effective June 1, 1992, establish limits on transactions between banks and their related parties, including foreign bank subsidiaries and their controlling entities, to ensure transparency and financial stability. They allow certain types of transactions—such as swaps, forwards, and short-term deposits—under strict conditions, including caps on deposit amounts and terms, and specify permitted transactions involving tax agreements, share issuances, and capital reductions.
