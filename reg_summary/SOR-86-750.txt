This regulation exempts Pacific hake caught in specific areas (121, 123, 124, 125, and 126) of the Pacific Fishery Management Area from the restrictions imposed by section 29 of the Fisheries Act. Issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on July 3, 1986, the notice allows these fish to be harvested without being subject to those provisions.
