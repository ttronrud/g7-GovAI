This regulation cancels an old import permit for chickens and chicken products and replaces it with a new general permit allowing Canadian residents to import up to 10 kg per person for personal use, covering specific types of chicken meat, offal, fat, sausages, and prepared foods, effective when certain WTO implementation laws came into force. The permit applies to specific tariff items and requires reporting with a designated statement upon importation.
