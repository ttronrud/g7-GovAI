This Canadian proclamation certifies the High Contracting Parties to the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and its 1955 amendment (The Hague Protocol), specifying which states and territories are parties, and confirms which countries have adopted the Additional Protocol to exclude Article 2's application to certain international air carriage. It also establishes that ratification of the 1955 Protocol by non-Convention states results in their adherence to the Convention as amended.
