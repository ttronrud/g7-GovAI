These regulations establish the competency requirements for operating pleasure crafts in Canadian waters, requiring operators to have proof of competency—such as a Pleasure Craft Operator Card or alternative documentation—and to complete a recognized boating safety course or pass a standardized test. They define the qualifications for course providers, test administration, and exceptions for residents, non-residents, and rental operations, with the regulations coming into force on April 1, 1999.
