These regulations exclude certain vaping products—such as non-prescription drugs, natural health products, and licensed medical devices—from the scope of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act, provided they meet specific criteria related to use, appeal to youth, and regulatory authorization. The exclusions apply to products used for treating respiratory conditions, administered through non-energy-dependent medical devices, or sold under existing health product or medical device authorizations.
