These regulations establish the timeframes within which eligible authors, performers, and makers not represented by collective societies must claim private copying remuneration, based on specific tariffs, with different deadlines depending on the type of rights holder and the tariff in question. The periods range from December 31 of the year following the tariff's end to December 31 of the seventh (for performers) or fifth (for makers) year after the tariff ceases to be effective.
