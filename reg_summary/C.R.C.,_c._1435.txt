These regulations establish safety and inspection requirements for large fishing vessels in Canada, including stability testing, life-saving equipment, propulsion systems, bilge pumping, and electrical standards, with exemptions and special provisions for safety and operational conditions. They apply to new and existing fishing vessels over 24.4 meters or 150 gross tons that are not sailing ships, and require compliance with specific design, construction, and operational standards to ensure safety at sea.
