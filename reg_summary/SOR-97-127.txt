These regulations implement the divestiture of the Canada Communication Group from the public service to St. Joseph Corporation, establishing rules for employees who transition to the new employer, including eligibility for superannuation options, death benefits, and pensionable service periods, and specify key dates and definitions for the transition. The regulations come into force on March 7, 1997, and apply to employees who cease public service employment on the transfer date and accept employment with the new employer.
