This regulation establishes a 1% marketing levy on pulse crops produced in Saskatchewan and marketed interprovincially or exported, which must be deducted by buyers, assemblers, or processors and remitted to the Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board. The levy applies to all pulse crops except those produced under research institutions, and each monthly payment must include a detailed list of producers and the amounts deducted.
