These regulations establish criteria for identifying certain shares and debt obligations of domestic systemically important banks that are subject to "bail-in" conversion under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, ensuring that prescribed liabilities are converted into common shares on a pro rata basis and that holders of such obligations receive preferential treatment over subordinate claims. The regulations also define when and how conversions occur, including requirements related to capital adequacy, ranking, and equal treatment among holders of like-ranking instruments.
