These regulations establish the requirements for sex offender registration within the Canadian Forces, designating specific military police stations and the Office of the Provost Marshal as registration centres, and specifying that reports and notifications must be made in person or by electronic means. The regulations come into force upon the enactment of the 2007 National Defence Act amendment and apply to Canadian Forces personnel subject to service discipline or serving in the primary reserve.
