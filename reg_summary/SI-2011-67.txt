The Governor General, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, transfers control of several key units within the Department of Public Works and Government Services to Shared Services Canada, effective August 4, 2011, and appoints the Minister of Public Works and Government Services as the head of Shared Services Canada. This move consolidates oversight of services related to technology, project management, and infrastructure support under a centralized shared services model.
