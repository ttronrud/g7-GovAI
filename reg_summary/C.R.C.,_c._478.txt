This regulation defines "authorized hours" and outlines the conditions and fees for "special services" provided by customs and excise officers outside regular hours. For such services, a person must pay $54 for the first two hours and $27 for each additional hour, plus cover transportation, living expenses, and accommodation for officers, with security required if the chief officer deems it necessary to ensure payment.
