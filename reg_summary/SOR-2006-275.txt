These regulations establish a special funding mechanism for defined benefit pension plans that had an initial solvency deficiency between December 30, 2005, and January 1, 2008, allowing the deficiency to be funded through equal annual special payments over a period of up to five years, with certain exceptions for multi-employer plans and conditions on member and beneficiary objections. The rules provide for transparency, require notification to beneficiaries, and modify standard solvency standards to permit extended funding periods while maintaining plan stability.
