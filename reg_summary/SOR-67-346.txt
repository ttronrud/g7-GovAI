This regulation revokes previous dry dock rules for Canadian Vickers Limited and replaces them with new rules governing fees, procedures, and responsibilities for vessel use of its dry docks, including entry requirements, payment terms, safety standards, and liability for damage or delays. It establishes clear conditions for docking, outlines fees based on vessel size and time, and places responsibility on vessel owners for damages, compliance, and safety measures, particularly regarding hazardous materials.
