This regulation establishes standardized Specifications for electronic automatic temperature compensators (ATCs) in metering assemblies used to measure liquids, ensuring accurate volume corrections based on temperature and pressure. It outlines design, performance, and installation requirements for ATCs, including temperature sensor placement, volume correction accuracy, and compatibility across different liquids, all to ensure fair and reliable trade measurements in Canada.
