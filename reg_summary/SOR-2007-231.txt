This regulation establishes the rules for the administration of the First Nations Land Registry under the First Nations Land Management Act, outlining procedures for registering and recording documents affecting First Nations lands, including definitions, submission methods, requirements for documents, and priority rules for registered interests. It ensures transparency, public access, and proper record-keeping while restricting certain types of transactions—such as long-term leases or transfers to non-members—without specific land descriptions tied to official plans.
