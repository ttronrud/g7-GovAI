This regulation withdraws certain lands in the Northwest Territories from disposal to facilitate the settlement of native land claims, specifically related to the Gwich’in Claim and the Mackenzie Delta, effective until September 30, 1993 or the implementation of the Gwich’in Agreement, whichever comes first. It excludes specific mineral rights, leases, and existing interests while reserving lands subject to existing leases or agreements for sale.
