This regulation grants a customs duty remission for goods imported from the United Kingdom between January 1, 2021, and the implementation of the Canada-UK Trade Continuity Agreement, equal to the difference between the Most-Favoured-Nation duty and the duty that would have applied under the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The remission is available only if a claim is submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness within two years of importation.
