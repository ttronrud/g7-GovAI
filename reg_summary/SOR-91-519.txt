This regulation confirms the revocation of an old by-law and the adoption of a new one governing the National Battlefields Park, establishing rules to protect the park’s property and environment, restrict certain activities like cycling and skateboarding, and require proper control and cleanup of animals. The new by-law prohibits damaging property, polluting water, and unauthorized use of recreational equipment, while requiring visitors to keep animals leashed or confined and to clean up animal waste.
