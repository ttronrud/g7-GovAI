These Regulations establish the responsibilities and procedures for the Translation Bureau of Canada, including the prioritization of translations and interpretations, the role of designated officials and interdepartmental committees, and requirements for departments to provide timely, accurate, and complete documentation for translation requests. The Bureau must ensure translations conform to "le français universel" or Standard English, provide technical advice, and resolve priority conflicts through an advisory committee, while departments are required to support the Bureau through forecasting, cooperation, and timely submission of materials.
