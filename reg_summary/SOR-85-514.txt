The Governor General in Council has revoked the previous Shipping Casualties Reporting Regulations and replaced them with new rules that require shipmasters and responsible personnel to promptly report shipping casualties, accidents, and dangerous occurrences—both by radio and through written reports—within 24 hours, with specific requirements for the content and completion of these reports, including the need for a witness in certain jurisdictions. The regulations apply to all ships in Canadian waters and abroad, ensuring timely reporting to Canadian authorities or designated international counterparts.
