These regulations establish administrative monetary penalties under the Canada Labour Code, designating specific violations (such as breaches of safety, wage, or working conditions provisions) and classifying them into types (A to E) with corresponding penalty amounts based on baseline fines and a history of non-compliance. Penalties are calculated according to the violator’s type (individual, business, or department) and the severity of the violation, with reduced payments allowed for Type A, B, or C violations if paid within 20 days.
