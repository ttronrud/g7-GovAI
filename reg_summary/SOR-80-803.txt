The Comox Airport Zoning Regulations establish height and land-use restrictions around Comox Airport to ensure aviation safety, prohibiting any structure or object from exceeding designated approach, transitional, or outer surfaces. These regulations apply to specific lands and waters adjacent to the airport, defined by a detailed boundary description, and also restrict the accumulation of bird-attractive waste.
