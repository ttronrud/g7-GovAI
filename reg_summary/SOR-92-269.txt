This regulation revokes the previous Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations and replaces them with new rules that define specific deleterious substances—such as acutely lethal effluent, BOD matter, and suspended solids—originating from pulp and paper mills, and establishes conditions under which these substances may be deposited, including requirements for monitoring, reporting, and environmental safeguards. It applies to all pulp and paper mills except the Port Alberni Mill.
