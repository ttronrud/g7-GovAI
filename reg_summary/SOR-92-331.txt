These regulations, enacted on June 1, 1992, define the scope of insurance activities permitted for companies under the Trust and Loan Companies Act, particularly limiting their ability to promote or administer certain types of insurance, and establishing strict rules on data sharing, advertising, and relationships with insurance companies, agents, and brokers—especially regarding authorized insurance types and customer privacy. They also prohibit companies from providing direct access to promotional content for non-authorized insurance products or sharing customer information with insurers or brokers.
