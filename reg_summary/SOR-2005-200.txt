This regulation establishes the conditions and financial assistance provisions for veterans, pensioners, and eligible civilians regarding last sickness, funeral, burial, and cremation costs, including the provision of gravemarkers when necessary. Financial assistance is available only if there is an insufficiency of funds, determined by assessing the net assets of the survivor and succession, and applications must be submitted within one year of death, with priority given to the liquidator, survivor, or those best able to ensure burial.
