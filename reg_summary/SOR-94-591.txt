These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Teslin Airport, limiting the height of any structure or building within a defined area adjacent to the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, with height limits based on approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. The regulations apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, with maximum building heights constrained by specific imaginary planes derived from the airport’s design and elevation.
