This regulation excludes certain portions of the critical habitat of the Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population—specifically within Banff, Waterton Lakes, and Jasper National Parks—from the official designation of critical habitat under the Species at Risk Act, as those areas are protected under the Canada National Parks Act. The Order is made by the Ministers of the Environment and Fisheries and Oceans to comply with the Act’s requirements and comes into force upon registration.
