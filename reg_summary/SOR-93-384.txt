The Canadian government revoked an earlier order and replaced it with a new one that grants administrative and technical staff of the U.S. Embassy in Canada, along with their families, certain privileges and immunities—such as immunity from legal proceedings and tax relief—except for nationals or permanent residents of Canada, who are excluded. This order extends these rights under the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act.
