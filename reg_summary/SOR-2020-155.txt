The CUSMA Rules of Origin Regulations establish the criteria for determining whether a good or material is "originating" under the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement, based on production processes, value content, and the use of materials from CUSMA countries. These rules define key terms such as direct costs, value allocation, and eligibility for origin status, and provide a framework for calculating regional value content to ensure compliance with trade preferences.
