These regulations exempt aircraft objects that were registered before the regulations came into force from sections 426 to 436 of the Bank Act, with full exemption applying five years later, and they come into force when the Aircraft Protocol is enacted for Canada. This ensures that aircraft objects are not subject to Bank Act provisions that apply to other mobile equipment.
