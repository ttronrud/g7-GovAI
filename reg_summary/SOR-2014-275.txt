This regulation establishes safety standards for grade crossings in Canada, outlining requirements for signage, warning systems, sightlines, and road and railway design parameters for both public and private crossings. It specifies responsibilities for railway companies and road authorities in maintaining safety features, providing detailed information about crossings, and complying with design and operational standards, with certain exemptions for low-traffic or low-speed crossings.
