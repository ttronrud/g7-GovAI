This regulation establishes the rules for dredging leases in the Northwest Territories, granting exclusive rights to individuals to dredge for certain minerals (such as gold and silver) from river beds, subject to specific requirements including lease size limits, annual dredging volumes, royalty payments, and environmental protections. Leases are for 15 years, renewable under conditions, and include provisions for public navigation rights, tailings management, and compliance with existing mining claims.
