These regulations address the posting of large quantities of letter-post items abroad by Canadian residents, requiring the Corporation to either return such items or have the sender pay full Canadian postage if the items are posted to return addresses in Canada or if the sole purpose is to profit from lower foreign rates. If the sender refuses to pay, the items are treated as undeliverable.
