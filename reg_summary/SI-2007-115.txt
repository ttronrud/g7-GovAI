The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to add the Bering cisco and black redhorse to Canada’s List of Wildlife Species at Risk, citing insufficient data and lack of immediate threats, while referring the assessment of the ghost antler lichen back to COSEWIC due to newly discovered population data. The decision for the black redhorse also includes a commitment to conduct socio-economic analysis before considering listing.
