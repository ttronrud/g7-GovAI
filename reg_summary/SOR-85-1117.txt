The Alberta Potato Commission establishes a levy system requiring potato growers and dealers to pay a specified fee on potatoes sold interprovincially or exported, with growers and dealers required to calculate and remit the levy within 15 days of the following month. The levy is collected to support potato marketing and is administered through the Alberta Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order.
