The Tax Court of Canada revoked the old Tax Review Board Rules and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Award of Costs (Income Tax Act), effective January 1, 1991, and replaced them with new Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and (Informal Procedure), which govern appeals under the Income Tax Act and other related legislation, including procedures for filing, service, expert witnesses, costs, and elections between informal and general procedures.
