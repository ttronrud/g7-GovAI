This regulation withdraws a large tract of land around Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories from disposal, designating it for future development as a national park, including the underlying minerals, while preserving existing mineral claims. The area covers approximately 2,860 square miles and is defined by a detailed boundary description, with a specific parcel excluded to preserve existing mineral rights.
