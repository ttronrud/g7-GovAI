The Indian Band Election Regulations establish the procedures for holding band elections, including the preparation and distribution of voter lists, nomination processes, mail-in voting, polling procedures, and ballot counting, with specific rules for residency, voter eligibility, and election administration. These regulations apply to all elections except accelerated elections and ensure transparency, accessibility, and fairness in the electoral process.
