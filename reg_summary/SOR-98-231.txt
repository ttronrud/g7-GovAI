These regulations, enacted on April 1, 1998, govern the superannuation rights of public servants who transition from the Department of Public Works and Government Services to a new employer through a government agreement, ensuring continuity of benefits such as pensions, death benefits, and allowances, while specifying key dates and conditions for eligibility. They apply to individuals who cease public service employment and begin work with a new employer, with certain provisions extending to survivors and children, and include specific rules on contribution returns and pensionable service periods.
