This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for current softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2008, based on historical export and production volumes, with specific formulas and conditions for primary producers and remanufacturers. Allocations are determined using reference period data, with priority given to those who exported products in the past, and a reserve pool ensuring equitable distribution when demand exceeds available quotas.
