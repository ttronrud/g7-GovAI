These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Sanikiluaq Airport in Nunavut to ensure aviation safety by preventing developments or natural growth that could interfere with aircraft operations, signals, or communications. They define specific surfaces (such as approach, outer, and transitional surfaces) and prohibit structures, vegetation, or activities that penetrate these surfaces or interfere with aeronautical services, with limited exceptions like short-term water storage.
