These regulations establish safety and pollution prevention requirements for vessels operating in Arctic and polar waters, including mandatory compliance with SOLAS, MARPOL, and the Polar Code, and specify conditions under which vessels may navigate in shipping safety control zones, including requirements for ice class, crew qualifications, and pollution control. They also outline specific safety measures for vessels operating in low-temperature environments and provide exemptions or equivalency provisions for vessels that do not meet standard classifications.
