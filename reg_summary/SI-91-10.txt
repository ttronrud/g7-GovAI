This regulation revokes an old order and establishes a new one that grants remission of customs duties and excise taxes on Passover foods and products not available in Canada, imported during a specified period before and during the Passover holiday. The remission is granted only if a claim is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of the final accounting.
