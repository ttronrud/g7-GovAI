This 1992 regulatory order remits income tax for individuals who received Quebec family allowances in 1992, based on specific calculations involving taxes, interest, penalties, and deemed payments, provided that the remission exceeds certain thresholds related to how family allowances were treated for income tax purposes. The remission is designed to offset the tax impact of including family allowances in taxable income under the Income Tax Act.
