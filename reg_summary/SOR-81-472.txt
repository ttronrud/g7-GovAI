The Yellowknife Airport Zoning Regulations establish elevation limits and land use restrictions around Yellowknife Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, prohibiting structures or natural growth that exceed designated approach, transitional, or outer surfaces. These regulations define specific boundaries, surfaces, and strip dimensions based on runway orientation and elevation, and prohibit waste disposal or accumulation that could attract birds.
