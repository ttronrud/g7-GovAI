The Antarctic Environmental Protection Regulations establish a strict permitting system requiring applicants to submit detailed environmental evaluations, waste management plans, and emergency plans before conducting activities in Antarctica, with the goal of minimizing environmental impact. Permits are issued only if activities are likely to have less than a minor or transitory effect on the environment, and permit holders must comply with rigorous conditions regarding waste disposal, animal introduction, and environmental monitoring.
