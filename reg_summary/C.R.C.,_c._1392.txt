These Regulations establish the rules for pension continuation for Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) members, including definitions of key terms, eligibility for service credit, allowances for pension purposes, and the process for officers to elect to reduce their pension in favour of a survivor’s pension. They also outline conditions under which such elections can be made, revised, or revoked, and specify actuarial methods and documentation requirements for determining pension reductions.
