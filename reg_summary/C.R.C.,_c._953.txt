These Regulations establish the financial framework for Indian Bands, requiring them to maintain a designated account with a financial institution, authorize at least three signatories (two of whom must be Band members) for payments, and undergo annual auditing by an independent auditor whose report must be made available to Band members and submitted to the Minister. All expenditures are subject to the Indian Act, and authorized expenditures by the Minister are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
