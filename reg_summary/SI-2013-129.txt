This regulation proclaims the formal entry into force of the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Kingdom of Norway on January 1, 2014, establishing rules for how social security benefits are calculated, eligible periods are credited, and individuals are covered based on residency, employment, and contribution history. It ensures that individuals working or residing in either country are eligible for benefits under the other country’s system under certain conditions, with creditable periods being totalized and benefits being paid without reduction due to residence in the other country.
