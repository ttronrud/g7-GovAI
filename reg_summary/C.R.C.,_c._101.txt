The Penticton Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions for buildings and structures near Penticton Airport, limiting all constructions to the elevation of designated surfaces—specifically a horizontal surface, approach surfaces at either end of the runway, and transitional surfaces—measured from a defined airport reference point. These limits apply to specific parcels of land described on Plan E.890, ensuring aviation safety by preventing structures from exceeding safe clearance levels.
