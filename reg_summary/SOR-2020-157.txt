These regulations establish the tariff preferences under the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), specifying that originating goods imported into Canada from CUSMA countries are entitled to preferential tariff treatment based on where the last production process occurred, provided certain shipping and documentation requirements are met. Exceptions apply when goods are classified under specific subheadings, requiring compliance with a change in tariff classification in the country of production or destination.
