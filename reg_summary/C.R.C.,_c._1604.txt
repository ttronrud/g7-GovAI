These Regulations establish requirements for weather modifiers in Canada to submit detailed pre-activity notices and ongoing reports to the Administrator of the Atmospheric Environment Service, including information on the proposed activity, personnel, equipment, materials, and operations, with specific formatting and timelines. They also mandate the maintenance of daily records and periodic reports to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with the Weather Modification Information Act.
