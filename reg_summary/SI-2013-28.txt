The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, refers the Humpback Whale (North Pacific population) and the Eulachon (Nass River and Skeena River population) back to COSEWIC for further assessment due to concerns about the structure of the designatable unit and new data indicating a decline in Eulachon abundance. The Minister also approves adding a statement explaining these referrals to the public registry under the Species at Risk Act.
