Despite identifying an imminent threat to the survival of the Steelhead Trout populations in the Chilcotin and Thompson Rivers, the Governor General in Council has decided not to list these species under the Species at Risk Act, based on a review of environmental, social, economic, and public interest factors. This decision reflects a determination that the species do not meet the criteria for inclusion on the List of Wildlife Species at Risk.
