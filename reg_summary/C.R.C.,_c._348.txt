These Regulations establish the framework for providing financial assistance—such as subsidies and contributions—to Canadian shipbuilders for the construction of eligible ships, with eligibility based on size, purpose, and construction timing. The assistance is limited in amount and subject to conditions, including the use of Canadian materials, compliance with construction schedules, and repayment requirements for certain contributions.
