The Domestic Ferries Security Regulations establish a comprehensive security framework for Canadian domestic ferries and ferry facilities, requiring operators to develop and maintain security plans, conduct regular audits, and implement measures to detect and respond to security threats. The regulations define key security requirements, including access controls, personnel training, communication protocols, and specific security levels (MARSEC 1–3), all aimed at preventing security incidents and ensuring the safety of passengers and operations.
