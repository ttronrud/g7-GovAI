The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs has established the Propane Dispenser Specifications to ensure accurate measurement and safe operation of liquid propane dispensers for motor vehicles, requiring all such dispensers to include an electronic automatic temperature compensator (ATC) and meeting specific design, installation, and performance standards. These specifications apply to all propane dispensers used in trade and mandate features such as proper temperature sensor placement, vapour return line requirements, and prohibitions on using vapour return lines for fuel tank refilling during transactions.
