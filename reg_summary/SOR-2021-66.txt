These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" — goods not imported for sale or industrial use — under the Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement, granting them origin status in a CUKTCA beneficiary country if they are marked appropriately or lack any indication of origin. The rules come into force on April 1, 2021, or upon registration if later.
