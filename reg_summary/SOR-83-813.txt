These regulations establish the terms under which the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission can advance funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Unemployment Insurance Account, including the issuance of promissory notes, interest rates (compounded semi-annually), repayment schedules, and the right to prepayments with Minister’s approval. The advances are secured by promissory notes and must be repaid with interest, with overdue amounts accruing additional interest, and payments prioritized by chronological order of advances.
