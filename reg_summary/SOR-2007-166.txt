This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for current softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2007, based on historical export or production volumes, with specific formulas and conditions for primary producers and remanufacturers. The allocations are determined by calculating percentage shares using data from the reference period (April 1, 2001 – December 31, 2005), with certain preferences and exclusions for those who relinquish their allocations or export to Quebec.
