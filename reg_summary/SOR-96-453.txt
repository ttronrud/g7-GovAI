These regulations, made under the Alternative Fuels Act, define alternative fuels and motor vehicles and establish that fuels such as ethanol, methanol, propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and electricity—along with certain blends containing at least 50% of these fuels—are recognized as alternative fuels, while specific vehicle types are designated as motor vehicles. The regulations come into force on September 24, 1996.
