These regulations establish specific indexing ratios to adjust excise taxes on wines, cigarettes, and manufactured tobacco, with different multipliers applied for September 1, 1983, and September 1, 1984, to reflect changes in the cost of living. The adjustments are made to ensure tax rates keep pace with inflation as defined in the Excise Tax Act.
