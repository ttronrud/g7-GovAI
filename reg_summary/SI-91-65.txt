This 1991 regulatory order approves the Public Service Commission's decision to exclude certain air traffic controller appointments in the Department of Transport from the application of section 10 and subsection 21(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, specifically for training and operational positions during a defined period (May 1, 1991, to December 31, 1996), including exemptions from appeal rights for affected appointments. The order facilitates the appointment of air traffic controllers through the Selection by Seniority and Transfer Down Programs without triggering standard employment Act provisions related to qualifications or appeals.
