This regulation outlines definitions and exemptions under the Weights and Measures Act, specifying when devices are exempt from compliance requirements—such as for certain types of measuring equipment, standard quantity commodities, or devices used in specific trades like petroleum, fishing, or retail food. It also details the conditions under which devices may be approved, exempted, or used without full certification, including provisions for temporary or practical exceptions when obtaining approval would be impractical.
