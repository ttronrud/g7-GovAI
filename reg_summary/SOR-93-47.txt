The Adjudication Division Rules, effective February 1, 1993, establish the procedures and practices for hearings conducted by the Immigration and Refugee Board, including requirements for notice, language access, witness management, conference procedures, and the conduct of hearings, with a focus on ensuring fairness, efficiency, and full opportunity for all parties. These rules provide detailed guidelines on how inquiries are initiated, managed, and concluded, including provisions for adjournments, expert witnesses, translations, and the handling of applications and orders.
