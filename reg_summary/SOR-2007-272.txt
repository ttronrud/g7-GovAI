This regulation establishes the environmental assessment framework for First Nations oil and gas projects under the First Nations Oil and Gas and Moneys Management Act, requiring assessments—through screening, comprehensive study, mediation, or review panels—based on environmental impacts, public consultation, and mitigation measures, with decisions made to protect the environment and human health while respecting Indigenous governance and the precautionary principle. Projects deemed to have insignificant environmental effects are exempt from full assessment, but all others must undergo a structured, transparent process involving public participation and review.
