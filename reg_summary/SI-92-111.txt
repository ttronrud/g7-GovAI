This regulation withdraws certain lands in the Nunavut Settlement Area from disposal, including mineral and quarry rights, to facilitate Inuit land claims settlement, effective until May 31, 1995 or the ratification of the land claims agreement, whichever comes first, while preserving existing mineral, lease, and other valid rights. The withdrawal specifically includes lands at Fry Inlet on Contwoyto Lake as identified on a 1991 agreement map.
