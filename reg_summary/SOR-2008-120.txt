These regulations establish restrictions on vessel operations in specific Canadian waters, prohibiting the use of electrically propelled or power-driven vessels—particularly those above certain power thresholds—within designated rivers, lakes, and coastal areas to protect public safety, environmental integrity, and navigational efficiency. Exceptions are made for authorized activities such as scientific research, aquaculture, and public events, which require permits, as well as for specific groups like fishermen, enforcement officers, and those operating under constitutional rights.
