This regulation establishes the Interim Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Israel, which enters into force on September 1, 2003, and governs the social security obligations of individuals who work or reside in either country, including rules on contribution liability, benefit eligibility, and residency for pension purposes. It ensures that certain individuals—such as Canadian citizens, refugees, and stateless persons—qualify for Canadian social security benefits under the same conditions as Canadian citizens, while also defining how employment and residence affect coverage under Canada’s Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan and Israel’s National Insurance Law.
