The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Forestry, revoked the previous Forestry Timber Regulations and introduced the Timber Regulations, 1993, which establish rules for issuing permits and agreements for the cutting and removal of timber in forest areas, including requirements for fees, environmental protection, permit conditions, and debris removal. These regulations ensure that timber harvesting is conducted legally, sustainably, and with accountability through permit systems, environmental safeguards, and oversight by forestry officers.
