The Products Containing Mercury Regulations, made under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, restrict the manufacture and import of products containing mercury, with specific exemptions for certain categories, replacement parts, and low-mercury items. The regulations require labeling of mercury content, safe handling instructions, disposal information, and reporting of mercury quantities, while also mandating permits for products where no technically feasible mercury-free alternative exists.
