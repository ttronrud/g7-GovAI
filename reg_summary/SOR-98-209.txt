These regulations establish strict rules for the storage, display, transportation, and handling of firearms by individuals in Canada, requiring firearms to be unloaded and secured using lock devices, locked containers, or vaults, with specific exemptions for certain categories of firearms, professionals, and hunting-related activities. The regulations came into force on December 1, 1998, and apply to non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited firearms, with additional provisions for antique firearms and transmission by post.
