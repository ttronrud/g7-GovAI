The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to list the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna or the Yellowmouth Rockfish on the Species at Risk List, citing significant socio-economic impacts and the lack of expected conservation benefits from listing, with both species continuing to be managed under the Fisheries Act with existing scientific and monitoring measures.
