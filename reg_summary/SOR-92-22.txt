These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Kindersley Airport in Saskatchewan, limiting the height of structures and natural growth near the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, with specific surface limits (approach, transitional, and outer surfaces) defined by elevation and distance from the runway. No building or object may exceed these surfaces, and land use is restricted to prevent bird attraction from waste disposal.
