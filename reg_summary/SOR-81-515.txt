This regulation establishes a levy of 2 cents per dozen eggs imposed on Manitoba egg producers who market their eggs in interprovincial and export trade, to be paid within seven days of the week in which the eggs are marketed. The levy is administered by the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board and collected at its office in Winnipeg.
