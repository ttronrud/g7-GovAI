These regulations require retail credit associations in Canada to clearly inform customers that their deposits are not insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), through written notices, verbal explanations, and prominent displays in branches, websites, and advertisements. The notices must include specific formatting requirements and must be provided either in the account agreement or as a separate document, with a signed declaration from the customer confirming they have received and understood the information.
