This regulation revokes an earlier order and establishes new terms for export assistance payments to Canadian dairy exporters, setting limits on payment amounts based on differences between Canadian support prices and world or U.S. market prices, and requiring exporters to submit documentation after shipment to receive payment. The assistance is administered by the Canadian Dairy Commission and is available for butter, skim milk powder, cheese, and aged cheddar cheese under specific conditions.
