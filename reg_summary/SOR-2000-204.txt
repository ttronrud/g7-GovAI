This regulation approves the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, setting out detailed requirements for licensing Class I nuclear facilities—such as reactors and certain processing plants—covering site evaluation, design, safety, environmental protection, worker training, and decommissioning, with specific information requirements for each stage of operation or construction. It also establishes a 24-month review timeline for license applications, with exclusions for additional assessments or consultations, and outlines certification and requalification processes for personnel working in these facilities.
