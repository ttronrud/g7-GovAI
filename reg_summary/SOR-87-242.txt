The Canadian Egg Marketing Agency revoked the old Canadian Egg Licensing Regulations and introduced new regulations in 1987 to govern the licensing of individuals involved in the interprovincial or export marketing of eggs, requiring licenses for buyers and sellers, strict record-keeping, and compliance with marketing plan conditions. These regulations apply to all egg marketers except those buying fewer than 300 dozen eggs per month and establish requirements for licensing, reporting, and enforcement.
