The Toll Information Regulations require toll-charging companies to submit quarterly reports detailing their rate of return, explanations for material deviations between actual and forecasted results, and supporting calculations, with possible exemptions or extended reporting periods if no significant changes are found. The National Energy Board may request additional information if the provided details do not fully explain performance variances.
