These regulations implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2206 (2015) by prohibiting Canadian individuals and entities from dealing with, exporting, or providing financial or technical assistance to armed mercenaries, military activities, or arms to South Sudan, with limited exceptions for humanitarian, UN-related, or approved activities. The regulations also establish procedures for exemptions and disclosures, and require certain entities to monitor property linked to designated persons.
