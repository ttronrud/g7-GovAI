This regulation establishes a list of goods that are exempt from excise tax when imported under specific circumstances, such as for temporary use, repair, public exhibition, or as part of a rental arrangement, and includes conditions related to ownership, exportation, and documentation. It also outlines requirements for declarations and reporting, particularly for imported art and vehicles, to ensure compliance with tax and customs rules.
