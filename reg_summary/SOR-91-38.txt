This regulation specifies how a registrant must disclose the goods and services tax (GST) payable on taxable supplies, requiring clear and visible notice to the recipient at the location of the supply. For certain services like coin-operated telephones or parking spaces, alternative methods—such as publishing tax rates in telephone directories or giving public notice—may be used instead.
