This regulation designates the Canadian Army Special Force as a special force under the Canadian Forces Act and exempts its members from the Defence Services Pension Act, except in specific cases such as transfer to regular forces or reattestation, where they may elect to have their service counted for pension purposes. Such service is deemed prior non-contributory service for pension contribution calculations under the Defence Services Pension Act.
