These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Pond Inlet Airport in Nunavut to ensure aviation safety by preventing developments or natural growth that would interfere with aircraft operations, signals, or communications. They define specific surfaces—such as approach, strip, outer, and transitional surfaces—within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, and prohibit construction, use, or wildlife activity that penetrates these surfaces, with limited exceptions like short-term water storage.
