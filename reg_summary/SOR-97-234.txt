These regulations establish exemptions for police officers and individuals assisting in police investigations under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, allowing them to engage in certain controlled substance-related conduct—such as handling, importing, or producing substances—without violating the Act, provided the actions are conducted in the course of a legitimate investigation and under specific conditions. The regulations also outline reporting requirements for the possession, transfer, and disposal of controlled substances and precursors by police forces.
