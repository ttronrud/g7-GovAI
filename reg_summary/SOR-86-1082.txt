The Canadian Human Rights Commission revoked the 1978 Equal Wages Guidelines and replaced them with updated guidelines in 1986 that define factors justifying wage differences for work of equal value, such as skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions, while requiring employers to demonstrate that such differences are applied consistently and equitably. These guidelines establish specific criteria for wage comparisons, including the use of weighted averages for individual complaints and specific thresholds for occupational group composition, and provide detailed justifications for wage disparities based on performance, seniority, reclassification, or other non-discriminatory factors.
