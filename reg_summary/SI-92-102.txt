This regulation grants tax remission to Indians and certain bands or designated corporations on specific Indian settlements for income tax and goods and services tax, based on the difference between taxes paid and taxes that would have been payable if those settlements were classified as reserves. The remission applies to taxation years after 1992 and is subject to a written application submitted within four years of tax payment.
