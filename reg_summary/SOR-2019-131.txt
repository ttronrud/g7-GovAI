These regulations establish the legal framework for a hydroelectric project on Black Lake First Nation’s Chicken Reserve No. 224, incorporating applicable Saskatchewan laws while ensuring they operate within federal constitutional limits. The regulations define key terms, specify how Saskatchewan laws apply to the project, and outline responsibilities for enforcement, water rentals (split 50% to the Water Security Agency and 50% to Her Majesty in right of Canada for the benefit of the First Nation), and administrative procedures, all while excluding certain federal laws and adapting Saskatchewan statutes to reflect the unique status of the First Nation.
