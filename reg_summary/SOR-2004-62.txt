These regulations establish the rules for calculating and administering the Canada Health Transfer, Canada Social Transfer, and Wait Times Reduction Transfer, including methods for determining provincial population and revenue bases, timelines for estimating and finalizing transfer payments, and procedures for adjusting or recovering amounts based on new information or overpayments. The transfers are calculated using federal tax revenue and provincial population data, with estimates made at specific intervals and final payments determined within 30 days of receiving population certificates from Statistics Canada.
