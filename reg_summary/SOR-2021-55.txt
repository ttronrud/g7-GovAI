These regulations set a maximum fee of $100 for disability tax credit requests by promoters, with annual adjustments based on changes in the Consumer Price Index to account for inflation, and limit total fees for multiple requests per taxation year to $100. The fee adjustments are applied only if they exceed the base fee by $5 or more and are rounded to the nearest dollar.
