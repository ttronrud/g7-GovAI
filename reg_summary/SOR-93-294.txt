The Governor General, on the recommendation of federal ministers, revokes the previous Air Transportation Tax Regulations and introduces the 1992 version, which establishes rules for collecting and reporting the air transportation tax, including requirements for ticketing, prepayment evidence, exemptions for certain aircraft, and how to calculate tax when both passengers and goods are transported. It also outlines adjustments to tax amounts when U.S. ad valorem taxes are applied.
