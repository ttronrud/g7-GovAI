The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, authorizes the Minister to set fees for environmental services (such as weather, climate, and wildlife information) based on the full or partial cost of providing those services, with exceptions to protect user income, service availability, or where a commercial alternative exists. Fees are waived for registered charities (excluding universities).
