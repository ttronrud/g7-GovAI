The Governor General in Council has revoked the 1982 Selkirk Marine Railway Dry Dock Regulations and replaced them with new regulations that establish the rules for the management and operation of the Marine Railway Dry Dock at Selkirk, Manitoba, including requirements for vessel entry, dock charges, safety standards, and responsibilities of agents and the Superintendent. These regulations govern access to the dry dock, dock charges based on vessel size and usage, environmental and safety protocols, and penalties for non-compliance.
