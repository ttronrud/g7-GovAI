This regulation establishes the formal entry into force of the Canada-Latvia Agreement on Social Security, which allows citizens of both countries to access social security benefits (such as pensions and disability benefits) under the same conditions as nationals of the other country, based on creditable periods of residence or employment. The agreement entered into force on November 1, 2006, after meeting mutual legal requirements and includes provisions for benefit calculation, transitional rules, and mutual information sharing between the two governments.
