These Ontario regulations govern the interprovincial and export marketing of greenhouse vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce) produced in Essex, Kent, and Lambton counties, restricting sales, purchases, and transportation to authorized producers, wholesalers, retailers, or appointed shippers, with exceptions for direct producer-to-consumer sales. Licences may be issued by the Commodity Board to allow producers to sell, transport, or ship products outside the Commodity Board system, with licences expiring on December 31 of the year issued.
