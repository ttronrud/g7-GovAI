These regulations define when a corporation is considered "prescribed" in relation to another corporation under the Excise Tax Act, primarily focusing on ownership structures involving closely related corporations, employees, or trusts, and specify that CDSL Canada Limited and CUE Datawest Ltd are prescribed corporations in relation to every credit union. The rules establish conditions under which qualifying voting control and ownership thresholds (such as 90% or 50%) trigger the prescribed corporation status.
