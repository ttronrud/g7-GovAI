The Governor General, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, transfers control of several divisions within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans—specifically the Office of Boating Safety, the Canada Shipping Act 2001 Regulatory Reform Team, the Navigable Waters Protection Division (except for section 678 responsibilities), and part of the Environmental Response Division—to the Department of Transport. Additionally, it transfers specific powers, duties, and functions related to shipping regulation under sections 519(a), (b), (d), and 562.15 and 562.16 of the Canada Shipping Act from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to the Minister of Transport.
