The Transport Control Regulations empower the Transport Controller (or Deputy Controller) to regulate the transportation of goods in bulk by setting priorities, minimum quotas, and transport requirements, and to order the use or limitation of transport facilities, equipment, or services. Violations are punishable by fines and/or imprisonment, with certain defences available for failures resulting from compliance with valid orders.
