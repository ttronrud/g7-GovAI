This regulation remits certain passport fees for individuals who had their passports lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible due to the 2017 British Columbia forest fires, provided they meet specific conditions related to residency, application timing, and documentation. The remission applies to fees under the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations, as long as the fees were not previously remitted.
