The Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission establishes a levy system requiring producers to pay 75 cents per metric tonne and buyers to deduct 50 cents per tonne on canola marketed interprovincially or exported, with buyers forwarding the collected levies to the Commission within 55 days of the month's end. This regulation, under the Saskatchewan Canola Order, aims to fund canola development and support in Saskatchewan.
