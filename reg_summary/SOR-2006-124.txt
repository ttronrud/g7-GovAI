This regulation establishes the definitions and exemptions for pest control products under the Pest Control Products Act, specifying which products are exempt from full regulatory requirements—such as those used in food processing, personal use, or as antimicrobial preservatives in certain treated articles—and outlines detailed labeling, shipping, and safety requirements for imported and transported products. It also allows the use of unregistered active ingredients solely in the manufacture of registered pest control products.
