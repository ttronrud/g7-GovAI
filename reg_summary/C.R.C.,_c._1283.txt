These Regulations establish guidelines for the free postage of materials intended solely for the use of the blind in Canada and abroad, including size, weight, labeling, and packaging requirements, and ensure such materials are accepted at no charge via registered mail or XpresspostTM. Materials must be clearly labeled with designated terms or approved labels and must meet specific dimensions and customs requirements to qualify for free postal delivery.
