The National Energy Board revoked its previous Rules of Practice and Procedure and issued new rules in 1995 to govern the conduct of proceedings, including applications, complaints, hearings, and service of documents, emphasizing fairness, public interest, and procedural flexibility. These rules establish detailed procedures for filing, serving, amending, and verifying documents, determining hearing formats, allowing interventions, and ensuring transparency in public hearings.
