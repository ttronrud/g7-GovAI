This regulation excludes certain designated areas—specifically parts of Thousand Islands National Park and several national wildlife areas—from the critical habitat of the threatened Pugnose Shiner, as required by the Species at Risk Act, due to their protected status under other federal laws and consultation with Indigenous and environmental authorities. The Order ensures that these areas are not subject to development or disturbance that could harm the species, while still protecting the species’ critical habitat elsewhere.
