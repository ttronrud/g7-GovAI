These Regulations grant eligible public service employees leave of absence while serving in the Canadian Forces reserves for training, emergencies, or duty, with pay either at civil or military rates, depending on the type of leave, and ensure that such leave does not affect seniority or compensation eligibility. Leave for certain training or service activities is unpaid and requires departmental approval, while injury or illness during leave is covered under specific pay provisions.
