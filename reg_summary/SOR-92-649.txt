These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Charlottetown Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations by limiting the height of structures and natural growth, defining specific surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) that buildings and objects cannot exceed, and prohibiting waste disposal that attracts birds. The rules apply to lands within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point and are based on detailed geometric and elevation requirements derived from approved zoning plans.
