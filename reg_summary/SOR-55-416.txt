These regulations govern pension contributions and benefits under Part V of the Defence Services Pension Act, specifying how contributions are calculated, transferred, and paid, including provisions for service in the armed forces, civil service, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as rules for counting past service, interest, and repayment of arrears. They also outline the conditions under which service can be counted toward pension or gratuity calculations, with specific rates of pay and allowances applied based on rank and type of service.
