The regulation establishes rules for interest on overdue payments to Her Majesty and administrative charges for dishonoured instruments, setting a monthly interest rate of the average bank rate plus 3% for overdue amounts, with exceptions and waivers for concessionary loans, emergencies, or circumstances beyond a debtor’s control. Administrative charges of $15 (plus additional fees in certain cases) apply when instruments are dishonoured, and these charges or interest may be waived if justified by hardship, emergencies, or other exceptional circumstances.
