The Rabies Indemnification Regulations allow the Minister of Agriculture to reimburse provinces up to 2/5 of the amount paid to animal owners for animals that died from rabies, with maximum reimbursement amounts set by animal type. Payment is only made if a veterinary inspector certifies the animal died from rabies.
