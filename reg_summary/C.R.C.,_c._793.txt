This regulation grants remission of excise duty when spirits are destroyed due to accidents during transportation or handling in licensed bonding warehouses, provided that the destruction was not due to negligence and the spirits were not illegally removed. Remission is only granted if written request and documentary evidence are submitted to the Minister of National Revenue confirming these conditions.
