Canada revoked a previous order restricting compliance with U.S. extraterritorial measures affecting trade with Cuba and introduced a new rule requiring Canadian corporations and their directors/officers to notify the Attorney General of any U.S. communications that would restrict trade with Cuba, while also prohibiting compliance with such measures or related directives. This action protects Canadian economic interests and sovereignty in trade with Cuba under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act.
