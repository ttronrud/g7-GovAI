This regulation amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and its regulations to apply specifically to travellers entering Canada through preclearance areas or perimeters in the United States, updating definitions, requirements, and inadmissibility grounds to reflect the unique nature of such entries. It also modifies various provisions to ensure consistency with preclearance operations, including changes to visa and authorization requirements, entry conditions, and exemptions related to alcohol and plant protection.
