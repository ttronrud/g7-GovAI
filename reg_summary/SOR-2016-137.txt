These regulations implement Canada’s obligations under the Montreal Protocol by banning the manufacture, use, and export of certain ozone-depleting substances (such as CFCs, HCFCs, and methyl bromide), with limited exceptions for essential, emergency, or critical uses, and by requiring permits for any import, export, or use of these substances. The regulations also establish rules for the reclamation, recycling, and destruction of these substances and set specific timelines for their handling.
