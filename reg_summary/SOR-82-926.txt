This regulation revokes an earlier set of rules and establishes new insurance provisions for loans made to Chrysler Canada Ltd., allowing the Government of Canada to insure up to $200 million in loans from private lenders, subject to strict conditions related to plant conversions, employment levels, investment targets, and loan repayment terms. The insurance is tied to specific projects at Chrysler’s Windsor facilities and includes requirements for employment, asset security, and licensing agreements with Chrysler Corporation.
