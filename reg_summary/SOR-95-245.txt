The Minister of Foreign Affairs repealed the previous fees order and introduced a new one that specifies fees for import and export permits and certificates under the Export and Import Permits Act, with different rates depending on who delivers the permit (private individual vs. government bureau) and the type of goods involved. Certain goods are exempt from these fees.
