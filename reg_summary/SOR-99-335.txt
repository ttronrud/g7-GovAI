These regulations establish rules for private buoys—non-governmental buoys used in Canadian waters—requiring them to be clearly marked with "PRIV," meet specific size and visibility standards, display the owner’s contact information, and not interfere with navigation. The owner must maintain the buoy and its anchor properly, and the Minister of Transport may require modifications or remove non-compliant buoys.
