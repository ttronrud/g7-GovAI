The Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health has issued the Tobacco Charges Regulations under the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act, establishing a system for designated tobacco manufacturers in Canada to pay an annual charge based on their net sales revenue, calculated using a formula tied to the annual cost base, and requiring them to submit detailed sales and revenue statements annually. The regulations also outline reporting requirements, payment deadlines, public disclosure of non-compliance, and record-keeping obligations.
