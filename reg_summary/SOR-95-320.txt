This regulation establishes licensing policies for Direct-to-Home (DTH) pay-per-view television programming undertakings in Canada, requiring them to operate in a competitive market, make significant financial contributions to Canadian programming (at least 5% of gross revenues), and adhere to equitable exhibition ratios of Canadian to foreign content. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is directed to issue licenses only through a competitive process, ensure fair access to programming, and not deny licenses based on the use of foreign satellites or holding a DTH distribution license.
