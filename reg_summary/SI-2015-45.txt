This regulation grants a tax remission for a Sahtu Dene and Metis Settlement Corporation when it ceases to exist and all its assets are transferred to a Sahtu Dene and Metis First Nation Government under a self-government agreement, including any associated penalties and interest. Remission is only granted if the amount has not already been refunded and if the recipient applies in writing to the Minister of National Revenue within 18 months of the order being made or by the filing deadline of the relevant taxation year, whichever is later.
