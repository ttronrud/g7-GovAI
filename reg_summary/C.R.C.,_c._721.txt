This regulation authorizes the Minister of National Defence to provide materiel, services, and money to foreign naval and merchant ships under repayment terms, with conditions including cost recovery, maximum debit limits, and reciprocal arrangements for cash advances. Repayment is required, and no materiel is issued without the recipient agreeing to pay at least the Crown's estimated cost.
