This regulation authorizes specific parties, including truck operators, shippers, and port authorities, to enter into or renew agreements under a Memorandum of Agreement to resolve a dispute affecting container traffic at the Port of Vancouver and the Port of Fraser River, with the goal of stabilizing the national transportation system. It grants the Vancouver and Fraser River Port Authorities the authority to implement licensing systems that require adherence to the agreement and an arbitration process, exempting these actions from competition law constraints for the duration of 90 days.
