These regulations govern the seizure and disposal of turnips marketed in violation of interprovincial or export trade rules in Prince Edward Island, allowing the Commodity Board to seize suspect produce, detain it with a tag or notice, and either return it or dispose of it after a hearing, with fees deducted for handling and marketing. Any person affected by a decision may appeal to the Commodity Board and, if necessary, to the Prince Edward Island Marketing Board.
