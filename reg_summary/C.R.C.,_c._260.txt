This regulation establishes a turkey marketing levy system in Quebec, requiring producers to pay $0.05 per pound of live weight on any turkey marketed beyond their allocated market quota. Buyers must deduct these levies from payments to producers and remit them to the Commodity Board, with producers also responsible for paying any unpaid levies within 15 days of the following month.
