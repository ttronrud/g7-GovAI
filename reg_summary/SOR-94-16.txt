These regulations require certain imported goods from non-CUSMA countries to be marked with their country of origin, except for specific exempted categories such as goods for personal use, antiques, charitable purposes, or items that cannot be marked without damage or significant cost. The country of origin is determined as the country where the goods were substantially manufactured.
