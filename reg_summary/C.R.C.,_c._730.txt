These Regulations establish Revenue Trust Accounts in financial institutions to hold money paid to the Receiver General for specific purposes, not public funds, and outline conditions under which such funds may be repaid to payers, including when purposes are not fulfilled or deposits exceed required amounts. They also specify that if a service is rendered by or on behalf of Her Majesty, the Treasury Board determines the amount to be retained, with the remainder repaid to the payer.
