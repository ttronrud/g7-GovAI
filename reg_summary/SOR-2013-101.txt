These Regulations establish administrative monetary penalties under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, classifying violations as minor, serious, or very serious based on a gravity factor, and specify penalties, payment deadlines, and procedures for compliance agreements, reviews, and appeals. Penalties vary by violation severity and whether the offender is a non-profit or commercial entity, with specific rules for payment methods, timelines, and delivery of notices.
