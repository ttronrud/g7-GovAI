These regulations establish procedures for the disposal of abandoned or unclaimed personal property and vehicles at airports in Canada, requiring retention periods of at least 30 days for personal property and 90 days for abandoned vehicles, with disposal options including sale, gift to a charity, or destruction, and all proceeds going to the Receiver General. The Airport Manager must notify owners of their rights to reclaim property, and if not claimed, the Regional Administrator may dispose of the property at their discretion.
