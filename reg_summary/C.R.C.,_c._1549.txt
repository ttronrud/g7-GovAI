This regulation establishes Fishing Zone 6 of Canada, a designated area in the Arctic sea adjacent to the mainland and islands, bounded by geodesic lines and a 200-nautical-mile distance from the baseline in the Beaufort, Arctic, and Lincoln Seas, excluding internal waters and territorial seas. The zone is defined by specific geographical coordinates and is cited as the Fishing Zones of Canada (Zone 6) Order.
