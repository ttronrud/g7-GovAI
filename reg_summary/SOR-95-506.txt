These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Sachs Harbour Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure or object whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria around the airport. The regulations apply to all land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, ensuring safe aviation operations by limiting obstructions near runways and approach paths.
