This regulation decides not to add the Winter Skate (three Canadian populations) and the Chinook Salmon (Okanagan population) to Canada’s List of Wildlife Species at Risk, citing insufficient evidence of imminent extinction, significant economic costs from fishing closures, and the availability of existing legislation and management measures to address threats like bycatch and habitat degradation. The Minister of the Environment approves public disclosure of the reasons for these decisions, emphasizing that current conservation actions under the Fisheries Act and treaty agreements are sufficient to support species recovery without the need for listing.
