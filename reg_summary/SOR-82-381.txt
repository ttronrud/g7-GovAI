These regulations establish the framework for determining and paying claims by Canadian citizens against the People’s Republic of China’s government, based on property losses before August 20, 1981, with awards limited to $100,000 per claim and funded from the Foreign Claims Fund. The Foreign Claims Commission evaluates claims, and payments are made only if the claimant was a Canadian citizen on October 20, 1981, with compensation from other sources deducted from the award.
