This by-law establishes requirements for member financial institutions in Canada to accurately and transparently represent their status as CDIC members, clearly disclose deposit insurance eligibility, and provide specific information to depositors, including the display of membership signs, brochures, and badges in both physical and digital formats. It also mandates warnings for uninsured deposits and requires institutions to maintain and submit updated records of their deposit-taking activities and trade names to ensure transparency and prevent false or misleading representations.
