These regulations require manufacturers of vaping products in Canada to submit detailed reports on sales and ingredients to the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, including information on product types, sales volumes and values, returns, nicotine concentration, flavour, and ingredient details, with specific reporting timelines and formats. The regulations apply to all vaping products and assortments intended for retail sale, except those authorized under the Food and Drugs Act, and mandate the use of unique product identifiers and standardized reporting forms.
