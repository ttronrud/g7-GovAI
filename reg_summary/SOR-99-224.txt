The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a by-law to establish rules for calculating and paying interest on certain deposits after the interest termination date, based on the terms of the deposit contract and specified indexes or reference points, with adjustments for periodic interest calculations and missing information. Interest is determined using specific formulas depending on contract terms and is subject to conditions related to index availability and early withdrawal penalties.
