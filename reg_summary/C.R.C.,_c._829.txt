These regulations establish limits on the discharge of certain pollutants—specifically biochemical oxygen demanding matter and total suspended matter—by potato processing plants into waterways, requiring owners to monitor, sample, and report effluent levels based on production volume and pH, with stricter requirements for new and expanded plants. Compliance is enforced through regular sampling, flow measurement, and monthly reporting to ensure environmental protection under the Fisheries Act.
