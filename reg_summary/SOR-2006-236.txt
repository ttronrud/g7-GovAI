The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) adopted a by-law requiring provincial financial institutions applying for deposit insurance to submit comprehensive applications that include detailed financial statements, business plans, information on directors and officers, capital structure, litigation, and governance practices, all to ensure the applicant meets prudential standards and is fit to operate safely. The by-law establishes clear definitions and criteria for ownership, control, and material disclosures to support CDIC’s oversight and risk assessment under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act.
