These regulations require retail cooperatives to designate a provincial office for serving enforcement notices, publish the designation (or changes) in specified media, and maintain an up-to-date online list of designated offices. Enforcement notices must include the named person’s full name, latest address, and either their social insurance number or date of birth.
