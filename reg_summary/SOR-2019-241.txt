These regulations establish the requirements for commercial carriers and individuals chartering flights to provide detailed passenger and flight information to Canada’s Customs and Border Services Agency (CBSA) before and after departure, ensuring timely, accurate, and electronic reporting of passenger data and flight details for border control purposes. The information must be submitted electronically, with specific deadlines based on whether it pertains to passengers or crew, and must include personal details, flight identifiers, and departure information.
