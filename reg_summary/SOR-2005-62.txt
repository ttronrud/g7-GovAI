This regulation establishes a framework for Canada to provide wildlife compensation to agricultural producers through production insurance agreements with provinces, allowing for compensation for damage caused by wildlife outside standard crop insurance programs. It sets strict requirements for actuarial soundness, premium rate methodologies, probable yield, and unit value determinations, and includes financial safeguards—such as reduced federal premium support—until provinces meet certification standards demonstrating financial viability and accuracy in their insurance plans.
