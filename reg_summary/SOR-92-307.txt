This regulation outlines the procedures for public inquiries into objections to proposed incorporations, continuances, or amalgamations of cooperative credit associations, setting out requirements for notice, participation, submissions, and the handling of inquiries by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. It ensures transparency and public access by requiring the publication of inquiry notices, allowing public examination of documents, and mandating that findings be shared with parties after the Minister's public release.
