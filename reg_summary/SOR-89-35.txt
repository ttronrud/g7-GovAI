These regulations define key terms and establish procedural guidelines for the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, including how to determine domestic production, identify related parties, assess market impact, and evaluate whether importation causes or threatens serious injury or market disruption to Canadian producers. They also authorize the Tribunal to operate with a single member as a quorum in certain cases to ensure efficient management of its caseload.
