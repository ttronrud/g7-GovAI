This regulation establishes a program to provide transitional assistance benefits to automotive industry workers who lost their jobs due to the Canada-United States Agreement on Automotive Products, ensuring they receive financial support during a period of unemployment, with benefits calculated based on prior earnings and adjusted for dependents, while also aligning with existing unemployment insurance rules. The benefits are paid for up to 156 weeks starting from the date of lay-off, with specific eligibility criteria and protections against disqualification under certain conditions.
