This regulation establishes egg marketing levies in Alberta, requiring producers and producer graders to pay $0.005 per dozen eggs sold, and processors to deduct and remit these levies to the Alberta Egg and Fowl Marketing Board within a specified timeframe. The levies are held in trust and must be accounted for in a form set by the Board.
