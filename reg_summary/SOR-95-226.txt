This regulation repeals two outdated Crown Corporation regulations and replaces them with new rules governing restricted transactions, property disposal, remuneration, by-laws, and borrowing for Crown corporations, while providing specific exemptions for certain corporations and transactions under the Financial Administration Act. It establishes clear conditions for property sales, limits director benefits to market levels, and exempts specific Crown corporations from borrowing approvals for certain transactions.
