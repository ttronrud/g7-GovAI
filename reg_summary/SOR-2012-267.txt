These regulations require a local cooperative credit society considering conversion to a federal credit union to provide members with a detailed notice at least four weeks before a vote on the special resolution, outlining changes in deposit insurance coverage during and after the transition. The notice must be made available online, in branches, in newspapers, and in the Canada Gazette, and must include information on provincial deposit insurance termination, transitional coverage, and post-transition coverage differences.
