These regulations establish the framework for assessing and collecting expenses from financial institutions and other entities that make specified reports to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. The assessment is based on a combination of a base amount tied to the entity’s asset value in Canada and a proportional share based on the number of reports filed, with specific formulas and thresholds outlined for different types of entities.
