This 1954 regulation revokes previous rules under the Dominion Succession Duty Act and establishes new procedures for assessing, reporting, and administering succession duties, including prescribed forms, filing requirements, valuation methods, and enforcement powers for executors, heirs, and financial institutions. It outlines specific forms and conditions for reporting property values, obtaining consent for withdrawals, paying small claims, and determining duty based on interest rates and mortality tables.
