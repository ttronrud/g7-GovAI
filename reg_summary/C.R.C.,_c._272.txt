These Saskatchewan Hog Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations govern the marketing of hogs produced in Saskatchewan, restricting direct sales to only the Commission or specific exempted parties, while allowing producers to sell hogs directly to small processors, consumers, other producers, or designated processors for research. Producers may also sell sows to order buyers at public auctions, and are entitled to payments from the Commission based on hog sales, including initial and subsequent payments tied to quality, quantity, and expenses.
