This regulation withdraws specific tracts of land in the Kivalliq area of Nunavut from disposal for 10 years to support Indigenous land agreements, while exempting certain mineral-related activities and leases that were already in place or required to support existing claims or exploration rights. The affected lands are identified on approved territorial resource base maps and include both surface and subsurface rights.
