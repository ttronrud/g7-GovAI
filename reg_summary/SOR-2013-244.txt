The Air Canada Pension Plan Funding Regulations, 2014 establish specific funding requirements for Air Canada’s defined benefit pension plans, including contributions based on normal cost, solvency deficiencies, and additional payments to address solvency shortfalls, with provisions for interest on late payments and adjustments to solvency ratios. These regulations supersede certain provisions of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985, and are designed to ensure plan solvency, with the regulations ceasing to apply on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier by Air Canada.
