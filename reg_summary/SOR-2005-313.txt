These regulations establish mandatory hours of service for commercial vehicle drivers in Canada, setting limits on daily driving, on-duty, and off-duty time, and requiring compliance with rest periods, including 8 consecutive hours of off-duty time and 10 hours of total off-duty time per day. They also define key terms, outline exceptions for certain vehicles and situations, and require drivers to maintain a record of duty status, with provisions for sleeper berth rest and electronic logging device use.
