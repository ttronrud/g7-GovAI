This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Stephenville Airport in Newfoundland, defining elevation limits for buildings and structures around the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, with specific surfaces (approach, transitional, and outer) set to prevent obstructions. It prohibits structures exceeding these surfaces and restricts land use to prevent bird attraction, based on detailed geometric and elevational boundaries defined in the schedules.
