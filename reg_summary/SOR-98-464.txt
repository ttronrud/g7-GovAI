These regulations define which firearms are considered "antique firearms" under the Criminal Code, specifically those manufactured before 1898 that discharge only rim-fire or center-fire cartridges, with certain exceptions, and establish that such firearms are subject to specific legal provisions. The regulations came into force on December 1, 1998.
