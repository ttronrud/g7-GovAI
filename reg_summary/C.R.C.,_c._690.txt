The Defence Materiel Loan Regulations govern the conditions under which military and defence-related property (materiel) may be loaned to various entities, including civil organizations, law enforcement, and foreign armed forces, for purposes related to national defence or public benefit, with specific restrictions and cost recovery provisions. Loans are authorized only when the Minister of National Defence determines it serves the national interest, and borrowers are generally required to pay reasonable charges or replace the materiel, except in cases involving charitable, non-commercial, or defence-support activities.
