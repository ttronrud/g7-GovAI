This proclamation designates a list of countries as "designated states" under the Visiting Forces Act, specifying that the Act applies to them with certain exceptions, and defines which civilian personnel accompanying visiting forces are considered part of the civilian component. It limits eligibility to civilians who are nationals of designated states, not stateless persons or nationals of non-designated states, and who are not ordinarily resident in Canada.
