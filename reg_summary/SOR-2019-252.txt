These Environmental Response Regulations establish requirements for oil-handling facilities and vessels involved in the loading or unloading of oil in Canada, including mandatory oil pollution prevention and emergency plans, notification timelines, equipment standards, and response procedures, with special provisions for areas north of latitude 60°N and facilities of different oil transfer rates. The regulations come into force on a specified date and replace previous environmental response arrangements.
