The Governor in Council designates Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta as provinces with payment and adjudication regimes reasonably similar to those under the Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act, thereby qualifying them for federal prompt payment protections. This designation comes into force on the day section 387 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2019, comes into force or on the date of registration if later.
