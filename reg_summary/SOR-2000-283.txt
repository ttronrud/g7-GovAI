These regulations establish a quota system allowing producers, dealers, and hatchery operators in non-signatory provinces to market broiler hatching eggs or chicks into signatory provinces, with quotas determined based on historical marketing data and production advantages, and requiring compliance with specific application and reporting requirements. The quotas are designed to ensure orderly marketing and prevent market oversupply, and they expire annually on December 31.
