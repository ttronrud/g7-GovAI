This regulation authorizes the Minister of Transport to enter into agreements for providing electronic maintenance services—both with private companies near government facilities and with external parties in remote areas—while establishing specific fee structures based on labor rates, fringe benefits, vehicle operating costs, parts pricing, and an overhead rate, all subject to annual review and potential adjustment by the Minister. Fees are determined using standardized benchmarks, including I.B.E.W. wage rates and government-set operating costs, and must be reviewed annually.
