The Military Rules of Evidence establish the standards for admissible evidence in court martial proceedings, defining key terms such as admissible evidence, relevant evidence, and credibility, and outlining procedures for the admission of hearsay, character evidence, and judicial notice. These rules emphasize the burden of persuasion on the prosecutor, require that evidence be relevant and properly introduced, and provide specific exceptions for certain types of evidence, while ensuring that trials are fair and free from prejudice.
