### **Overview**

The *Railway Safety Management System Regulations, 2015* are a set of administrative regulations made under the *Railway Safety Act* (RSA) by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. These regulations establish **minimum safety management requirements** that all railway companies must develop, implement, and maintain to achieve the **highest level of safety** in their operations.

The regulations are structured into **three main parts**:

1. **Part 1**: General requirements applicable to all railway companies.
2. **Part 2**: Specific requirements for two types of local railway companies:
   - Those operating on **main tracks** (lines where railway equipment movement is authorized).
   - Those operating **exclusively on non-main tracks**.
3. **Part 3**: Consequential amendments, repeal of previous regulations, and enforcement date.

These regulations are designed to promote a **proactive, systematic, and evidence-based approach** to railway safety, emphasizing accountability, continuous improvement, employee involvement, and compliance with legal and technical standards.
