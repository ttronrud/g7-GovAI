These Regulations amend the Canada Labour Code to establish flexible working hour limits for bus, city, and highway motor vehicle operators involved in interprovincial or national transportation, allowing weekly hours to exceed 48 in certain cases, with specific caps (e.g., 9 hours/day and 45 hours/week for city operators, 60 hours/week for highway operators), while exempting them from certain overtime provisions and permitting exceptions for holidays or irregular schedules.
