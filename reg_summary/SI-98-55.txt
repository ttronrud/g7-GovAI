This 1998 regulation establishes the official order of precedence for wearing Canadian orders, decorations, and medals, including specific sequences for Canadian honours and foreign awards approved by the Government of Canada, with special provisions for individuals who received British honours prior to 1972. It also prohibits the wearing of unapproved or non-listed awards and ensures that only recipients may display the insignia.
