The Migratory Birds Regulations, 2022 establish rules for the protection and management of migratory birds in Canada, including restrictions on hunting, baiting, and disturbing nests or eggs, while allowing exceptions for scientific purposes and conservation. The regulations also outline permit requirements, possession and hunting limits, and provide the Minister with authority to adjust hunting seasons or limits in specific areas to protect bird populations.
