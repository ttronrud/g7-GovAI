This by-law exempts certain deposits of less than $150,000 from deposit insurance, specifically those made by federal member institutions from entities such as governments, international agencies, pension funds, mutual funds, or other entities meeting specific financial or service criteria. The exemption applies to the first deposit transaction between a person and the institution and comes into force upon registration.
