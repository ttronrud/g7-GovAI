These regulations require registrants to obtain specific information from supporting documentation before claiming an input tax credit, with the level of detail increasing based on the amount of the supply: less than $100 requires minimal information, while supplies of $500 or more require comprehensive details including supplier information, tax amounts, payment terms, and a description of each supply. The rules are designed to ensure transparency and accuracy in tax claims under the Excise Tax Act.
