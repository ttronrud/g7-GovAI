The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Public Complaints Commission established these Rules of Practice and Procedure to govern hearings related to public complaints, ensuring fairness, transparency, and efficiency in the process, including provisions for record filing, service of documents, witness summoning, requests for information, motions, and private hearings when appropriate. The Rules allow for flexibility in procedure, including informal hearings and agreements between parties, while maintaining accountability and confidentiality where necessary.
