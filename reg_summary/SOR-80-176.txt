These regulations establish a controlled marketing system for Ontario-grown asparagus in interprovincial and export trade, requiring all producers to sell through the Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing Board, prohibiting direct sales or transportation outside designated receiving stations, and mandating that all transactions occur via written contracts. Proceeds from sales are distributed to producers based on the quantity, grade, and size of asparagus delivered, with payment terms and grade disputes governed by specific provisions and the Farm Products Grades and Sales Act.
