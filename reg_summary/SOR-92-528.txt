These regulations define the regulatory capital of cooperative credit associations in Canada, specifying that it consists of members’ and shareholders’ equity, minority interests, and subordinated indebtedness, minus goodwill, with specific requirements for subordination and term of securities. For regulatory purposes under certain sections of the Act, the capital is further adjusted to exclude certain investments, loans, and minority interests in affiliated insurance companies or securities dealers.
