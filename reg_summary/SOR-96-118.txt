The Canada Oil and Gas Installations Regulations establish safety, environmental protection, and operational standards for oil and gas installations in Canada, including requirements for design, construction, emergency preparedness, hazard classification, and the placement of equipment near sources of ignitable vapours. These regulations ensure the safety of personnel, minimize environmental damage, and mandate compliance with quality assurance and classification standards.
