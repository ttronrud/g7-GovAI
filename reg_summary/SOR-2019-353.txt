This regulation establishes mandatory labelling and packaging requirements for vaping products in Canada, requiring manufacturers to display the nicotine concentration (in mg/mL), a required health warning, and, in certain cases, permitted "nicotine-free" expressions on the main display panel of exterior or interior packages. The information must be clearly visible, legible, and presented in both English and French using standardized font and size requirements, with specific rules for packaging formats, kit products, and display surfaces.
