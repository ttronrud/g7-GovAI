These regulations establish accounting requirements for certain goods (tariff items 9971.00.00 and 9992.00.00), mandating importers to provide an invoice detailing repair or alteration costs and proof of export to designated countries, and they come into force on January 1, 1998. The regulations were not published under normal requirements because they implemented a prior public announcement.
