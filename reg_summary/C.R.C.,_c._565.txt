These Brewery Regulations define key terms related to beer production and distribution in Canada, establish rules for production days and excise duty payments, outline conditions for refunds when beer is destroyed, and specify labeling and export requirements, including provisions for beer delivered to accredited representatives. Beer produced by a licensed brewer must be subject to excise duty paid by the end of the following month, with exceptions for six-month returns, and specific rules apply to destruction, labeling, and export situations.
