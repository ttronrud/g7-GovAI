This regulation repeals the British Columbia Milk Order and replaces it with a new order granting the British Columbia Milk Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of milk from British Columbia, including the power to impose and collect levies on milk producers for administrative, financial, and equity purposes. The Board’s powers are limited to those under the Milk Industry Act and Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act and do not include functions previously held by the Canadian Dairy Commission.
