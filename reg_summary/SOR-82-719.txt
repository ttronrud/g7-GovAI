This regulation grants the Nova Scotia Winter Grain Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of wheat produced in Nova Scotia, allowing it to exercise the same powers it has for local marketing under the Agricultural Products Marketing Act. The order, known as the Nova Scotia Wheat Order, enables the Board to manage wheat marketing through orders or regulations affecting persons and property within the province.
