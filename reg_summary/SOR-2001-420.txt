These regulations establish the methodology for calculating the regulatory capital of bank holding companies in Canada, based on shareholders’ equity, minority interests, and subordinated indebtedness, while excluding certain investments and loans that are part of the capital of controlled insurance companies or securities dealers. The capital amount is adjusted to reflect the regulatory capital of controlled entities and is subject to specific requirements for subordinated securities.
