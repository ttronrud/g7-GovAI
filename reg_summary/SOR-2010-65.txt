The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) adopted the Telecommunications Fees Regulations, 2010, which require certain telecommunications service providers with at least $10 million in Canadian telecommunications services revenues to pay an annual fee, a supplementary fee, and an annual adjustment based on their contribution-eligible revenues and the CRTC’s estimated regulatory costs. The regulations came into force on April 1, 2010, and specify formulas for calculating these fees, with adjustments applied to reflect actual versus estimated costs in the following year.
