This regulation implements a supplementary convention between Canada and Spain to amend their 1976 double taxation avoidance agreement, clarifying tax treatment of income, dividends, interest, royalties, and capital gains, while introducing limits on tax rates, defining residency and permanent establishments, and establishing rules to prevent double taxation. Key changes include caps on dividend and interest taxation, expanded definitions of business and enterprise, and provisions allowing tax deductions or credits in either country to avoid double taxation.
