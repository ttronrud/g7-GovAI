This regulation allows former members of Parliament to count their service in the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Account as pensionable service under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, provided they make a written election before ceasing to be a member of the RCMP and surrender any retirement allowance entitlement. The election must be submitted within one month of signing, and if made after a one-year window or due to misinformation, it may be subject to conditions, including medical examination requirements or repayment of prior benefits.
