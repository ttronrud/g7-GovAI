The Nova Scotia HST Regulations, 2010 establish a 10% harmonized sales tax (HST) rate for Nova Scotia and its offshore area, with specific rules addressing tax calculation and collection for supplies made after April 6, 2010, but before May 1, 2010, particularly when portions of the supply or consideration relate to periods after July 1, 2010. These rules ensure that tax is calculated at 10% on the relevant portion, with a deemed 8% collection rate and a requirement for the recipient to pay the difference, unless certain exceptions apply (e.g., continuous journeys, pre-July 1, 2010 services, or specific types of memberships or transportation passes).
