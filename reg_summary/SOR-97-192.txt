This regulation prohibits the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) from issuing, amending, or renewing broadcasting licences to non-Canadians, and deems an applicant a non-Canadian if controlled by a non-Canadian through any means, except in specific cases involving qualified successors. The direction comes into force on April 8, 1997.
