This regulation, now repealed by SOR/2024-265, outlines the definitions and contribution calculation rules for the Canada Pension Plan, including how employee and employer contributions are determined based on remuneration, basic exemptions, and contribution rates, with specific provisions for payments made at different frequencies and limits on total contributions. It also establishes rules for the timing and remittance of contributions to the Receiver General, including special rules for employers with high average monthly withholdings.
