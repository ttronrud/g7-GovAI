These Regulations establish the framework for Canada to provide financial contributions to provinces for the cost of nursing home care benefits under a universal nursing home care benefit program, based on base year payments adjusted for cost and population increases. Contributions are calculated using a formula that considers per diem care costs and the number of residents aged 65 or over, with initial payments set at a reduced rate and advances made monthly, while requiring provinces to maintain auditable records and comply with specific administrative and financial conditions.
