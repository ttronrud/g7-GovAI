These Regulations establish a method for determining the prescribed rate of interest for customs purposes by calculating the simple arithmetic mean of the average equivalent yields of Government of Canada Treasury Bills maturing three months after issuance, based on auctions held in the first month of the preceding quarter. The rate is expressed as a percentage per year and rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percentage, and applies to interest calculations under the Customs Act, Customs Tariff, and the Special Import Measures Act.
