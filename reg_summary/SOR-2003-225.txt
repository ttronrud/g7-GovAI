This regulation establishes the Saskatchewan Canola Order, granting the Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of canola, including the power to impose levies or charges on producers and marketers based on classification, and to use those funds for operational expenses, loss payments, and equalizing income among producers. The Order comes into force upon registration.
