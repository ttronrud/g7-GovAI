This regulation establishes the methodology for assessing pension plans under the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act, setting the assessment base and basic rate based on plan size and administrative costs, with assessments reduced or eliminated in certain termination scenarios, such as timely winding-up or plan bankruptcy. The Superintendent must publish the basic rate in the Canada Gazette and send written assessments to plan administrators.
