### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order* (hereinafter referred to as the "Order") is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically subsection 23(2.1)). It was enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board, with the objective of promoting public interest by providing a financial remission (i.e., relief) to certain employees of the Cape Breton Development Corporation (CBC).

This Order specifically addresses the remission of unemployment insurance (UI) premiums that were paid by certain employees during a defined period related to their participation in the CBC’s *Pre-Retirement Leave Plan*.

- **Recommendation**: The decision was based on recommendations from the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**, indicating a collaborative, policy-driven approach involving fiscal and administrative oversight.

### **Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order*  
- **Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
- This means the Order is part of the *Statutes of Canada* from 1991, Chapter 24, and specifically Section 7(2).

### **Key Definitions Used in the Order**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (the primary legislation governing unemployment insurance in Canada).  
   → This ensures clarity in interpreting the rights and obligations of individuals under the UI system.

2. **"Individual"**  
   Includes not only the original employee but also their **heir or legal representative**.  
   → This provision extends the benefit of remission to beneficiaries who may inherit the employee’s rights or obligations after death, ensuring continuity of protection.

3. **"Severance Benefit"**  
   Defined as an amount payable under **subsection 19(2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act** *as that section read before October 23, 1990*.  
   → This is a critical limitation: the remission is only applied if the employee did **not** receive a severance benefit under the pre-October 1990 version of the Act.  
   → The reference to the pre-1990 version indicates that changes to the Act after that date (e.g., amendments to severance provisions) may affect eligibility.

### **Core Provision: Remission of Unemployment Insurance Premiums**

The central purpose of the Order is to **remit (i.e., cancel or forgive)** certain unemployment insurance premiums paid by employees of the Cape Breton Development Corporation under the following conditions:

> **Where an individual:**
> - Was paid an amount under the Unemployment Insurance Act **after 1971 and before June 8, 1989**,  
> - As an **employee’s premium** in respect of their **insurable employment** under the **CBC’s Pre-Retirement Leave Plan**,  
> - And during that period, the individual **received a disability pension** under the *Canada Pension Plan* (CPP),  
>  
> **Then remission of that premium is granted to the individual**, **less** the amount of any severance benefit paid to that individual.

### **Eligibility Criteria (Summary)**

An individual must meet **all of the following conditions** to be eligible for remission:

1. **Employment Period**:  
   - Must have been employed by the Cape Breton Development Corporation **after 1971 and before June 8, 1989**.

2. **Employment Type**:  
   - Must have been covered under the **CBC’s Pre-Retirement Leave Plan** — a specific benefit plan designed to support employees transitioning into retirement.

3. **CPP Disability Pension**:  
   - Must have received a **disability pension** from the *Canada Pension Plan* during the period of insurable employment referenced above.

4. **Severance Benefit**:  
   - If the individual received a **severance benefit** under the pre-October 23, 1990 version of subsection 19(2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, that amount **must be subtracted** from the remitted premium.  
   - This means remission is **not full** — it is reduced by the severance benefit amount.

---

### **Purpose and Public Interest Rationale**

The Order was introduced to:
- Recognize the unique circumstances of employees who were part of the CBC’s pre-retirement program.
- Acknowledge that these employees were on disability under the CPP while also being subject to UI premiums — a dual financial burden.
- Provide relief to reduce the financial strain on individuals who were already receiving disability support.
- Promote fairness and equity in the unemployment insurance system by addressing a specific, historically relevant group of employees.

The Governor General in Council determined that it is **in the public interest** to grant this remission, suggesting that the policy supports broader social and economic goals such as workforce stability, employee well-being, and equitable treatment of long-serving public servants.

### **Important Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No remission applies** to individuals who:
  - Did not participate in the CBC Pre-Retirement Leave Plan.
  - Did not receive a CPP disability pension during the relevant period.
  - Received a severance benefit under the Act (as defined pre-October 23, 1990).
- The remission is **not automatic** — it is conditional upon meeting all specified criteria.
- The remission is **not retroactive beyond the time period** (1971–June 8, 1989).
- The **severance benefit deduction** ensures that the financial benefit is not unlimited — it prevents over-compensation.

---

### **Impact and Significance**

- This Order serves as a **targeted policy intervention** to address historical inequities in employment benefits for public sector workers.
- It reflects a recognition that employees on disability while in a pre-retirement plan may have been disproportionately burdened by UI premiums.
- It demonstrates how federal fiscal instruments can be used to provide targeted relief to specific groups of employees, particularly in public corporations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order* is a specific, narrowly tailored regulation that grants remission of unemployment insurance premiums to certain employees of the Cape Breton Development Corporation who:
- Were employed between 1971 and June 8, 1989,
- Participated in the CBC’s Pre-Retirement Leave Plan,
- Received a CPP disability pension during that period,
- And whose remission is reduced by any severance benefit received under the pre-October 1990 version of the Unemployment Insurance Act.

This Order underscores the importance of balancing fiscal responsibility with social equity, particularly in public employment contexts where employees face complex financial challenges during transitional phases like retirement planning.

**Note**: This Order is a historical instrument, relevant primarily to employees of the CBC during the late 20th century. It is not applicable to current or future employees or to other public sector plans. Its significance lies in its role as a precedent for targeted remission orders under the Financial Administration Act.
