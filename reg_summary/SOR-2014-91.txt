These regulations establish the conditions under which the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans or the Minister of the Environment can authorize the deposition of certain deleterious substances—such as approved drugs, pest control products, or biochemical oxygen-demanding matter—into aquatic environments, ensuring that such deposits do not pose acute risks to fish or their habitats and are conducted in a scientifically sound and environmentally responsible manner. The regulations require specific environmental safeguards, scientific evaluation, and public transparency, particularly for research activities, and come into force upon registration.
