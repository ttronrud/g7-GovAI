The Canadian government has established regulations to limit formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products, requiring manufacturers to test and certify that their products meet specific emission thresholds—such as 0.05 ppm for hardwood plywood and 0.09 ppm for particleboard—using approved testing methods and third-party verification. These regulations apply to most composite wood panels and laminated products but exclude certain structural wood products, specific applications, and products used in research or for export.
