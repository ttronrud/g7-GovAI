The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked the previous Aboriginal Fisheries Agreements Regulations and introduced the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations to govern fishing activities by aboriginal organizations in specified Canadian waters. These regulations allow the Minister to issue communal fishing licences with conditions related to species, methods, vessel and person designations, landing locations, reporting requirements, and conservation measures, while prohibiting fishing during a December 29 to 31 close time.
