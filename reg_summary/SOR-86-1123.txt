This regulation authorizes the Treasury Board to delegate the powers of the Governor in Council under the Financial Administration Act, allowing it to approve or reject contracts that require payments exceeding amounts set by the Board. Contracts exceeding these prescribed amounts must be approved by the Treasury Board before they become effective.
