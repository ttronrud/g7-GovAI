This regulation revokes the previous British Columbia Tree Fruit Order and replaces it with a new order that grants the British Columbia Tree Fruit Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of tree fruit, including the power to impose levies or charges on producers based on group classifications and to use those funds for reserves, expenses, and equalizing profits among producers.
