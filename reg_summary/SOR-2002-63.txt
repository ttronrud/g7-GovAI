These regulations exclude certain outdated or repealed indictable offences—such as those under the Feeds Act, Fertilizers Act, and Seeds Act—from the definition of "designated offence" in the Criminal Code, effective February 1, 2002. The exclusion applies to offences under these acts, except where specifically retained (e.g., section 50 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act).
