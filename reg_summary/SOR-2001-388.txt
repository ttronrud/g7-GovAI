This regulation defines "finance entity" under key Canadian financial acts to include businesses that issue payment, credit, or charge cards or make/refinance loans, while excluding certain entities like financial institutions and specialized financing entities with limited lending activities. The regulations come into force when specific sections of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act are enacted.
