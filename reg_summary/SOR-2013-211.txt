These Explosives Regulations, 2013, establish a comprehensive framework for the safe acquisition, storage, use, and transportation of explosives in Canada, setting out specific requirements, prohibitions, and authorization processes for various types of explosives and fireworks. They exempt certain low-risk explosives from full regulation and allow limited activities without authorization, such as small-scale manufacturing for educational or ceremonial purposes, while requiring strict safety measures, age restrictions, and proper licensing for all other activities involving explosives.
