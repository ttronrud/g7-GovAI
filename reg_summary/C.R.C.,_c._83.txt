The Gander International Airport Zoning Regulations establish height and land-use restrictions around the airport to ensure aviation safety, prohibiting any structure or natural growth from exceeding designated approach, transitional, or outer surfaces. These surfaces are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria and are based on the airport’s reference point, runways, and surrounding areas, as outlined in the schedule and Department of Transport Plan MT-1593.
