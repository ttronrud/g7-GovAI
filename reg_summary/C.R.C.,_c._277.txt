This regulation establishes hog marketing levies in Saskatchewan, requiring producers to pay $0.80 per hog marketed for slaughter, with the levy deducted from payments to producers and collected by the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission. The levy applies to hogs marketed for slaughter except in specific exempt cases, such as those sold for personal consumption, to processors for research, or certain classes like breeding stock or weanlings.
