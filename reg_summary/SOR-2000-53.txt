These regulations designate certain deposits made by authorized foreign banks from specific entities—such as governments, international agencies, financial institutions, and large pension or mutual funds—as "prescribed deposits" for the purposes of the Bank Act, particularly concerning deposit insurance and regulatory oversight. The regulations come into force upon registration and define key terms, including the first deposit transaction and the types of entities eligible for such deposits.
