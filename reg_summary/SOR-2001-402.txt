These regulations establish limits on banks' investments in designated entities, prohibiting acquisitions or increases in substantial investments that would cause the total value of such holdings—along with related loans and guarantees—to exceed 50% of the bank’s regulatory capital, unless specific exceptions apply. The rules also restrict banks from making loans or guarantees to such entities if they would breach this 50% threshold.
