The Northern Pipeline Agency rescinds certain socio-economic and environmental conditions from Foothills Pipe Lines (South B.C.) Ltd.'s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, retaining only a compensation undertaking, and replaces them with new, comprehensive socio-economic and environmental terms and conditions specifically applicable to the southern British Columbia portion of the pipeline. These conditions mandate compliance with environmental protections, community consultation, equitable employment opportunities, and emergency preparedness, all to be implemented under oversight by the Designated Officer.
