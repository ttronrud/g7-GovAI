These regulations establish the tariff preference rules for goods originating in Honduras under the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement, allowing such goods to benefit from reduced tariffs in Canada if they are shipped directly or through another country with proper documentation. The regulations come into force on October 1, 2014, or upon registration if later.
