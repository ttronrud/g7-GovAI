The Governor General, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, transfers control of the Public Access Programs Sector—including the Canada Site, Canada Enquiry Centre, Publiservice, and Gateways and Clusters—from the Department of Public Works and Government Services to the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development under section 207 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This transfer aligns these public access programs under the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development to better support public service delivery and accessibility.
