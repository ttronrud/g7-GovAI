These regulations establish a licensing system for persons involved in the interprovincial or export marketing of broiler hatching eggs or chicks produced for chicken production, requiring buyers and sellers to hold appropriate licences issued by the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency, with specific conditions regarding compliance, record-keeping, and quota requirements. The licences are non-transferable, expire annually, and may be suspended or cancelled for non-compliance.
