These regulations, effective June 1, 1992, require trust and loan companies in Canada to clearly disclose the interest rates and calculation methods for deposit accounts and debt obligations, both at the time of account opening and upon any changes to interest rates. The disclosures must be provided in writing, displayed in branches or online, or included in advertisements to ensure transparency for customers.
