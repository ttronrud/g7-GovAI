The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, approved the revocation of the old Canadian Import Tribunal Rules and the adoption of new rules governing the proceedings, practice, and procedures of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, which may be cited as the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Rules. These rules establish comprehensive guidelines for hearings, document filing (including electronic transmission), service, confidentiality, and procedural fairness, with flexibility for the Tribunal to adapt procedures as needed.
