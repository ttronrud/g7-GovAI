This regulation grants a sales tax remission for Canadian-made aircraft used solely by the manufacturer to demonstrate the aircraft to prospective customers, provided the manufacturer maintains complete records and allows inspection by the Department of National Revenue. The remission is conditional on strict usage and record-keeping requirements.
