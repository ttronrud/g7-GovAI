This regulation establishes Fishing Zones 4 and 5 off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Canada, defining their boundaries using geographic coordinates and arcs of circles with a 200-nautical-mile radius, while excluding certain internal waters and areas near the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. The boundary between Fishing Zone 4 and the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon is specifically delineated using a combination of geodesic lines and arcs of varying radii centered on French island baselines.
