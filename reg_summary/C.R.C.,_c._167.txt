The Nova Scotia Hog Order authorizes the Pork Producers Marketing Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs, including setting and collecting levies or charges based on producer groups to fund operations, reserves, and loss adjustments. These levies may be used to support producer equity and cover expenses related to hog sales.
