The Tax Court of Canada revoked the Pension Appeals Board Rules of Procedure (Contributions and Coverage) effective January 1, 1991, and replaced them with new Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure respecting the Canada Pension Plan, which came into effect on the same date. These rules govern appeals under the Canada Pension Plan, including procedures for filing notices of appeal, serving documents, interventions, and hearings, and are designed to ensure a just, expeditious, and cost-effective resolution of appeals.
