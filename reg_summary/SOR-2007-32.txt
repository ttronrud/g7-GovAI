The Treasury Board, acting on the Minister of National Defence’s recommendation, establishes the Reserve Force Pension Plan Regulations to define eligibility, contributions, and pensionable earnings for reserve force members, with key provisions including participation thresholds based on earnings, contribution rates increasing annually, and the option to count past earnings as pensionable service under specific conditions. These regulations also outline rules for elections, payment of past earnings, and recovery of unpaid contributions from pension benefits.
