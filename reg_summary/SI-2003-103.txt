This regulation grants a remission of certain passport and consular service fees and any associated interest to individuals who were unable to obtain required citizenship or birth certificates due to specific government disruptions in 2002, or who had their service requests denied before June 24, 2002. The remission applies to fees related to passport extensions and various consular services, with the purpose of addressing historical service barriers and administrative issues.
