These Regulations establish traffic rules for vehicles operating on government property and designated highways in Canada, requiring drivers to hold valid provincial or municipal licences and registrations, comply with local traffic laws, and follow specific rules regarding speed, parking, and accident reporting. They also grant authorities the power to install traffic signs and issue permits, with penalties for violations, including fines and imprisonment, and provide exceptions for certain areas like the Confederation Bridge and South Klondike Highway where local jurisdictional laws apply.
