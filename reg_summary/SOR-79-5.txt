This regulation revokes the old Import Permits Regulations from 1954 and establishes new rules governing the issuance and use of import permits under the Export and Import Permits Act. It outlines the requirements for applying for a permit, the information needed, the responsibilities of applicants and importers, and procedures for replacing a lost or destroyed permit.
