The Canadian Turkey Anti-dumping Regulations prohibit the marketing of turkeys in Canada at prices lower than those charged in the province of origin, plus reasonable transportation costs, whether the turkeys are shipped from the unregulated area into the regulated area or vice versa, to prevent dumping and protect domestic producers. This applies to interprovincial trade and ensures fair pricing based on the production location.
