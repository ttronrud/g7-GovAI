These regulations require petroleum facilities that produce liquid petroleum products to implement a leak detection and repair program to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Operators must maintain an inventory of equipment components, conduct regular inspections using calibrated leak detection instruments or visual checks, and repair significant leaks within 15 days, with specific exemptions and thresholds based on component type and leak severity.
