This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Kingston Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting the height of structures and natural growth near the airport, defining specific surfaces (approach, transitional, and outer) that buildings must not exceed. It also prohibits the use of land adjacent to the airport for waste that attracts birds.
