These regulations establish how excise tax is calculated when a person recovers the cost of gasoline from certain individuals (such as employees or contractors), with a standard rate of $0.015 per litre or an optional $0.0015 per kilometre driven in Canada for automobile or truck use. They also define who is deemed to be the purchaser of gasoline in such cases, particularly when reimbursement is made by an employer.
