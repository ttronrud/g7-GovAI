The Governor in Council enacted the Frontier Lands Registration Regulations, effective April 28, 1988, to establish a system for the registration and administration of interests and instruments in frontier lands, including requirements for abstracts, record-keeping, fees, and procedures for registration, corrections, and surrenders. These regulations are administered by the Registrar, based in Gatineau, Quebec, who maintains a register, daybook, and original documents, and ensures public access and accuracy of records.
