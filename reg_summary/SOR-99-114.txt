These regulations establish a fee of $470 for every 1,000 m³ (or portion) of dredged material or inert, inorganic geological matter disposed of at sea under a permit granted under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, with payment due either in full before permit publication or in two installments (at least 50% before publication and the balance before halfway through the permit period). The regulations come into force upon registration.
