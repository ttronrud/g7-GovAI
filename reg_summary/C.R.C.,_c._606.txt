These regulations govern the transhipment of goods originating outside Canada that are destined for countries on the Area Control List, requiring a transit authorization certificate from the exporting country or the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, and prohibiting unauthorized use of such certificates. Transhipment is only permitted if the certificate is presented to a Canadian customs collector or approved by the Minister, and the certificate must be used strictly in accordance with its terms.
