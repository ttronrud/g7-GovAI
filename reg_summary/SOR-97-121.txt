This regulation limits the immunity granted to entities acting on behalf of the United States under the State Immunity Act, stating that such immunity does not apply to any legal entity—regardless of structure or registration—if it acts on behalf of the U.S. unless a majority of its ownership is held by the U.S. or a political subdivision of the U.S. The order took effect on February 18, 1997.
