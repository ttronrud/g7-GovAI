The Additional Canada Pension Plan Sustainability Regulations, made under the Canada Pension Plan, establish rules for adjusting additional contribution rates and benefits based on actuarial reviews, with specific ranges and formulas to ensure plan sustainability. These adjustments aim to maintain balance between contribution rates, benefits, and inflation, while protecting retirees' benefits through defined thresholds and multiplier adjustments.
