This regulation revokes the 1986 Merchant Seamen Compensation Order and replaces it with a 1992 order that increases various compensation amounts and the maximum rate of earnings for merchant seamen and their dependants, bringing them in line with provincial worker compensation standards. Key increases include raising the weekly compensation amounts, the maximum rate of earnings to $49,400, and monthly payments for additional children.
