This regulation grants tax remission to certain former members of the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees for contributions made to a non-existent service, provided those contributions were made before 1991, in accordance with the pension plan, not previously deducted from income, and a written application is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue before January 1, 2002. The remission applies only where such contributions would not have been taxable if they were not deductible under the Income Tax Act.
