This regulation repeals a previous order that had withdrawn certain lands from disposal and establishes a new order to withdraw specific lands in the Yukon Territory from disposal to support the Dawson First Nation's Aboriginal land claim, effective July 25, 1997, for a period ending December 31, 2001. The withdrawal applies to mineral and hydrocarbon rights, excluding existing claims, rights, and resources governed by other legislation.
