The Canadian government enacted the Tetrachloroethylene (Use in Dry Cleaning and Reporting Requirements) Regulations to restrict the use of tetrachloroethylene in dry cleaning by requiring specific equipment, closed storage, and proper waste management, while also mandating reporting of imports, sales, and usage by businesses. These regulations came into force in stages starting in 2003, with full implementation by January 1, 2004, to protect human health and the environment.
