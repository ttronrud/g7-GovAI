The Canadian Transport Commission revoked the previous Electric Sparks Prevention Regulations and introduced the Railway Prevention of Electric Sparks Regulations to prevent electric sparks that could cause fires during the transfer of flammable liquids or compressed flammable gases between railway rolling stock and stationary storage facilities. These regulations require strict electrical bonding, grounding, and insulation measures to eliminate spark risks, with additional restrictions on transfers near high-voltage power lines.
