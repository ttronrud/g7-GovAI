These regulations govern the treatment of public servants who transition from the Department of Health to a new employer under a government agreement, ensuring their superannuation rights, including pensionable service, survivor benefits, and child allowances, are preserved or adjusted accordingly. They came into force on September 1, 2002, and apply to individuals who cease public service employment and begin work with a new employer, with specific provisions for returns of contributions and transfer options.
