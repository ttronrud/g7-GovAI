This regulation, issued under the Emergencies Act, prohibits public assemblies that could disrupt public order, interfere with critical infrastructure, or support acts of serious violence, while exempting certain groups such as Indigenous peoples, protected persons, and those in the national interest. It also establishes protections for critical infrastructure, Parliament Hill, and war memorials, and mandates compliance with requests for essential goods and services to clear blockades, with penalties for non-compliance.
