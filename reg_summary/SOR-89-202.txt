This regulation revokes an old export control list and establishes a new one under the Export and Import Permits Act, imposing export controls on specific goods and technologies—such as dual-use items, firearms, nuclear materials, and certain agricultural products—based on international agreements and destination-specific restrictions. Controls apply to items listed in Groups 1–9 of the schedule, with exemptions for certain low-risk or civil-use materials, and include provisions for trade with the United States and EU countries under CUSMA and CETA.
