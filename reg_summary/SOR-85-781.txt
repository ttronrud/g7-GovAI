These regulations establish a process by which the Minister of Justice examines Bills and regulations for consistency with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, issuing certified reports and transmitting them to relevant officials if inconsistencies are found. The Minister must certify each examined document and report any inconsistencies in writing, with copies sent to the Clerk of the House of Commons and, for regulations, to the Clerk of the Privy Council.
