These regulations establish exceptions to ownership limits for cooperative credit associations investing in designated entities, allowing such investments to continue if the total value of related shares, loans, and guarantees does not exceed 50% of the association’s regulatory capital, particularly when the entity is controlled by another association or a group of associations. If the threshold is exceeded, the association must notify the Superintendent and take steps within two years to divest the investment.
