The Lieutenant Governor in Council of Manitoba enacted the Manitoba Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations to establish procedures for sex offender reporting, define authorized personnel and registration centres, and specify locations where information can be collected or registered under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act. These regulations came into force on the date the Act was enacted and designate RCMP detachments, municipal police services, and aboriginal police service offices as authorized collection and registration points across the province.
