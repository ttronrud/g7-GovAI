The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, revoked several outdated occupational safety and health regulations under the Canada Labour Code and replaced them with new, consolidated regulations effective March 31, 1986, to strengthen workplace safety standards. These updated regulations apply to employers and employees across various industries and include provisions on building safety, fire prevention, machine guarding, hazardous substances, and accessibility for employees with special needs.
