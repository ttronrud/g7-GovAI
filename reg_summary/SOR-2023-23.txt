This regulation replaces the 2006 and 2019 CRTC directions with a renewed, comprehensive framework to guide the Commission in promoting competition, affordability, consumer rights, and innovation in Canada’s telecommunications market. It mandates specific actions, such as maintaining wholesale access for fixed Internet and mobile services, strengthening consumer protections, improving transparency, and ensuring equitable, timely, and evidence-based decision-making across all aspects of telecommunications regulation.
