These regulations govern the temporary importation of goods under tariff item 9993.00.00, allowing importers up to 18 months (extendable under certain conditions) to export or destroy the goods, with specific exemptions and security requirements based on the nature and origin of the goods. Security is only required in certain cases, and is refundable if the goods are exported, destroyed, or consumed in approved circumstances.
