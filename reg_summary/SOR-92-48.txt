These regulations establish criteria for federal institutions to provide services and communications in both official languages, based on the size and distribution of English or French linguistic minority populations in census areas, the nature of services offered, and public demand. Significant demand is determined by specific population thresholds, service types, and consultation with minority communities, ensuring that language access is provided where it is needed most.
