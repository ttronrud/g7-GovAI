The Feeds Regulations, 2024 establish definitions, exemptions, and approval and registration requirements for feeds in Canada, with a focus on ensuring safety for animal and human health, environmental protection, and proper labeling. Certain feeds—such as those used in research, small samples, or for specific temporary uses—are exempt from regulation, while others, including novel feeds or those with novel traits, require prior approval and registration.
