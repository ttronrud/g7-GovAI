These regulations establish zoning restrictions around John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport to ensure aviation safety by prohibiting developments or activities that could interfere with aircraft operations, communications, or signals. They define specific surfaces (such as approach, outer, and transitional surfaces) and restrict construction, vegetation growth, and wildlife-related activities within designated areas adjacent to the airport.
