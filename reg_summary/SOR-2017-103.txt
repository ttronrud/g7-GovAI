This regulation prohibits the issuance of surface and subsurface interests in specified public lands in the Central and Eastern Portions of the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories for five years, to support the settlement of an Aboriginal land claim or related agreements, while exempting certain existing rights and activities such as mineral claims, leases, and renewals. The Order comes into force upon registration and is based on consultations with affected parties and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
