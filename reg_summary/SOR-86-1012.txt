These regulations establish rules for special customs services, defining when services performed outside normal hours, locations, or duties are considered "special services," and setting fees for such services, including hourly charges and reimbursement for transportation, accommodation, and meals. They also require security for payment if needed and specify that certain services—like those involving military conveyances or urgent humanitarian releases—are exempt from being classified as special services.
