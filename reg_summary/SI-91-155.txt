This regulation revokes a previous order and withdraws certain lands in the Yukon Territory from disposal under the Territorial Lands Act, specifically to facilitate native land claims, excluding mineral rights and surface rights held by existing holders, for a period ending December 31, 1993. It includes lands designated as "COMMUNITY LANDS," "RURAL LANDS," and "AREAS FOR SITE SPECIFIC SELECTION" on specified maps, while preserving existing leases, sales agreements, and mineral rights.
