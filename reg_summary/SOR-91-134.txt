These Regulations establish a formal process for determining whether persons detained by the Canadian Forces are entitled to prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Conventions, including the creation of specialized tribunals, procedures for hearings, rights of detainees (such as representation and interpretation), and a review mechanism for tribunal decisions. The process ensures that detainees are treated as prisoners of war until their status is conclusively determined, with protections for due process and access to legal representation.
