This regulation approves the re-application of the Public Service Employment Act to positions excluded under a prior order, while excluding specific positions (GGS-S-910 to 920) in the Office of the Governor General’s Secretary from most provisions of the Act, except for certain key sections related to employment rights and conditions. The decision was made by the Governor in Council, based on recommendations from the Minister of Canadian Heritage and after consultation with the employer.
