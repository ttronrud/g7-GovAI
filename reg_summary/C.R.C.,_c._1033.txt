This regulation outlines the rules for calculating and paying retirement allowances, including interest rates, installment payments, prorating for partial months, recovery of unpaid amounts, and eligibility for children’s allowances, with specific provisions on when and how payments are made, adjusted for mortality rates and interest, and subject to certain conditions related to death, financial hardship, and full-time education. Key interest rates and payment terms vary based on when the election was made, and the rules allow for amendments to payment plans or lump-sum payments, with provisions for deductions if payments are in default.
