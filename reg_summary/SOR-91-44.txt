This regulation prescribes the specific information that must be included in a credit note or debit note under the Excise Tax Act, such as the names and registration numbers of the supplier or intermediary, the recipient, the issue date, and details of any tax adjustment, refund, or credit. It also outlines when certain provisions apply, particularly regarding the disclosure of tax reductions and the total tax rate, with key provisions coming into force in stages starting in 1990.
