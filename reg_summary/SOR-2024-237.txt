The Possession and Export of Elvers Regulations prohibit the possession and export of elvers (American eels less than 10 cm in length) in Canada except under a licence issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, with specific exceptions for licensed anglers, aquaculture operators, commercial transporters, and law enforcement personnel. The regulations establish strict conditions for licensing, record-keeping, transportation, and export, and prohibit mixing legally and illegally caught elvers or combining elvers from different sources in the same container.
