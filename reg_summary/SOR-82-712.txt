These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Fort Nelson Airport in British Columbia, defining prohibited elevations for buildings and structures within specified boundaries based on approach, transitional, and outer surfaces to ensure aviation safety. No structure may exceed the elevation limits of these surfaces, and natural growth or waste that attracts birds must be managed to prevent hazards to aircraft operations.
