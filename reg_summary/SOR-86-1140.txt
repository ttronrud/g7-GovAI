These regulations establish the procedural rules for the Public Service Staff Relations Board under the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act, outlining procedures for filing complaints, applications for certification or revocation of bargaining agent status, service of documents, hearings, and the handling of oppositions and replies, while also providing flexibility for adjournments, extensions, and consolidation of proceedings. The rules ensure that all procedural requirements are met, including time limits, document formatting, and the right to a hearing, with provisions for dismissal of applications lacking merit and for review of decisions.
