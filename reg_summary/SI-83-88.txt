This regulation grants a tax remission on imported coffins or caskets under specific circumstances, such as when the remains of a non-resident or foreign deceased are transported or buried/cremated outside Canada, or when a funeral service is held in Canada with burial or cremation abroad. The remission applies only if a written claim is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of importation.
