These regulations implement the Sex Offender Information Registration Act in Quebec by establishing procedures for sex offenders to report and provide notifications, designating specific registration centres across the province, and authorizing certain law enforcement personnel to collect and register information. The regulations come into force upon registration and outline the designated areas of service for each registration centre.
