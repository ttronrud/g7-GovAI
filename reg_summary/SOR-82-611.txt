These regulations establish a government insurance program to cover up to $10 million in losses from loans made by private lenders to St. Anthony Fisheries Limited, subject to approval by the Treasury Board and specific application requirements. The insurance covers the full amount of a loss only if the private lender applies and provides required information, and the payout is limited to the amount of insurance in effect on the date of repayment demand.
