This regulation grants tax remission on certain advertising materials imported into Canada on or after January 1, 1991, including catalogues, price-lists, and trade notices, related to goods, transport services, or commercial insurance, provided the materials meet specific weight and origin requirements. Remission is only granted if the materials consist of one document, multiple documents without duplicate copies, or a total weight not exceeding 1 kg, and clearly identify a foreign supplier without indicating a Canadian source.
