These regulations establish elevation limits around Chilliwack Airport to ensure safe aircraft approaches and landings, prohibiting any structure or natural growth from exceeding designated approach and transitional surfaces. The airport reference point is set at 27 feet above sea level, and all structures must remain below the defined approach surfaces (with a 1:40 slope) and transitional surface (1:7 slope) extending from the runway strip.
