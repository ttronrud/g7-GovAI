The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has established cost recovery regulations under the Online News Act to ensure that digital news operators contribute to the costs of the Commission’s operations, based on their news revenue and the Commission’s estimated and actual expenses. Operators must report their news revenue annually and pay a calculated cost recovery charge, which may be adjusted annually and can be offset if negative, with the regulations coming into force on April 1, 2025.
