The Safe Working Practices Regulations establish comprehensive safety standards for work on Canadian ships and in associated working areas, requiring employers and owners to ensure safe working conditions, proper training and supervision, and compliance with specific procedures for hot work, equipment use, ventilation, fire prevention, and entry into hazardous compartments. These regulations define key terms, mandate the use of qualified personnel, enforce protective measures against fire, gas hazards, and falls, and require regular inspections and reporting of unsafe conditions to protect the health and safety of all personnel involved.
