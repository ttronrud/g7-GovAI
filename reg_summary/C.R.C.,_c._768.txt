This regulation grants tax remission on temporarily imported goods needed to address a declared emergency, such as natural disasters, disease, or accidents, and requires that such goods be exported once the emergency ends and they are no longer needed. The emergency must be urgent, critical, and beyond the capacity of local authorities to handle.
