These regulations prescribe the required form and requirements for deeds related to the acceptance, renunciation, or settlement of successions involving Cree or Naskapi beneficiaries, including those with movable, immovable, or traditional property on Category IA or IA-N land or involving persons with legal incapacity. Deeds must be properly dated, identified, and signed—either in authentic form or with witness signatures and declarations—while ensuring witnesses meet specific eligibility criteria and that no provisions exempt the deed from other land registry rules.
