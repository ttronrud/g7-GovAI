These regulations allow an insurance holding company to permit its regulated securities entity subsidiaries to hold shares of the company, up to 1% of its regulatory capital, unless the subsidiary is acting as a securities underwriter in a share distribution, in which case the limit is temporarily lifted until the distribution ends. The regulations came into force on October 24, 2001.
