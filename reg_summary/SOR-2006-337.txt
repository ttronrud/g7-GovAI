These regulations, made under the Library and Archives of Canada Act, require publishers to provide copies of their publications—especially those using non-paper media—to the Librarian and Archivist, including decrypting encrypted content, removing access restrictions, and supplying necessary software, technical information, and descriptive data. Certain types of publications require only one copy, while others require two copies upon written request, with specific exemptions for low-volume, niche, or non-commercial works.
