The Goose Bay Airport Zoning Regulations establish strict height and land-use restrictions around the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, prohibiting structures or natural features from exceeding designated approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. These regulations apply to lands adjacent to or near the airport and also restrict the use of land for activities that could create bird hazards or interfere with aeronautical communications.
