This regulation repeals the Saskatchewan Milk Order and replaces it with a new order granting The Milk Control Board of Saskatchewan authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of milk produced in Saskatchewan, including the power to impose levies and charges on milk producers and marketers. The Board may exercise powers similar to those for local marketing, except in cases involving milk traded under quotas set by Alberta or Manitoba, and it may use collected funds for reserves, expenses, and loss adjustments among producers.
