The North Bay Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions and designated surfaces (approach, transitional, and outer surfaces) around North Bay Airport to ensure aviation safety, prohibiting any structure or natural growth from exceeding these defined elevation limits. The regulations apply to lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, as described in the schedule, and are enforced by the Minister of Transport.
