This regulation authorizes negotiations to resolve an extraordinary disruption in container truck movements into and out of specific British Columbia ports—Vancouver, North Fraser, and Fraser River—by granting a facilitator and key stakeholders, including truckers, shippers, and port authorities, the freedom to negotiate and reach agreements on rates, terms, and conditions without Competition Act constraints. It also directs the Vancouver and Fraser River Port Authorities to implement licensing systems that require signatories to a 2005 agreement and acceptance of arbitration, effective for 90 days.
