These regulations implement a federal legal framework on Squamish Nation reserve lands by applying British Columbia’s residential tenancy and manufactured home park laws, adapted to align with federal constitutional authority, and establish a harmonized landlord-tenant regime for residential tenancy developments and manufactured home parks. The regulations require notice to tenants, define key roles and responsibilities, and ensure provincial authorities enforce the laws while excluding federal government entities from liability under the incorporated statutes.
