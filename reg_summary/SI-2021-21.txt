This regulation grants a fee remission to individuals who applied for or replaced certain travel documents (such as passports, refugee travel documents, or permanent resident cards) between January 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, if they are family members of a victim of the January 8, 2020, Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 crash and needed to travel to attend to the victim’s personal affairs or support their family. The remission applies only if the fees have not already been waived under existing rules.
