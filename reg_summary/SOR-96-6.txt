This regulation reduces customs duty rates under the General Preferential Tariff, effective January 1, 1996, with specific adjustments for different tariff items, including a mechanism to gradually lower rates annually if a certain threshold is exceeded. For some items, the rate is set at a fixed reduction or two-thirds of the Most-Favoured-Nation rate, with annual reductions of one per cent until the difference between the adjusted rate and the base rate falls below one per cent.
