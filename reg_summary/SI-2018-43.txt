The Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador repealed outdated pre-trial conference rules and adopted new Criminal Proceedings Rules, effective July 1, 2018, to standardize and streamline criminal proceedings, including procedures for arraignment, conferences, and case management, while ensuring fairness, efficiency, and the rights of the accused. These rules apply to all criminal proceedings in the court’s jurisdiction except appeals and establish clear procedures for conferences, deadlines, legal representation, and the handling of applications and pleadings.
