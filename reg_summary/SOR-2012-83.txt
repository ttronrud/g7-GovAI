These regulations establish the rules for appointing or deploying alternates—indeterminate employees who temporarily take on the role of an opting employee (an employee whose work unit is relocated or whose services are no longer needed) without being formally hired. Alternates must submit an irrevocable resignation accepted by the deputy head, effective within five days of appointment, and cease to be public service employees upon resignation, while not performing the duties of the opting employee’s position.
