This regulation grants tax remission to Indigenous individuals or bands residing on the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College Indian Settlement for income tax and goods and services tax (GST) periods beginning in or after 2000, based on the difference between actual taxes paid and what would have been payable if the settlement had been a reserve throughout the period. The remission is subject to conditions, including timely written claims to the Minister of National Revenue and the requirement that the tax has not already been refunded or remitted.
