These regulations establish that extra-provincial truck transport is governed by the conditions of carriage and liability limits of the province where transport originates, or, if no specific provincial rules exist, by the conditions agreed upon by the trucking company. The regulations come into force when the amending Act (S.C. 2001, c. 13) comes into effect.
