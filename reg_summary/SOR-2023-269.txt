These regulations establish criteria, time limits, interest rates, and dispute resolution procedures under the Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act, allowing provinces to be designated if their laws mirror the Act’s requirements for invoice submission, payment timelines, notice of non-payment, and binding adjudication. Interest is calculated as simple interest at the average Bank of Canada bank rate plus 3% per year, and certain days (holidays, Saturdays, and the December 24–January 1 period) are excluded from time calculations.
