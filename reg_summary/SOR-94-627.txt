This regulation repeals the New Brunswick Milk Order of 1984 and replaces it with a new order granting the Farm Products Marketing Commission of New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Milk Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of milk produced in the province, including the power to impose levies and charges on milk producers for administrative and financial purposes.
