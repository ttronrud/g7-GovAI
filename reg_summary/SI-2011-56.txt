The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to add the Bocaccio rockfish, Canary rockfish, and Lake Winnipeg Physa to Canada's List of Wildlife Species at Risk under the Species at Risk Act. This decision is based on ongoing effective management under the Fisheries Act, including catch reductions, improved monitoring, and mitigation measures, as well as taxonomic uncertainties regarding the Lake Winnipeg Physa, which is not considered a distinct species.
