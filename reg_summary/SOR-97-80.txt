This regulation establishes General Import Permit No. 6, allowing Canadian residents to import up to two dozen cut roses or rose buds from Israel or other CIFTA beneficiaries for personal or household use. The permit is valid from January 1, 1997, and requires imported roses to be reported with a specific statement indicating authorization under this permit.
