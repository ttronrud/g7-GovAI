These regulations establish the framework for the management and oversight of First Nation local and other revenues during co-management arrangements or third-party management, requiring transparency, access to records, and cooperation between the Board and the First Nation council, while ensuring that the First Nation retains the right to eventually regain full control of revenue management. They also mandate remedial planning and reporting to address financial or administrative deficiencies that led to the implementation of such arrangements.
