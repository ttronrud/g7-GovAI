This regulation approves the exclusion of certain provisions of the Public Service Employment Act during a specific period (January 1, 1989, to March 31, 1993) to facilitate the appointment of target group members—such as women, disabled persons, visible minorities, and Indigenous peoples—into employment equity programs, including training positions, while removing barriers like language requirements and appeal rights for appointments outside these programs. It also revokes outdated regulations related to the Northern Careers Program and the Visible Minority Employment Program.
