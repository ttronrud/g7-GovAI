This 1988 regulatory order grants income tax remission to non-residents of Canada who earned income in Quebec, reducing their tax liability by the difference between what they actually paid and what they would have paid if they had been considered residents of Quebec for tax purposes. It modifies income attribution rules to include certain types of income (such as remuneration from Quebec entities or educational institutions) and applies to specific groups, including students, researchers, and individuals with ties to Quebec, particularly for taxation years from 1983 to 1996, with specific provisions extending to later years.
