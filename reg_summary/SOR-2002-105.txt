These regulations establish the requirements for cooperative credit associations to notify customers and the public before closing a retail deposit-taking branch, with notice periods of four or six months depending on the location and availability of nearby branches. The notice must include key details such as the closure date, alternative service locations, and contact information, and may be supplemented by community meetings if certain conditions are met, while providing exceptions for temporary closures, sales, relocations, or court-ordered actions.
