This regulation, known as the Quebec Turkey Order, authorizes the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board and the Fédération des producteurs de volailles du Québec (Commodity Board) to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys produced in Quebec, including the power to impose and collect levies or charges on turkey producers based on group classifications. These levies may be used to create reserves, cover expenses or losses, and adjust payments among producers to ensure equitable distribution of revenue.
