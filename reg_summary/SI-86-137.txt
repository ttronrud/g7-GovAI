These rules establish the procedures for criminal appeals in the British Columbia Court of Appeal, including filing requirements, timelines, notice of appeal, submission of appeal books and transcripts, factums, and grounds for appeal, while also outlining the court’s authority to manage and direct the appeal process. They specify that appeals must be filed within 30 days of sentencing, with extensions available, and require detailed documentation such as transcripts, appeal books, and factums, while allowing for amendments and pre-hearing conferences to streamline proceedings.
