This regulation grants the International Labour Organization and its officials extensive privileges and immunities in Canada, including judicial immunity, tax exemptions, protection of property and communications, and immunity from legal process for senior officials in their official capacities, all to facilitate the organization’s operations as a specialized UN agency. These immunities are subject to waiver by the Director General and do not apply to Canadian citizens or officials who retire and reside in Canada.
