This regulation designates specific parcels of public land in Saskatchewan—known as the Last Mountain Lake, Saline Creek, West, and East Units—for wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation, and assigns their administration, management, and control to the Minister of the Environment under the Canada Wildlife Act. The lands are described in detail by title numbers, section boundaries, and exceptions for roads and mineral rights.
