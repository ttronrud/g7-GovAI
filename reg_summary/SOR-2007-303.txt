The Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Regulations, 2007 establish definitions and methodologies for calculating key economic and fiscal indicators used in federal-provincial revenue sharing, including adjusted fuel sales, property values, and income tax assessments, and specify how certain revenues are excluded from calculations for specific provinces. These regulations support the implementation of fiscal transfer payments under the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, particularly for fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2012 or 2014, based on data from Statistics Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency.
