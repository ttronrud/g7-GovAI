These regulations implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) by prohibiting Canadians from exporting, transporting, or providing technical assistance related to arms and related material to Lebanon, with limited exceptions for activities approved in advance by the UN or Lebanese government. The regulations also allow for exemptions through a certificate issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs if the activity is authorized by the Security Council or its designated committee.
