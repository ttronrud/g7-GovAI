The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rescinds an outdated tariff regulation and introduces new rules governing the form, content, and publication of tariffs by telecommunications companies, effective July 20, 1979. These regulations require tariffs to be clearly formatted, consistently numbered, publicly accessible, and available in both official languages where applicable, with specific requirements for indexing, revisions, and public inspection.
