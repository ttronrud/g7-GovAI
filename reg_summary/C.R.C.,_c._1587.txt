These Veterans Insurance Regulations establish the terms and conditions for life insurance policies issued by the Government of Canada under the Veterans Insurance Act, including requirements for policy form, signatures, premium payments (monthly, with a one-month grace period), death benefits, disability provisions, cash surrender value, and automatic extended term insurance. The policies are payable in Ottawa, Ontario, and include protections for beneficiaries, with specific rules on premium defaults, reinstatement, and policy modifications.
