The Governor in Council authorizes the Secretary of State to set fees for courses, seminars, and residential services provided by the Canadian Centre for Management Development, based on direct costs, for individuals outside of senators, members of Parliament, and government department employees. These fees are established to ensure cost recovery while maintaining access for eligible participants.
