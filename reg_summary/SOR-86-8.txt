The Canadian Egg Marketing Agency established quota regulations to limit the number of egg dozens a producer may market in interprovincial and export trade, based on provincial quotas and specific conditions, ensuring that total egg marketing does not exceed production levels and that sales to processors or vaccine manufacturers meet price and contractual requirements. These regulations were approved by the National Farm Products Marketing Council and came into force on December 13, 1985.
