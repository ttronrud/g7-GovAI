These regulations allow U.S. military and Department of Defence aircraft to fly over or within Canadian territory and waters on a reciprocal basis, subject to Canadian restrictions and orders from the Minister of National Defence. Such aircraft must comply with Canadian aviation rules and be under the same operational control as Canadian Forces aircraft, except where otherwise directed.
