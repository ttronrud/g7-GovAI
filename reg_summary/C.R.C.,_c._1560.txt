These Regulations establish the procedures for registering trade unions in Canada, including the forms and requirements for applications, rule alterations (partial or complete), and the issuance of certificates of registry. They also outline the conditions under which a trade union’s registration may be cancelled or withdrawn, and require applicants to demonstrate proper authorization and compliance with the Trade Unions Act.
