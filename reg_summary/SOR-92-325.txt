These Regulations, effective June 1, 1992, define the circumstances under which a natural person is considered affiliated with a bank under the Bank Act, including being an officer, having significant investments or debt, being a significant borrower, or being related to someone in one of these categories. Affiliation triggers disclosure and oversight requirements to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure financial stability.
