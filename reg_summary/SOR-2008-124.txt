The Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area Regulations designate a specific area in the Pacific Ocean as a marine protected area to conserve marine life and habitats, prohibiting activities that could disturb or damage living organisms or their habitats, while allowing limited exceptions such as authorized fishing, vessel travel, and approved scientific research. The regulations require advance approval for any scientific, educational, or commercial tourism activities and establish environmental assessment requirements to ensure conservation objectives are met.
