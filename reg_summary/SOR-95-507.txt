These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Wrigley Airport in the Northwest Territories, limiting the height of any structures or natural growth near the airport to the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria. The regulations apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point and were enacted after a public consultation period.
