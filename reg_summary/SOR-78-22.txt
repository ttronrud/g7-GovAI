This regulation establishes the Indian Economic Development Direct Loan Order, allowing the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to provide direct loans to Indigenous individuals, bands, or corporations to support business enterprises that contribute to Indigenous economic development, subject to strict eligibility, repayment, and security requirements. Loans are limited in amount, carry interest based on market rates, and require borrowers to maintain financial records and use funds for approved purposes.
