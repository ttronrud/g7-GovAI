These Regulations establish the procedures for the registration, publication, and exemption of statutory instruments in Canada, including specific exemptions for regulations that affect only a limited number of persons, those involving national or military security, and those that could harm federal-provincial relations or international affairs. They also outline the publication schedule for different types of instruments in the Canada Gazette and set conditions under which inspections or copies of certain instruments may be precluded.
