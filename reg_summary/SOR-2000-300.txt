These regulations establish the procedures for adding DNA profiles of convicted offenders to Canada’s national DNA data bank, require specific documentation including sample kits, authorizations, and fingerprints (with exceptions for valid reasons), and outline safeguards for privacy, consent, and access to DNA information, including a five-year period after which access to certain profiles must be removed unless extended by a qualified authority. The regulations also require that any international agreements involving DNA data include privacy protections.
