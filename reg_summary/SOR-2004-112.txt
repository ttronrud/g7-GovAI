The Gully Marine Protected Area Regulations designate a specific area in the Atlantic Ocean as a marine protected area, dividing it into three management zones with strict prohibitions on disturbing or removing living marine organisms or seabed materials, except under limited conditions for scientific research or commercial fishing with valid licences. Activities requiring approval must include detailed environmental impact assessments, and the Minister may only approve them if they do not cause undue environmental harm, particularly in more sensitive zones.
