These regulations require charcoal containers sold to consumers to display a clear, prominent, and easily legible warning in both English and French about the toxic fumes produced when charcoal is burned without adequate ventilation, emphasizing that it should not be used indoors without a ventilation system that exhausts fumes outdoors. The warning must be in bold or medium type, with specific font sizes and a contrasting color, and must be set apart by a border.
