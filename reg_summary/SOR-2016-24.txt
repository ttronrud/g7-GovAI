These regulations establish financial requirements for offshore petroleum operations in the Canada-Nova Scotia offshore region, including proof of financial capacity through statements and supporting documents, requirements for a Canadian-based pooled fund to cover potential liabilities, and conditions for the Board’s recommendation of reduced financial guarantees based on risk assessments. The regulations come into force when section 97 of the Energy Safety and Security Act comes into force or upon registration, whichever is later.
