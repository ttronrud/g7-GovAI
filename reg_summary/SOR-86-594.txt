This regulation, approved on June 1, 1986, establishes the procedures for the Civil Aviation Tribunal under the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada Act, outlining rules for service, filing, hearings, witness appearance, and appeals. It ensures fair and efficient handling of reviews, appeals, and applications by defining timelines, notice requirements, and the Tribunal’s discretion in managing procedural matters.
