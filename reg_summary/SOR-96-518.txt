These regulations establish the superannuation rights of public service employees who transition to employment with an airport authority following an airport transfer, including eligibility for pension options, death benefits, and allowances, with specific provisions on service periods, ages, and timing for exercising options. The regulations come into force on December 1, 1996, and apply to individuals who cease public service employment and begin work with an airport authority on or after that date.
