This regulation mandates Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway to move minimum amounts of grain each week during a 90-day period to address an extraordinary disruption in grain transportation, with specific volume requirements increasing over time and weekly reporting obligations. The order was issued under section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act to ensure the continued effective operation of the national transportation system during a critical agricultural period.
