The Ontario Fresh Grape Growers’ Marketing Board revoked the 1977 regulations on grape trade information and replaced them with new rules requiring dealers, shippers, and transporters to submit monthly sales, shipping, and transportation reports, as well as daily tally returns and receipts detailing grape transactions in interprovincial and export trade. These records must be submitted by specified deadlines to ensure transparency and traceability in the marketing of Ontario-produced fresh grapes.
