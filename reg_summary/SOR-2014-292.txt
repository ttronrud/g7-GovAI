These Standing Orders establish the employment requirements and disciplinary procedures for Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) members, including criteria for basic eligibility (such as firearm authorization, vehicle licensing, and security clearance), procedures for suspending pay or disciplining members, and safeguards for due process, including notice, written responses, appeals, and recusal rights. They also define the roles of decision makers, outline the grounds for discharge or demotion, and ensure members have rights to respond and appeal adverse decisions.
