This regulation establishes the rules for calculating insurable earnings and collecting premiums under the Employment Insurance Act, defining who is considered an employer, specifying which earnings are included or excluded, and outlining the timing and conditions for premium deductions and remittances by employers. It also provides special provisions for certain types of employment, such as stevedoring, logging, and barbering or hairdressing, where specific employers are deemed responsible for calculating and paying premiums.
