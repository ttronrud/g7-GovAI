This regulation grants a customs duty remission for certain heated tobacco products imported between January 1, 2022, and the order's coming into force, based on the difference in duty rates applicable on the date of importation versus December 31, 2021. The remission is available only if a claim is submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness within two years of importation.
