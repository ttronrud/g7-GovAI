These regulations establish rules for determining the origin of "casual goods" (goods not imported for sale or industrial use) acquired in Iceland, Norway, or Switzerland/Liechtenstein, based on product markings or the absence of marks indicating non-origin. Goods are deemed to originate in a specific country if their markings comply with that country’s laws and indicate the product is made in that country or Canada, or if no mark indicates otherwise, allowing them to benefit from the corresponding tariff treatment.
