These regulations define "small retransmission systems" under the Copyright Act as cable or terrestrial systems that retransmit signals to no more than 2,000 premises in a service area, with specific rules on how systems are grouped based on ownership and geographic proximity. A system is excluded if it operates within the service area of a larger system serving over 2,000 premises.
