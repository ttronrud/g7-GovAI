The Governor General in Council has approved the revocation of the previous St. Andrew’s Airport Zoning Regulations and replaced them with new regulations that define specific elevation limits—approach surfaces, outer surfaces, and transitional surfaces—around the airport to ensure aviation safety. These limits restrict the construction or growth of any object that exceeds the designated surfaces, and apply to all lands adjacent to or under the approach surfaces and outer limits of the airport.
