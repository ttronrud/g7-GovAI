The Minister of Transport revoked the previous Airport Vehicle Parking Fees Regulations and introduced new rules governing parking fees at designated airports operated by the Minister, setting hourly rates and maximum daily, weekly, and monthly charges based on location. These fees apply to the general public but exempt members of Parliament and the Senate when parking in designated areas at their respective airport locations.
