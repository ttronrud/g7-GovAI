This regulation grants a remission of income taxes for individuals who received Quebec family allowances in 1988, reducing their tax liability by the amount by which their actual taxes exceeded what they would have paid if those allowances had not been included in their income. The order is made under section 17 of the Financial Administration Act and applies to taxes under Parts I and I.1 of the Income Tax Act.
