This regulation establishes turkey marketing levies in Nova Scotia, requiring producers to pay $0.05 per pound live weight on turkeys sold beyond their market allotment, with buyers required to deduct and remit these levies to the Commodity Board. Producers must also pay any unpaid levies by the 10th day of the following month.
