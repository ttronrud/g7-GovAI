The Governor in Council has enacted the Fort William First Nation Sawmill Regulations, which establish the legal framework for the operation of a sawmill on designated project lands within the Fort William Indian Reserve, incorporating specific Ontario laws with key exclusions and adaptations, and assigning enforcement responsibilities to provincial authorities. The regulations come into force upon the official designation of the project lands as reserve land and include provisions for fee collection, regulatory exceptions, and the application of certain laws with modified scope.
