This proclamation establishes the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers agency to regulate the marketing of broiler hatching eggs and chicks produced for chicken production, particularly in interprovincial and export trade. It authorizes the agency to implement a quota system, establish licensing requirements, impose levies and charges, and set pricing, with specific rules governing production and marketing between signatory and non-signatory provinces.
