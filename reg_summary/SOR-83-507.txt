These regulations establish procedures for accessing government records under the Access to Information Act, including requirements for submitting requests, identifying records, providing identification for personal information, and determining when records can be examined instead of copied—particularly when reproduction would interfere with operations or when format conversion is unreasonable. They also define specific investigative bodies and classes of investigations exempt from full disclosure requirements.
