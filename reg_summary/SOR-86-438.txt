The Treasury Board revokes the previous Accountable Advances Regulations and introduces new rules governing the issuance, accounting, repayment, and recovery of accountable advances, including limits on advance amounts, requirements for timely accounting, and procedures for repayment or recovery. These regulations establish clear guidelines for when and how advances can be issued, particularly for travel, petty cash, and imprest funds, and require holders to account for expenditures and repay unexpended balances within specified timeframes.
