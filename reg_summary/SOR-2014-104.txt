The Canadian Transportation Agency issued rules governing dispute proceedings, establishing procedures for filing documents, deadlines, confidentiality requests, participation rights, and the conduct of proceedings in a timely and fair manner, all in accordance with the Canada Transportation Act. These rules emphasize proportionality, efficiency, and the just determination of disputes while providing mechanisms for parties to request expedited processes, intervene, or seek confidentiality.
