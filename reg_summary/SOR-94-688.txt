This regulation replaces the old Patented Medicines Regulations with updated requirements for patented medicines, mandating that patentees provide detailed information about their medicines—including patent details, pricing, sales, and research and development expenditures—within specified timeframes, both upon first sale and annually, with exceptions for certain drugs and veterinary products. The information must be submitted electronically and verified with an authorized signature.  

[Note: This regulation was repealed in 2008 and is no longer in force.]
