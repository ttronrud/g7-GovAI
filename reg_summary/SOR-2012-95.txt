These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Kugaaruk Airport in Nunavut to ensure aviation safety by preventing developments or natural growth that could interfere with aircraft operations, communications, or signals. They define specific surfaces—such as approach, strip, transitional, and outer surfaces—within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport, and prohibit structures, vegetation, or activities that penetrate these surfaces or disrupt aeronautical communications.
