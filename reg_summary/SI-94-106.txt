This regulation revokes an earlier fee-prescribing order and establishes a new one, authorizing the Minister of Communications to set fees for users of Library and Archives of Canada services, in accordance with Treasury Board policies on user charges. The fees must be determined based on the Treasury Board Policy on External User Charges, last revised in December 1989.
