These regulations establish a government insurance program to cover up to $1 million in losses for private lenders who provide working capital loans to Baie Verte Mines Inc., with loans limited to $4 million and secured by inventory or accounts receivable. The insurance is valid until March 1, 1987, requires a 1% semi-annual premium, and pays no more than the lesser of the insurance amount or 100% of the lender’s actual loss.
