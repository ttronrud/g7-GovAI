This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2013, based on historical export or production volumes, with specific formulas and thresholds to ensure fair distribution and minimum reserve requirements. Export allocations are determined by a formula tied to past export or production data, and any unused allocations are distributed in order of application receipt, with limits on individual allocations to prevent overuse.
