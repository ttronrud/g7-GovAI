These Regulations establish limits on the discharge of deleterious substances—such as oil and grease, phenols, sulfide, ammonia nitrogen, and total suspended matter—into waterways by petroleum refineries, requiring owners to monitor and report actual deposits against authorized limits based on refinery operations and crude oil processing rates. Discharges are permitted only if daily and monthly average deposits do not exceed authorized levels, with additional provisions for storm water and pH control.
