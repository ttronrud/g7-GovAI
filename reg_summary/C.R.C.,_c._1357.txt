These regulations allow former members of the Senate or House of Commons to count their service under the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act as pensionable service under the Public Service Superannuation Act, provided they surrender their right to a retiring allowance and meet medical examination requirements. In exchange, they must pay certain amounts to superannuation and retirement benefit accounts, and the election is void if they fail the medical examination.
