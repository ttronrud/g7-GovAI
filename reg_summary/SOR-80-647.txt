These regulations establish a controlled marketing system for mushrooms grown in British Columbia, restricting interprovincial and export trade to ensure quality, fair pricing, and compliance through licensing, centralized packing and storage by the Fraser Valley Mushroom Growers’ Co-operative Association, and strict rules on sales, transportation, and record-keeping. They require all key participants—growers, wholesalers, retailers, processors, and transporters—to obtain licenses, prohibit certain sales practices, and mandate inspections and accountability to prevent fraud and ensure market stability.
