This regulation grants remission of excess payments made to certain Canadian Forces members who were reclassified from general service officer to pilot classification between December 1, 1977, and December 31, 1994, as well as to their beneficiaries in cases of death benefits, due to incorrect incentive pay calculations. The remission covers both the excess amounts and any accrued interest.
