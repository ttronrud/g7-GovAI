These Regulations, known as the Valuation for Duty Regulations, establish the methodology for determining the value of imported goods for customs duty purposes, including definitions of key terms like "resident" and "permanent establishment," and set out specific rules for assessing transaction value, costs, and profit margins, with provisions for review and appeal when information appears inaccurate. The regulations ensure that valuation is based on reliable, transparent, and commercially reasonable factors, and require that amounts like commissions or profit be determined using generally accepted accounting principles and comparable market data.
