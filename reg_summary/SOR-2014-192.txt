These regulations define "operational terms" in rail service agreements, specifying obligations related to the receipt, handling, delivery, and performance of rail services, including timelines, equipment, and recovery measures, and establish communication protocols between rail companies and shippers to ensure transparency and compliance. They are made under the Canada Transportation Act to facilitate fair and efficient rail service arbitration at the operational level.
