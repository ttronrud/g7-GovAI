These regulations establish the conditions and procedures under which the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) provides loan insurance to lenders financing eligible commercial projects in Atlantic Canada, such as agriculture, manufacturing, mining, forestry, and tourism, with specific exclusions and requirements for project viability, loan terms, and claim payments. The insurance covers up to 90% of a loan’s principal and is only available for projects that meet strict economic and structural criteria, with claims payable only after a formal demand and proof of reasonable efforts to recover the debt.
