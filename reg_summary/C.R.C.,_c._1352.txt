These regulations establish that any increase in a re-employed public servant’s pension under the Public Service Pension Adjustment Act is suspended if the pension itself is partially or fully suspended under the applicable law or pension plan. If the pension is not suspended, the increase is paid as if it were part of the pension under that plan.
