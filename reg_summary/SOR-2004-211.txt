These regulations establish a compensation program for farmers and businesses who suffer losses due to potato wart, a soil-borne fungal disease, when Canadian Food Inspection Agency notices impose treatment, prohibition, or restriction measures. Compensation is available for direct costs incurred within specified limits, provided the applicant meets eligibility criteria, submits a complete application within three years (or with exceptional circumstances), and has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the loss.
