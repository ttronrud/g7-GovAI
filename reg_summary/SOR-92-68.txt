This regulation establishes zoning restrictions at Coral Harbour Airport in the Northwest Territories, limiting the height of any structures or buildings on adjacent lands to ensure safe aircraft operations by conforming to defined approach, outer, and transitional surfaces. The regulations, based on a 1989 zoning plan, set maximum elevation limits derived from geometric surfaces extending from the runway and airport reference point, with a boundary defined as a 4,000-meter circle centered on the airport reference point.
