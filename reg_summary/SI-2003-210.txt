On December 12, 2003, the Government of Canada transferred control of several public service units from the Department of Industry to the Department of International Trade, including Investment Partnerships Canada, the Trade Integration Directorate, and key divisions related to international trade and investment, excluding those involved in the administration of the Investment Canada Act. This realignment aimed to strengthen the Department of International Trade’s focus on international trade and investment policy.
