This regulation cancels a previous permit for importing dairy products for personal use and replaces it with a general permit allowing Canadian residents to import dairy products for personal use, up to a value of $20 per importation, with specific exceptions for certain items (such as those in item 5 of the schedule). The permit is effective upon the coming into force of specific provisions of the WTO Agreement implementation act and applies to a defined list of dairy products classified under specific tariff items.
