These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Cape Dorset Airport in Nunavut to ensure aviation safety by preventing structures, vegetation, or activities that could interfere with aircraft operations or communications. They define specific surfaces—such as approach, strip, outer, and transitional surfaces—within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport, prohibiting developments that penetrate these surfaces or cause signal interference, with limited exceptions like short-term open water reservoirs.
