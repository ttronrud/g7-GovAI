This regulation establishes Canada Turkey Marketing Levies for producers and processors based on the live weight of turkeys marketed interprovincially or exported, with levies collected by provincial Commodity Boards or directly to the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency, depending on concurrence. The levies are set by province and expire in 2026 and 2028, respectively, and the prior producers levy order is repealed.
