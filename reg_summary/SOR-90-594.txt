This regulation approves the replacement of the outdated Veterans Care Regulations with new Veterans Health Care Regulations, effective September 1, 1990, to provide a modern framework for health care services for veterans and eligible individuals, including definitions of key categories such as veterans, health needs, and eligibility criteria for care in community facilities. It establishes clear standards for adult residential, intermediate, and chronic care based on the severity and nature of a person's health needs.
