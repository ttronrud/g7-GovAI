These regulations govern the leasing of specific lands in Ottawa, limiting lease terms to 50 years and sublease terms to 20 years, requiring prior approval from the Treasury Board or Minister of Finance, and mandating that sublease rents reflect the costs of acquisition and administration while not falling below market value, with public advertisement required unless deemed impractical. The leases are structured so that Her Majesty acquires a leasehold interest expiring one day before the leased term ends.
