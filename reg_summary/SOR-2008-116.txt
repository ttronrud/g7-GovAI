These Lobbyists Registration Regulations, enacted on July 2, 2008, establish the requirements for lobbyists to file returns electronically or in paper format, specify detailed information to be included in those returns (such as client details, public office holder information, and compliance with five-year lobbying prohibitions), and outline procedures for responding to requests for clarifications or corrections from the Commissioner of Lobbying.
