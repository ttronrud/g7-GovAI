These regulations establish a framework for funding the solvency deficiencies of Air Canada’s defined benefit pension plans, requiring annual special payments over a 10-year period (2004–2013) to address the initial solvency shortfall as of January 1, 2004, with specific conditions on payment timing, exemptions, and treatment of special payments. The regulations also provide for an election by Air Canada to transition to a surplus-based funding model if a surplus exists, and they expire on December 31, 2013.
