This regulation provides temporary duty relief for certain goods imported into Canada for specific purposes and subsequently exported, with the relief amounting to full exemption for Class 1 goods and a partial exemption for Class 2 goods based on duration of stay. Export must occur within specified timeframes, depending on the type of goods, and applications require documentation and, in some cases, security.
