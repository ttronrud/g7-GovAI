This regulation establishes the eligibility criteria for residential mortgage or hypothecary loans in Canada, specifying requirements related to loan type (low ratio or high ratio), property value, credit score, debt service ratios, amortization periods, and borrower eligibility, with special provisions for first-time home buyers and newly built properties. It ensures that eligible loans are underwritten by qualified lenders, secured by eligible residential property, and meet strict financial and risk-based standards to protect borrowers and insurers.
