These Regulations establish a framework for reimbursing railway companies for certain costs related to employee benefits resulting from changes in Railway Passenger Services between 1977 and 1990, requiring special agreements with trade unions, arbitration in case of disputes, and strict conditions on reimbursement, including limits on the prescribed portion and the requirement for prior special agreements. The regulations emphasize job security, employee support, and fair treatment of both unionized and non-unionized employees affected by service changes.
