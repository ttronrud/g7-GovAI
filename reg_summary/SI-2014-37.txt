This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories—from disposal for one year—to support the establishment of the Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve, while excluding specific mineral-related activities that were already in place or authorized prior to the Order. The withdrawn area covers approximately 7,600 km² within the Sahtu Settlement Area.
