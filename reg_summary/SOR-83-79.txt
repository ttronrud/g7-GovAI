These regulations establish the method for converting values expressed in gold francs into Canadian dollars for use under subsection 2(6) of the Carriage by Air Act, first converting gold francs to special drawing rights (S.D.R.) at a rate of 15.075 gold francs per S.D.R., and then converting S.D.R. to Canadian dollars using the exchange rate set by the International Monetary Fund.  

The regulations provide a standardized conversion process to ensure consistency in monetary value calculations for air carriage purposes.
