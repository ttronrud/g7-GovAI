This regulation requires persons who import commercial goods into Canada to maintain detailed records for six years after importation, covering origin, costs, value, sales, and duty-related matters, with specific additional requirements for certain types of importers (e.g., duty-free shops, bonded warehouses). Failure to comply may result in the denial or withdrawal of preferential tariff treatment under trade agreements.
