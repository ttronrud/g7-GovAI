This regulation remits $485 of the $975 permanent resident status fee for individuals who paid the fee on or after May 3, 2006, or who acquired permanent resident status on or after that date, before a specific regulatory amendment took effect. If the full $975 fee was paid, the remitted $485 must be repaid to the individual.
