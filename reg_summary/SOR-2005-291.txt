This regulation grants the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its associated meetings, including the main conference and preparatory meetings, specific privileges and immunities in Canada during a defined period, allowing the Organization and its representatives, officials, and invited experts to operate without interference in matters related to those meetings. These privileges and immunities are limited to the exercise of their official functions and do not extend to tax liabilities for Canadian citizens or residents.
