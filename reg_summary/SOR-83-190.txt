The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, has approved the replacement of the old Gas Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations with new regulations that establish a standardized accounting system for gas pipeline companies. These regulations require Group 1 companies to maintain detailed financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and specific schedules, while Group 2 companies are subject to more limited requirements, including the filing of audited financial statements and compliance with certain accounting rules, all to ensure transparency and consistency in reporting.
