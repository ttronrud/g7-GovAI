This regulation grants tax and duty remissions for goods temporarily imported into Canada to support the 14th IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Edmonton in 2005, covering athletes, officials, sponsors, and related entities, with specific conditions on use, export, or destruction of goods and timely claims. Remission applies to excise taxes, GST, and customs duties for eligible goods, provided they are used exclusively for the event and meet specified import and reporting requirements.
