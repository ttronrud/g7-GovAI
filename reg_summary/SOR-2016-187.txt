These regulations establish safety standards for lighters in Canada, requiring child-resistant designs, specific flame height limits, and rigorous testing for gas and wick lighters, with additional requirements for labeling, fuel safety, and documentation, particularly for luxury and refillable models. They come into force upon registration and ensure that lighters are safe for use, especially in preventing accidental ignition by children.
