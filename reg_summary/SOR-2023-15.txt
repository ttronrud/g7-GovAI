The Governor in Council has enacted regulations prohibiting the manufacture and importation of wheel weights containing more than 0.1% lead in Canada, with limited exceptions for export or wheel weights already installed on vehicles, and permits may be issued for specific, technically or economically justified cases. These regulations require detailed applications, record-keeping, and compliance with environmental and health standards, with permits limited to a maximum of 24 months and subject to renewal or revocation based on compliance and accuracy of information.
