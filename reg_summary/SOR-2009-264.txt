This regulation establishes VOC concentration limits for architectural coatings in Canada, prohibiting the manufacture, import, sale, or use of certain coatings if their VOC levels exceed specified thresholds, with exceptions for specific product types and limited-capacity coatings. It requires manufacturers and importers to comply with strict labeling, dilution, and permit requirements, particularly for coatings with high VOC content, and mandates that any deviation from limits must be justified through a technically feasible plan and approved permit.
