The Northern Pipeline Agency rescinds certain environmental, social, and economic conditions from a pipeline certificate for Foothills Pipe Lines (South Yukon) Ltd., specifically those related to the Swift River Portion of the pipeline in British Columbia, except for a compensation undertaking, and replaces them with new, detailed socio-economic and environmental terms and conditions that govern construction and operation. These terms require Foothills to comply with environmental protections, engage in public consultation, ensure worker safety, maintain emergency procedures, and provide transparency to affected communities and governments.
