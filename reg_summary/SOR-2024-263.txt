The Clean Electricity Regulations, made under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, establish a framework to reduce climate change by prohibiting excessive carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-powered electricity generation, with specific requirements for unit registration, performance testing, and emission limits. The regulations apply to units with at least 25 MW of capacity that generate electricity using fossil fuels and are connected to an electricity system, beginning when they meet certain criteria and continuing until the responsible person formally ceases operations.
