This regulation amends the Canada-Austria double taxation convention by expanding the scope of information exchange between the two countries on tax matters, while establishing clear rules to prevent "fishing expeditions" and ensure that requested information is relevant and reasonably obtainable. It requires a detailed request including the taxpayer's identity, nature of the information sought, and evidence that the information exists in Austria, while maintaining the obligation to share information for tax administration and enforcement purposes.
