The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, revoked the previous Protection of Securities (Insurance Companies) Regulations and introduced the Protection of Assets (Insurance Companies) Regulations to strengthen the protection and secure management of insurance companies' assets. These regulations require companies to maintain secure records, safeguard securities, ensure proper custody, deposit transaction proceeds, register securities, and maintain insurance and bonds against loss from fraud, theft, or damage, with specific provisions ensuring these protections remain in place for at least 30 days after notice.
