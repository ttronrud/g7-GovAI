The Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations establish strict requirements for drilling, production, and well management on Canadian lands, including mandatory approvals, safety measures (such as blowout preventers), core and log reporting, waste prevention, and proper well abandonment procedures to ensure environmental protection, operational safety, and efficient resource recovery. These regulations apply to all oil and gas operations under a licence, permit, or lease and require detailed reporting, compliance with engineering standards, and adherence to conservation and safety protocols.
