This regulation approves the amendment of Schedule III to the Northern Pipeline Act, rescinding certain environmental, social, and economic conditions previously imposed on Foothills Pipe Lines (North B.C.) Ltd. and replacing them with new, more detailed socio-economic and environmental terms and conditions specifically tailored to the pipeline’s operations in northern British Columbia. These terms require Foothills to comply with strict environmental protections, engage in meaningful consultation with Indigenous groups, communities, and government agencies, and maintain transparency through public reporting and access to information.
