The Government of Canada has enacted the Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations, establishing rules for the safe transport, import, export, and transit of hazardous waste and recyclable materials across Canada and internationally, based on environmental protection standards, international agreements (such as the Basel Convention and Canada-USA Agreement), and domestic legislation. These regulations define key terms, set conditions for shipments, and require permits, notifications, and compliance with safety and environmental criteria to ensure responsible handling of hazardous substances.
