The Sydney Airport Zoning Regulations establish height limits and land use restrictions around Sydney Airport, prohibiting structures or objects from exceeding designated approach, horizontal, or transitional surfaces to ensure aviation safety, with specific boundaries and elevations defined for the airport and its surrounding areas. These regulations also restrict the disposal of bird-attractive waste and allow the Minister to require removal of excessive natural growth.
