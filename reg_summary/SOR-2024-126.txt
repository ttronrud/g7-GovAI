This regulation grants the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and its subsidiary bodies, including specific personnel such as international civilians, military personnel, and temporary staff, certain privileges and immunities under the Ottawa Agreement, with provisions for family members and exceptions for Canadian citizens. These privileges are granted for the benefit of the Organisation and can be waived if they impede justice or undermine the Organisation’s interests.
