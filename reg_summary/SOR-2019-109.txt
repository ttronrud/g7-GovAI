These regulations establish criteria for identifying "low-materiality fees" under the Service Fees Act, defining fees below $151 as such based on revenue thresholds and historical reporting, while excluding fees set by formula or listed in Schedule 2. Fees are considered low-materiality only if they meet specific conditions related to revenue, reporting, and prior status, and cease to be classified when they exceed $151 or exceed revenue thresholds in consecutive reports.
