These regulations allow certain public service contributors who received erroneous advice about being able to count prior service without paying contributions to elect to count that service under the Public Service Superannuation Act, provided they do so within one year of being advised by the President of the Treasury Board. If such an election is made, the individual must pay the applicable contributions as if they had elected within the required time frame, and adjustments—such as refunds or reduced instalments—may be made to ensure fairness, with no contribution allowed for service exceeding the limits set by the Act.
