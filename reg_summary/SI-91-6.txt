On December 14, 1990, the Governor General designated the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as the Minister and appropriate Minister for the Canadian Space Agency, and designated the Canadian Space Agency as a department under several federal acts, with the President of the Agency serving as its deputy head. This formalized the agency’s status and governance structure within the Canadian government.
