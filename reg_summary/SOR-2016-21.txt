These regulations establish a cost recovery system for the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board, requiring operators to pay annual fees based on estimated regulatory costs, including direct and indirect expenses, with adjustments made annually based on actual costs. Fees are calculated using base and variable units of time, an effective rate, and a heavy burden coefficient for non-compliance, and payments are made quarterly with interest accruing on overdue amounts.
