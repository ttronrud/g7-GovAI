These regulations define what constitutes borrowing by the Government of Nunavut under the Nunavut Act, specifying when loans, capital leases, sale-leasebacks, and loan guarantees are considered borrowing, while excluding certain internal transactions and specific Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation loans. The value of such borrowings is determined based on principal, interest, or lease obligations, as outlined in the CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook, and the regulations come into force on a specified date or upon registration.
