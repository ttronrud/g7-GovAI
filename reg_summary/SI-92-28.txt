This regulation grants a tax and Canada Pension Plan contribution remission to taxpayers who were reassessed in 1984, 1985, or 1986 regarding trade-in allowances on farm equipment, provided the cost of acquired equipment equals the trade-in allowance plus other payments and the proceeds from traded-in equipment equal the trade-in allowance. The remission is conditional on the taxpayer filing an undertaking and waiver within 90 days, agreeing to pay future amounts if certain conditions are met and waiving all objections or appeals related to the reassessment.
