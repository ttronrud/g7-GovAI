These regulations prohibit the sale of interprovincial chicken (not for export) at a price below the production province's market price plus reasonable transportation costs, to prevent dumping and support fair pricing in accordance with Chicken Farmers of Canada's marketing plan. The regulations were established under the Farm Products Agencies Act and approved by the National Farm Products Council, but were later repealed in 2015.
