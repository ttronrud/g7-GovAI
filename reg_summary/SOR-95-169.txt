These regulations establish a public service early retirement compensation arrangement effective April 1, 1995, providing eligible surplus employees and Governor in Council appointees with an annual benefit based on the difference between their full pensionable service annuity and their annual allowance, subject to specific eligibility criteria including age, service length, and employment cessation dates. The benefit is payable only if the employee ceases employment by October 1, 1998, and meets conditions related to job offers, re-employment, and pension plan elections.
