These regulations define what constitutes a "prescribed security interest" under the Excise Tax Act for amounts deemed to be held in trust, limiting such interests to specific registered mortgages or hypothecs on land or buildings and setting a formula to cap the interest amount if trust amounts are not withdrawn or remitted. The regulations came into force on October 20, 2000.
