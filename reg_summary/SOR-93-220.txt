This regulation revokes the previous Heritage Canals Regulations and establishes new rules for the management, maintenance, and protection of historic canals administered by Parks Canada. It sets out detailed provisions on vessel use, environmental protection, permits for activities like dredging, camping, and events, and restrictions to preserve the historic character and safety of the canals.
