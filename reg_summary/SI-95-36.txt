This regulation transfers specific powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Employment and Immigration to the Minister of Labour under several Canadian Acts, including the Canada Labour Code and key labour and safety legislation, as authorized by the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The transfer reflects a reorganization of ministerial responsibilities to align with current government priorities and administrative efficiency.
