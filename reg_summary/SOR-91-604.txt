The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, revokes the previous Crown Liability (Provincial Court) Regulations and replaces them with new regulations that prescribe the rules of practice and procedure for proceedings in provincial courts under Part II of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, effective when the 1990 amendment to the relevant Acts comes into force. These regulations establish specific rules on service of documents, discovery, confessions of judgment, cost certification, and other procedural matters, while modifying time limits and eliminating provisions that would otherwise apply if the Crown were a private party.
