This regulation excludes employment at Ontario Hydro nuclear facilities from Part II of the Canada Labour Code (Occupational Health and Safety), except for specific sections, and grants priority to nuclear safety regulations over labour code provisions in case of conflict. The regulations came into force on April 1, 1998, and clarify applicable criminal code sections for enforcement related to nuclear facility employment.
