These regulations establish the timing and method for making fiscal equalization offset payments from the federal government to Nova Scotia based on offshore petroleum revenues, with initial payments of one-third of an estimated amount made in May, November, and March, followed by final adjustments and recovery of overpayments based on the final computation. The payments are subject to revision if the final assessment of equalization payments changes, and all adjustments must be made within specified timeframes.
