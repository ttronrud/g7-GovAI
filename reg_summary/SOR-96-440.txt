The Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board establishes charges for the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs, requiring producers to pay $0.20 per weanling hog (under 56 kg) and $0.95 for all other hogs, with the charge to be deducted from sales proceeds or remitted within 15 days of the month following marketing. The Order applies to hogs marketed outside Ontario, excluding certain regions in Haliburton, and comes into force on September 12, 1996.
