The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has revoked the previous National Parks Cemetery Regulations and introduced new regulations to govern the control and management of cemeteries within Banff and Waterton National Parks. These regulations establish rules for burial of human remains and ashes, including requirements for certificates, grave use, monument placement, exhumation, and vegetation, while ensuring perpetual care and protecting the integrity of the national park cemeteries.
