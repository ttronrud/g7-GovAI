This regulation, now repealed, establishes criteria under which a child of a judge is considered to have been in full-time attendance at an educational institution without interruption during absences due to scholastic vacations or illness, and includes provisions for the payment of death duties from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to survivors or children of judges, with annuity payments reduced proportionally based on the value of the annuity relative to the death duties. The regulation also specifies conditions under which such attendance is deemed continuous, including in cases of death or the child ceasing to be a child.
