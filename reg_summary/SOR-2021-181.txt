The Financial Consumer Protection Framework Regulations establish consumer protections under the Bank Act, Trust and Loan Companies Act, and Insurance Companies Act, including requirements for transparent disclosure, fair lending practices, timely cancellation of accounts, refund policies, and debt collection standards. These regulations define key terms such as APR, disbursement charges, and principal, and set specific timelines and procedures for complaint handling, account cancellation, and the refund of unused charges.
