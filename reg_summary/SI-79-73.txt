This regulation grants a remission of income tax to taxpayers who are not principal-business corporations, reducing their tax liability by the amount by which their Canadian exploration expenses incurred between May 25, 1976, and 1980 exceed the total of previously claimed amounts under that period. The remission applies only if the tax payable exceeds what would be due under a modified version of the income tax rules for exploration expenses.
