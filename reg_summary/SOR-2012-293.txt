The Haisla Nation Liquefied Natural Gas Facility Regulations establish that certain British Columbia laws apply to the project lands as federal law, within constitutional limits, and specify how those laws are interpreted, enforced, and adapted to ensure consistency with federal authority and the unique status of the Haisla Nation. The regulations define key terms, exclude or modify certain provincial laws, and clarify the roles of provincial bodies and the Haisla Nation in administration, enforcement, and liability.
