These regulations establish requirements for financial institutions in Canada to clearly and simply provide information about registered products—such as RRSPs, RRIFs, and education savings plans—both in writing and orally, depending on how the account is opened. Institutions must maintain and make publicly accessible a list of product charges and must disclose any proposed changes to terms and conditions before implementation.
