This regulation revokes a previous order that allowed fees for advance income tax rulings to be set by the Minister of National Revenue, and instead authorizes the Minister to prescribe fees that will be paid by the recipient of the ruling. The decision is based on the principle that the cost of providing such a service should be borne by the person receiving it.
