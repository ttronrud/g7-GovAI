The Pickering Airport Site Zoning Regulations establish height and land-use restrictions around the Pickering airport to ensure aviation safety by preventing structures, natural growth, or activities that could interfere with aircraft operations, signals, or pose a bird hazard. These regulations apply to specific lands adjacent to or near the airport, limiting construction and development to stay within defined surfaces such as approach, outer, and transitional surfaces.
