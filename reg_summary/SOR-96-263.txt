These regulations establish the framework for protecting certain wild animals and plants in Canada by regulating international and interprovincial trade, defining what constitutes wildlife (including live specimens, eggs, tissue cultures, etc.), and outlining exemptions from permits for personal use, such as hunting trophies, household effects, and pets, under specific conditions. Notably, permits are required for trade in species listed in Appendix I of the Convention, and exemptions are strictly limited—especially for elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn, which are never exempt from permit requirements.
