The Governor General in Council revokes an old exemption order and designates the Criminal Operational Intelligence Records (No. CMP/P-PU-015) as an exempt personal information bank under the Privacy Act, allowing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to retain and use the records without privacy restrictions. This exemption applies to personal information related to criminal investigations and is governed by specific federal laws, including the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
