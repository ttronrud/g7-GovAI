This regulation imposes a 25% surtax on certain motor vehicles originating in the United States that are not entitled to the United States Tariff, with a reduced surtax applicable when Canadian or Mexican goods used in production account for more than 15% of the vehicle’s value. Exemptions apply to specific vehicle classifications, those with gross vehicle weights exceeding five tonnes, and vehicles in transit on the order’s effective date.
