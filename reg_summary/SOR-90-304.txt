These regulations reduce or remove customs duties on certain vessels temporarily imported into or stored in Canadian customs waters, with special provisions for cruise ships and vessels operating between specific Canadian points. Duty reductions are calculated based on time and value, and full duty removal applies under specific conditions, including for vessels undergoing repairs or modifications abroad for safety or operational reasons.
