This regulation imposes a 50% surtax on the importation of certain steel goods that exceed specified quantity limits, based on quarterly import volumes and country of origin, with exemptions for goods from Canada, the U.S., Mexico, in transit, or classified under specific tariff headings. The surtax applies only if goods are imported without a valid permit under the Export and Import Permits Act, and the order is set to expire one year after coming into force.
