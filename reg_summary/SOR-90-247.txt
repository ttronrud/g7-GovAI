This regulation revokes previous leaded and lead-free gasoline rules and establishes new limits on lead and phosphorus concentrations in gasoline sold in Canada, setting a maximum lead concentration of 5 mg/L and a phosphorus concentration of 1.3 mg/L. It also requires record-keeping for leaded gasoline used in competition vehicles, including details on brand, octane rating, lead concentration, and distribution or usage locations, with annual submission to the Minister.
