The Canadian Human Rights Commission issued guidelines stating that charging lower fares or rates to children, youths, or senior citizens is reasonable and not discriminatory under the Canadian Human Rights Act, as long as the differentiation is based solely on age. These guidelines, known as the Age Guidelines, clarify that such practices do not violate section 5 of the Act.
