These regulations establish minimum pricing requirements for the interprovincial sale of broiler hatching eggs in Canada, ensuring that sales to signatory provinces are not below a specified price based on intraprovincial minimum prices, hatchability rates, or market prices, plus transportation costs. The regulations were approved by the National Farm Products Marketing Council and came into effect on December 1, 1989, to support the implementation of a marketing plan by the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency.
