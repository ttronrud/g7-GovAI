These regulations require trust and loan companies in Canada to clearly disclose all charges applicable to deposit accounts and related services to customers and the public, including both personal deposit accounts and other services like cheque processing and account management. Companies must provide written statements at branches, points of service, and online, and must notify customers at least 30 or 60 days in advance if charges are increased, depending on whether they receive statements.
