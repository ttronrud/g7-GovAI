The regulation establishes performance, accuracy, and design requirements for non-automatic weighing devices in Canada, specifying error limits, verification scale intervals, and operational conditions based on device class and type. It ensures weighing devices maintain accuracy over time, under environmental variations, and in the presence of disturbances, while prohibiting manual entry of gross or tare values in on-board systems to prevent fraud.
