This regulation revokes a previous order and defines certain periods of service abroad—specifically within NATO’s area of responsibility—as "special service" eligible for the Special Service Medal, including service before and after October 19, 2004, and establishes a Bar with a NATO Star to represent such service. It also specifies that service in NATO operations outside Canada, not previously recognized by the Canadian honours system, qualifies as special service if it meets the 180-day threshold.
