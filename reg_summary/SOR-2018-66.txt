These regulations require the upstream oil and gas sector in Canada to reduce emissions of methane and certain volatile organic compounds by mandating the capture and conservation of hydrocarbon gas, limiting venting and flaring, and establishing reporting requirements, with serious offences designated for non-compliance. The rules apply to facilities on land and exclude offshore operations, with specific requirements based on location and gas-to-oil ratios.
