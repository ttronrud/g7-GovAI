The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) adopted and published its Rules of Practice and Procedure, which govern the conduct of proceedings before the Commission, including filing requirements, service of documents, hearings, and confidentiality, with specific provisions for broadcasting and telecommunications matters. These rules apply to most CRTC proceedings except those involving certain applications or administrative penalties, and allow for flexibility in procedure based on public interest or fairness.
