These regulations establish a framework for pest control product registrants and applicants in Canada to report incidents involving health or environmental risks, including human or animal deaths, serious health effects, plant damage, or scientific findings indicating new hazards. Reports must be submitted within specific timeframes depending on the incident type, and registrants must also provide annual summaries for active ingredients involved in 10 or more incidents affecting the same subject group.
