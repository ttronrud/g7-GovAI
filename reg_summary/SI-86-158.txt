A pre-trial conference must be held before a jury trial, as directed by the presiding judge, and must be attended by the accused’s counsel (or the accused if unrepresented) and the prosecutor or senior prosecuting counsel. The purpose is to promote a fair and expeditious trial through informal discussion, disclosure of motions and trial matters, and potential scheduling of certain issues before or during the trial.
