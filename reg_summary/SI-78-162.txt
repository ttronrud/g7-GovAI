This regulation grants remission of sales and excise taxes on motor vehicles purchased by diplomatic and foreign representatives in Canada during specific periods, provided the vehicles were acquired without paying sales or excise tax and have been used in Canada for a minimum period (one or two years depending on whether the vehicle was made in Canada or imported). Remission may also be granted in cases of unexpected transfer or death, but only if the vehicle was used for less than the required period, and no remission is allowed where full reciprocity is not provided by the foreign government.
