This regulation grants customs duty remissions to Canadian manufacturers and producers of tailored collar shirts for the import of yarn-dyed and greige shirting fabrics, with remission rates decreasing over time (from full remission in 1998–2004 to 50% or 25% thereafter), and applies to specific eligible companies listed in Schedules A and B. The remissions are subject to conditions, including timely claims within five years of import and caps based on prior remittances under a previous order.
