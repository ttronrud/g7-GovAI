The Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations, made by the Canadian Transportation Agency and approved by the Governor in Council, establish accessibility requirements for transportation service providers, including carriers and terminal operators, to ensure persons with disabilities have equal access to transportation services through accessible information, communication, facilities, and personnel training. These regulations mandate accessible formats for information, accessible design of services and technology, training for staff, and the provision of assistance to persons with disabilities, while emphasizing dignity, autonomy, and barrier-free access.
