The Minister of the Environment designated specific physical activities under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, including major infrastructure projects, energy developments, mining operations, and nuclear facilities, as requiring environmental assessment. These activities are linked to respective regulatory agencies, and the regulations do not apply to certain projects that have already begun or are subject to prior assessments under the previous environmental assessment framework.
