These regulations exempt banks, bank holding companies, and foreign banks from certain investment restrictions under the Bank Act, allowing them to acquire substantial investments in entities without being subject to specific ownership or control limitations. The exemptions apply to specific provisions related to acquisitions and control, and the regulations come into force when certain amendments to the Bank Act are enacted.
