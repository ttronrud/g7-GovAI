This regulation establishes emission standards for marine spark-ignition engines, vessels, and off-road recreational vehicles in Canada, aligning them with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards to reduce harmful pollutants such as hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. It defines specific vehicle and engine classes, sets emission limits, and introduces a national emissions mark system requiring compliance verification, permanent labeling, and unique identification for covered vehicles and engines.
