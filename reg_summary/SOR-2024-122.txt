The Tang.ɢwan — ḥačxʷiqak — Tsigis Marine Protected Area Regulations designate a specific marine area off Canada’s coast, encompassing the seabed, subsoil to 1,000 meters, and water column, and establish three management zones—Dellwood, Union, and General—with strict prohibitions on activities that harm marine life, while allowing limited fishing, navigation, and scientific research under approved activity plans. The Minister must approve such plans to ensure they do not damage sensitive hydrothermal vents or ecosystems and must review them within 90 days, with reporting requirements for environmental impacts and outcomes.
