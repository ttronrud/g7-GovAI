The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) adopted the Broadcasting Distribution Regulations on December 8, 1997, after publishing a proposed version and allowing public comment, establishing definitions and rules for the distribution of broadcasting services in Canada, including distinctions between basic and discretionary services, community programming, and licensing requirements. These regulations govern how broadcasting services are distributed through terrestrial, cable, and direct-to-home (DTH) platforms, with specific provisions for Canadian content, community involvement, and programming obligations.
