These regulations establish a cost recovery framework for the Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, requiring applicants to pay annual fees based on estimated regulatory costs—including direct and indirect expenses—calculated using base and variable units of time and an effective rate. Fees are adjusted annually based on actual costs, with overpayments refunded and underpayments billed, and a heavy burden coefficient may be applied for non-compliance or negligence.
