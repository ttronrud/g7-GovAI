This regulation establishes the Defence Floating Equipment Rental Order, authorizing the Minister of National Defence to rent large, medium, and small tugs, derricks, and flat scows at commercial rates when no commercial facilities are available, with rental agreements requiring the charterer to pay fees, indemnify against damages, and confirm private equipment is unavailable. The agreement includes terms for rental duration, termination by the Minister, and liability protections for the Crown.
