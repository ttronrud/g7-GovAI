This regulation establishes an ex gratia payment of $20,000 for individuals who were exposed to unregistered U.S. military herbicides, including Agent Orange, at CFB Gagetown between 1966 and 2011 and who have been diagnosed with specified medical conditions, with payments made to the primary caregiver if the individual has passed away. The program ends on December 30, 2011, and does not constitute an admission of liability by the Crown.
