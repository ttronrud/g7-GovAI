These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Clyde River Airport in Nunavut to ensure aviation safety by preventing developments or natural growth that could interfere with aircraft operations, communications, or signals. They define specific surfaces—such as approach, strip, outer, and transitional surfaces—within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, prohibiting structures, vegetation, or activities that penetrate these surfaces or disrupt aeronautical communications.
