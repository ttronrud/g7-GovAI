These Regulations, known as the Special Services and Fees Regulations, govern the registration, insurance, and indemnity provisions for registered mail in Canada, including requirements for receipts, addressee signatures, insurance limitations, and conditions under which indemnity payments are made. They specify that indemnity is limited to the value of the mail minus any other compensation and is subject to strict eligibility criteria, including claim timelines, proof of loss, and exclusions for certain types of items or circumstances.
