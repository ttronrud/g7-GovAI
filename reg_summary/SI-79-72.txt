This 1979 regulatory order remits customs duty and sales tax for certain imported goods imported on or after March 27, 1979, or previously imported without consumption entry before that date, based on the difference between the actual tax and what would have been payable if a specific bill had been enacted. The remission does not apply to certain designated tariff items or green peas under specific conditions related to Canadian production and market presence.
