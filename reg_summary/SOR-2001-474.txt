This regulation establishes the methodology for assessing financial institutions under the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act, setting base assessment amounts based on factors such as average assets, net revenue or premiums, and administrative expenses, with a minimum assessment of $1,000 for most institutions. Assessments are calculated differently for banks, trust and loan companies, retail associations, life companies, and insurance companies, and are subject to exemptions for institutions undergoing voluntary liquidation or court-ordered winding-up.
