The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked several existing Atlantic fishery regulations and replaced them with new regulations effective January 8, 1986, to establish a unified framework for the management and allocation of fishery resources along Canada's Atlantic coast. These new regulations govern fishing activities for specified fish species and marine plants in designated areas, including the Convention Area and coastal tidal waters, while excluding certain types of fishing such as recreational fishing, angling, and aquaculture operations.
