This regulation establishes the authority of the British Columbia Vegetable Marketing Commission and the British Columbia Farm Industry Review Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of vegetables in British Columbia, including the power to impose and collect levies or charges based on producer groups and to use those funds for reserves, expenses, and equitable distribution among producers. The previous British Columbia Vegetable Order is repealed, and this regulation comes into force upon registration.
