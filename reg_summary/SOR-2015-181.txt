These regulations establish requirements for air carriers to collect, verify, and report passenger information—such as citizenship, passport details, and Canadian Travel Numbers—before boarding domestic or international flights subject to security screening, with specific rules on identity verification and reporting to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. They also mandate the timely provision of information via an electronic system and prohibit boarding if there are discrepancies between a passenger’s identification and reservation details, unless exceptions apply.
