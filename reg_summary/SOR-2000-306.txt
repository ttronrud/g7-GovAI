The Board of Arbitration (Agriculture and Agri-Food) has established detailed rules for handling complaints under the Canada Agricultural Products Act, outlining procedures for filing complaints, defenses, interventions, hearings, and decision-making, with a focus on fairness, expediency, and flexibility. The rules emphasize liberal interpretation, allow for procedural flexibility, and require clear documentation while ensuring parties have opportunities to present evidence and be heard.
