The Cosmetic Regulations establish definitions, labeling requirements, and safety standards for cosmetics sold in Canada, including restrictions on hazardous ingredients (such as mercury, chloroform, and coal tar dyes), mandatory ingredient listing by INCI name, and specific warnings for products with avoidable hazards. The regulations also require child-resistant packaging for certain products, clear labeling in both English and French, and specific safety information for pressurized containers, mouthwashes, and products containing methyl alcohol or bromates.
