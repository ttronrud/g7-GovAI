These regulations establish the rules for fishing in Canadian national parks, including permit requirements, species-specific restrictions, seasonal openings, daily and possession limits, and tagging requirements for salmon and lake trout. They also provide for enforcement, suspension, and cancellation of fishing permits based on violations, and exclude certain groups or areas from their application due to legal or cultural agreements.
