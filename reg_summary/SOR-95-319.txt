This regulation establishes the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's (CRTC) policy for licensing Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite distribution undertakings, requiring them to operate in a competitive market, contribute significantly to Canadian programming (at least 5% of gross revenues), and ensure equitable access to programming services, including offering both English and French-language pay-per-view services. The CRTC is directed to begin accepting licence applications immediately and complete the licensing process no later than November 1, 1995.
