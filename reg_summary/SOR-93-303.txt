This regulation revokes the previous Northern Inland Waters Regulations and replaces them with new inland water resource regulations for the Northwest Territories and Yukon Territory, effective June 15, 1993, establishing water management areas and setting out licensing requirements for water use and waste deposition. It allows certain low-impact activities to proceed without a licence, while requiring detailed applications and environmental assessments for larger undertakings, with fees and reporting obligations tied to the volume and type of water use or waste.
