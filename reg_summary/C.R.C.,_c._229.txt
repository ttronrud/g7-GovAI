This regulation establishes a hog marketing levy system in Prince Edward Island, requiring producers to pay a levy on each hog sold at a specified base price, excluding hogs graded below Canada Index 67, and mandating buyers to deduct and remit these levies to the Commodity Board. Buyers must also provide grade certificate information, either in physical form or via an approved data processing method.
