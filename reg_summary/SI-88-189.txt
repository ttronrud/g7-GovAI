The Governor in Council authorizes the Minister of National Revenue to set a fee for copies of tax documents made available to the public under section 149.1(15) of the Income Tax Act, with the cost to be borne by the individuals receiving the documents. This decision is made under the Financial Administration Act to ensure the cost of providing public information is recovered from those who receive it.
