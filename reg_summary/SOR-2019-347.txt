The Canadian Energy Regulator issued regulations requiring persons planning to construct facilities, engage in ground disturbances, or operate vehicles across international or interprovincial power lines to obtain written authorization from the line holder, make a locate request at least three working days in advance, and comply with specific safety and procedural standards, including adherence to CSA standards for overhead and underground crossings. These regulations also establish clear obligations for holders, including notification requirements and protection of underground infrastructure, and repeal prior regulations on power line crossings.
