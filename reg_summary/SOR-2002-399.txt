This regulation grants a customs duty remission for certain textile and apparel goods imported from Costa Rica, reducing the duty paid to the difference between Most-Favoured-Nation rates and the applicable Costa Rican tariff rates, subject to annual quantitative limits and specific documentation requirements. The remission applies only to goods that meet defined criteria related to origin, production, and compliance with the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement.
