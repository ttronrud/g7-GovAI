These Regulations define the regulatory capital of a bank under the Bank Act, specifying that it consists of shareholders’ equity, members’ equity (for federal credit unions), minority interests, and subordinated indebtedness, minus goodwill, with strict conditions on the types of securities and shares included. Additionally, certain investments, loans, and minority interests in insurance companies or securities dealers are excluded from a bank’s regulatory capital when they are part of those entities’ capital.
