These regulations establish a government insurance program to cover up to 100% of losses (up to CAD 40 million in total) from loans made by private lenders to Marine Industries Limited, with insurance fees paid semi-annually and reimbursement limited to the lesser of the outstanding insurance amount or 100% of the lender’s actual loss. The Minister may reduce the insurance amount at the private lender’s request.
