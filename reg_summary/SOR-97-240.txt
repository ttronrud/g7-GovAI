The Treasury Board adopted the Cheque Issue Regulations, 1997, to establish rules for the issuance of cheques by the Receiver General and departmental ministers, including requirements for signatures, payment details, replacement cheques, and the creation and use of departmental bank accounts for specific expenditures. These regulations came into force on April 23, 1997, and set strict controls on cheque issuance, replacement, and authorization to ensure accountability and security in government financial transactions.
