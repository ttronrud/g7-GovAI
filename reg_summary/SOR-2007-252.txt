This regulation establishes the method for calculating and distributing payments to provinces under the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006, based on revenue from export charges and shared costs, with specific formulas applied to non-excluded provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta). The payments are calculated annually for calendar quarters, starting from October 12, 2006, and are adjusted based on export volumes and known costs.
