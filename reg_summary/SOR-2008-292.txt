This regulation exempts the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from certain radiocommunication restrictions for a specific period and geographic area in Quebec, allowing them to interfere with or obstruct radio communications solely for security, safety, or international relations purposes, with strict limits on scope and duration. The exemption is limited to a defined quadrilateral region and requires that interference be confined to the smallest necessary area, frequencies, and time.
