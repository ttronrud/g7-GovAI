This regulation repeals the previous ICAO privileges and immunities order and replaces it with a new order that grants the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and its representatives, including permanent missions, diplomatic privileges and immunities in Canada, consistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Canada-ICAO Agreement. These privileges include diplomatic immunities, tax exemptions, and other legal rights for ICAO officials and their families, as well as for accredited missions.
