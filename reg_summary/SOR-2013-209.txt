The Prepaid Payment Products Regulations, enacted on May 1, 2014, establish clear requirements for the issuance and disclosure of information related to prepaid payment products in Canada, including mandatory disclosures about fees, restrictions, product terms, and expiry dates, with specific rules on fee increases, maintenance fees, and the prohibition of overdraft fees or interest without express consent. The regulations ensure that information is presented in a clear, simple, and non-misleading manner and apply to products issued by financial institutions such as cooperatives, insurance companies, and trust and loan companies.
