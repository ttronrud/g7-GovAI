This regulation declares that the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations do not apply in Yukon, as Yukon’s Waters Act and Waters Regulation provide equivalent environmental protection. The Order comes into force upon registration and is based on an equivalency agreement between the federal government and Yukon.
