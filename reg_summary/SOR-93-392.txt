This regulation revokes the previous Canada Student Loans Regulations and introduces updated rules effective August 1, 1993, to govern student loans, including definitions of key terms, eligibility for full-time status, repayment conditions, and provisions for medical or parental leave, with the goal of providing more flexibility and support for students facing temporary disruptions to their studies. It also establishes a framework for borrowers to resume full-time status and receive a period of deferred repayment under certain circumstances.
