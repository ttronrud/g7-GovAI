These Regulations establish the framework for licensing international river improvements in Canada, defining such improvements as works that alter the flow or use of international rivers and requiring applicants to provide detailed information on environmental, economic, and operational impacts. The Minister may issue licences for up to 50 years, with conditions on construction, operation, and maintenance, and may cancel a licence if terms are not met, providing notice and opportunity to respond before cancellation.
