This regulation establishes mandatory reporting requirements for tobacco product manufacturers under the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act, requiring them to submit detailed information on products, packaging, manufacturing processes, ingredients, and constituents. The reports must include digital images of packaging, specifications of materials, test data from accredited laboratories, and be submitted in a standardized electronic format, with specific deadlines depending on the type of product and whether it is a new brand or subject to changes.
