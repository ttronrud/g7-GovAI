These Regulations establish the procedures for the public auction or tender sale of abandoned, forfeited, or detained goods under the Customs Act, requiring sales to be on an "as is-where is" basis and specifying rules for bidding, acceptance, and enforcement of tenders. If no acceptable bid is received or a tender is not completed within seven days, the sale may be canceled and the goods held for a future sale.
