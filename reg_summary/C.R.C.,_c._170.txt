The Ontario Apple Order establishes the regulatory framework for the marketing of apples in Ontario, granting both the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Apple Marketing Commission authority to regulate interprovincial and export trade, including powers similar to those available for local marketing. This includes the ability to regulate persons and property within the province under the Farm Products Marketing Act and associated plans and regulations.
