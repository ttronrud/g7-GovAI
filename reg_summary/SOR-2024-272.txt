The Canada Offshore Renewable Energy Regulations establish comprehensive safety, environmental, and emergency management requirements for offshore wind energy projects and associated power lines, mandating that operators submit detailed plans—including safety, environmental protection, and emergency response plans—before commencing work, and implement a robust management system to ensure safe, secure, and environmentally responsible operations. These regulations emphasize risk assessment, hazard identification, compliance, and continuous improvement to protect people, property, and the environment.
