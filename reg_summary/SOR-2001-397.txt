These regulations establish investment limits for insurance holding companies under the Insurance Companies Act, defining how real property interests and related financial instruments are valued and setting capital requirements, with exemptions for large, well-capitalized holding companies. They specify that certain investments in insurance companies, securities dealers, or real property entities are subject to regulatory capital rules, while also outlining the valuation of real property interests, including loans, guarantees, and security interests, based on book value or net realizable value.
