These regulations, now repealed, required vessel and aircraft operators to notify Canadian quarantine officers in advance of arrival about any illness or death on board, particularly those involving fever, rash, diarrhea, or suspected infectious diseases like smallpox or plague, and mandated specific health and travel information to be reported. The regulations also designated specific quarantine stations for different ports and outlined procedures for reporting health-related incidents via radio prior to landing.
