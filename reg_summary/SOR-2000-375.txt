These regulations establish the calculation and payment of pension benefits for certain former Public Service employees who transitioned to Canada Post on October 1, 2000, using specific actuarial assumptions and interest rates, with payments made over two years to the Canada Post Pension Plan from either the Superannuation Account or the Public Service Pension Fund. The benefits are calculated as of September 30, 2000, net of any unpaid instalments, and include interest at a specified rate on each payment.
