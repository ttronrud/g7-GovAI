These Ontario regulations govern the interprovincial and export marketing of greenhouse vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce) by requiring shippers and producers to report sales, maintain detailed receipts and records, and promptly notify and report claims for compensation. They also mandate compliance with handling and cooling standards and ensure transparency through accessible sales records and inspection certificates.
