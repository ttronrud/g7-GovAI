These regulations establish the framework for guaranteed farm improvement loans under the Farm Improvement Loans Act, defining eligible loan types (such as for agricultural implements, livestock, buildings, and farm development), setting limits on loan amounts (up to 75% or 90% of costs depending on the loan type), requiring borrowers to provide evidence of proper use of funds, and outlining repayment terms, interest rates, security requirements, and procedures for defaults and claims. The regulations also specify maximum interest rates based on prime lending rates and require banks to maintain adequate security and provide borrowers with written repayment agreements.
