The Railway Costing Regulations, enacted in 1980, establish detailed guidelines for calculating costs and actual losses for railway companies in Canada, particularly for branch lines and passenger-train services, ensuring that costs reflect avoidable expenses and include allowances for depreciation and capital costs based on Committee-approved rates. These regulations apply to cost submissions for financial years starting in 1979 and beyond, requiring cost categorization, use of uniform accounting standards, and specific treatment of variable costs, capital expenses, and loss calculations under the Railway Act.
