These regulations establish a framework for authorizing the non-commercial export of patented pharmaceutical products and medical devices for international humanitarian purposes under the Patent Act, requiring specific forms, declarations, and royalty calculations based on the destination country’s position in the Human Development Index or similar criteria. They ensure transparency in applications, including detailed information on the product, export destination, consignee, and shipment details, and mandate that applicants demonstrate efforts to obtain a license from patentees before seeking authorization.
