These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Burwash Airport in the Yukon Territory, limiting the height of any structures or buildings near the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, with height limits defined by approach, transitional, and outer surfaces based on the airport’s reference point and surrounding land boundaries. The regulations apply to all land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, and no structure may exceed the elevation limits set by these surfaces.
