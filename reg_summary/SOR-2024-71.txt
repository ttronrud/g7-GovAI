This regulation grants the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and its designated officials, representatives, and experts in Canada specific privileges and immunities while carrying out official activities, as outlined in an agreement signed in 2024, to facilitate the operation of the BIS Innovation Hub Toronto Centre. These privileges are derived from the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities and are strictly limited to official duties, without exempting individuals from traffic liabilities or Canadian taxes.
