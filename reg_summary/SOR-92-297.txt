These regulations allow a trust or loan company to permit its subsidiaries that are regulated securities entities to hold shares of the company, up to 1% of the company’s regulatory capital, with a temporary exemption for subsidiaries acting as underwriters in share distributions. The rules are designed to ensure transparency and stability in shareholding structures while allowing flexibility during securities offerings.
