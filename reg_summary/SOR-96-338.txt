The Canadian Transportation Agency issued the Railway Traffic and Passenger Tariffs Regulations on July 2, 1996, requiring railway companies to include specific details in all traffic and passenger tariffs, such as rates, routes, terms and conditions, and explanations of symbols. The regulations also mandate that amended tariffs clearly highlight changes and provide references to previous versions or supplements, whether in printed or electronic form, and came into force on July 3, 1996.
