This regulation grants the United Nations the status of a body corporate and establishes its immunities and privileges in Canada, as defined in the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities, including for its representatives, officials, and experts, while excluding Canadian citizens and limiting tax exemptions. It ensures that representatives and certain officials enjoy diplomatic immunities and privileges during official duties, including protection from taxation based on residence, but does not exempt Canadian citizens from taxes on their salaries or emoluments.
