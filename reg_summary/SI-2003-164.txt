This regulation grants tax remission to accredited foreign missions of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for the period April 1, 2002, to the date before the order is registered, covering the difference between tax actually paid and tax that would have been paid if the mission had been granted ICAO privileges. Remission is only available if the mission pays the tax and submits a timely claim with proof of payment and accreditation.
