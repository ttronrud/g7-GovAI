The Ontario Court of Appeal revoked its 1985 criminal appeal rules and adopted new Criminal Appeal Rules, effective September 1, 1993, to standardize procedures for criminal appeals, including notice of appeal, transcript requirements, service, and appeal book content, with specific provisions for inmate appeals and modifications for appeals under the Young Offenders Act or sections 784 and 839 of the Criminal Code. These rules clarify timelines, document requirements, and the role of the Registrar and criminal panels in managing appeals.
