The Small Businesses Loans Regulations establish the conditions under which guaranteed business improvement loans are provided to small businesses, defining eligible loan types (such as fixed, movable equipment, premises, and land loans), setting limits on loan amounts based on estimated or actual costs, requiring repayment in instalments with specific terms, and outlining security requirements, interest rate caps, and procedures for default and loss claims. The regulations apply only to certain types of businesses and loans made before April 1, 1993, and include provisions for borrower default, lender remedies, and the determination of losses.
