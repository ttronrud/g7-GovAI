The Musquash Estuary Marine Protected Area Regulations designate specific zones within the estuary to protect marine habitats by prohibiting activities that could disturb or damage living marine organisms, with limited exceptions for approved fishing, tourism, and scientific activities. These regulations come into force upon registration and require advance approval for any scientific, educational, or habitat restoration activities to ensure environmental protection.
