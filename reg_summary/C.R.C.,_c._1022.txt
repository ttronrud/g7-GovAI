These Regulations establish the terms for Lieutenant Governors' superannuation contributions, including payment of prior service amounts in instalments or lump sums, with interest at 4% per annum, and provide rules for payment plans, defaults, and recovery of unpaid amounts, including from a spouse’s pension. They also outline election forms and conditions for contributing or opting out of contributions, with certain interest exemptions and provisions for medical examinations and payment flexibility.
