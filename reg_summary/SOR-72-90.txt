These regulations establish the framework for determining and paying claims by Canadian citizens against the Government of Romania and its entities, based on nationalization, expropriation, or other pre-1971 measures, as well as claims under the Treaty of Peace with Romania. Awards are limited to claims notified by December 14, 1971, and payments are made from a designated portion of the Foreign Claims Fund, with eligibility and compensation deductions based on prior payments or defaults.
