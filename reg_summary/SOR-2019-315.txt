This regulation grants remission of the surtax on certain imported steel goods, specifically those listed in paragraphs 1(c) to (i) of the schedule to the Surtax Order, and goods excluded from item 2 of that schedule, provided no other surtax relief has been claimed and the importer submits a claim within two years of importation. The Order comes into force upon registration.
