This regulation revokes the old Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure (Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971) effective January 1, 1991, except for appeals or proceedings initiated before that date, and replaces it with new rules governing appeals under the Employment Insurance Act, including procedures for filing, service, time extensions, interventions, and hearings. The new rules are designed to ensure a fair, efficient, and cost-effective resolution of appeals.
