These regulations establish the procedures for applications for ministerial review of potential miscarriages of justice under the Criminal Code, requiring detailed information and documentation, mandating a preliminary assessment, and allowing for an investigation if a reasonable basis for a miscarriage of justice is found. The Minister must then decide whether to proceed with an investigation or make a decision under subsection 696.3(3) of the Code, with transparency requirements and annual reporting obligations.
