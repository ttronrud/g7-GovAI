These regulations establish the framework for settling claims by Canadian citizens, juridical persons, or the Canadian government against the Bulgarian government related to pre-1966 nationalizations, with payments made from the Foreign Claims Fund under an agreement signed in 1966. Final payments to claimants are subject to a release and constitute full satisfaction of claims, with an appointed adviser providing recommendations on claim validity and compensation, though the Ministers retain discretion in final decisions.
