This regulation revokes the old Currency Exchange for Customs Valuation Regulations and establishes new rules for determining the Canadian dollar value of foreign currencies used in customs duty calculations. The exchange rate used is based on the most recent rate quoted by the Bank of Canada, a Canadian chartered bank, or the Financial Times, with adjustments for weighted averages and import data when necessary.
