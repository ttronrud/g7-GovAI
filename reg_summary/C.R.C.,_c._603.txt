These Regulations establish the requirements for obtaining and using import certificates in Canada, specifying that only Canadian residents may apply, applications must include detailed and truthful information about the goods and their intended import, and the certificate is valid only until its stated expiry date. The regulations also require reporting on the arrival, diversion, or delay of goods and prohibit unauthorized disposal or use of the certificate, with delivery verification certificates only issued after proper reporting.
