The Farm Debt Mediation Regulations, made under the Farm Debt Mediation Act, establish procedures for mediation between farmers and their creditors, including definitions, notification requirements, appeal processes, and the structure and duties of Appeal Boards. They also outline rules for when and how notices must be delivered and ensure timely and fair resolution of disputes through a structured, transparent process.
