This regulation establishes the types of insurance an authorized foreign bank may offer or promote in Canada, including credit-related, life, disability, and travel insurance, while strictly limiting promotions to only authorized insurance types and prohibiting the sharing of customer information with insurance companies or brokers. It also restricts advertising on bank web pages and ensures that such promotions do not target individuals who have opted out or have inactive accounts.
