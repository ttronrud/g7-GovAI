This regulation grants remission of surtaxes paid under U.S. surtax orders (specifically for steel, aluminum, and other goods) for certain imports into Canada, subject to specific timing, eligibility, and claim conditions, including import dates, purchase contracts, and a requirement to submit a claim to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness within two years of importation. The remission applies to goods imported on or after July 1, 2018, or temporarily imported for repair, alteration, or storage under defined conditions.
