The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, enacted the Hibernia Development Project Offshore Application Regulations to modify and add to Newfoundland’s laws and apply federal laws in the offshore area for the Hibernia Development Project, including amendments to definitions, security interests, registration procedures, and judicial remedies to allow for clerical errors and late filings. These changes facilitate the operation of the project by clarifying legal application, enhancing flexibility in document registration, and providing judicial discretion in rectifying omissions or misstatements.
