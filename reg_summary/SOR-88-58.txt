The Air Transportation Regulations, approved under the National Transportation Act, establish licensing classes for air carriers and air services based on aircraft size (small, medium, large, and all-cargo) and define insurance requirements, including minimum liability coverage for passengers and third-party damages, adjusted annually for inflation. These regulations also exempt certain specialized air services from full licensing requirements and specify conditions for insurance exclusions.
