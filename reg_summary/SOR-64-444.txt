These regulations provide that certain Canadian Forces members, who are compulsorily retired due to a reduction in military establishment rather than inefficiency or misconduct, will be deemed to have served 20 or more years for superannuation purposes, entitling them to a full annuity instead of a reduced one. This applies to retirees who served at least 10 years and were retired between May 7, 1964, and two years thereafter.
