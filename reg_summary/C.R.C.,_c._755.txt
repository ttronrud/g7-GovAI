This regulation grants tax remission on certain imported or purchased articles and materials used exclusively in defence production or development under Canada-U.S. defence contracts, excluding taxes under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act. To claim remission, a person must provide verification from the Canadian Commercial Corporation of a qualifying contract and a certificate from the importer confirming the materials’ use for defence-related purposes.
