The Criminal Rules of the Ontario Court of Justice, approved on March 22, 2012, aim to ensure that proceedings are conducted justly and efficiently by promoting fair treatment of prosecution and defence, protecting the rights of the accused, and managing court time based on the seriousness and complexity of the case. The rules establish procedures for applications, pre-trial conferences, preliminary inquiries, and hearings, while allowing flexibility through practice directions and consent agreements, with all rules coming into force on July 1, 2012.
