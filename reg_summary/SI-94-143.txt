The Governor in Council refers back to a portion of a 1994 CRTC decision that required local rate increases and long-distance rate reductions for certain telecommunications companies, including Manitoba Telephone System, for implementation in 1995, 1996, and 1997, and stays its enforcement pending a reconsideration by the Commission. The Commission is directed to review the rate rebalancing plan, compare Phase III cost allocations with external benchmarks, and complete the reconsideration by October 31, 1995, in the context of broader telecommunications policy objectives.
