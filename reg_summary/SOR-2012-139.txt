These regulations establish environmental standards for wastewater systems in Canada, prohibiting the discharge of effluent that is acutely lethal to rainbow trout or contains excessive levels of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, total residual chlorine, or un-ionized ammonia. They apply to systems discharging 100 m³ or more of influent per day, with specific limits and monitoring requirements based on system type (intermittent or continuous), and include provisions for authorization, reporting, and treatment to protect aquatic species.
