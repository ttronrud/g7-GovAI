These regulations establish how amounts paid or recovered by Her Majesty—up to $1 million or above—under certain insurance or winding-up acts are distributed on a pro rata basis to assessed insurance companies, societies, or foreign/provincial companies, with expenses for locating the company or its beneficiaries deducted from the payment, and any remaining balance applied to reduce assessments if the company cannot be found. The regulations come into force upon registration.
