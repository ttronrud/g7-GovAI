These regulations set limits on cooperative credit associations' investments in designated entities, restricting acquisitions or increases in substantial investments, and prohibiting loans or guarantees to such entities if, after the transaction, the total value of related holdings exceeds 50% of the association’s regulatory capital. The rules also define key terms and include exemptions for certain investments and transactions.
