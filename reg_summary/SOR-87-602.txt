This regulation revokes the previous Sarnia Airport Zoning Regulations and establishes new zoning rules to control development around Sarnia Airport, setting limits on building heights based on approach, transitional, and outer surfaces to ensure aviation safety. No structure may exceed the elevation of these defined surfaces, and owners must remove any vegetation or waste that attracts birds.
