The Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Regulations establish elevation limits and land boundaries around Fort Simpson Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, prohibiting structures or natural growth that exceed designated approach, transitional, or outer surfaces. These restrictions apply to all lands within or directly under the approach surfaces, and require removal of vegetation or waste that poses a risk to aviation safety.
