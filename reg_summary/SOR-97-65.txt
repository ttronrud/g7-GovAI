These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" — goods not imported for sale or industrial use — under the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, stating that such goods acquired in Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary country are deemed to originate there and qualify for tariff benefits if they are marked according to the marking laws of that country or bear no mark indicating otherwise. The regulations came into force on the date section 45 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act took effect.
