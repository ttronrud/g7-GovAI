These Regulations establish safety standards for the stationary bulk storage of flammable liquids on railway right-of-way, including requirements for tank placement, minimum distances from tracks and structures, construction standards, fire protection, and compliance with testing and inspection codes. They define key terms such as flash point, vapour pressure, and boil-over, and classify flammable liquids into three classes based on their properties, with specific rules for storage, ventilation, and emergency safety.
