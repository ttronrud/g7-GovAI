The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, revokes two previous fruit marketing orders and replaces them with a new Ontario Tender Fruit Order that establishes a regulatory framework for the marketing of tender fruits (peaches, pears, plums, sour cherries, and sweet cherries) in Ontario, including interprovincial and export trade. The Ontario Tender Fruit Producers’ Marketing Board and the Farm Products Marketing Board are authorized to regulate marketing, set and collect levies based on producer groups, and use those funds for reserves, expenses, and equitable distribution among producers.
