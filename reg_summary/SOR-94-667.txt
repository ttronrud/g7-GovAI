These regulations establish ownership and control standards for Canadian telecommunications common carriers, requiring that Canadian-owned corporations meet specific thresholds for Canadian shareholder control—such as at least 66⅔% of voting shares beneficially owned and controlled by Canadians—to ensure national ownership and prevent foreign dominance in the telecommunications sector. They define key terms like "Canadian," "beneficial ownership," and "qualified corporations," and outline procedures for determining ownership, including affidavits and declarations by shareholders, trusts, partnerships, and depositories.
