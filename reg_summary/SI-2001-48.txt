This regulation amends the Canada-Austria double taxation avoidance convention by modifying tax rates on dividends, interest, royalties, and capital gains, introducing limits on taxation for residents of the other country, and establishing rules for information exchange and tax enforcement. The updated provisions came into force 60 days after ratification and apply to tax withheld at source and other taxes beginning in the second month following entry into force.
