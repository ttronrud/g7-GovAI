This regulation grants the Ontario Milk Marketing Board and the Milk Commission authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade, similar to their local powers, but excludes powers exercised by the Canadian Dairy Commission. It also allows the Commodity Board to impose and collect levies or charges on milk producers and use those funds for reserves, expenses, and equalizing producer incomes.
