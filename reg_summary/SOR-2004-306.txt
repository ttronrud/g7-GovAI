The Lieutenant Governor in Council enacted the Ontario Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations to define key terms, authorize certain individuals and agencies to collect and register sex offender information, designate specific registration centres with defined service areas, and set the regulations' effective date. These regulations came into force on the later of the date the Sex Offender Information Registration Act came into force or the date of registration.
