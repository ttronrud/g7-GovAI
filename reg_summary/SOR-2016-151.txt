The Governor in Council has adopted the Multi-Sector Air Pollutants Regulations to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from specific industrial facilities, including boilers, stationary engines, and cement manufacturing plants, in order to protect human health and the environment. The regulations establish emission standards, define key terms, and set out requirements for monitoring, reporting, and data retention using approved methods, including the EC CEMS Code and Alberta CEMS Code.
