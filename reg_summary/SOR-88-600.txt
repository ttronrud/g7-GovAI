The Canada Oil and Gas Diving Regulations, enacted under the Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act, establish safety standards for diving operations related to oil and gas exploration, drilling, production, and transportation. They define key terms, classify dives by depth and technique, and require operators and contractors to maintain safe performance levels, appoint qualified supervisors and medical personnel, and ensure continuous safety oversight through a diving safety specialist.
