The Minister of Transport revoked an earlier exemption and granted a new exemption in 1989, allowing Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. to operate a domestic licence despite not meeting the usual qualification requirements under section 72(2)(a)(i) of the National Transportation Act, 1987, due to public interest considerations. This exemption is effective under the Lawrence Bay Airways Ltd. Exemption Order, 1989.
