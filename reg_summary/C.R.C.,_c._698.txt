These Regulations establish the rules for the issuance, registration, transfer, and administration of Canadian domestic bonds by the Bank of Canada, defining the rights of registered owners, the procedures for transferring ownership, and the conditions under which the Bank may register or redeem bonds, including in cases of death, seizure, or court orders. The Bank maintains a register of bond ownership and ensures that transfers are validly documented and authorized, with specific provisions for forged instruments, survivorship, and international transfers.
