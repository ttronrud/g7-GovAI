The Safe Food for Canadians Regulations establish food safety standards, definitions, and labeling requirements across various food categories, including dairy, meat, eggs, and processed foods, to ensure consumer safety and compliance with Canadian food laws. These regulations are enacted under the Safe Food for Canadians Act and other relevant legislation, and they define key terms, set requirements for packaging, labeling, and handling, and specify which foods require licensing or authorization for movement between provinces or for export.
