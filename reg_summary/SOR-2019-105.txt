The Governor General in Council designates the Laurentian Channel as a Marine Protected Area under the Oceans Act, establishing specific boundaries, management zones, and strict prohibitions on activities that harm marine life, while allowing limited exceptions such as scientific research, public safety operations, and approved fishing or cable maintenance activities. Activities requiring approval must include detailed environmental assessments and post-activity reporting to ensure minimal impact on marine ecosystems.
