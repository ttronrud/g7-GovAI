The Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Republic of Poland, effective October 1, 2009 (deemed under Section 1828 of the Jobs and Economic Growth Act, 2010), establishes reciprocal recognition of social security benefits, allowing individuals who have contributed in one country to accumulate creditable periods that count toward eligibility for pensions, disability benefits, and other benefits in the other country, with specific rules for totalizing periods and calculating benefit amounts. It also ensures that benefits are not reduced or suspended solely due to residence in the other country and provides for mutual assistance, information sharing, and administrative cooperation between the two countries.
