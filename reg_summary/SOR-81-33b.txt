On January 1, 1981, the Public Service Commission revoked previous part-time employment exclusions and regulations, establishing new rules that exclude certain part-time workers—those working less than one-third of the standard hours or up to 15 hours per week—from the Public Service Employment Act. These new regulations, known as the Public Service Part-time Regulations, govern recruitment, call-back procedures, and termination notice for part-time workers, ensuring fair treatment and providing at least one day’s notice before service termination.
