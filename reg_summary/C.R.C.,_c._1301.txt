These regulations establish the procedures for applying for and receiving advance payments for Prairie grain crops, specifying forms, eligibility criteria, approval processes, and payment conditions, including rates, grading standards, and interest calculations, all under the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act. They also outline the Board’s authority to make advance payments for unthreshed grain and to enforce repayment if producers fail to meet their obligations.
