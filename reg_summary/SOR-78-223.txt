This by-law, approved by the Canadian Human Rights Commission and the Governor in Council, limits the filing of complaints under section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act—regarding wage disparities between male and female employees—to complaints filed before June 1, 1978. As a result, no new complaints on this issue will be accepted after that date.
