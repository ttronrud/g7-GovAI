These regulations establish fees for parties involved in proposed air service arrangements involving at least one level I air carrier, with fees increasing based on the number of parties and whether the arrangement is subject to a public interest review. Fees must be paid in full via certified cheque either when a notice is given or within five days after the Minister identifies significant public interest concerns.
