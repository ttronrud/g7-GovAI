The Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Order authorizes the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers' Marketing Board to establish and enforce levies or charges on producers and marketers of greenhouse vegetables (such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce) for interprovincial and export trade, with funds used to cover expenses, losses, and to equalize revenues among producers. These levies are applied based on producer groups and may be used to create reserves or adjust income disparities.
