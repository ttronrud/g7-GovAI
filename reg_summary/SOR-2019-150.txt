The Air Passenger Protection Regulations establish minimum standards for how airlines must treat passengers in cases of flight delays, cancellations, or denial of boarding, including providing compensation, alternate travel arrangements, and clear information on rights and recourse. The regulations apply to both large and small carriers, with special provisions for passengers with disabilities, and ensure that passengers are informed and treated fairly when delays or disruptions occur due to either circumstances outside the carrier’s control or within its control, including safety-related issues.
