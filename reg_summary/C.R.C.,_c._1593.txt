These Regulations establish the structure and responsibilities of regional advisory committees under the Veterans’ Land Act, specifying that each committee has three members, including a Chairman appointed by the Governor in Council, who may serve on other committees if needed. Members (except the Chairman) are paid $10 for each half day of meetings or travel, plus reasonable expenses.
