The Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has established Standing Orders outlining the procedures for handling grievances and appeals within the Force, including definitions, processes for informal resolution, adjudication at initial and final levels, and the rights and responsibilities of grievors, respondents, and adjudicators. These rules ensure procedural fairness, allow for appeals within 14 days of a decision, and provide mechanisms for resolving disputes through formal and informal means while protecting sensitive information.
