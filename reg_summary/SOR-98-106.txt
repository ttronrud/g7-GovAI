The Federal Court Rules, 1998, approved by the Governor General in Council, establish the procedural framework for proceedings in the Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court of Canada, defining key terms, outlining court administration, and emphasizing efficiency, proportionality, and accessibility. The rules apply to all proceedings unless superseded by an Act of Parliament, and provide for public input, recordkeeping, document management, and time-related procedures.
