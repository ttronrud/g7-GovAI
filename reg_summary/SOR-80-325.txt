These regulations authorize the Canadian Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce to provide insurance up to 90% of loans (with a total cap of $2 million) made by private lenders to Trident Aircraft Ltd., subject to specific conditions, including application requirements, annual fees, and limits on reimbursement in case of early loan repayment. The insurance covers only losses up to the lesser of the existing insurance amount or 90% of the lender’s actual loss.
