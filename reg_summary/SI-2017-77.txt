On November 30, 2017, the Canadian government transferred control of the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch from the Department of Health to the Department of Indigenous Services Canada, and transferred the Education and Social Development Programs and Partnership Sector, as well as the Regional Operations Sector, from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to the same department. This realignment aimed to strengthen the federal government's capacity to deliver services to Indigenous peoples by consolidating responsibility under a single department.
