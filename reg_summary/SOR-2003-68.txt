These regulations restrict property and casualty and marine companies from acquiring control of or making substantial investments in entities that engage in certain information technology activities—such as designing or managing data transmission systems—unless specific conditions are met, including limits on the total balance sheet value and loan exposure, and prohibitions on activities involving financial risk or unauthorized financial intermediation. The regulations also specify that such investments are prohibited if the entity engages in activities that violate the Insurance Companies Act, including accepting deposits or dealing in securities, unless expressly permitted.
