These regulations establish definitions and procedural requirements for the administration and enforcement of the Assisted Human Reproduction Act, including clarifying who is considered a donor of an in vitro embryo, the conditions under which consent is required, and the process for serving notices and disposing of forfeited reproductive materials. They also specify that certain measures involving embryos must align with the consent of spouses or common-law partners, and that written consent—either signed and witnessed or attested in a document from a prior anonymous donation—is required for compliance with the Act.
