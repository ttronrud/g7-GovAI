These regulations establish the types of insurance that cooperative credit associations in Canada may administer or promote, define key terms such as "authorized type of insurance" and "group insurance policy," and set strict rules on how associations can promote insurance products—particularly prohibiting promotion of non-authorized insurance or sensitive customer information. Associations are restricted from promoting or sharing customer data with insurers unless specific conditions are met, and promotions must comply with defined audiences and content requirements.
