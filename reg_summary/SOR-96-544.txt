The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation establishes a discretionary interest rate for deposit insurance payments during a member institution's winding-up, using the simple annual rate of interest from three-month Government of Canada treasury bills auctioned by the Bank of Canada prior to the winding-up order. This by-law came into force on December 5, 1996.
