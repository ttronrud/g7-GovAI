These regulations establish the fees for inspections and certifications of ships under the Canada Shipping Act, with fees varying based on ship type, gross tonnage, inspection type (e.g., first inspection, annual, re-inspection), and whether the ship is Canadian or non-Canadian. Specific fees are set for inspections, certificate issuance, and surveys, with reduced rates for short voyages in the coasting trade and exemptions or reductions for concurrent inspections.
