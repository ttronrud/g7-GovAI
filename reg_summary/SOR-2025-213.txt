The Governor in Council has declared that the federal regulations aimed at reducing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector do not apply in Alberta, due to the existence of equivalent Alberta laws and a formal agreement between the federal government and Alberta. This declaration is effective until the agreement terminates, after which the regulations will resume applying in the province.
