These regulations establish a process for air carriers to reserve airport apron and terminal facilities for passenger charter flights, requiring applications at least 30 days in advance (or sooner if a permit is issued) and specifying the required information, airport eligibility, and procedures for reservation approval or rejection. The regulations apply to non-regular charter flights involving aircraft with a maximum certified take-off weight of 35,000 pounds or more, and cover a list of designated Canadian airports.
