Order NP-MO-1-80 rescinds outdated socio-economic and environmental conditions from Foothills Pipe Lines (Alta.) Ltd.'s pipeline certificate and replaces them with new, comprehensive Northern Pipeline Socio-Economic and Environmental Terms and Conditions for Alberta, which mandate environmental protection, community consultation, employment equity, public information sharing, and accountability for impacts during pipeline construction and operation. These terms strengthen regulatory oversight and ensure that Foothills complies with both provincial and federal laws while addressing social, economic, and environmental concerns.
