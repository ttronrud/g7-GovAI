The Minister of the Environment designates certain classes of projects as exempt from mandatory environmental impact assessments, concluding that they cause only insignificant adverse environmental effects and after considering public feedback. These exemptions apply to projects involving small-scale construction, modifications, or operations of buildings, physical works, utilities, and storage tanks, with specific restrictions to protect water bodies, wetlands, wildlife, and culturally significant sites.
