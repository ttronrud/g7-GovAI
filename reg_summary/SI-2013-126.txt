This regulation withdraws certain tracts of land in the Dehcho Region of the Northwest Territories from disposal for two years to support the implementation of Aboriginal land and resource agreements, while excluding specific mining and land-related activities that were already established or authorized prior to the Order. It also formally recognizes and deposits specific land parcels identified on reference maps signed by Dehcho First Nations and Government of Canada negotiators as part of land negotiations.
