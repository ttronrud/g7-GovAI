This regulation establishes a customs duty remission for apparel imported from designated countries when the apparel is made from textiles produced in Canada and shipped directly without further processing abroad. Remission is granted if imported materials constitute less than 50% of the value of the textiles and is limited to the lesser of the value of the Canadian textiles or the duties owed on the imported apparel, subject to specific conditions including timing and documentation requirements.
