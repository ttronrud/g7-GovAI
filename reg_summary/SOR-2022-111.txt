These regulations establish a federal offset credit system under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, outlining the conditions for registering projects that prevent or remove greenhouse gas emissions, including requirements for project eligibility, quantification methods, verification, and recordkeeping, with a focus on ensuring that emissions reductions are real, additional, unique, and permanent. The system applies to projects with a start date on or after January 1, 2017, and defines crediting periods based on project type, with specific rules for aggregations and protocol updates.
