This regulation withdraws certain tracts of land in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories from disposal for two years to support the negotiation and implementation of Aboriginal land agreements, while excluding specific mineral-related activities and existing land interests from the withdrawal. The withdrawal applies to surface and surface-subsurface rights as defined in the schedules and reference maps, with all existing rights and renewal options remaining unaffected.
