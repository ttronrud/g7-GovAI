The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, varies a prior telecommunications decision by refraining from regulating retail local access-independent VoIP services provided by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) within their territories, as this class of services is seen as distinct and more conducive to competition and innovation. However, this forbearance is conditional and can be reversed if the Commission determines that continued regulation is necessary to maintain a competitive market.
