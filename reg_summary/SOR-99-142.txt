The Minister of Natural Resources approves the Canada Lands Surveyors Regulations, which establish professional standards, define misconduct and incompetence, outline ethical obligations for surveyors and permit holders, and set requirements for membership, licensing, examinations, and disciplinary processes under the Canada Lands Surveyors Act. These regulations ensure accountability, competence, and public trust in surveying activities across Canada.
