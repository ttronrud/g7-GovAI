These Ontario regulations govern the interprovincial and export marketing of greenhouse vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce) by establishing standards for product quality, proper handling, temperature control, and shipping practices, with strict compliance requirements and oversight by the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board. Shippers must ensure products meet Canada’s agricultural standards, properly label containers, maintain appropriate temperatures, and follow specific procedures for storage, transportation, and distribution, with all records and facilities accessible for inspection.
