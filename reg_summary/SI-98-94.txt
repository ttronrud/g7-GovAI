This proclamation announces that the Canada-Switzerland Double Taxation Convention on Income and Capital Taxes came into force on April 21, 1998, and that it ceased to be effective in respect of certain taxes as per Article 28, paragraph 3. The Convention establishes rules for taxing income and capital gains, determines residency, defines permanent establishments, and sets limits on taxation of dividends to prevent double taxation between Canada and Switzerland.
