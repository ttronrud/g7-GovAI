This regulation excludes employment at Ontario Hydro nuclear facilities from Part III of the Canada Labour Code, except for specific sections (265 to 267), and applies the Employment Standards Act, 2000, to the extent relevant to such employment. The exclusion was effective April 1, 1998, and applies to nuclear facilities in Ontario owned or operated by Ontario Hydro or others that later come under its ownership and operation.
