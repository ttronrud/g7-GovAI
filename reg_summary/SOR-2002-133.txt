These regulations require banks, insurance companies, and trust and loan companies to publish annual public accountability statements detailing their community development efforts, including financial contributions, charitable donations, employee volunteer activities, and lending to small businesses and underserved populations, with specific reporting requirements on employment, branch locations, and tax payments. The statements must be made available to customers and the public within 135 days of the end of each financial year.
