This proclamation, issued on June 28, 2018, officially renames "National Aboriginal Day" to "National Indigenous Peoples Day" on June 21 each year, reflecting a commitment to recognizing the rights and cultures of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples and advancing reconciliation through respectful, nation-to-nation relationships. The change acknowledges the broader and more accurate term "Indigenous peoples" to better represent the diverse communities of Canada.
