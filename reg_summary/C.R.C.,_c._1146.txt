The Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Storage Regulations establish strict safety, design, and location requirements for stationary bulk storage facilities of anhydrous ammonia on railway property, including minimum distances from tracks, buildings, and public areas, tank design and construction standards, filling density limits, and mandatory inspections and approvals. These regulations apply to all new or modified installations as of February 1, 1965, and require Commission approval before construction, with specific requirements for tank placement, grounding, gauging, and compliance with A.S.M.E. and provincial pressure vessel codes.
