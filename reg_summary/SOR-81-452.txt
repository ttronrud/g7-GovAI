These regulations establish elevation limits and land use restrictions around Fredericton Airport to ensure aviation safety, prohibiting structures or natural growth that exceed designated approach, transitional, or outer surfaces. They define specific zones, including strips, approach surfaces, and an outer surface, all based on the airport reference point and measured from runway centers, with strict controls on construction, vegetation, and waste disposal.
