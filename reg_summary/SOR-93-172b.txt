This regulation establishes temporary employment terms for specific staff positions in the Department of External Affairs during a limited period (April 1 to December 31, 1993), allowing for appointments of less than three months with a total of less than six months in any 12-month period, exempting such appointments from the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act. It grants the Deputy Head authority to recruit, appoint, and terminate such temporary employees with one day’s notice for cause or due to lack of work.
