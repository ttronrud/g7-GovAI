These regulations transfer the pension obligations of Canadian Arsenals Limited employees from a private pension fund to the Public Service Superannuation Act, effective January 1, 1962, allowing employees to opt out initially or later, and ensuring pensions, allowances, and contributions are properly managed and paid out from the Superannuation Account. They also establish the transfer of funds, pension rights for widows, and the treatment of past service and elective periods under the new public service pension system.
