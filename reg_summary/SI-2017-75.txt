The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, approves the re-application of the Public Service Employment Act to certain Statistics Canada positions, while simultaneously excluding specific provisions—such as those relating to deployment and internal appointment processes—from applying to positions that provide administrative or data processing support for censuses and surveys, except for those specified in the Statistics Act. This exclusion applies to personnel appointed or deployed on a term basis for these purposes.
