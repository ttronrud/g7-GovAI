This regulation establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas for softwood lumber products from Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to the United States in 2011, based on historical export or production volumes, with priority given to applicants who submit export permit applications first. Export allocations are determined by specific formulas and are subject to conditions, including relinquishment by producers and a minimum 10% reserve requirement for Quebec exports.
