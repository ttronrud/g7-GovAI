These Regulations establish a drawback system allowing exporters or importers to receive 99% of the customs duty and excise taxes paid on imported goods that are exported and not used in Canada for purposes other than export production, plant equipment, or damage prior to export. A claim must be filed within two years of exportation, include required forms and waivers, and be supported by evidence, with payment only allowed if taxes were paid within the three years before export and not previously refunded.
