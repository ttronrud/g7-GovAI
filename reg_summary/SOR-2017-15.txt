This regulation designates the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs as Marine Protected Areas to conserve fragile glass sponge reefs, establishing distinct zones with varying levels of protection, including core protection, adaptive, and vertical management zones. It prohibits activities that harm the reefs but allows limited fishing, navigation, and scientific research under strict conditions and approved activity plans.
