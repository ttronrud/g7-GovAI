These Regulations require the Minister of Justice to examine all Bills introduced in Parliament and statutory regulations before they are registered, ensuring they are consistent with the Canadian Bill of Rights. If inconsistencies are found, the Minister must issue a written report and submit it to the appropriate authorities, with copies sent to the Clerk of the House of Commons and, for regulations, to the Clerk of the Privy Council.
