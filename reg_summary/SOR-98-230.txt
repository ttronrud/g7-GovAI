These regulations, enacted on April 1, 1998, govern the superannuation rights of public servants who transition from the Department of National Defence to a new employer through a government agreement, including rights to contributions, pensions, death benefits, and allowances, with specific provisions for service periods, age, and eligibility periods. They ensure continuity of benefits for individuals who cease public service employment and become employed by a new employer, particularly in relation to pension entitlements and survivor benefits.
