These regulations define eligible financial contracts under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, specifying types of derivatives, lending, clearing, and collateral agreements that qualify for insurance coverage, and establish that such contracts must be traded on regulated markets or involve recurrent dealings in derivatives or over-the-counter markets. The regulations come into force when subsection 103(2) of the Budget Implementation Act, 2007, comes into force.
