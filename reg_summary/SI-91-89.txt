This regulation grants a tax remission to Indigenous individuals and others affected by the inclusion of "bridge pay" from work on the international bridges at Cornwall Island in their taxable income, specifically for taxation years after 1983. The remission amounts to the difference between taxes owed with and without the inclusion of bridge pay, but only if the taxpayer waives any right to appeal or objection.
