This Canada-New Zealand social security agreement allows citizens of either country to claim certain benefits (such as superannuation, invalids, widows’, and veteran’s pensions) based on residency or creditable periods in the other country, with special rules for residents of Canada who have lived in New Zealand. It establishes equal treatment, clarifies how creditable periods and residence are counted, and includes provisions for benefit calculations, administrative cooperation, and dispute resolution.
