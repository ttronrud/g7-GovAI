The Governor in Council enacted the Heavy-duty Vehicle and Engine Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, establishing emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles and engines based on criteria such as CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ emissions, with provisions for deterioration factors, testing methods (including A-to-B testing), and fleet-level certification. The regulations define key terms and set limits for vehicle and engine emissions, aligning with U.S. EPA standards and including specific requirements for vocational vehicles, trailers, and engine families.
