This regulation repeals a previous order and designates the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (who is not a member of the Treasury Board) as the Minister under the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act and the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act. This designation aligns the definition of "Minister" in both acts to ensure consistency in public sector labour relations governance.
