The Navigation Safety Regulations, 2020 establish additional safety standards for vessels in Canadian waters, aligning with international conventions like SOLAS, and require equipment such as AIS and ECDIS to be type-approved and maintained in effective operating condition. These regulations apply to vessels of 150 gross tonnage or more, with specific requirements based on voyage type, vessel class, and operational context.
