This regulation revokes an old duty remission order and establishes a new one that provides partial remission of customs, sales, and excise taxes for Canadian air carriers using aircraft parts, equipment, and certain supplies purchased or imported after January 1, 1975, with the remission amount based on the carrier's international flight usage percentage. The remission is granted only if the carrier applies within four years and certifies the goods were used in qualifying aircraft providing international commercial air service.
