This regulation establishes the Agreement between Canada and Japan on Social Security, which came into force on March 1, 2008, to ensure equal treatment for Canadians and Japanese nationals residing in each other’s territories and to facilitate the mobility of workers by allowing periods of contribution and residence in one country to count toward social security benefits in the other. It outlines specific rules for how periods of coverage and residence are calculated, particularly for pension and disability benefits, and provides mechanisms for combining contributions from both countries to meet eligibility requirements.
