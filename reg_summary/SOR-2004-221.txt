These regulations implement UN Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq by prohibiting Canadian persons from dealing in property formerly owned by the previous Iraqi government or individuals/entities identified by the UN Committee, and from exporting arms to Iraq unless authorized. They also establish exemptions for humanitarian activities and require notification and transfer of such property to the Development Fund for Iraq.
