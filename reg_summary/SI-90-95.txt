This regulation revokes outdated orders relating to gallantry gratuities and annuities and replaces them with a new Gallantry Awards Order that specifies payments to members of the Canadian armed forces (including British forces who enlisted before 1949) based on the gallantry awards they received, including annuities and one-time gratuities. Payments vary by award and recipient circumstances, with specific conditions on when annuities begin or are suspended.
