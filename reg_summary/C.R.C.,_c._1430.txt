These regulations define classifications for home-trade, inland, and minor waters voyages in Canada, specifying the geographic and operational limits for each class to determine eligibility for steamship certification. Voyages are categorized by risk, proximity to shore, distance between ports of refuge, and specific geographic constraints, with the Board having discretion to upgrade certain voyages to a higher class based on risk assessment.
