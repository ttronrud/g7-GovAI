The Governor in Council has rescinded a previous decision by the Canadian Transportation Agency that had set pilotage tariffs, following a petition by the Laurentian Pilotage Authority, because the Authority's proposed tariff increases were deemed not prejudicial to the public interest. This action allows the Authority to set tariffs that are fair, reasonable, and sufficient to operate on a self-sustaining financial basis.
