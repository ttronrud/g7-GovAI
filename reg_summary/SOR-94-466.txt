These regulations establish the framework for the marketing of dairy products in interprovincial and export trade under the Canadian Dairy Commission Act, setting out rules for federal and provincial quotas, licensing requirements, marketing restrictions, and compliance obligations. They ensure that only milk or cream produced by licensed producers can be marketed outside a province or exported, and require accurate record-keeping and oversight by the Commission.
