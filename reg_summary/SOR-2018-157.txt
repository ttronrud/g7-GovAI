This regulation excludes a specific portion of the Northern Bottlenose Whale's critical habitat—Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area—from protection under the Species at Risk Act, as permitted by the Act's provisions, and establishes the remaining critical habitat for the species. The Order comes into force upon registration and is based on the species' recovery strategy and the need to align with marine protected area designations.
