The Minister of Health established a list of pest control product formulants and contaminants of health or environmental concern under section 43(5)(b) of the Pest Control Products Act, identifying specific chemicals of concern using CAS Registry Numbers. This list applies only to pest control products registered under the Act and comes into force when section 43 of the Act becomes effective.
