This regulation approves amendments to the Employment Insurance Act that define key terms such as "family member," "care," and "support," and establish detailed criteria for what types of employment are considered insurable, including exceptions for temporary, religious, or international work. It also clarifies when certain short-term or non-regular employment becomes insurable based on duration and remuneration.
