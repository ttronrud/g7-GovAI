These regulations prohibit non-Canadians from purchasing residential property in Canada, with specific exceptions for temporary residents meeting certain conditions (such as study enrollment, work permits, or low purchase prices), and for certain protected categories like diplomatic personnel or refugees. The regulations establish procedures for enforcement, including court-ordered sale and distribution of proceeds, and were repealed on the date section 236 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2022 came into force.
