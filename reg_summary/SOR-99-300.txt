These regulations define key terms for section 21.1 of the Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act, specifying that "revenues generated by the supply of advertising services directed at the Canadian market" refer to paid advertisements placed by Canadian advertisers on a periodical's pages, while "revenues generated by the total supply of advertising services" include all paid advertisements, regardless of target market. The regulations came into force on July 1, 1999.
