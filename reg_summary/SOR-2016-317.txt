These regulations establish comprehensive requirements for railway companies to prevent and control fires on line works, including mandatory fire preparedness and hazard reduction plans, employee training, advance notification of high-risk work in high fire danger areas, and strict record-keeping obligations. They apply regardless of the cause of a fire and require immediate action by railway companies to notify fire services and assist in fire suppression when needed.
