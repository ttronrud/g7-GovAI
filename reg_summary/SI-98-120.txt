This regulation establishes the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which came into force on November 1, 1998, allowing residents of both countries to access social security benefits (such as pensions, survivor benefits, and invalidity benefits) under the laws of either country, with periods of residence or contribution being totaled to determine eligibility. Benefits are paid without reduction due to residency in the other country, and the competent authorities are required to cooperate through information sharing and administrative arrangements to ensure proper implementation.
