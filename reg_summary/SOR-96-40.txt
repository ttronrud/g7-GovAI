The Ships’ Stores Regulations, enacted under the Customs Tariff and Excise Tax Act, define and regulate the types and quantities of goods that may be carried on board various types of ships and aircraft operating in Canada, including those engaged in international trade, fishing, military operations, and coasting voyages. These regulations establish specific allowances for alcohol, tobacco, food, and fuel, with restrictions based on the vessel or aircraft type, duration of voyage, and compliance with reporting requirements.
