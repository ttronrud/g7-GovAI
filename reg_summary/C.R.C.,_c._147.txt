These regulations establish the British Columbia Tree Fruit Pooling Regulations, authorizing B.C. Tree Fruits Limited (the Agency) to pool and distribute proceeds from the sale of regulated tree fruits grown in a defined area, with distributions based on the amount, variety, size, grade, and class of fruit delivered. The Agency operates under the oversight of three designated pooling committees—specifically for apples/crabapples, other tree fruits, and both—each composed of members appointed by the British Columbia Fruit Growers’ Association, the Okanagan Federated Shippers’ Association, and the Agency, with voting rules and quorum requirements defined.
