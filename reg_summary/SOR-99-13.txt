This regulation establishes a list of exempt activities and developments in the Mackenzie Valley that do not require environmental screening or permits under the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act, primarily because their environmental impact is deemed insignificant. It covers a wide range of activities, including minor construction, modifications, maintenance, and certain types of infrastructure, as long as they meet specific criteria such as distance from water bodies, no waste disposal, and no significant changes to land use or environment.
