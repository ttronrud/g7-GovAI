This regulation establishes a remission program to refund certain amounts paid under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) or Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB) to individuals who were not eligible for those payments but would have qualified for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) during the same period, under specific eligibility conditions and deadlines. The remitted amount equals the amount of the ineligible benefit paid, but is capped at the CESB amount the individual would have received.
