The Governor in Council has enacted the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Petroleum Operations Framework Regulations, following consultation and public review, to establish safety, environmental, and operational standards for petroleum activities in the offshore area. The regulations define key terms, mandate safety and environmental management systems for operators, and require qualified personnel, proper training, and reporting of incidents to protect lives, the environment, and petroleum resources.
