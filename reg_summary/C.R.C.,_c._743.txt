This regulation grants remission of customs duties and sales tax on ballet shoes (pointe or block toe shoes) imported between July 1, 1970, and June 30, 1988, for use by students at designated dance schools and professional dancers at recognized Canadian ballet companies. The sales tax remission equals the difference between tax calculated on the duty-paid value and the value for duty.
