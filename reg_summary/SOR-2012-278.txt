These guidelines, issued by the Minister of Finance under the Bank Act, establish criteria for determining whether an acquisition would result in a person having "control" of a federal credit union, as defined in section 377.2 of the Act, with a focus on preserving cooperative governance, transparency, and financial stability while allowing appropriate investor influence. The determination considers factors such as ownership structure, relationships, board control, and potential conflicts of interest.
