The Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories adopted the Criminal Procedure Rules in 1998 to govern criminal proceedings, ensuring fair, efficient, and accessible procedures that align with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The rules establish clear guidelines for service of documents, notice of motion, hearings, trials, and applications, including provisions for adjournments, changes of venue, and release of accused persons, while allowing flexibility and liberal interpretation to promote justice and reduce delay.
