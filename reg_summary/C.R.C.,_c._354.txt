These regulations establish rules for preventing pollution in Arctic waters by governing the deposit of domestic and industrial waste on land and by ships, including requirements for authorization, reporting of violations, and financial liability limits for operators and shipowners. They also define specific liability caps based on the type of operation and include provisions for financial responsibility, such as insurance requirements for ships navigating in designated Arctic zones.
