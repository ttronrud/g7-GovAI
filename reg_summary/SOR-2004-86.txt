These regulations establish zoning restrictions around the Edmonton Garrison Heliport to ensure safe aviation operations by limiting construction, land use, and natural features that could interfere with aircraft takeoff and landing, particularly by preventing structures or objects from exceeding approach surfaces and restricting activities like landfills, garbage disposal, and sewage lagoons in designated bird hazard areas. Exceptions are allowed for small, temporary open water reservoirs if bird hazards are minimized and approved by the appropriate authorities.
