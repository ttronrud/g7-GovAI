The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has revoked the previous National Parks Game Regulations and replaced them with the National Parks Wildlife Regulations, which apply to all Canadian national parks except Wood Buffalo National Park. These regulations prohibit hunting, disturbing, or possessing wildlife in most parks, impose strict rules on firearm and trap use, and allow limited exceptions for specific purposes such as scientific management, hunting in the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, or transport under certain conditions.
