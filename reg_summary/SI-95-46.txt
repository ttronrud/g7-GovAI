On April 1, 1995, the Canadian Coast Guard (excluding specific directorates and branches) was transferred from the Department of Transport to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This transfer involved the control and supervision of the Canadian Coast Guard's operations, except for the Harbours and Ports and Ship Inspection directorates and their regional branches.
