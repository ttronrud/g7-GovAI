This regulation grants customs duty remissions to specified tailored collar shirt manufacturers for shirts imported into Canada between July 1, 1997, and December 31, 2012, with the amount of remission decreasing over time—from full remission in 1997 to 25% in 2008 and 50% or 75% in subsequent years—subject to conditions and caps based on prior remissions under the 1988 order. The remission is limited to claims made within five years of import and applies only to shirts meeting the defined description of a tailored collar shirt under heading 62.05.
