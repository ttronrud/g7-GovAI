The Romania Claims Fund Regulations establish a special account in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to hold proceeds from Romanian property seized during World War II, and authorize payments up to $40,000 to individuals recommended by the Foreign Claims Commission, as well as pro rata payments to bondholders who notified the government by December 14, 1971. Payments are subject to specific conditions, including bond surrender by December 31, 1972, and a transfer of half the Commission’s estimated expenses to the Foreign Claims Fund.
