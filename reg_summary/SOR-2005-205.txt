These regulations establish the rules for snaring snowshoe hares in Gros Morne National Park of Canada, limiting snaring to eligible residents of designated communities, requiring permits, and setting strict conditions to protect the species and ecological integrity of the park. Snare permits are issued based on eligibility and seasonal management decisions by the superintendent, with penalties for violations and a review process available for permit denials or suspensions.
