These regulations establish eligibility and payment conditions for a pre-retirement benefit for footwear and tanning industry workers in Canada who are laid off due to import competition, requiring certification by the Enterprise Development Board and meeting specific criteria such as age, employment history, and job prospects. The benefit is capped at 66⅔% of the employee’s average weekly insurable earnings and is adjusted annually for inflation, with payments suspended during certification reviews or if the employee finds employment with insufficient earnings.
