This regulation revokes previous rules on school fees and transportation costs for children of certain government employees and establishes new guidelines, allowing the Minister to provide financial assistance for school fees and transportation for children of non-taxable employees residing on federal land, with specific conditions and reporting requirements. Payments are limited to cases where the employee is not subject to municipal taxation and only for schools within a specified distance or when transportation costs exceed a set threshold.
