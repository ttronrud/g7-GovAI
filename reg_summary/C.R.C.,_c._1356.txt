These regulations establish the terms for transferring pension benefits from the former Atomic Energy of Canada Limited pension plan to the Public Service Superannuation Act, including the payment of annuities and ex-gratia benefits to eligible pensioners, and provide for the crediting of pensionable service to employees who were previously covered under the old plan. They also outline the Company’s obligations to pay into the Superannuation Account certain amounts, including interest and contributions based on service periods and salaries, and allow employees to elect to pay for unused service periods.
