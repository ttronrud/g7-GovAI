These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Baker Lake Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure or object whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all of which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria. The regulations apply to lands adjacent to the airport and are based on the approved zoning plan, ensuring safe aviation operations by limiting obstructions near the runway and airport reference point.
