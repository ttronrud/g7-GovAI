This regulation revokes the previous Saskatoon Airport Zoning Regulations and establishes new zoning rules to control land use around Saskatoon Airport, setting elevation limits for buildings and structures to ensure aviation safety. These limits are defined by specific surfaces—approach, transitional, and outer surfaces—based on runway configurations and distances, with strict prohibitions on structures exceeding these surfaces or on using land for bird-attractive waste disposal.
