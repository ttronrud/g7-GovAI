This regulation grants a tax remission to eligible members of the Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association who paid annual maintenance fees between October 1, 1992, and January 31, 1999, provided they meet specific criteria and submit a timely application to the Minister of National Revenue. The remission applies only if the fees were not previously refunded or credited under the Excise Tax Act or the Financial Administration Act.
