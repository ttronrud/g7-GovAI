These Regulations establish the requirements for issuing certificates of fitness for offshore oil and gas installations, including drilling, production, accommodation, and diving facilities, ensuring they are safe, environmentally sound, and compliant with applicable safety and operational standards. A certifying authority may issue such a certificate only if the installation meets specific design, construction, safety, and maintenance criteria, and the certificate remains valid for up to five years unless determined otherwise based on ongoing compliance and inspections.
