These Yukon Territory Fishery Regulations establish rules for fishing activities, including definitions of key terms such as angling, commercial and domestic fishing, and sport fishing, and set limits on gear, catch, and locations. They require licenses for most fishing activities, provide exemptions for youth and beneficiaries, and impose specific restrictions on salmon fishing in the Yukon River and its tributaries, including seasonal closures and gear limits.
