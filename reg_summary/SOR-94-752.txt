This regulation, known as the Alberta Equivalency Order, declares that specific provisions of Canadian Environmental Protection Act regulations relating to vinyl chloride, secondary lead smelter releases, dioxins and furans from pulp and paper mills, and certain defoamer and wood chip regulations do not apply in Alberta, as Alberta already has equivalent environmental protections in place. The order was made under the authority of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and is effective upon registration.
