The Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench has enacted detailed rules governing criminal proceedings, including procedures for filings, service of documents, briefs, motions, and pre-trial conferences, with a focus on fairness, efficiency, and simplicity. These rules ensure consistent application of the Criminal Code, provide clear formatting and time limits, and allow for judicial discretion in exceptional circumstances.
