The Investment Canada Regulations, made effective June 30, 1985, establish the framework for assessing foreign investments in Canada, defining key terms such as fair market value, equity securities, and enterprise value, and outlining how the value of assets is determined based on financial statements and market conditions. They specify requirements for notices and applications filed by non-Canadian investors, including the information to be included and the responsibility of the signatory to ensure accuracy and completeness.
