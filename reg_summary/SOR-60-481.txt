This regulation grants the Quebec Apple Growers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of apples grown in Quebec, allowing it to exercise the same powers it has for local marketing—except for specific obligations outlined in the Plan—while maintaining its jurisdiction over persons and property within the province. The Order is based on the Agricultural Products Marketing Act and implements the Board’s approved joint marketing plan.
