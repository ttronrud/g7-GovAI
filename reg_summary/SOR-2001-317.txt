This regulation establishes the requirements for reporting suspicious financial transactions or attempts under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, mandating that financial entities report specific details about transactions to the Centre when there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion. Reports must include detailed information about parties involved, transaction specifics, and identities, and must be submitted electronically when possible, with copies retained for at least five years.  

*Note: Many definitions and provisions in the regulation have been repealed or amended, including references to outdated terms like "accountant" or "money services business," and the regulation is now largely superseded by updated legislation.*
