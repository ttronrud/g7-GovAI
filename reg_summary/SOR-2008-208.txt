These regulations exempt employment at mines on the Donkin coal block from certain provisions of the Canada Labour Code, while incorporating applicable Nova Scotia labour and safety laws—subject to specific adaptations—into the regulation of mine employment. The regulations come into force upon registration and include provisions on leave, human rights, and the scope of application to provincial and employee entities.
