This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories' South Slave Region from disposal to support the negotiation and conclusion of Aboriginal land agreements, with the withdrawal effective from the date of the order until November 30, 2014. The withdrawal specifically includes surface and subsurface rights, but excludes mineral claims, leases, and licenses issued before the order's date that relate to pre-existing exploration or recorded claims.
