These regulations, made under the Corporations Returns Act, define how corporations calculate gross revenue and assets for reporting purposes, set prescribed thresholds (e.g., $200 million for revenue, $600 million for assets), provide exemptions for certain corporations that file financial statements or tax returns under other acts, and specify the format and fees for corporate returns and inspections. The regulations come into force upon registration.
