This regulation establishes rules for water and sewer connections, usage, and charges in national parks, requiring owners to obtain written permission from the superintendent to connect to or install water or sewer systems, and setting out formulas and fees based on lot size, usage, and system costs. It also defines key terms such as lot, unit, volume value, and base factor, and applies specific rules to certain parks like Banff and Jasper, while prohibiting unauthorized connections, tampering with systems, and certain activities in designated water areas.
