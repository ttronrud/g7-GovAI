These Regulations establish the conditions under which duty refunds and drawbacks can be granted for imported goods that are subsequently exported, processed in Canada, or used in the processing of exported goods, with specific rules on eligibility, timing, and classification of goods. They also set out exemptions and restrictions, such as prohibitions on drawbacks for certain types of goods (e.g., spirits, beer, or goods in Schedule III) and require that goods be processed or exported within two years of release.
