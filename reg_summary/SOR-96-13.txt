The Government of Canada repealed the old Public Lands Mineral Regulations and introduced new regulations governing the leasing of mineral rights on certain public lands, allowing the Minister of Natural Resources to grant exclusive rights to search for and extract specified minerals, subject to tender processes, minimum rental payments, and specific conditions related to operations, royalties, and lease termination. Leases are for a 10-year term and may be renewed if production remains commercially viable, with provisions for consolidation of interests and strict compliance with environmental and legal requirements.
