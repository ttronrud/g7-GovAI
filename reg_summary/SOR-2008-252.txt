This regulation establishes the procedures for dividing a judge’s annuity benefits between the judge and their spouse, former spouse, or former common-law partner, including requirements for applications, documentation, valuation, and payment. It outlines the role of the annuity administrator, the conditions under which a division can be approved, and the rules governing the timing, interest, and valuation of the benefits, with specific provisions for applications after a judge’s death or in cases of administrative errors.
