This regulation exempts certain health information custodians in Ontario from Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) when handling personal health information, as those custodians are already governed by the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004. The Order comes into force on the day it is registered.
