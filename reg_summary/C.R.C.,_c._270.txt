This regulation establishes a levy system under the Saskatchewan Egg Marketing Levies Order, requiring egg producers to pay $0.0125 per layer per three-month period (January, April, July, or October) as long as the layer is available for production and within their allocated quota. No levy is charged for layers that replace previously levied layers, and payments must be made by the 15th day of the month following the period’s start.
