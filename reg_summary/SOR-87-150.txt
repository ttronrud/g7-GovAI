These Regulations establish minimum qualification standards for locomotive engineers, transfer hostlers, conductors, and yard foremen in Canadian railways, requiring candidates to pass classroom exams and on-job training with a minimum overall mark of 80% to qualify, and mandating regular re-examinations and training program reporting to ensure safety and competency. Railway companies must maintain training records, provide training programs in consultation with unions, and file detailed reports on training activities and outcomes.
