These regulations establish strict conditions under which insurance entities can invest in or acquire control of permitted infrastructure entities, requiring that such entities involve a public body and limiting investments to ensure alignment with long-term liabilities. They also impose caps on the total value of such investments relative to an insurer’s regulatory capital, with specific restrictions on further investments, loans, or guarantees if the threshold is exceeded.
