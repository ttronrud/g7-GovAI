This regulation, known as the Syncrude Remission Order, grants tax remission to participants in the Syncrude Project for royalties, tax, rental, or levy amounts related to the recovery or disposal of synthetic crude oil from Leases 17 and 22, but only up to the point when 2.1 billion barrels are recovered or December 31, 2003, whichever occurs first, and only if certain fiscal conditions are met.
