This regulation authorizes the Minister of National Defence to make one-time ex gratia payments of $24,000 to eligible veterans who voluntarily participated in chemical warfare agent testing between 1940 and 1974, or to their eligible beneficiaries if the veteran has passed away, with payments capped at March 31, 2007 and not constituting an admission of liability. The payments do not apply to veterans who have already received compensation under the Chemical Warfare Agent Testing Recognition Program.
