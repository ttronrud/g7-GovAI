This regulation repeals an earlier order and establishes a new withdrawal from disposal of approximately 7,337 square kilometers of land on the East Arm of Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, to create a proposed national park. The lands are withdrawn from disposal for conservation purposes, while existing mineral claims, rights, and permits remain unaffected.
