These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Fort McPherson Airport in the Northwest Territories, limiting the height of any structure or natural growth near the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, with specific elevation limits defined by approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. The regulations apply to all land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, and any exceedance of these height limits requires removal by the landowner.
