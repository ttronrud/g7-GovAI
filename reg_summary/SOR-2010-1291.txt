This regulation defines key financial institutions—banks, insurers, and securities dealers—under the Excise Tax Act, specifies their eligibility as "qualifying institutions," and sets prescribed amounts and percentages for tax purposes, including a $500,000 threshold and respective rate thresholds of 12% for banks, 10% for insurers, and 15% for securities dealers. It also confirms the regulatory authority and publication requirements for the Input Tax Credit Allocation Methods (GST/HST) Regulations.
