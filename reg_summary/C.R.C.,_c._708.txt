These Regulations establish the procedures for claims against the Investors’ Indemnity Account, requiring all claims for losses related to unpaid or unfulfilled securities purchases to be submitted to the Minister of Finance, investigated, and approved before payment—subject to a maximum of $5,000 unless approved by the Treasury Board. Payments are only made if the claimant assigns their rights to Her Majesty, and an annual report on payments and recoveries must be submitted to the Treasury Board.
