This regulation establishes the form and requirements for a company to submit a Notice of Objection to an assessment under section 26 of the Northern Pipeline Act, including the need to send two signed copies by registered mail within 30 days of receiving the assessment notice. Each objection must be submitted separately, though identical facts and reasons can be consolidated if applicable.
