This proclamation, issued by the Governor in Council on September 27, 2013, declares a new electoral boundaries order for Canada, effective on the first dissolution of Parliament at least seven months after the proclamation, as required by the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. It establishes specific electoral districts for each province, with detailed geographic descriptions and population figures based on the 2011 census, particularly for Newfoundland and Labrador.
