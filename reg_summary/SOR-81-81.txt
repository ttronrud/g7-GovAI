These regulations establish the framework for determining and paying Canadian claims against the Government of Cuba and its citizens from the Foreign Claims Fund, limiting eligibility to Canadian citizens (or corporations substantially owned by them) who were citizens from the time a claim arose until November 7, 1980, and capping individual awards at $1 million. Awards are made only after claims are properly submitted and reviewed by the Foreign Claims Commission, with payments drawn from funds received from Cuba under a 1980 agreement, and payments made in full or in part if funds are insufficient.
