The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, revoked outdated export quota regulations for Canadian aged cheddar cheese to the European Economic Community and replaced them with new rules effective January 1, 1991, which establish a more flexible system for allocating export entitlements based on utilization, with adjustments for increases, decreases, non-utilization, and compliance, and allow for limited allocation to non-eligible exporters if quotas remain unused.
