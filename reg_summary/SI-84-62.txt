This regulation designates specific public lands in Ontario’s Long Point National Wildlife Area for wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation, and assigns administrative control of these lands to the Minister of the Environment under the Canada Wildlife Act. The lands are precisely described in a legal survey and include adjacent areas outside original survey lines, with a strip along Lake Erie and Long Point Bay reserved for fishing and public access.
