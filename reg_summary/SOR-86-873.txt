These Regulations establish the requirements for reporting imported goods to Canadian customs, specifying when and how goods must be reported—either electronically, orally, or in writing—based on the mode of transport (air, water, or land), type of goods, and the circumstances of arrival. They define key terms and provide exemptions for certain goods, such as those in the possession of arriving passengers or crew, or those transported by specific vessels under certain conditions.
