These regulations establish the requirements for accounting for imported goods and paying duties in Canada, mandating electronic submission of accounts for most commercial goods, with exceptions for certain types of goods, casual imports, and mail. They also outline conditions under which goods can be released prior to full accounting or duty payment, including for couriers and low-value shipments, and specify timelines for duty payments. 

*(Note: The regulation has been repealed by SOR/2018-121, s. 2.)*
