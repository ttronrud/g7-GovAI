The Canadian Cultural Property Export Control List identifies and restricts the export of culturally significant objects from Canada, including archaeological items, Aboriginal artifacts, paleontological specimens, ethnographic materials, applied and decorative art, fine art, and scientific instruments, based on age, origin, value, and cultural relevance. These restrictions apply to objects 50 years or older made by individuals who are no longer living, with specific thresholds for value and provenance to determine export eligibility.
