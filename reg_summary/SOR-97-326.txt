These regulations exempt certain Chilean goods that meet origin criteria under the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement from anti-dumping measures, effective on January 1, 2003 or when the tariff for such goods becomes free under the CCFTA, whichever comes first. The regulations came into force on the date section 89 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act was enacted.
