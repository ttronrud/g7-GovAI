This regulation establishes egg marketing levies in Ontario, requiring producers to pay $0.05 per dozen of eggs sold and an additional $0.35 per dozen sold beyond their allocated quota. Egg grading station operators must deduct and remit these levies, and producers must pay any unpaid levies within 15 days of the following month.
