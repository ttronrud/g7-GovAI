This proclamation designates July 28 each year as "A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval" to honor and remember the Acadian people's suffering during the 18th-century deportation, without acknowledging legal or financial responsibility by the Crown. It was issued by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson in 2004, effective from 2005, as part of Canada's recognition of this dark chapter in its history.
