The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) has established a by-law defining eligible financial contracts involving federal member institutions, specifying that such contracts must include provisions allowing the application of specific deposit insurance provisions if actions are taken by parties other than certain designated entities. The by-law comes into force upon registration and applies to contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2023 or 2024, or those linked to other contracts within the prescribed class.
