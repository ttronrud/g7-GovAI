Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the **Tetrachloroethylene (Use in Dry Cleaning and Reporting Requirements) Regulations**, as published under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), effective August 18, 2001, and formally enacted by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Tetrachloroethylene (Use in Dry Cleaning and Reporting Requirements) Regulations**

### 🔍 **Background and Legislative Basis**
- These regulations were developed under **section 93 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**.
- The **Minister of the Environment** initially proposed the regulations and provided public notice in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **August 18, 2001**, allowing stakeholders to submit comments or file objections.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was consulted as required by section 93(3).
- The **Governor in Council** concluded that the proposed regulations:
  - Do **not conflict** with other federal environmental or health legislation.
  - Provide **sufficient protection** to human health and the environment.
- Therefore, the regulations were formally adopted under **section 93(1)** of CEPA 1999.

## 📌 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Refrigerated condenser** | A closed system using mechanical refrigeration to cool tetrachloroethylene vapour into a liquid for reuse in dry-cleaning machines. |
| **Residue** | Any solid, liquid, or sludge waste containing tetrachloroethylene (excluding wastewater), produced at a dry-cleaning facility. |
| **Spotting agent** | A substance or mixture applied directly to stains to remove them from textiles, rugs, furs, leathers, etc. |
| **Waste management facility** | A facility authorized to handle, recycle, or dispose of tetrachloroethylene, wastewater, and residue. |
| **Wastewater** | Wastewater containing tetrachloroethylene generated by dry-cleaning machines or carbon adsorber regeneration. |

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Uses and Restrictions

### 1. **Spotting Agents**
- **No commercial or institutional use** of spotting agents containing tetrachloroethylene is permitted.

### 2. **Dry-Cleaning Machine Requirements**
To legally use tetrachloroethylene for dry cleaning, a machine must meet **all of the following criteria**:

| Requirement | Details |
|-----------|--------|
| **Closed Storage** | Tetrachloroethylene, wastewater, and residue must be stored in **closed containers** at all times (except during operation or maintenance). |
| **Same Drum Use** | The machine must use the **same drum** for washing, extraction, drying, and aeration cycles. |
| **Integral Refrigerated Condenser** | Must have a refrigerated condenser that recovers vapour from the drum and reuses it. |
| **No Atmospheric Venting** | Must prevent venting of tetrachloroethylene vapours during any phase (washing, extraction, drying, aeration). |
| **Integral Water Separator** | Must have a built-in tetrachloroethylene-water separator to recover solvent from wastewater. |
| **Efficiency Rating** | Must have a manufacturer’s design rating of **≤10 kg or 6.2 L of tetrachloroethylene per 1000 kg of clothing cleaned** — or was installed or in use **before August 1, 2003**. |
| **Secondary Containment** | Facility must have a **tetrachloroethylene-impermeable secondary containment system** that: <br> - Covers at least the entire surface under each machine, tank, or container; <br> - Can hold **at least 110% of the capacity** of the largest container within the system. |
| **Tetrachloroethylene-Resistant Drain Plugs** | Must have readily available, leak-proof drain plugs to seal floor drains in case of spill. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Paragraph 5(e) (prohibiting self-service dry-cleaning machines) came into force on **August 1, 2003**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Sections 3, paragraphs 5(a)–(c), (f), and sections 8–16 came into force on **January 1, 2004**.

## 🚚 Waste Management Requirements

### 1. **Wastewater Handling**
The owner/operator must either:
- **Transport wastewater** to a **waste management facility at least once every 12 months**, OR
- **Treat wastewater on-site** using a full treatment system that includes:
  - A **second tetrachloroethylene-water separator** to recover solvent.
  - An **initial activated carbon filter** to remove tetrachloroethylene.
  - A **monitor-alarm system** that automatically shuts down the system when the initial filter becomes saturated.
  - A **second activated carbon filter** to further purify the water after the first filter.

> ✅ When transporting wastewater, **all wastewater present in the facility at the time of transport** must be moved — even if not yet treated.

---

### 2. **Residue Handling**
- All **residue** must be transported to a **waste management facility at least once every 12 months**.
- All residue present in the facility at the time of transport must be removed.

> ⚠️ *Note: This provision was amended in 2011 (SOR/2011-216, s. 9) — the specific reporting requirement for residue is now fully in place.*

---

## 🔁 Transfer and Handling of Tetrachloroethylene

- **No direct transfer** of tetrachloroethylene into a dry-cleaning machine, tank, or container is allowed **unless**:
  - A **closed direct-coupled delivery system** is used — which prevents any release of vapours during transfer.

---

## 📝 Reporting and Recordkeeping Obligations

All persons involved in the use, import, recycling, or sale of tetrachloroethylene must maintain records and submit annual reports to the **Minister of the Environment** by **April 30 of the following calendar year**.
