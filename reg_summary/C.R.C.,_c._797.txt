This regulation grants a remission of sales tax on certain machinery goods where customs duties have been previously remitted, specifically for tariff items listed in Schedule II to the Customs Tariff, and the remission equals the difference between the original sales tax and the sales tax that would apply if the duty remitted value had been used to calculate the tax. The remission applies to goods released under the Customs Act on or after November 5, 1980.
