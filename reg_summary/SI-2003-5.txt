This regulation proclaims the entry into force of the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Czech Republic on January 1, 2003, establishing rules for the mutual recognition and calculation of social security benefits, including old age, disability, and survivor benefits, based on creditable periods of residence or contributions. It ensures that eligible individuals, regardless of where they reside, receive benefits without reduction due to cross-border residency and outlines procedures for eligibility, benefit calculations, and cooperation between the two countries’ social security authorities.
