The Online News Act Application and Exemption Regulations establish criteria for determining when a significant bargaining power imbalance exists between digital news intermediaries and news businesses, particularly those with annual revenues over $1 billion or that serve at least 20 million users/month. They also set out detailed requirements for operators seeking exemptions from compensation obligations, including open call processes, fair compensation standards, and specific rules on monetary and non-monetary contributions to support local news, journalistic independence, and marketplace sustainability.
