These Regulations establish the rules for calculating and adjusting pensions for Defence Services personnel who continue serving after receiving a pension, including provisions for counting augmenting service, repayment of pension or gratuity amounts, and pension computations based on the total pensionable term. They also define key terms, outline conditions under which service can be counted, and specify how pensions are adjusted based on service length and type, with limits on pension amounts and special rules for widows and children.
