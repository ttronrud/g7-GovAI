These regulations govern the transfer of official mementos—items of distinct Canadian character and manufacture, such as arts and crafts or military-related items—to foreign dignitaries, military representatives, or visiting officials in recognition of hospitality or professional support. Transfers are approved by the Minister, Chief of the Defence Staff, or a designated officer, with restrictions: the Chief of the Defence Staff cannot approve transfers exceeding $200, and designated officers cannot approve those exceeding $75.
