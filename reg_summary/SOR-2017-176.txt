These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" — goods not imported for sale or industrial use — under the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), stating that such goods originate in an EU country or CETA beneficiary if they are marked accordingly or lack any indication of origin. The regulations come into force on the date section 97 of the CETA Implementation Act takes effect, or upon registration if later.
