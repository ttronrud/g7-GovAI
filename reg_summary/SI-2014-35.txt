This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories—specifically in the South Slave and North Slave regions—from disposal for two years to support the resolution of Aboriginal land and resource agreements, while excluding specific land uses and mineral claims that were already in place or authorized prior to the Order. It also repeals provisions related to specific parcels of land and subsurface rights previously agreed upon with the Akaitcho Dene First Nations and other stakeholders.
