This regulation grants remission of excise taxes on certain Canadian-produced goods (such as cigars, cigarettes, tobaccos, and wines) and imported goods purchased or brought into Canada by diplomatic representatives for personal or official use, provided the goods are not sold or disposed of within one year of acquisition. Remission is not granted if the representative's home government does not offer reciprocal treatment to Canadian officials.
