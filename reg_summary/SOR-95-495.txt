These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Stratford Municipal Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations by limiting the height of buildings, structures, and natural growth near the airport, defining specific surfaces (approach, outer, and transitional) that must not be exceeded, and applying to all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport. Any development or growth that interferes with aircraft signals or communications is prohibited.
