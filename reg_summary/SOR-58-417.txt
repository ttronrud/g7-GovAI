These regulations, effective 1 July 1958, establish rules for increasing certain public service pensions in Canada, with increases based on service periods and capped by specified limits in Schedule B, ensuring no pension exceeds a defined maximum rate. Increases are applied only under specific conditions, such as pension eligibility, service length, and total pension amounts, with special provisions for widows, children, and multiple pensions.
