These Ontario regulations establish a service charge on the interprovincial and export marketing of greenhouse vegetables—specifically tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce—requiring producers to pay $0.005 per pound for tomatoes, $0.05 per dozen for long, seedless cucumbers, and $0.025 per dozen for other cucumbers. The charge is collected by the Commodity Board either directly from sales through the Board or from shippers, who must remit it within 21 days of receiving the product.
