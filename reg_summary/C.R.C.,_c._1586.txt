These regulations allow certain public service contributors who served in a "special force" to count that service as pensionable service under the Public Service Superannuation Act, as if it were active service during World War II, provided the election is made in writing within one year of becoming a contributor and while still employed. However, contributors who were on leave of absence to enlist in the special force are treated as having been absent on active service during WWII under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.
