This regulation transfers specific powers and duties from the Minister of Finance to the Minister of National Health and Welfare and the Minister of Employment and Immigration, enabling them to make special adjustment payments to provinces based on proportional entitlements related to insured health services and post-secondary education financing. The payments are calculated to reflect the same proportions as the provinces' entitlements under the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.
