The Life Saving Equipment Regulations establish minimum requirements for life-saving equipment on Canadian ships, including lifeboats, life rafts, personal flotation devices, and communication devices, based on the ship's class, size, and type of voyage. These requirements are tailored to different ship categories and voyage types, with provisions allowing for substitutions (e.g., marine evacuation systems for life rafts) and exemptions for smaller or specific vessels like fishing boats and pleasure craft.
