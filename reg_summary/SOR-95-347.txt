These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Tuktoyaktuk Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all of which are defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria based on the airport’s runway and surrounding area. The regulations apply to all land adjacent to or near the airport, as outlined in the zoning plan, to ensure safe aircraft operations.
