This 1982 Canadian regulatory order revokes an earlier duty remission rule and grants a customs duty remission for goods imported between March 30, 1980, and December 31, 1987, used in manufacturing satellites and satellite subsystems for export, provided a claim is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within three years of importation. The remission applies to goods not classified under tariff items 42700-1 and 42701-1.
