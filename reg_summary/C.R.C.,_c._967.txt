These regulations allow the Board to provide insurance up to 99% of loans—limited to $30 million total—for private lenders who financed the leasing of computer products made by Consolidated Computer Inc. The insurance payout to lenders, if a loan is repaid early, is capped at the lesser of the insurance amount in effect at the time of demand or 99% of the lender’s loss.
