This regulation establishes a Supplementary Agreement between Canada and the Republic of the Philippines to expand the social security agreement to include the Philippine Government Service Insurance System, amending definitions and provisions related to creditable periods, eligibility, and benefit payments, and setting the agreement in force on July 1, 2001. It ensures that individuals who meet certain contribution and residency criteria can receive benefits under the social security systems of both countries, including for events occurring before July 1, 2001, while also addressing issues such as currency controls and the treatment of previously paid lump-sum benefits.
