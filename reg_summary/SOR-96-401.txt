These regulations establish zoning restrictions around Trenton Airport to ensure aviation safety by limiting construction and land use near the airport, particularly within defined approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. No structures or natural features may exceed the elevation of these surfaces, and certain hazardous land uses—like landfills or sewage lagoons—are prohibited to minimize bird hazards and protect flight operations.
