These Seeds Regulations define key terms related to seed classification, certification, and standards in Canada, including pedigreed status (foundation, registered, certified), grading requirements, and exemptions for certain seeds such as those used in research, export, or for producing pedigreed seed. They also establish minimum standards for seed purity, germination, and weed content, with specific allowances for noxious weed seeds in certain grades and varieties.
