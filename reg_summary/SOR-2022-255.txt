The Social Security Tribunal Regulations, 2022 establish procedures for challenging the constitutionality of social security legislation, requiring parties to file detailed notices with specific facts and legal arguments, and setting rules for hearings that can be conducted in writing, by teleconference, or in person—subject to flexibility based on practical or safety concerns. The regulations also allow for private hearings when public disclosure poses serious risks to individuals or public security.
