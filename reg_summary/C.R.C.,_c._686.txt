This regulation authorizes the Minister of National Defence to loan clothing and equipment to Cadet Officers and Cadets from Caribbean countries visiting Canada under exchange programs, allowing them to retain certain items either free of charge (for hygienic reasons) or at 50% of cost price (if the items would otherwise be sold to Canadian Forces members).
