These regulations establish height and land-use restrictions around Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport to ensure aviation safety by preventing structures, natural growth, or activities that could interfere with aircraft operations or communications. Specifically, no building or object may exceed designated surfaces such as take-off/approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, and no activities are permitted in bird hazard zones that attract birds posing a risk to aviation safety.
