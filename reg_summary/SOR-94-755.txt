These regulations define a "small cable transmission system" as a cable system that transmits signals to 2,000 or fewer premises within the same service area, with specific rules on how systems are grouped if they are owned or controlled by the same entity and serve contiguous areas. The definition excludes master antenna systems located within service areas of larger cable systems.
