This regulation directs the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to reserve at least one channel on cable transmission facilities in provinces where a provincial authority has requested such a reservation for educational broadcasting, provided the authority demonstrates intent to use the facilities within a reasonable time. The reserved channel must broadcast programming specifically designed to support learning, including continuity of education and information on courses or special education events, and must be distinct from general public or private broadcasting.
