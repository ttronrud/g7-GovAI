This regulation revokes a previous directive and establishes a new one prohibiting the issuance or renewal of broadcasting licences to Her Majesty in right of any province, their agents, and municipal governments, except in specific cases where the Commission determines that a licence would serve the public interest and allow for diverse public expression. The rule emphasizes that such exceptions must involve community programming that provides a reasonable opportunity for public discourse.
