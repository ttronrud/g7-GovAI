This regulation rescinds a previous order that had stayed the abandonment of the Avonlea Subdivision and modifies the original abandonment order to extend its effective date from January 1, 1986, to November 28, 1989, thereby finalizing the decision to abandon the line. The change was made by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport under section 64 of the National Transportation Act, 1987.
