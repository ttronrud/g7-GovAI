These regulations mandate that operators of passenger ships in Canada must carry compulsory liability insurance covering death or personal injury caused by fault or neglect during carriage, with coverage amounts based on passenger capacity (minimum $250,000 per passenger), and require proof of insurance to be carried on board—either in paper or electronic form—unless exempted by technical or practical reasons. The regulations come into force 30 days after publication and apply to most passenger water carriage operations, with specific exclusions for adventure tourism, government activities, and certain non-commercial or emergency transports.
