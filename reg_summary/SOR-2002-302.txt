These regulations establish the rules for making and adjusting fiscal equalization offset payments to the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador under the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord, including interim and final determinations, monthly instalments, and mechanisms for correcting overpayments or outstanding balances. Payments are made in equal monthly instalments, with adjustments required if subsequent determinations show changes to the original amount.
