These Regulations establish the conditions under which loans for fisheries-related activities—such as purchasing or constructing fishing vessels, equipment, shore installations, or making major repairs—are guaranteed under the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. They define key terms, set maximum loan amounts (up to 90% for vessels, buildings, or shore installations; up to 75% for equipment or major repairs), require borrowers to provide evidence of proper fund use, and outline repayment terms, interest rates, security requirements, and procedures for default and claim submission.
