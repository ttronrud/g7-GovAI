This regulation mandates that Canadian cargo and passenger vessels engaged in international voyages be equipped with Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) equipment that automatically transmits the vessel’s identity, position, and date/time. The equipment must meet specific performance standards, can be switched off under certain conditions with required reporting, and must be properly installed and documented.
