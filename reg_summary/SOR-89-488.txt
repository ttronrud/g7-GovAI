This regulation, issued by the Governor in Council on January 15, 1990, varies National Transportation Agency orders to modify passenger train services in Canada, including discontinuing certain routes (such as Halifax-Saint John and Toronto-London via Stratford) and extending others (like Moncton-Montréal to Moncton-Halifax). It also ensures continuity of key services, such as the Victoria-Nanaimo route, and later adjusts these services in 1994 following the abandonment of the Canadian Atlantic Railway.
