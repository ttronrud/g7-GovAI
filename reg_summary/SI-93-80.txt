This 1993 regulatory order remits certain storage charges paid under the Storage of Goods Regulations for the period September 18, 1986, to September 14, 1988, based on a comparison to what charges would have been if they had started four business days after goods were left at customs. Remission is only granted if a claim is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of the order's issuance.
