This regulation revokes two previous Manitoba vegetable marketing orders and replaces them with a new Manitoba Vegetable Order that grants the Manitoba Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of certain root vegetables, including potatoes, onions, carrots, parsnips, and rutabagas. The Board may impose levies or charges on producers and marketers, classify them into groups, and use the collected funds for operational expenses, reserves, and revenue equalization among producers.
