These regulations establish exceptions under the Copyright Act that allow libraries, archives, and museums to make copies of works for research, private study, or education, with specific requirements for recording and disclosing information about the copies. They also mandate clear notices on photocopiers to inform users about authorized copying and the need for copyright owner authorization for any use beyond fair dealing.
