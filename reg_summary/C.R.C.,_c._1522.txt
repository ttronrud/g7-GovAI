This regulation, now repealed, established the rules for staking, leasing, and permitting coal mining on territorial lands in Nunavut, including definitions of key terms, requirements for staking locations, application procedures, and obligations for lessees and permittees regarding exploration, royalties, and compliance. It set specific limits on location size, required documentation, and financial obligations, while also providing for the renewal of leases and the issuance of permits with defined terms and expiration dates.
