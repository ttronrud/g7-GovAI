This regulation establishes a land registry system for the registration of rights and interests in Category IA and IA-N Cree-Naskapi land and buildings thereon, administered through a central land registry office in Quebec and local offices for each Cree and Naskapi band. It outlines the roles of land registrars, requirements for document submission and approval, the use of CRINA numbers, maintenance of index books and land registry plans, and procedures for inspections and administrative oversight.
