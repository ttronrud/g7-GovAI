These regulations establish the requirements for certifying the origin of goods exported to free trade partners under agreements like NAFTA, CIFTA, and CCFTA, specifying when and how exporters or producers must complete and sign origin certificates, and outline the languages required based on the destination country. The regulations are not subject to publication under the Customs Act because they implement existing free trade agreement provisions without substantive changes.
