This regulation establishes the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Sweden, which enters into force on April 1, 2003, and provides for the mutual recognition of social security benefits, including old-age pensions, survivors' pensions, and disability benefits, for citizens and their dependants residing in either country. It outlines rules for creditable periods, eligibility, benefit calculation, and cross-border cooperation between the two countries' social security authorities, while ensuring benefits are not reduced solely due to residence in the other country.
