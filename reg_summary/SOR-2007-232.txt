These regulations establish the procedures for registering and recording documents affecting Westbank First Nation lands, including definitions of key terms, requirements for applications (in person, by mail, or electronically), and rules on document validity, priority, and public access to land records. They also specify that only certain types of interests—such as those granted to members or on specific parcels—can be registered, and that registered interests have priority over unregistered ones, with specific provisions for mortgages and postponement agreements.
