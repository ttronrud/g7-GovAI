The Government of Canada has determined, based on reasonable grounds, that certain entities linked to terrorism remain listed under the Criminal Code, and has therefore approved their continued inclusion on the list of designated terrorist entities. These entities include Al Qaida, Hamas, Hizballah, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and others.
