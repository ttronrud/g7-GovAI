These regulations establish a framework under the Excise Tax Act allowing members of a closely related group to reduce or offset the excise tax they remit by the amount of a refund or rebate entitled to another member, provided certain conditions are met, including the appointment of a coordinator to file joint applications, directions, and related documents on behalf of the group. The coordinator must file timely applications, maintain accurate records, and ensure tax remittances reflect any applicable offsets, with specific rules governing eligibility, timing, and reporting.
