These regulations establish the rules for former Members of Parliament to elect joint and survivor benefits under the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, including eligibility timelines, requirements for proving marriage and spouse’s age, calculation of benefits based on actuarial values, and provisions for revocation due to erroneous information or changes in benefit status. The benefits are payable starting in the second month after election, with adjustments if the former member becomes disabled or if the marriage ends.
