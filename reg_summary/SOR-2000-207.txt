This regulation establishes exemption and clearance levels for radioactive materials and radiation devices in Canada, allowing certain activities—such as possession, use, or disposal—without a licence if the quantities or concentrations do not exceed defined thresholds. It also outlines specific conditions for exempt activities involving smoke detectors, tritium safety signs, and radium luminous devices, while applying to all nuclear substances and sealed sources except those covered by nuclear security or transport regulations.
