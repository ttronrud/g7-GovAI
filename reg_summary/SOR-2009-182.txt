These regulations establish a framework for funding solvency deficiencies in defined benefit pension plans, allowing plans with a 2008 solvency deficiency or a solvency shortfall to be funded through annual special payments over a maximum of 10 years, with specific requirements for actuarial reporting, beneficiary notification, and approval processes. The funding is designed to meet solvency standards while providing flexibility in payment timing and structure, and it applies to plans that meet certain criteria regarding letter of credit requirements and prior payment obligations.
