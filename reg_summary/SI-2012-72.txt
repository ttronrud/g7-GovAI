This regulation exempts certain personal health information custodians in Newfoundland and Labrador from Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) when handling personal health information, as the Personal Health Information Act (SNL 2008) already governs such activities. The Order comes into force on the day it is registered.
