These regulations specify which individuals and institutions are entitled to receive free copies of the Consolidated Regulations of Canada, 1978, in either hard or soft cover formats, based on their official roles or responsibilities related to legislation, judiciary, or public administration. The delivery is governed by schedules outlining eligible offices and functions, with hard cover copies available to certain senior officials and soft cover copies provided to a broader range of government, judicial, and library personnel, either for official use or upon request.
