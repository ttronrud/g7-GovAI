The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, designates two marine areas in the Beaufort Sea—Darnley Bay/Amundsen Gulf and Kendall Inlet—as the Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam Marine Protected Areas under the Oceans Act, establishing strict protections against activities that harm marine life or habitats, while allowing limited fishing, navigation, dredging for community supply, public safety, and approved scientific, educational, or tourism activities. These activities must follow specific conditions and be approved by the Minister through a detailed activity plan that includes environmental safeguards and reporting requirements.
