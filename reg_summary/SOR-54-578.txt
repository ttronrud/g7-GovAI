This regulation revokes the previous War Claims Regulations and establishes a new set of rules for processing claims related to World War II, including compensation for maltreatment, property losses, and personal injury, with specific priorities, eligibility criteria, and payment conditions. Payments are made from the War Claims Fund with Treasury Board approval, and claims must be filed by November 30, 1954, with special provisions for survivors, prisoners of war, and claims arising from the European and Far Eastern Theatres.
