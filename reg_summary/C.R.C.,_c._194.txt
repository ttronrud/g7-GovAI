The Ontario Fresh Grape Order authorizes the Ontario Fresh Grape Growers' Marketing Board to impose and collect levies or charges on producers and marketers of fresh grapes in Ontario for interprovincial and export trade, with the funds used to cover expenses, losses, and to equalize revenues among producers. These levies are classified by producer groups and may be used to create reserves or adjust income disparities among grape producers.
