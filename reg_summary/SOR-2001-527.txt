The Canada Small Business Financing (Establishment and Operation of Capital Leasing Pilot Project) Regulations establish a framework for capital leasing of equipment to small businesses in Canada, setting criteria for eligible leases (such as lease term, equipment cost, and ownership transfer), defining key terms, and outlining the responsibilities of lessees, lessors, and the Minister of Industry. The Minister provides liability protection for lessors in the event of a lessee’s default, subject to limits and compliance requirements, and the regulations apply only to leases meeting specific financial and operational thresholds.
