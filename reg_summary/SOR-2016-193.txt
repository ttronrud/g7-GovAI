These regulations limit lead and mercury levels in surface coating materials, setting a maximum of 90 mg/kg lead and 10 mg/kg mercury in most products, with exemptions for agricultural, outdoor, and hobby uses. They also require clear, visible warnings on containers if lead exceeds the limit, particularly when used on accessible parts of children’s products or furniture.
