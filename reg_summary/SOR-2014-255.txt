This regulation establishes the rules for apprentice loans in Canada, outlining eligibility criteria, loan conditions, interest suspension periods, and repayment terms, while also defining key terms such as apprenticeship, technical training, and financial assistance. It ensures that eligible apprentices receive loans without immediate repayment obligations for up to 19 months or until specific events occur, such as default or loss of apprenticeship status.
