These regulations establish the Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone (NORDREG Zone) and set out specific reporting requirements for vessels operating within it, including sailing plans, position reports, final reports, and deviation reports. Vessels of certain classes—such as those carrying dangerous goods or pollutants, or those 300 gross tons or larger—must comply with detailed reporting formats that begin with “NORDREG” and include specific designators and information related to safety, navigation, and environmental risks.
