These regulations establish how trust and loan companies must calculate and disclose the cost of borrowing to borrowers, including interest, fees, and other charges, and require clear, standardized disclosure statements in a readable format before or at the time a credit agreement is entered into. The rules apply to loans, lines of credit, and credit cards, with specific requirements for fixed and variable interest rates, periodic updates, and transparency in fees and payment terms.
