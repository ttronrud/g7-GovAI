These Regulations establish the framework for temporary attachments and joint service between the Canadian Forces and armed forces of other countries under Part VI of the Visiting Forces Act, allowing Canadian Forces members and foreign service members to be attached to each other’s forces for training, duty, or transit, with Canadian military statutes applying except for superannuation, pensions, and veterans' benefits. Additionally, when Canadian and foreign forces serve together in the same location, they are deemed to be serving together under these regulations.
