These regulations establish the conditions under which a chief firearms officer may issue authorizations to transport restricted or prohibited firearms, including specific requirements for applications (including telephone submissions), renewal, revocation, and notice delivery, and come into force on December 1, 1998. The authorizations must ensure safety, specify transport details, and include conditions such as a reasonably direct route, with revocation possible if safety risks arise or the holder's licence expires.
