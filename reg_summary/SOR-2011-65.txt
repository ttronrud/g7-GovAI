These regulations, enacted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on March 4, 2011, require analog television licensees to broadcast public service announcements at least six times per broadcast day (increasing to eight times by August 1, 2011 or earlier if ceasing analog broadcasting) and to post key conversion information on their websites, ensuring viewers are informed about the transition from analog to digital television. The rules apply to licensees serving markets with populations of 300,000 or more, including national or provincial capitals, or those broadcasting on channels 52 to 69, and come into force on April 1, 2011.
