This regulation establishes the required information and methods for retail cooperative credit associations to provide complaint-related details to consumers, as outlined in the Cooperative Credit Associations Act. Consumers may contact the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) at its Ottawa office or through its website, and the information must be provided in a brochure, statement of account, or separate document that includes required disclosures about credit arrangements, payments, charges, or borrowing costs.
