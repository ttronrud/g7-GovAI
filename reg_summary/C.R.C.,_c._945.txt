These Income Tax Regulations define key terms such as employee, employer, remuneration, and personal credits, and establish the methodology for calculating tax deductions and withholdings from employee payments, including adjustments for pay periods, personal credits, and various types of income. The rules specify how notional remuneration and tax are determined for employees, particularly in relation to commissions, salary, and gratuities, and outline the process for withholding tax based on estimated income and applicable rates.
