These regulations establish height restrictions for all lands adjacent to Canadian Forces Base Shearwater Airfield in Nova Scotia, limiting structures to the elevation of designated surfaces—primarily a horizontal surface, approach surfaces, and transitional surfaces—described in detail by precise geographic boundaries and bearings. No building or structure may exceed the height of these surfaces, which are designed to ensure aviation safety by maintaining clear airspace around runways and approach paths.
