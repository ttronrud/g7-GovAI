These regulations establish a compensation program for individuals who lost host trees—specifically those of certain genera affected by the Asian Long-horned Beetle—between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019, and who replanted trees to replace them. Compensation is provided at varying rates depending on the location of the lost trees, with maximum payments of $300, $150, or $40 per tree, and applicants must submit detailed documentation and maintain records for three years.
