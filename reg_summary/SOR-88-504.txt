The Governor in Council has authorized Air Canada to amend its articles of incorporation to divide its 329,090 common shares on a 125:1 ratio, resulting in 41,126,125 new common shares, without altering its original purposes or business restrictions. This action is permitted under the Financial Administration Act, as Air Canada is already empowered to make such amendments under the Canada Business Corporations Act.
