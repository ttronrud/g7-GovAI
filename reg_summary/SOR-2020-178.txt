These regulations require rail companies operating controlling locomotives in Canada to install and maintain locomotive voice and video recorder (LVVR) systems that continuously record audio and video data, with strict requirements on data storage, privacy, access, and security. The systems must meet technical standards, include clear signage, ensure data synchronization, and allow for lawful access only in specific accident or incident investigations, while maintaining records for six years and complying with transparency and accountability requirements.
