The Prohibition of Asbestos and Products Containing Asbestos Regulations prohibit the import, sale, and use of processed asbestos fibres and consumer products containing asbestos in greater than trace amounts, with limited exceptions for military equipment, nuclear facilities, museums, scientific research, and chlor-alkali diaphragms under strict conditions, including mandatory reporting and asbestos management plans. These regulations were enacted under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to protect human health and the environment, while allowing for transitional and justified uses.
