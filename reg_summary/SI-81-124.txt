This proclamation announces that the Canada-Australia Income Tax Convention came into force on April 29, 1981, following the mutual notification by both governments that all necessary measures to implement the treaty had been completed. It formally notifies Canadian citizens and authorities of the treaty's entry into force to ensure compliance with its provisions on avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion.
