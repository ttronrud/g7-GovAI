The Pay Equity Regulations implement provisions of the Pay Equity Act to ensure fair compensation for women by comparing and adjusting pay across predominantly female and male job classes, with specific rules on frozen compensation, posting requirements, and methods for calculating pay equity differences, including the use of regression lines and alternative methods when necessary. These regulations also establish requirements for posting notices, accessibility, and the treatment of unionized positions in pay equity analyses.
