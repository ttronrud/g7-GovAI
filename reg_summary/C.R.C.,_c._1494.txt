The Tackle Regulations establish safety standards for ship and shore-based cargo handling operations in Canada, requiring proper equipment, safe access and working conditions, and the use of approved gear to protect workers during loading, unloading, and handling of cargo. They apply to ships and shore equipment involved in cargo operations, with exemptions for small vessels and specific conditions, and mandate compliance with safety measures such as fencing, lighting, life-saving equipment, and proper lifting procedures.
