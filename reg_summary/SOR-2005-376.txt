These regulations define "promotion" under the Public Service Employment Act and specify that a promotion occurs when an employee is assigned to a position with a higher pay rate—either by at least the smallest pay increment (if the position has multiple rates) or by 4% of the previous maximum rate (if it has a single rate)—and clarify that promotions do not include assignments to positions within the same or lower level in the same occupational group. The regulations came into force on the date section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act was enacted.
