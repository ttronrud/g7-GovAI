This regulation repeals the old Nova Scotia Milk Order and replaces it with a new order granting the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial and export trade, including the power to impose and collect levies or charges on milk producers and use those funds for operational expenses, reserves, and loss sharing among producers.
