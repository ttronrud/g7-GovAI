This regulation, now repealed, prescribed certain diagnostic and treatment health care services for excise tax purposes under the Excise Tax Act, specifying that laboratory, radiological, and drug administration services are taxable if provided in a health care facility. It applied to supplies made on or after March 4, 2010, or those made before that date under specific conditions related to when consideration became due or was paid.
