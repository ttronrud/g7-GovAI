This regulation establishes the framework for assessing financial institutions in Canada based on their type, size, and risk profile, setting minimum assessments and introducing surcharges tied to regulatory stage ratings. Assessments are adjusted annually for inflation and are calculated using a formula that considers capital levels, administrative expenses, and industry-wide costs, with surcharges applied to institutions rated at higher risk levels.
