These regulations authorize the deposition of fish toxicants in specific waters across Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, with authorization granted by designated provincial ministers or officers, provided the use enhances fishing and does not harm adjacent fish populations. The regulations are enacted under the Fisheries Act to control pest fish populations while protecting non-target fish species.
