This 1974 regulation designates specific regions across Canada—excluding parts of Quebec and Ontario that were later revoked—as "designated regions" for the purposes of the Regional Development Incentives Act until December 31, 1984, providing eligibility for development incentives in those areas. The designated regions include all of Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and various regions in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Alberta, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon.
