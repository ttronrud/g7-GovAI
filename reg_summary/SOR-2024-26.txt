The Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Area Petroleum Operations Framework Regulations establish safety, environmental, and operational standards for offshore petroleum activities in the shared offshore area between Canada and Nova Scotia, including definitions of key terms, requirements for operator management systems, and procedures for well operations, pollution prevention, and emergency response. These regulations were developed after public consultation and provincial approval, and require operators to ensure personnel are qualified, maintain comprehensive safety management systems, and comply with strict safety and environmental protections.
