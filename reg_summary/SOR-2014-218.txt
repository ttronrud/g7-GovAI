These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" (goods not imported for sale or industrial use) acquired in Honduras, determining that such goods originate in Honduras and are eligible for Honduras tariff benefits if they are marked according to Honduran marking laws or lack any indication of non-origin. The regulations come into force on the date section 43 of the Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act takes effect, or on the registration date if later.
