These regulations, under the Excise Tax Act, prescribe specific joint venture activities that are considered "prescribed activities" for tax purposes, including real property development, electricity generation, waste disposal, and certain industrial operations. Notably, certain uses of real property in joint ventures—particularly non-commercial uses by participants or their associates—are excluded from being prescribed activities if they do not involve commercial activity or are not subject to proper taxation.
