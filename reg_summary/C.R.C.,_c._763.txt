This regulation grants tax remission for non-commercial film and video tape imported into Canada by residents for personal use when exposed or recorded abroad, and for certain commercial Canadian film or video tape exported abroad under specific conditions, including the use of Canadian equipment and verified export documentation. Remission is only available if the goods are not subject to prior refunds, drawbacks, or exemptions, and applications must be made within two years of importation.
