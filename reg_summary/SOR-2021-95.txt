This regulation excludes a specific portion of the Copper Redhorse's critical habitat—located in the îles de Contrecœur National Wildlife Area—from protection under the Species at Risk Act, as permitted by the Act's provisions, and establishes the remaining critical habitat for the species. The Order comes into force upon registration and is based on the species' recovery strategy and designated critical habitat.
