The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner has established Standing Orders outlining the administrative procedures for addressing alleged violations of the Code of Conduct by members, including definitions, roles of conduct authorities, types of disciplinary measures (remedial, corrective, and serious), review processes, and hearing procedures to ensure fairness and proportionality. These orders provide a structured, transparent, and procedurally fair framework for disciplinary actions, including the right to representation and appeal.
