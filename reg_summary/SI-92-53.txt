This regulation proclaims that the Canada-Ireland Social Security Agreement, signed in 1990, enters into force in Canada on January 1, 1992, allowing citizens of both countries to receive social security benefits from each other under equivalent conditions, including the totalization of reckonable periods for pension eligibility, with specific rules for contributions, residence, and benefit calculations. It establishes mutual recognition of benefits, ensures payment in the territory of the other country, and outlines procedures for coordination between the competent authorities of Canada and Ireland.
