This regulation establishes that the Convention on Social Security between Canada and Luxembourg came into force on April 1, 1990, and outlines the rules for how benefits under Canada’s Old Age Security Act and Canada Pension Plan, and Luxembourg’s pension legislation, are calculated and applied for individuals residing in or working in either country. It provides mechanisms for crediting periods of residence, insurance, and contributions across borders, ensures benefits are not reduced due to residency in the other country, and establishes mutual cooperation and information-sharing between the two governments.
