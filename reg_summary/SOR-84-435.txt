This regulation establishes uniform occupational health and safety standards for uranium mines in Ontario by adopting and amending provincial laws to align with the Atomic Energy Control Board’s requirements, ensuring consistency with general mining safety regulations while exempting certain provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. It grants specific rights and powers to workers, supervisors, and officers, and gives precedence to Atomic Energy Control Regulations in cases of conflict.
