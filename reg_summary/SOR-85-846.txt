The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources revoked the 1984 Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Forms Order and issued a new 1985 Order that specifies the forms, required information, and documentation for applications seeking a certificate under the Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act, effective August 29, 1985. The Order outlines different application forms based on applicant type and includes specific annexes for certain entities, such as life insurance companies and cooperatives, and mandates detailed information on ownership, financial statements, and shareholder holdings to determine Canadian ownership and control status.
