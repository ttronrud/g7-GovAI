The Governor General revoked an earlier order on pari-mutuel betting payments and introduced a new Order effective April 1, 1983, establishing a payment rate of eight-tenths of one per cent for supervision of pari-mutuel betting systems, under the authority of subsection 188(4) of the Criminal Code. This Order may be cited as the Pari-Mutuel Payments Order.
