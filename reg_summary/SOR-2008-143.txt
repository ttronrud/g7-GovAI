These regulations establish the procedures and powers of the Procurement Ombudsman to review complaints related to government procurement contracts, ensuring fairness, openness, and transparency in the awarding of contracts for goods and services. The Ombudsman can review complaints based on alleged failures to follow procurement rules, assess whether compensation should be paid, and may recommend changes to departmental practices—subject to specific conditions, timeframes, and exclusions, such as for national security or certain parliamentary departments.
