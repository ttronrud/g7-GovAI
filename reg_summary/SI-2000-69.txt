This regulation grants tax remission to taxpayers and recipients of taxable supplies related to Indian Settlements, where the tax paid exceeds what would have been payable if the settlement had been a reserve throughout the relevant period, provided certain conditions are met, including timely claims and no prior rebates or refunds. The remission applies to income tax and goods and services tax (GST) under specific timelines and eligibility criteria set out in Schedule 2.
