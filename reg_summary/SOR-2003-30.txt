The Consular Fees (Specialized Services) Regulations, made under the Financial Administration Act, establish fees for specialized consular services provided by consular officers or locally engaged employees, with fees set out in a schedule. Certain services are exempt, including those for destitute individuals, Canadian or foreign officials in official capacity, naval vessels of Commonwealth countries, citizenship matters, and official government business. The regulations come into force upon registration and define "locally engaged employee" consistently with the Locally-Engaged Staff Employment Regulations. These fees are designed to ensure consistent and transparent pricing for consular services while allowing for humanitarian and official exceptions.
