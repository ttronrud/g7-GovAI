These regulations establish the rules for determining the origin of goods from Commonwealth Caribbean Countries for tariff treatment under the Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff, specifying conditions under which goods are considered to originate in a beneficiary country, including production, material content, and transportation requirements. Goods must be shipped directly to Canada from a beneficiary country to qualify for preferential tariff treatment, and certain goods, such as those in Chapters 61 to 63, must meet specific assembly or manufacturing criteria.
