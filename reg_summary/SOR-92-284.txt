These regulations define specific classes of Canadian citizens who are considered resident Canadians for insurance company purposes, even if they reside outside Canada, based on their employment, organizational affiliation, or residency history. Effective June 1, 1992, they include citizens working for Canadian-owned corporations, employees of Canadian international organizations, and those who were previously resident in Canada and have lived abroad for less than 10 years.
