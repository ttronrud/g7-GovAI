These Regulations establish fees for radio inspections of ships, both Canadian and foreign-registered, with fees covering inspector expenses and overtime pay, and require payment by ship owners upon inspection unless exempted—such as for U.S.-registered ships proceeding to a Great Lakes port under a bilateral agreement. The fees are not applicable in specific cases involving U.S. ships inspected for Great Lakes transit under the Canada-U.S. radio safety agreement.
