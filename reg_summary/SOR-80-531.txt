This 1980 regulation establishes a levy of one cent per pullet marketed by producers in interprovincial and export trade, requiring payment within seven days of the end of the week, along with a report detailing the purchasers and quantities of pullets sold. The levy is administered by the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board under the Natural Products Marketing Act.
