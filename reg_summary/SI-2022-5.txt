This regulation authorizes the Minister of Natural Resources to make one-time ex gratia payments of $28,500 to workers who participated in decontamination activities at AECL’s Chalk River nuclear facilities between 1952–1953 or 1958–1958, with payments also available to eligible deceased workers’ estates or caregivers, and all applications must be submitted by March 31, 2023, though extensions may be granted under exceptional circumstances. The payments are not considered an admission of liability by the Crown.
