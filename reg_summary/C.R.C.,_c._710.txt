These Regulations establish the conditions under which the Government of Canada may loan purebred sires (boars, bulls, or rams) to approved farmer associations for stock improvement purposes. The loan requires a formal application and a written agreement outlining responsibilities for animal care, veterinary treatment, reporting of illness, liability, and costs, with the agreement lasting no more than six years.
