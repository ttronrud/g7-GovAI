This regulation allows eligible taxpayers, excluding promoters, to receive a remitted amount equal to 50% of the difference between interest calculated on payments made before an agreement on a tax shelter and refund interest, plus additional interest for the period from assessment to the implementation date, plus amounts that would otherwise be payable. The remittance is made under the Financial Administration Act to address tax liabilities arising from specific tax shelter arrangements.
