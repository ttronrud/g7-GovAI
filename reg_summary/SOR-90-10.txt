This regulation revokes the previous Prohibited Mail Regulations and establishes new Non-mailable Matter Regulations, effective January 1, 1990, defining specific items that cannot be sent by mail and outlining procedures for their disposal, such as destruction, return to sender, or delivery to authorized entities. It specifies that certain items—like live animals, dangerous goods, offensive materials, and sexually explicit content—are non-mailable, with detailed rules for handling and disposal based on whether they have return addresses or pose safety or environmental risks.
