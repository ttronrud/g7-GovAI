The Canadian government has established the Canadian Industrial Hemp Promotion-Research Agency by proclamation, empowering it to promote and conduct research on industrial hemp products, including marketing and import/export activities, with a mandate to support producers and importers through a structured governance model and annual reviews. The Agency is composed of nine members elected by producers and importers across Canada, with a head office in Calgary, and is authorized to impose levies on marketing and importation to fund its operations.
