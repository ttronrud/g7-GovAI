**Date of Issuance:**  
February 13, 2020  
**Place of Issuance:** Ottawa, Canada

**Governing Legislation:**

### **1. Background and Legal Context**

The regulation establishes the **critical habitat** for the *Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback* (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*), a distinct population segment (DPS) of the threespine stickleback fish. This species is legally recognized as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*.

- The *Species at Risk Act* is a federal law designed to protect and recover wildlife species at risk in Canada.
- Under SARA, critical habitat is defined as the specific areas that are essential for the survival or recovery of a species and which are required to be protected.

### **2. Basis for the Order**

The Order is made based on the following key factual and legal considerations:

#### a) **Endangered Status and Recovery Strategy**
- The Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback is listed as an endangered species under SARA.
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this species has been developed and is publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*.
- This recovery strategy identifies the specific areas (i.e., locations and features) that are essential for the species’ survival and recovery — these are known as the **critical habitat**.

#### b) **Critical Habitat is Not in a Prohibited Area**
- The critical habitat identified in the annexed Order is **not located in any area** referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA.
- Subsection 58(2)b prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas where a **wildlife management board (WMB)** has exclusive jurisdiction under a **land claims agreement** — unless specific consultation and consent procedures are followed.
- Since the critical habitat is **not in such a restricted area**, the Minister does not need to invoke the more complex land claims jurisdictional provisions under SARA.

#### c) **Consultation with Wildlife Management Board**
- Despite the absence of a land claims jurisdictional conflict, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFDO) determined that the proposed critical habitat **may fall within an area** where a wildlife management board is authorized under a land claims agreement to perform wildlife-related functions.
- Therefore, **pursuant to subsection 58(8) of SARA**, the Minister **consulted** with the relevant wildlife management board before issuing the Order.
- This consultation ensures that Indigenous and regional stakeholders have had a meaningful opportunity to provide input, reflecting the principles of consultation and cooperation in SARA.

### **3. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Subsection 58(4)**: Authorizes the Minister to designate critical habitat for a species listed under SARA.
- **Subsection 58(5)**: Requires that the designation be based on scientific and recovery strategy information.
- The Minister has fulfilled both requirements by referencing the recovery strategy and providing a scientifically grounded designation.

### **4. Scope and Content of the Order**

- The Order formally **designates specific geographic areas** as the **critical habitat** for the Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback.
- These areas are defined in the **annex** to the Order and are based on the recovery strategy’s findings.
- The critical habitat includes the **physical and biological features** (e.g., water depth, temperature, vegetation, substrate type, and food availability) that are essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

---

### **5. Effect and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., the day it is officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- Once in force, the designated critical habitat is legally protected under SARA.
- **Prohibitions** may apply to any activities (e.g., development, mining, or alteration of land or water) that could degrade or destroy the critical habitat, unless authorized under a permit or exception.
- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for enforcing the Order and may issue permits or restrictions as necessary.

---

### **6. Significance and Implications**

- This Order is a **key step in the recovery of the Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback**, as protecting its critical habitat directly supports its long-term survival.
- It reflects the federal government’s commitment to **science-based conservation** and **cooperative governance** through consultation with Indigenous wildlife management boards.
- The regulation underscores the importance of **protecting small, isolated populations** of species that are highly vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental change.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat for the endangered Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, complies with legal requirements, and includes meaningful consultation with Indigenous wildlife management authorities. By protecting this specific habitat, the federal government is taking a proactive step toward the species’ recovery and conservation in Canada.
