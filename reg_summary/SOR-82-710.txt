This regulation revokes outdated rules on vehicle export drawbacks and introduces new rules allowing a refund of customs, sales, and excise taxes for new motor vehicles temporarily used in Canada before exportation, provided certain conditions are met—such as limited use, proper documentation, and no commercial or resale activity. The refund applies to both imported and domestically manufactured vehicles, with specific rules on eligible parts, use periods, and documentation requirements.
