This regulation withdraws certain tracts of land in the Northwest Territories, including surface and subsurface rights, from disposal for two years to support the proposed expansion of Tuktut Nogait National Park, specifically adding a 1,841 km² parcel within the Sahtú Settlement Area. The withdrawal does not affect mineral claims, leases, or licenses issued before the Order's enactment.
