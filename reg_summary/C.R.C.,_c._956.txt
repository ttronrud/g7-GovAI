The Indian Mining Regulations establish the framework for granting and managing permits and leases for mineral exploration and development on reserve lands in Canada, outlining requirements for assessment work, royalties, rent, security deposits, and compliance by permittees and lessees, while excluding British Columbia reserves. These regulations ensure that mineral rights are managed through a transparent, regulated process involving the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, with provisions for extensions, renewals, and reporting obligations.
