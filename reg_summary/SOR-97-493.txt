The Benzene in Gasoline Regulations, made under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, set maximum limits on benzene concentration and benzene emissions number in gasoline, with stricter limits in the northern supply area and during winter months, effective from July 1, 1999, and prohibit the sale of gasoline containing benzene above specified thresholds. The regulations apply to gasoline supplied in Canada but exclude certain uses, such as aircraft fuel, competition vehicles (with high antiknock index), and gasoline in transit or for export.
