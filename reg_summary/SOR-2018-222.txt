These regulations establish the rules for determining the origin of "casual goods" — goods not imported for sale or industrial use — acquired in a CPTPP country, allowing them to benefit from the applicable CPTPP tariff based on marking requirements. Goods are considered to originate in the country indicated by their marking (or Canada) if the marking complies with the country’s laws and clearly identifies the product’s origin.
