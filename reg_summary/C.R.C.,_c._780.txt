This regulation grants remission of customs duties for certain imported materials used in the manufacture of Canadian-made railway rolling stock produced between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1985, with specific conditions on eligibility, claim submission, and repayment if the rolling stock is later used domestically. Remission is reduced if by-products or scrap are produced, and the manufacturer must repay the full remission if the rolling stock is placed in domestic service for more than 90 days within 10 years of entering international service.
