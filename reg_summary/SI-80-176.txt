This regulation grants remission of customs duties and sales tax on certain front-end wheel loaders and their parts imported or produced in Canada, provided the manufacturer meets specific Canadian value-added thresholds and sales ratio requirements. Remission is conditional on demonstrating a minimum level of Canadian content in production and is subject to reporting requirements and claims filed within three years of importation.
