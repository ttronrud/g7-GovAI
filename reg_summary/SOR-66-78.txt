These regulations allow former Canadian Forces members who failed to elect service for superannuation benefits due to erroneous advice from military or public service personnel to make a special election to count that service, provided they do so within one year of being advised it may be counted. If such an election is made, the individual must pay contributions as if they had elected within the prescribed time limits under the original Act, and any overpayment or adjustment will be made through a refund or reduction in contributions.
