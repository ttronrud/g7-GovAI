This regulation establishes that member financial institutions may face a premium surcharge if they fail to comply with specific practices and requirements outlined in the deposit insurance policy, including governance, financial reporting, record-keeping, and statutory obligations. The by-law, which was repealed in 2023, defined these practices and replaced a key provision to emphasize the requirement to provide timely and accurate information to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
