This regulation grants a fee remission for individuals affected by Hurricane Fiona, allowing them to apply for replacement of certain identity and travel documents—such as passports, permanent resident cards, or refugee travel documents—without paying fees, provided the document was lost, damaged, or destroyed due to the hurricane and the applicant meets specific residency and application criteria. The remission applies to fees for documents issued between September 24, 2022, and March 24, 2023, in Quebec or the Atlantic provinces.
