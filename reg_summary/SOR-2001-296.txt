These regulations require educational institutions and collective societies to assign unique identifiers to copies of news programs, works, or subject-matter made under the Copyright Act, mark those copies with identifiers, maintain detailed records of copying, public performances, and destruction, and submit those records to collective societies on a regular basis. The records must be kept for two years after destruction unless sent to a collective society earlier.
