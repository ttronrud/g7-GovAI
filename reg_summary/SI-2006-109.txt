This regulation establishes a program for the Minister of Canadian Heritage to make one-time ex-gratia payments of $20,000 to eligible Chinese head tax payers or their beneficiaries who were alive on February 6, 2006, and have a long-standing connection to Canada. The payments are made without admitting liability on the part of the Crown and must be applied for by March 31, 2008, or with justification for a later submission.
