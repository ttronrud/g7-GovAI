The Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations set a maximum sulphur concentration of 12 mg/kg in gasoline for most types, with a higher limit of 80 mg/kg for certain exempt cases, and establish a pool average system allowing refineries and suppliers to calculate sulphur levels across batches. The regulations aim to reduce air pollution by limiting sulphur emissions from gasoline combustion, as determined by the Governor in Council under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
