The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources, has discontinued the Northern Pipeline Agency's Annual Report because it contains no more information than what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates submitted to Parliament. This decision is made under section 157a of the Financial Administration Act.
