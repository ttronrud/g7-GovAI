These regulations establish a service charge of 3/8 of one cent per pound for the interprovincial and export marketing of fresh grapes in Ontario, which must be paid by producers and deducted either by the Commodity Board or a dealer-shipper, who then remits it to the board within 21 days. The regulations apply to marketing activities involving fresh grapes, excluding direct sales to consumers by producers.
