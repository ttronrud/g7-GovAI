These regulations adapt the First Nations Fiscal Management Act to allow Indigenous groups that are parties to treaties or self-government agreements with Canada to access financing secured by "other revenues," such as taxes, royalties, and investment income, through the First Nations Finance Authority, without re-establishing existing bodies like the First Nations Tax Commission or altering their composition. The regulations define key terms, expand local revenue authority, and establish procedures for law-making, approval, and enforcement by Indigenous groups.
