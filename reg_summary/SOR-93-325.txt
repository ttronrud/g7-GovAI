These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Gjoa Haven Airport, prohibiting any structure or building from exceeding the elevation limits defined by approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and an outer surface, all measured from a designated airport reference point. The rules apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport and are designed to ensure safe aircraft operations by maintaining clear airspace around the runway and airport facilities.
