This regulation authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to set fees for special services provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, either at full cost or a partial cost, depending on specific circumstances such as potential harm to user income, service utilization, or the availability of commercial alternatives. Fees may be waived for registered charities.
