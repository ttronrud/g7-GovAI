This regulation allows taxpayers to have certain flood relief payments made in 1997 excluded from their income if they were voluntary, reasonable, bona fide, and not tied to employment factors or compensation for lost income, provided the taxpayer waives any benefits under the Income Tax Act, Canada Pension Plan, or Employment Insurance Act that would otherwise result from the payment.
