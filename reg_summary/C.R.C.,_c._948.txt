These Regulations establish the process for disposing of goods and chattels forfeited under the Indian Act, requiring public auction after advertisement, while allowing eligible claimants to apply for protection of their interests if they were innocent and exercised reasonable care. The Minister may also direct alternative disposal methods if it is in the public interest, subject to prescribed conditions.
