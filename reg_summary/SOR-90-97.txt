The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, revoked the old Coal Mines (CBDC) Safety Regulations and replaced them with new occupational safety and health regulations for coal mines in Nova Scotia, effective February 15, 1990, under Part II of the Canada Labour Code. These regulations establish detailed safety standards for the handling of explosives, ventilation, personnel qualifications, and mine operations to ensure the safety of workers in coal mines.
