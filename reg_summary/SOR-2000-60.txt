These regulations, enacted on February 14, 2000, govern the superannuation rights of public servants who transition from the Canada Ports Corporation to a new employer under a government agreement, including eligibility for pension options, death benefits, and allowances, and define key terms such as "new employer" and pensionable service. They ensure continuity of benefits for employees who cease public service employment and begin work with a new employer, while establishing specific timelines and conditions for exercising options and receiving benefits.
