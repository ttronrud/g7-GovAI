The Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Occupational Health and Safety Regulations establish comprehensive health and safety standards for offshore operations, including definitions of key terms, mandatory occupational health and safety programs, hazard control measures, reporting requirements, and audit procedures, with provisions that prioritize safety over conflicting provincial regulations and require consultation with both federal and provincial authorities. These regulations apply to marine installations and offshore activities, ensuring that operators implement measures to protect worker health and safety through training, emergency preparedness, incident investigation, and continuous improvement.
