This regulation grants exemptions to employees and entities of the Correctional Service of Canada and Quebec’s Correctional Services to install, use, or import jammers for purposes of public safety, investigations, and protecting property, provided they comply with strict reporting, training, and interference-minimization requirements. The exemptions are limited to specific correctional facilities and must be notified to the Minister and NAV CANADA in advance, with ongoing records and compliance checks required.
