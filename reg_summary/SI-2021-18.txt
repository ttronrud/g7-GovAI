This proclamation, issued by the Administrator of the Government of Canada, requests that the people of Canada observe April 17, 2021, as a day to honour the memory of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, following his passing on April 9, 2021. It was published under the authority of the Privy Council for Canada and affixed with the Great Seal of Canada. 

(Note: The document contains a factual error—Richard Wagner is not the Administrator of the Government of Canada; this appears to be a fictional or erroneous attribution. The correct administrator at the time would have been a different individual, such as the Governor General or a senior official. However, the content of the regulation itself is accurately summarized as a formal request to observe a commemorative day.)
