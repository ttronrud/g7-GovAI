These regulations establish zoning restrictions around the New Montreal International Airport (Mirabel) to ensure that no structures or natural growth exceed specific elevation limits—such as approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and the outer surface—defined by precise geometric and coordinate boundaries to protect aviation safety. The regulated area includes certain lands and water adjacent to the airport, with violations subject to enforcement by the Minister of Transport.
