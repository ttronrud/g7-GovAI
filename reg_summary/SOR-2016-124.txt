The National Energy Board has established regulations requiring individuals or companies planning to construct facilities, engage in ground-disturbing activities, or operate equipment across or near pipelines to make a locate request at least three working days in advance, obtain necessary consents, and comply with strict safety and notification measures to prevent pipeline damage. Authorizations are granted under specific conditions, including written consent from the pipeline company, proper marking of pipelines, and adherence to technical and safety requirements, with exceptions for emergencies or agricultural activities.
