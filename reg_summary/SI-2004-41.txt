This regulation grants remission to certain provinces for equalization overpayments made between fiscal years 1993 and 2001, due to an overstatement of mutual fund trust capital gains refunds in the calculation of those payments. The remission amounts are specified in the Schedule and are approved under the Financial Administration Act.
