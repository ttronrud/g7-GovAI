These regulations establish restrictions on bank holding companies' ownership of specialized financing entities, limiting such investments based on debt levels, regulatory capital thresholds, and control over entities involved in leasing, temporary possession of property, or insurance brokering. A bank holding company may not acquire or increase a substantial investment in such entities if certain financial or ownership conditions are exceeded, and these rules exclude specific types of entities and transactions involving subsidiaries or non-controlling interests.
