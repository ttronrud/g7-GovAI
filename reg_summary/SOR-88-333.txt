This regulation grants remission of customs duties on denim fabrics imported from the United States into Canada, for use in the manufacture of apparel, under specific conditions and volume limits. For apparel manufacturers, remission is granted at 100% of duties if at least 80% of the denim used is Canadian-produced, otherwise reduced by 10 percentage points for every 1 percentage point below 80%, while denim fabric producers receive remission on up to 20% of their annual Canadian production volume, subject to volume adjustments and compliance requirements.
