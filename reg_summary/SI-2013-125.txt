This regulation withdraws certain tracts of territorial lands in the Northwest Territories—specifically around the Ramparts River and Wetlands—from disposal for a two-year period to protect them as potential candidate areas under the Northwest Territories Protected Areas Strategy, as part of the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. The withdrawal includes surface and subsurface rights, with specific exclusions for mineral claims, leases, and existing agreements that are not affected by the order.
