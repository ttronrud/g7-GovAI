The Veterans Treatment Regulations, now revoked, established eligibility criteria for veterans and qualified persons to receive treatment and financial support, including definitions of dependants, spouses, and entitlements, and provided for the payment of interest on held funds and the distribution of credits upon a veteran's death to dependants or beneficiaries. However, the entire regulation has been revoked by SOR/90-595, s. 1, and is no longer in effect.
