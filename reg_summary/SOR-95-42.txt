This regulation cancels a specific egg import permit and replaces it with a general permit allowing Canadian residents to import up to two dozen eggs per importation for personal use, effective upon the coming into force of certain WTO-related sections of Canadian law. The permit covers specific types of eggs classified under certain tariff headings and requires reporting of imports with a designated statement.
