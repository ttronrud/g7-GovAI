This regulation establishes the rules for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for fishermen in Canada, defining key terms such as "fisher," "catch," and "employer," and outlining how earnings are calculated, premiums are determined, and benefit periods are established. It specifies that a buyer or agent of a catch may be considered the employer of the crew, and that benefits are available to fishermen who meet earnings and residency criteria during specific qualifying periods, with extensions for special circumstances like parental leave or hospitalization.
