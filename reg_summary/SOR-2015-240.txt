The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) enacted the Simultaneous Programming Service Deletion and Substitution Regulations to allow operators of Canadian television stations to request that distribution undertakings delete a programming service (either Canadian or non-Canadian) and substitute it with a local or regional Canadian television station's service, provided certain conditions are met, including comparability, format, and timing requirements, and that such actions do not harm public interest or subscriber service. The regulations also establish obligations for due diligence, error prevention, and compensation when errors occur due to negligence.
