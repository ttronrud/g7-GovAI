These regulations establish circumstances under which time limits for reporting, applying for certificates or authorizations, or seeking orders can be excluded, including when an applicant requests an extension, when studies are needed due to insufficient information, or when fees and charges are unpaid. The regulations apply to various types of energy projects under the Canadian Energy Regulator Act and come into force on the date the Act is enacted or upon registration.
