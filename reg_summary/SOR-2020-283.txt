This regulation, issued by the Minister of Transport under the Canada Transportation Act, requires airlines to provide refunds to passengers when flights are cancelled due to situations outside the carrier’s control, such as severe weather or air traffic control issues, that prevent passengers from completing their itinerary within a reasonable time. The Direction comes into force upon registration and applies to cancellations listed in the Air Passenger Protection Regulations.
