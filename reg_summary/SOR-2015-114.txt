This regulation exempts gluten-free oats and foods containing such oats from certain labeling requirements if the oats are specially produced or processed to avoid gluten contamination from barley, rye, rye, triticale, or wheat, and contain no more than 20 parts per million (p.p.m.) of gluten from those sources. It also removes the need to disclose the source of gluten or list oats by name in ingredient lists for such foods, provided all labeling clearly states the oats are gluten-free.
