These regulations require retail cooperative credit associations in Canada to clearly disclose the interest rate, how interest is calculated, and any factors that affect the rate when opening a deposit account or when interest rates change. The disclosures must be provided in writing at account opening, through posted notices, or on websites, and must include details such as the annual interest rate, payment frequency, and how the account balance impacts interest.
