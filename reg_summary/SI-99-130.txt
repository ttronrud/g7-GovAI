This regulation, enacted in 1991, directs the discontinuation of several annual reports required by specific Acts of Parliament, as they contain no additional information beyond what is already provided in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates. The decision was made by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board under section 157a of the Financial Administration Act.
