The Governor in Council has declared that the federal regulations aimed at reducing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector do not apply in British Columbia, due to the existence of equivalent provincial regulations under British Columbia’s environmental laws. This declaration is effective until the agreement between the federal government and British Columbia on regulatory equivalency terminates.
