This regulation requires foreign life, property and casualty, and marine insurance companies to maintain certain minimum levels of assets in Canada, calculated based on their policy liabilities and other obligations, in addition to the margin required under the Insurance Companies Act. These asset requirements can be reduced by amounts receivable from agents, brokers, or policyholders, or by reinsurance arrangements with approved reinsurers.
