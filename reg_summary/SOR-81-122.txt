This regulation cancels and replaces General Import Permit No. 7 with a new permit allowing the import of turkeys and turkey products for non-commercial purposes, including up to 10 kg of turkey parts per importation, turkey poults, and turkeys in jars or cans, with specific requirements for customs entry forms. The permit was issued under the Export and Import Permits Act and is now revoked by SI/83-185.
