The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission established administrative monetary penalty regulations under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, defining violations, categorizing them as Category A, B, or C, and specifying penalty amounts based on the violator's status (individual or entity) and the severity of the violation. Penalties are determined by factors such as compliance history, intent, harm caused, and mitigation efforts, with notices of violation served through specific methods and timelines.
