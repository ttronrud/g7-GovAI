The Industrial Hemp Regulations, made under the Cannabis Act, establish the framework for the cultivation, import, export, sale, and processing of industrial hemp in Canada, setting strict requirements on THC levels (0.3% w/w or less), approved cultivars, licensing, testing, record-keeping, and compliance with import/export permits. These regulations ensure that only authorized activities are conducted, with specific rules for seed and grain handling, pedigree status, and reporting to the Minister.
