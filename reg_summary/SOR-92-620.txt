The Governor General in Council has revoked previous penitentiary and parole regulations and replaced them with the new *Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations*, which establish comprehensive guidelines for the custody, rehabilitation, and conditional release of offenders, including provisions on inmate rights, staff responsibilities, transfer processes, security classifications, and community involvement. These regulations are designed to enhance accountability, transparency, and the rehabilitation of offenders in line with the goals of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.
