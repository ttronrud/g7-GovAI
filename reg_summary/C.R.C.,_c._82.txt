The Fort McMurray Airport Zoning Regulations establish height restrictions on buildings and structures near Fort McMurray Airport, prohibiting any construction that exceeds designated approach, outer, or transitional surfaces—defined by specific geometric and elevation parameters—within a defined area surrounding the airport. These surfaces ensure safe aircraft approach and takeoff by maintaining clear airspace and minimizing obstruction risks.
