This regulation grants the Lacroix trustee a remission of up to $256,000 in bankruptcy dividend payments related to Vincent Lacroix’s 2005 tax liability, subject to specific conditions, including the filing and validation of claims regarding misappropriated funds from Groupe Norbourg-managed funds and the distribution of the remitted amount to investors in certain Norbourg and Evolution funds. The remitted amount is distributed to investors only after claims are validated and fully satisfied, with any remaining funds returned to the Crown, and investors potentially required to repay amounts exceeding their original claims.
