The Governor General, on the Prime Minister's recommendation, transfers control of the Ports and Border Management Directorate and all port of entry functions (including marine security) from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration to the Canada Border Services Agency. This reallocation enhances the agency's authority over border management operations in Canada.
