This 1990 regulation establishes strict controls on the marketing of Manitoba-produced milk in interprovincial and export trade, requiring all sales and purchases to be conducted exclusively through the Commodity Board. It ensures producers receive payments based on the quantity, quality, and grade of milk delivered, with the Board managing distribution, transport, and payment processes.
