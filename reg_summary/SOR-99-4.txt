These regulations allow certain public servants who transitioned to PMG Technologies Inc. (the new employer) after the transfer of the Blainville Motor Vehicle Test Centre to exercise an irrevocable option within one year to count their period of employment with the public service and the new employer as pensionable service for annuity eligibility, provided they were contributors under the Public Service Superannuation Act on June 14, 1996 and had not previously received benefits under sections 12, 13, or 13.01. The regulations also extend benefits to surviving spouses and children born or adopted during the transition period and clarify how pensionable service and age are calculated for eligibility purposes.
