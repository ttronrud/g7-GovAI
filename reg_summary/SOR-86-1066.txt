These Regulations authorize various designated officers and classes of officers within the Department of National Revenue to exercise specific powers and perform duties of the Minister of National Revenue under the Customs Act, with certain exceptions and limitations based on their position and the sections of the Act they are permitted to administer. The regulations were published in the Canada Gazette and came into force upon the coming into effect of paragraph 164(1)(a) of the Customs Act.
