These regulations govern the superannuation rights of public servants who transition from the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food to a new employer under a government agreement, ensuring continuity of benefits such as pensions, death benefits, and survivor's allowances, with specific provisions for return of contributions and options for transfer value, effective January 1, 2010. They clarify that the individual is deemed to have ceased public service employment on the date they begin employment with the new employer, and certain benefits and periods of service are calculated based on that date.
