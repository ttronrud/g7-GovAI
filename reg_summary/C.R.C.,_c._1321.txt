This regulation grants remission of customs duty and excise taxes on equipment, materials, and supplies used exclusively in building NATO Common Infrastructure Project systems funded by NATO common funds, but only if an exemption certificate signed by a designated National Defence officer is attached to the relevant documentation. The Minister of National Revenue is responsible for ensuring the Order is properly implemented.
