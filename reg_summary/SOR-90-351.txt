The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked the Sanitary Control of Shellfish Fisheries Regulations and replaced them with the Management of Contaminated Fisheries Regulations, effective October 1, 1990, to better manage fish contamination risks and protect public health. These regulations allow Regional Director Generals to prohibit fishing in contaminated areas and permit licensed individuals to fish only under specific conditions, including submission of decontamination plans for food purposes and strict use restrictions for fish caught for scientific or bait purposes.
