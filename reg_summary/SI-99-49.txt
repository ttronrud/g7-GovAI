This regulation establishes the formal entry into force of the Canada-Croatia Agreement on Social Security, which allows citizens of both countries to access social security benefits (such as pensions and disability benefits) under each other’s legislation, with creditable periods from one country counted toward eligibility in the other. Benefits are paid in the territory of the third state when a person is covered by both countries’ systems, and the agreement includes provisions for totalizing periods, eligibility rules, and mutual administrative cooperation.
