The Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Area Occupational Health and Safety Regulations establish comprehensive health and safety standards for offshore petroleum operations, including definitions of key terms, requirements for occupational health and safety programs, hazard control measures, incident reporting, employee training, and auditing procedures, all of which are designed to protect workers and ensure compliance with both federal and provincial regulations. These regulations were developed through consultation with Nova Scotia’s health and safety authorities and take precedence over provincial regulations when there is a conflict.
