The Governor in Council has adopted the Reduction in the Release of Volatile Organic Compounds (Storage and Loading of Volatile Petroleum Liquids) Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from petroleum storage and loading operations, applying to facilities that meet specific volume or loading thresholds. The regulations establish requirements for vapour control systems, monitoring, leak detection, and maintenance to protect human health and the environment.
