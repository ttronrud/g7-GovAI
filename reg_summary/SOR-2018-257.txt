This regulation designates Newfoundland and Labrador as a jurisdiction under Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code, allowing for the enforcement of criminal penalties related to excessive interest rates in payday loans, but only after the province's specific legislative measures—amending the Consumer Protection and Business Practices Act, and establishing the Payday Loans and Licensing Regulations—are fully in force. The Order comes into effect on April 1, 2019.
