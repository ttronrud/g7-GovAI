These regulations authorize civilian dental practitioners, under the approval of a Command Dental Officer, to provide dental treatment to Canadian Forces personnel when military dental services are unavailable or unable to meet specific needs, with treatment limited to maintaining dental fitness and masticatory function for 12 months. In emergencies, treatment for pain or acute infection or broken dentures may be provided without prior authorization, but all services require proper documentation and certification for payment.
