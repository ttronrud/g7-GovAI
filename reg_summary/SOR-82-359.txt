These regulations establish the tax rates for natural gas and gas liquids in Canada, specifying that certain uses of pipeline gas—such as in compressors, line heaters, and pilot lights—are exempt, and that wells not engaged in gas production businesses with low annual output (under 1,000 gigajoules) are eligible. The tax rates were phased out starting January 31, 1984, with all rates set to zero for marketable pipeline gas and gas liquids received after that date.
