These regulations require that any mail item resembling a bill, invoice, or statement of account due but actually being a solicitation for goods, services, or both must clearly display a boldface, capitalized notice stating it is not a bill and that no payment is required unless the offer is accepted. The notice must be prominently printed, with sufficient size, contrast, and spacing, and no such mail item may claim approval by Canada Post or compliance with federal laws.
