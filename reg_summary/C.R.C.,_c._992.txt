These Regulations amend the Canada Labour Code to set maximum working hours and lay-day entitlements for shipping employees on vessels operating from British Columbia, allowing up to 12 hours per day and 40 hours per week for employees working 12-hour shifts, or up to 8 hours per day with weekly hours exceeding 40 for those on 8-hour shifts, while limiting total lay-day accumulation to 45 days (with exceptions for exceptional circumstances). Overtime is capped at 18 hours in seven consecutive days for 12-hour shifts or 12 hours for 8-hour shifts, with adjustments for reduced workdays due to loading/unloading.
