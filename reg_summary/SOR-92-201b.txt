This regulation establishes temporary employment terms for individuals in specific categories within the Department of National Defence, allowing appointments for periods of less than three months (with a total of less than six months in any 12-month period) without being subject to the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act. It grants the Deputy Minister or an authorized individual the authority to recruit, appoint, and terminate such temporary employees with one day’s notice, either for cause or due to lack of work.
