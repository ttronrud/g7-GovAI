This regulation establishes definitions and rules for the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act’s fuel charge system, including definitions of key terms like bio-aviation fuel, eligible greenhouses, and qualifying fuels, and outlines how fuel charges are calculated based on fuel type, location, and usage—particularly for greenhouse operators and remote communities. It also sets specific conditions under which rebates are provided for exported or transferred fuel and defines the rates and formulas used to determine charges, including adjustments for biofuels and hydrogen content.
