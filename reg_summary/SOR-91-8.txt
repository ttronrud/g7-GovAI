The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has revoked the previous National Parks Townsite and Subdivision Designation Regulations and replaced them with new regulations that designate specific surveyed areas in national parks across Canada—such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba—as towns, visitor centres, or resort subdivisions. These designations are outlined in the schedule and are now governed by the National Parks Town, Visitor Centre and Resort Subdivision Designation Regulations.
