**Detailed Summary of the Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Insurance Companies) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Context and Authority**  
These regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **paragraph 703(h) of the Insurance Companies Act** (*Act*). The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and are formally titled the **Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Insurance Companies) Regulations**. They are cited as **S.C. 1991, c. 47**.

The purpose of these regulations is to **allow insurance companies to permit their subsidiaries to hold shares in the parent company**, under specific conditions designed to ensure financial stability, prevent conflicts of interest, and maintain regulatory oversight.

**Key Definitions in the Regulations**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which provides the legal framework governing the operations, capital requirements, and regulatory obligations of insurance companies in Canada.

2. **Distribution**  
   Defined as "distribution" as set out in **section 296 of the Act**. This refers to the issuance or sale of shares or other securities by a company to the public or to specific investors. The term is critical because it triggers special rules regarding shareholding limits and disclosure.

3. **Regulated Securities Entity**  
   A financial institution whose primary business is dealing in securities (e.g., underwriting, brokerage, investment services), and which is regulated in its securities activities by:
   - An Act of Parliament,
   - A provincial legislature, or  
   - The laws of a foreign country.  
   This definition ensures that only entities operating under recognized regulatory regimes are eligible to hold shares in the parent insurance company.

**Main Provisions and Conditions**

**1. General Shareholding Limit (Section 3)**  
A company (parent insurance company) may permit a **subsidiary** that is a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares of the company **only if** the **aggregate value** of all such shares held by all subsidiaries (excluding shares referred to in section 76 of the Act) does **not exceed 1% of the company’s regulatory capital**.

- **Regulatory Capital**: This is the minimum capital required by law to ensure the financial soundness and solvency of the insurance company.
- **Aggregate Value**: The total value of the shares held across all subsidiaries must not exceed 1% of this regulatory capital.
- **Exclusion of Section 76 Shares**: Shares that are specifically mentioned in **section 76 of the Act** (which may relate to shares held by certain affiliates, such as in connection with mergers or capital restructuring) are excluded from this 1% cap.

👉 *This provision ensures that subsidiaries do not accumulate excessive ownership stakes in the parent company, thereby reducing potential conflicts of interest and maintaining the parent company’s independence and financial integrity.*

**2. Exception for Securities Underwriting Activities (Section 3 – Special Provision)**  
Where a subsidiary of the company is a **regulated securities entity** and is **acting as a securities underwriter** in connection with a **distribution of shares** of the parent company, the parent company may permit the subsidiary to hold shares **in excess of the 1% limit** — **until the distribution is concluded**.

- This exception applies **only during the period of the share distribution** (i.e., when the company is issuing new shares to the public or to investors).
- The subsidiary’s ability to hold shares above the 1% threshold is **temporary** and **time-bound**, ending once the distribution is complete.
- The underwriting role must be directly related to the share issuance process.

👉 *This provision recognizes that during a share offering, a subsidiary acting as an underwriter may need to have a financial stake in the company to support the transaction (e.g., to cover underwriting fees or to provide market stability). However, it is strictly limited to the duration of the distribution to prevent long-term overexposure.*

**Purpose and Regulatory Objectives**

These regulations aim to:
- **Balance operational flexibility** with **regulatory prudence**.
- Allow insurance companies to leverage their subsidiaries (especially those involved in securities activities) in capital-raising efforts without compromising financial stability.
- Prevent potential misuse of shareholding to create conflicts of interest or to manipulate the company’s financial position.
- Ensure that any shareholding by subsidiaries remains within reasonable and transparent bounds.

---

**Key Limitations and Safeguards**

- The 1% cap applies to **all subsidiaries** that are regulated securities entities.
- The cap is based on **regulatory capital**, not market capitalization or book value, ensuring alignment with solvency and risk management standards.
- The exception for underwriting is **temporary and conditional**, not a permanent relaxation of the rule.
- The rules are designed to be **transparent and enforceable**, with clear definitions and conditions.

**Conclusion**

The *Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Insurance Companies) Regulations* provide a **structured and risk-managed framework** allowing insurance companies to permit their regulated securities subsidiaries to hold shares in the parent company. The core principle is **strict limitation** (1% of regulatory capital) to safeguard financial stability, with a **temporary exception** during share distributions when a subsidiary acts as an underwriter.

These regulations reflect a balanced approach—enabling operational efficiency in capital markets while maintaining the integrity and independence of insurance companies under Canadian insurance law.

**Relevance Today**  
Although these regulations were enacted in 1992, their principles remain relevant in modern financial regulation, particularly in the context of cross-ownership, corporate governance, and risk management in the insurance and financial services sectors. They serve as a foundational precedent for similar rules in other jurisdictions.
