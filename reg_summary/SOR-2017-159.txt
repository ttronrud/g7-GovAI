The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has adopted regulations requiring licensed broadcasters to devote at least 35% of their broadcast time to Canadian programs, with additional requirements for third-language services, strict advertising standards, and detailed programming logs. These regulations also establish rules on content, commercial messaging, transparency, and compliance with the Broadcasting Act.
