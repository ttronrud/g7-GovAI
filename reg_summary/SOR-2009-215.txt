These regulations establish the rules of origin for "casual goods" (goods not imported for sale or industrial use) acquired in Peru, stating that such goods are considered to originate in Peru and qualify for Peru's tariff benefits if they are marked according to Peruvian marking laws or lack a mark indicating they are not Peruvian or Canadian-made. The regulations came into force on August 1, 2009.
