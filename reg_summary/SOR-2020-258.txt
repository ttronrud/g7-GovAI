The Governor in Council has enacted the Off-road Compression-Ignition and Large Spark-Ignition Engine Emission Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, establishing emission standards for off-road engines based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, with specific definitions and exemptions for emergency, military, competition, and export engines. These regulations apply to mobile and stationary engines not covered by other emission rules and require compliance with testing, fuel, and emission standards to reduce air pollution.
