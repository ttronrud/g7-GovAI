These regulations establish how public service superannuation benefits are applied to individuals who, on December 1, 2001, ceased being employed in the public service and instead became employed by The Micronutrient Initiative, treating them as if they had been employed in the public service for pension and death benefit purposes. The regulations define key dates, benefit entitlements, and service periods for such individuals, and classify them as Group 1 contributors, with the rules coming into force upon registration.
