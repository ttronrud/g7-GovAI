Canada has enacted regulations to freeze the assets of certain politically exposed individuals from Tunisia and Egypt who are alleged to have misappropriated state property or acquired it improperly, in response to concerns over political instability and the need to protect international relations. These regulations prohibit Canadians from dealing with, financing, or providing financial services to the listed individuals or their property.
