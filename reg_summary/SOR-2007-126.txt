This regulation establishes the requirements for vessel registration and tonnage measurement in Canada, based on the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. It defines tonnage calculation methods for vessels of different lengths, outlines exemptions for small or human-powered vessels, and specifies when and how International Tonnage Certificates (1969) must be issued, renewed, or cancelled upon changes to a vessel’s structure, capacity, or use.
