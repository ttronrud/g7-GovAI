These regulations establish the transfer of pension funds from the Halifax and Saint John Pilots’ Pension Funds to the Public Service Superannuation Account by September 30, 1973, ensuring that retired pilots receive pension benefits under the Public Service Superannuation Act, with their prior service under the old by-laws credited as pensionable service and any excess contributions paid to them. Employees may also elect to pay for unused service periods, with amounts calculated based on actuarial standards and contribution rates.
