The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal adopted the 2021 Rules of Procedure to govern the conduct of inquiries into discriminatory practices, ensuring they are fair, expeditious, and accessible, with provisions for procedural flexibility, accommodation, document disclosure, and timely decision-making. These rules apply to inquiries initiated after their effective date and establish clear requirements for statements of particulars, witness and document disclosure, hearings, motions, and decisions, while emphasizing the need for informal and equitable proceedings.
