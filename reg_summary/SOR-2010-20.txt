This regulation repeals an earlier set of rules adapting the Canada Elections Act for referendums and establishes a new, updated version tailored to the specific procedures of a referendum. It defines key terms, outlines voting eligibility, and grants the Chief Electoral Officer broad authority to manage and supervise the referendum process, including extending voting hours in emergencies and conducting public education campaigns.
