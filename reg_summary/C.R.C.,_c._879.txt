These regulations establish the rules for government annuities, including interest rates, mortality tables, and procedures for applications, contracts, and contract variations, with specific provisions for immediate and deferred annuities, group contracts, and special cases involving employees or pre-1948 contracts. They define key terms, set interest rates based on age and contract type, and specify the use of the 1983 Annuity Table and Projection Scales for actuarial calculations.
