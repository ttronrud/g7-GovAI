This regulation grants a remission of the goods and services tax (GST) to certain Indigenous bands in Saskatchewan for land purchased under treaty land entitlement agreements, up to specified acreage limits and associated costs, subject to specific conditions including no prior tax relief and timely submission of an application. The remission applies only to purchases made on or after September 23, 1992, and is governed by agreements between the bands, the Government of Canada, and the Government of Saskatchewan.
