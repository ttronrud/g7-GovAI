The Governor in Council has revoked the Returning Residents Special Exemption Regulations and introduced a new exemption order that allows certain goods—such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, vaping products, bride’s trousseaus, wedding presents, and replacement items— to be exempt from the six-month ownership requirement for returning residents, under specific conditions. This exemption applies to goods imported by individuals who have lived abroad for at least five years or who are newly married or receiving wedding gifts.
