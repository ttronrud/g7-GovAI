These Ontario Wheat Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations establish a controlled system for the marketing of wheat in Ontario, requiring producers to sell only to designated agents of the Ontario Wheat Producers’ Marketing Board, who then sell the wheat through the Commodity Board. The Board distributes proceeds from sales based on the quantity, variety, and grade of wheat delivered, with disputes over quality resolved by Canadian Grain Commission inspectors.
