The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has decided not to list the Newfoundland and Labrador, Laurentian North, and Maritimes populations of Atlantic Cod or the Interior Fraser population of Coho Salmon on Canada’s List of Wildlife Species at Risk, citing socio-economic impacts, uncertainty in marine survival, and existing conservation measures. The assessments for six other species—Lake Winnipeg Physa, Bocaccio, Shortjaw Cisco, Cusk, the Northwest Atlantic Harbour Porpoise, and the Arctic Atlantic Cod—are being referred back to COSEWIC for further review due to insufficient data, unclear species definitions, and lack of consideration of traditional knowledge.
