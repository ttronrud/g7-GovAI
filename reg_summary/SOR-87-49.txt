The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) revoked previous television broadcasting regulations and enacted new ones in 1987, effective January 9, 1987, to update rules on Canadian programming requirements, commercial advertising, and broadcast obligations, including minimum percentages of Canadian and ethnic programming that licensees must air. These regulations established specific standards for programming content, advertising, and record-keeping, with special provisions for ethnic and remote stations.
