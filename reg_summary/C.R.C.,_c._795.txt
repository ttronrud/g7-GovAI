This regulation grants a sales tax remission on imported machinery and goods eligible for drawback under Code 9075, equal to the difference between the sales tax paid and the sales tax that would apply if the duty-paid value used for calculation were reduced by the drawback amount.  
The remission effectively reduces the sales tax burden by reflecting the lower value of the goods after drawback is applied.
