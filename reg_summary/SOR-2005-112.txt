This regulation establishes the legal privileges and immunities for the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme in Canada, granting it corporate status and immunity from legal process, taxation, and interference, while also providing similar protections to its representatives, officials, experts, and the Head of Secretariat. These immunities are granted to ensure the Organization can operate independently and efficiently, in accordance with the Programme Agreement, without conflicting with Canadian laws or national security considerations.
