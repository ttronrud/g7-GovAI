The Treasury Board repeals outdated regulations on Crown corporation planning and budgets and replaces them with new rules that specify the five-year coverage period for corporate plans, require submission of plans and budgets eight weeks before each financial year, mandate inclusion of reasons for missing information, and establish timelines for submitting summaries to Parliament following approval by the Governor in Council or the Treasury Board. These regulations are now known as the Crown Corporation Corporate Plan, Budget and Summaries Regulations.
