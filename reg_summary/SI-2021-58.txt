The Governor General in Council has referred the status of the Rusty Cord-moss (Entosthodon rubiginosus) back to COSEWIC for further review, following new evidence of significant population declines at key sites in British Columbia due to fire and invasive species, which raises concerns about its continued classification as endangered. The Minister of the Environment has approved including a statement in the public registry explaining the referral, emphasizing the need for a more thorough assessment of the species' status.
