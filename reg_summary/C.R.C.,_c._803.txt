These regulations grant exempted carriers, to whom Parliament of Canada extends legislative authority, from certain provisions of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Act when transporting fish on behalf of the Corporation or its licensed agents. Exempt carriers must issue bills of lading or contracts that include the Corporation’s licence number or a signed statement confirming the sender is an authorized agent.
