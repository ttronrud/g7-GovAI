This regulation grants the Manitoba Milk Producers’ Marketing Board authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade, allowing it to impose and collect levies or charges on milk producers and marketers, and to use those funds for reserves, expenses, losses, and equalizing revenues among producers. However, this authority does not include powers exercised by the Canadian Dairy Commission under its own Act.
