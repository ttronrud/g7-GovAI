These regulations establish zoning restrictions at Coppermine Airport, prohibiting the construction of any structure whose highest point exceeds the approach surfaces, outer surface, or transitional surfaces, all defined by specific geometric and elevation criteria. The regulations apply to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, ensuring safe aircraft operations by limiting obstacles near the airport.
