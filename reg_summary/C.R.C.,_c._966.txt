These Regulations establish the Automotive Manufacturing Assistance Regulations, which provide for loans and guarantees to eligible manufacturers in Canada—defined as companies producing parts, accessories, tooling, or buses, off-highway vehicles, or specified commercial vehicles—not directly involved in automobile manufacturing—to support their operations, particularly in response to the Canada-United States Automotive Products Agreement. The General Adjustment Assistance Board administers these loans, with conditions on security, interest rates, repayment terms, and reporting, and may certify layoffs related to reduced production under the automotive program.
