This regulation grants the Commission for Environmental Cooperation a tax remission equal to the difference between the tax it actually paid from September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997, and the tax it would have paid if it had been entitled to the exemptions granted under the United Nations privileges and immunities convention. The remission is made under the Financial Administration Act to support the Commission’s operations.
