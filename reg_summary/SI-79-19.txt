This regulation revokes previous orders and establishes a new framework for granting payments in lieu of real estate taxes, local improvement costs, and development taxes for diplomatic, consular, and international organizations' property in Canada. The Secretary of State for External Affairs may pay such grants to municipalities or provinces based on the taxes that would have been payable if the property were federal, subject to specific conditions and installment options.
