This regulation establishes a levy system for wood producers in the Labelle area of Quebec, requiring them to pay a fee based on the unit of measurement used when marketing wood in interprovincial or export trade. The levy amounts vary by measurement unit, and if a producer fails to pay, any third party marketing the wood must deduct the levy and remit it to the Syndicate within 30 days.
