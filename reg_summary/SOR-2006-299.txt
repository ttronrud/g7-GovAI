These regulations establish specific thresholds and circumstances under the Bank Act for insider trading and take-over bids, including setting a 10% voting rights threshold for bank shares and defining when transactions constitute insider activity, with the regulations coming into force upon registration. They also align the definition of "take-over bid" across various provincial and federal securities acts to ensure consistency in enforcement.
