The National Farm Products Marketing Council established these Rules of Procedure to ensure efficient, transparent, and accessible hearings by setting clear requirements for applications, submissions, public participation, and evidence presentation, while promoting focused decision-making and minimizing delays. The rules govern all aspects of hearings, including filing requirements, timelines, service of documents, issue definition, and procedures for amending or clarifying submissions.
