These regulations allow certain businesses to ship prohibited firearms and specified devices by post to eligible recipients in Canada under strict conditions, including requiring the firearms to be unloaded, rendered inoperable, and securely packaged, while exempting them from the usual storage and transportation rules during transit. The provisions apply during designated amnesty periods and are subject to agreements with the Government of Canada for destruction of the weapons.
