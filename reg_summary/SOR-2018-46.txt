This regulation declares an amnesty period from the date of registration to February 28, 2021, allowing individuals who legally possessed certain prohibited firearms—such as specific SAN Swiss Arms models—and held valid licenses under the Firearms Act to continue possessing, transferring, selling, or delivering those firearms without criminal penalties during that time.
