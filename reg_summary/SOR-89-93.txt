This regulation revokes the previous Ontario Fishery Regulations and replaces them with new rules governing fishing in Ontario, defining specific divisions of waters subject to different fishing regulations based on geographic boundaries and locations. The new regulations establish detailed descriptions of which water areas are included or excluded for fishing purposes.
