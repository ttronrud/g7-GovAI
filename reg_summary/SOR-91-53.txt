These Regulations establish the method for determining the estimated federal sales tax in respect of new housing rebates under the Excise Tax Act, specifying how the value of a residential complex—such as a condominium unit or a standalone building—is calculated based on interior floor space, fair market value, or consideration for supply, depending on the circumstances. The regulations define interior floor space and exclude certain areas like parking, storage, and utility spaces.
