These Regulations, known as the Armed Forces Postal Regulations, govern postal services for members of the Canadian Forces and certain civilians stationed or residing outside Canada, including rates, handling, and labeling requirements for mail, particularly Forces Air Letters and international mail subject to customs duties. They establish specific rules for the use, dimensions, and customs declarations for mail sent through Canadian Forces Post Offices or Fleet Mail Offices.
