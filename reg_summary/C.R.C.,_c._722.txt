The Public Lands Licensing Order authorizes the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to issue licences for various uses of canals, including telegraph, telephone, and power lines, pipelines, boathouses, water drawing for domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes (excluding water power), and fire protection, with conditions on water discharge and rental determination. The specific sites and limits are designated by the Superintending Engineer of the canal, and effluents must be settled or purified if required by the General Superintendent of Canals.
