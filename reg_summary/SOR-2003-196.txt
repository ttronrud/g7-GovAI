The Natural Health Products Regulations establish the framework for the manufacture, sale, labelling, and distribution of natural health products in Canada, requiring product licences for all such products and setting strict standards for safety, labelling, and quality. The regulations define key terms, mandate clear labelling including ingredient lists, recommended use, and allergen warnings, and outline procedures for product licensing, recalls, and safety monitoring, while exempting certain products like those used in clinical trials or with localized effects from full compliance.
