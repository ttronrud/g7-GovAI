This regulation revokes the previous fishery rules for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island and replaces them with the Maritime Provinces Fishery Regulations, effective February 24, 1993, establishing unified fishing rules for those provinces and adjacent tidal waters, including restrictions on methods, species, and seasons, while exempting certain recreational and commercial activities.
