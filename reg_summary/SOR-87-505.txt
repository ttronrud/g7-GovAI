These regulations establish the conditions under which security (such as mortgages, pledges, or liens) can be accepted by the Canadian government to cover debts or obligations due to Her Majesty, limiting such security to charges on the personal or real property of debtors or their guarantors. They authorize any appropriate Minister to accept such security and to issue instruments releasing it upon full or partial payment of the debt.
