This regulation expands the grant of land at La Martre Lake by including any portion within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark along the shoreline, specifically for Lots 45 and 57 in the Community of Wha Ti, Northwest Territories. The adjustment is made under the Territorial Lands Act to ensure inclusion of land adjacent to the lake's shoreline.
