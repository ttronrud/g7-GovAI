The Public Service Staffing Tribunal Regulations establish detailed procedures for handling complaints in the public service, including requirements for filing, notice, mediation, information exchange, participation by third parties, and timelines for responses and hearings, all designed to ensure fairness, expeditious resolution, and compliance with relevant human rights and accessibility laws. The Board retains discretion to manage proceedings, extend deadlines, and determine whether to consolidate cases or allow intervention.
