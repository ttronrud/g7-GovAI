The Quebec Sheep and Wool Order mandates that sheep producers pay specific levies on each sheep sold in interprovincial and international trade, as outlined in the Producer Contributions Regulation, the Joint Producer Plan, and the Heavy Lamb Sales Regulation. These levies come into force on the day the order is registered.
