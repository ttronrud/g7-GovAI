This by-law requires federal institutions applying to accept deposits without being member institutions to notify their depositors in writing that deposits will no longer be insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) after authorization, and that depositors must provide written acknowledgment to waive insurance coverage. If depositors do not respond, their deposits will be assumed by another member institution under the same terms.
