On June 4, 2001, the Government of Canada transferred control of the Residential Schools Unit from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State, rebranding it as the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada. This move established a dedicated office to lead the resolution of issues related to Canadian residential schools.
