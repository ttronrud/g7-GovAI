These regulations govern timber harvesting in Gros Morne National Park of Canada, restricting harvesting to specific communities, species, and areas, and requiring permits based on residency and traditional use. Harvesting is limited to renewable purposes such as heating, building structures, or commercial boat construction in Rocky Harbour, with strict environmental protections, permit conditions, and reporting requirements to ensure ecological integrity.
