This regulation grants a tax remission to individuals who received Quebec family allowances in 1989, equal to the difference between the taxes they would have paid on their income and the taxes they would have paid if those allowances had not been included in their income. The order is made under section 23 of the Financial Administration Act and aims to address the tax impact of family allowances received in 1989.
