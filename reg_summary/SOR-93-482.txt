These regulations establish fees for criminal record verification by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, with a $5 fee for Canadian records and a $60 fee for foreign records, to be used in licensing or certifying individuals for employment in insurance, real estate, or securities. The fees are set under the Financial Administration Act and apply to provincial agencies conducting such verifications.
