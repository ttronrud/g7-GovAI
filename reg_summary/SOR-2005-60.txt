This regulation directs the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to require cable providers with 2,000 or more subscribers to reserve two video channels—one for English and one for French—for the distribution of CPAC, with at least one channel on the basic service. The goal is to ensure broader availability of the Canadian Public Affairs Channel in both official languages while recognizing the financial challenges faced by smaller cable providers.
