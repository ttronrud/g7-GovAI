The Canadian Transportation Agency established the Railway Third Party Liability Insurance Coverage Regulations to ensure that rail operators and constructors maintain adequate third-party liability insurance—covering bodily injury, property damage, and named perils pollution—supported by full disclosure of risks and financial capability, with specific requirements based on whether the railway serves passenger rail or not. The regulations mandate detailed reporting on insurance coverage, self-insurance levels, risk factors, and financial statements to the Agency, with periodic updates and disclosures before policy expiry.
