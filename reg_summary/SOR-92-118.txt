This regulation grants the Office des producteurs de fruits et légumes du Québec authority to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of certain vegetables produced in Quebec, including the power to impose and collect levies or charges on producers and processors to fund operational expenses, reserves, and equitable distribution of revenues. The Order allows the Board to classify producers into groups and set different fees based on group, with funds used for administrative costs, losses, and revenue equalization among producers.
