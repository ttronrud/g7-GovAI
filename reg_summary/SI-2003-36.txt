This regulation withdraws certain subsurface lands in the Northwest Territories from disposal to support the development of a hydroelectric power plant near Bluefish Lake, with specific exemptions for existing mining and exploration rights granted prior to the Order's enactment. It also repeals a previously designated parcel of land within the Bluefish Lake area, excluding portions covered by lakes and rivers.
