These regulations apply the Pay Equity Act to a grouping of ministers’ offices, treating them as a single employer under the Act, with specific adaptations to provisions related to pay equity plans, employee counts, committee establishment, and penalties, and they come into force upon registration. The grouping is subject to the Act upon the coming into force of the grouping order or upon a new Prime Minister’s appointment, with certain provisions (such as sections 30, 61(2), 62(4), 63, 78(2), 107, and 113) not applying, and special rules governing plan updates, employee thresholds, and compliance obligations.
