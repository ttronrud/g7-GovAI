This regulation repeals the old Duties Relief Regulations and replaces them with new rules that provide relief from duty payments for certain imported and exported goods, such as textiles, spirits, and specific types of ships and aircraft, under specific conditions including time limits for export and eligibility based on product class and use. It also outlines requirements for applications, certificates, reporting, and conditions under which certificates can be amended, suspended, or cancelled.
