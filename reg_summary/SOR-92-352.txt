These Regulations establish requirements for banks to protect and maintain their assets by maintaining secure records, ensuring proper custody of securities, depositing transaction proceeds daily, registering securities in the bank’s name where possible, and obtaining insurance or bonds to cover losses from fraud, theft, or damage. The regulations also set minimum standards for insurance coverage and procedures, with certain exemptions for government-controlled, pledged, or temporarily held securities.
