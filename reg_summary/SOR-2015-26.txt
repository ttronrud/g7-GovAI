The Railway Safety Management System Regulations, 2015 establish minimum safety management requirements for railway companies, including mandatory processes for accountability, safety policy, risk assessment, incident reporting, employee safety training, and continual improvement. The regulations are divided into three parts, with distinct requirements for companies operating on main tracks, non-main tracks, and local railway companies, and require the maintenance of detailed records and periodic audits to ensure compliance and safety.
