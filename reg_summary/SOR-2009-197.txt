This regulation establishes voluntary limits on volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations in automotive refinishing products, such as coatings and surface cleaners, to protect human health and the environment. It prohibits the manufacture, import, or sale of such products with VOC levels exceeding specified thresholds, unless the product is diluted or the manufacturer/importer holds a permit under conditions that ensure compliance and a plan for eventual reduction of VOC content.
