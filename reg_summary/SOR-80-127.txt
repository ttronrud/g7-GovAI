This regulation revokes the previous National Parks Camping Regulations and establishes new rules governing camping on public lands in Canadian national parks, requiring all campers to hold a valid camping permit and outlining specific conditions for campsite use, including restrictions on structures, vehicles, fires, noise, and animal keeping. It also establishes rules for permit issuance, seasonal camping, and enforcement actions, including permit cancellation and removal of non-compliant equipment.
