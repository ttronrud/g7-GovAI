This regulation establishes the Ontario Grapes-for-Processing Order and grants the Ontario Grape Growers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board) the authority to impose and collect levies or charges on grape producers and marketers within Ontario for interprovincial and export trade, with the funds used to cover expenses, losses, and to equalize revenues among producers. The Board may classify producers into groups and set different levies based on group, and these levies can be used to create reserves and manage financial adjustments among grape producers.
