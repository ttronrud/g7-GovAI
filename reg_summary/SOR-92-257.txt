These regulations, effective June 1, 1992, allow a trust or loan company to use its name in documents related to securities transactions—such as prospectuses or takeover bids—if required by law or if the company has given explicit written permission. The regulations are known as the Name Use (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations.
