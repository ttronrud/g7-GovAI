The Government of Canada, acting on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, excluded certain short-term appointments (less than three months, totaling less than six months in any 12-month period) in specific groups within the Department of Public Works from the Public Service Employment Act for the period April 1 to December 31, 1993. These regulations allow the Deputy Minister or an authorized individual to recruit, appoint, and terminate such short-term employees for cause or due to lack of work, with one day’s notice.
