The Canadian government has enacted the Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemicals Regulations to establish additional standards complementary to international maritime pollution conventions, ensuring the prevention of pollution from ships, particularly concerning dangerous chemicals and emissions. These regulations apply to various types of vessels, define key terms related to hazardous materials and operations, and set requirements for safe handling, discharge control, and environmental protection in Canadian waters and beyond.
