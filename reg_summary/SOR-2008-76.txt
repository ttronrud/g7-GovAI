These regulations exclude employment at the Point Lepreau nuclear facility from most provisions of the Canada Labour Code and the Non-smokers’ Health Act, except for specific sections related to labour standards, occupational health and safety, and industrial relations, with certain acts and regulations incorporated by reference to apply instead. The exclusion is due to the facility’s unique status as a nuclear site regulated under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, and the regulations clarify how applicable laws are interpreted to reflect the facility’s operational and safety requirements.
