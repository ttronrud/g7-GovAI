The National Parks Highway Traffic Regulations govern the operation and parking of motor vehicles within national parks, specifying that only authorized vehicles may operate on park highways, with restrictions on speed, parking, and vehicle types. Certain vehicles, such as trucks over 4,550 kg, buses, and all-terrain or over-snow vehicles, require special permits or written permission from the superintendent, and specific rules apply to parking, safety, and use of park roads, especially in high-risk or winter conditions.
