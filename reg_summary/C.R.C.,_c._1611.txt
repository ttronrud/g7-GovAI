The regulation specifies that the Commissioner of Yukon must take and subscribe the oath of allegiance as set out in the Oaths of Allegiance Act and the oath of office as outlined in Schedule I, both of which must be sworn before a judge of the Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory or a police magistrate in their absence. This regulation was repealed by SOR/2003-116, sections 23, 25, and 26.
