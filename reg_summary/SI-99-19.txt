This regulation implements a revised tax treaty between Canada and France to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion, updating provisions on taxable income, residency, permanent establishments, dividends, and tax credits, with specific limits on tax rates and conditions for applying treaty benefits. It came into force on September 1, 1998, and applies to income and capital taxes, including adjustments to how dividends are taxed and how residency and permanent establishments are defined.
