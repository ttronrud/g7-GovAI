The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources revoked the 1985 satellite remote sensing fees order and introduced a new fee structure in 1987, specifying charges for various satellite imagery and services, with reduced payment rates (91%, 88%, 85%) for multiple scenes under certain conditions. Fees are set per item in the schedule, based on product type and size, and apply to both satellite operators and ground station operators.
