This regulation grants customs duty remissions to specified manufacturers of outerwear apparel imported into Canada, with the amount of remission decreasing over time—from full remission in 1998–2004 to partial remissions of up to 75% in later years—subject to eligibility, claim deadlines, and annual caps. The order defines "outerwear apparel" and "outerwear fabric" and applies to manufacturers listed in the schedule for imports between 1998 and 2012.
