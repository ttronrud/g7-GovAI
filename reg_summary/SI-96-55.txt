This regulation proclaims June 21 each year as "National Aboriginal Day" to recognize and celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples of Canada—Indian, Inuit, and Métis—highlighting their cultural heritage, particularly the significance of the summer solstice. The proclamation was issued by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 1996.
