This proclamation declares a public order emergency in Canada due to widespread blockades and threats of violence, and authorizes special temporary measures to regulate public assemblies, enforce essential services, restrict blockade-related activities, and protect critical infrastructure and economic stability. It empowers authorities to take actions such as imposing fines, authorizing law enforcement to enforce municipal laws, and requiring financial institutions to report transactions linked to blockade supporters.
