This regulation revokes the previous National Parks Fire Protection Regulations and establishes new rules governing fire prevention, use, and management within Canadian national parks, including restrictions on starting fires, storage of flammable materials, and inspections by authorized personnel. It exempts certain officials and applies specific prohibitions and permit requirements to ensure public safety and protect park resources.
