The Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board, authorizes the Minister to set charges for using Canadian Coast Guard pollution countermeasures equipment, ensuring these charges cover the costs of purchasing, maintaining, and replacing the equipment. The charges must be based on the equipment's replacement value and must recover actual costs.
