This regulatory order authorizes truck operators, shippers, and port authorities to adhere to a Memorandum of Agreement to resolve a dispute disrupting container movement at the Port of Vancouver and the Port of Fraser River, and directs both port authorities to implement licensing systems that require signatory status to the agreement and participation in an arbitration process, all without being bound by the Competition Act during the 90-day effective period. The order is made under section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act to prevent an imminent extraordinary disruption to the national transportation system.
