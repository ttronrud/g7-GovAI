The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations, 2014, establish the organizational structure, ranks, duties, and administrative procedures for the RCMP, including definitions of key roles, precedence rules, reserve appointments, service requirements, conduct standards, and uniform and badge regulations. These regulations also outline procedures for appeals, resignations, reinstatement, and the provision of living accommodations, all under the authority of the Commissioner and subject to Ministerial and Treasury Board approval.
