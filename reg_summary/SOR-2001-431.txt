These regulations establish restrictions on specialized financing activities by trust and loan companies, prohibiting investments in certain types of entities (such as motor vehicle leasing or insurance brokerage firms), limiting the duration of control or investment in specialized financing entities to 13 consecutive years, and setting capital-based thresholds (up to 10% or 25% of regulatory capital) to prevent excessive exposure. They also define key terms and apply specific limits to the balance sheet value and debt levels of specialized financing entities.
