The Governor General in Council has revoked the previous Protection of Securities Regulations and replaced them with new Protection of Assets (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations, which establish detailed requirements for cooperative credit associations to safeguard their assets, including maintaining written procedures, securing securities, depositing transaction proceeds, registering securities, and obtaining insurance against loss due to fraud, damage, or theft.
