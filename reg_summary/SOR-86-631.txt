This regulation revokes previous rules and authorizes the Minister of Transport to establish charges for the use of various aviation facilities, services, or aerodromes, as well as for issuing or managing documents under the Aeronautics Act. It allows the Minister to set fees for services provided by or on behalf of the Government, regardless of whether flights originate or terminate in Canada.
