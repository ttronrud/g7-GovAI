These regulations establish the procedures for property assessments and appeals within First Nations, requiring that assessment laws incorporate provincial appeal procedures, allow for reconsideration and appeals to a review board composed of qualified members, and provide clear timelines and rules for hearings and decisions. Appeals can be brought to court within 30 days of a board decision on questions of law.
