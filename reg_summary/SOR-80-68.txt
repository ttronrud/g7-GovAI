This regulation establishes the Canadian Human Rights Benefit Regulations, which define key terms related to pension and insurance plans and outline specific provisions that do not constitute discriminatory practices under the Canadian Human Rights Act, particularly when based on actuarial assumptions related to age, marital status, family status, or health requirements. It ensures that certain differential treatment in benefit plans—such as retirement ages, benefit amounts, or eligibility conditions—is permissible if it is grounded in actuarial calculations and does not discriminate on prohibited grounds.
