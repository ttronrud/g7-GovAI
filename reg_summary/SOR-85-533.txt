This 1985 regulation establishes the Manitoba Chicken Marketing Levies Order, requiring chicken producers in Manitoba to pay a levy of $0.0076 per kilogram of live weight on all chickens marketed interprovincially or exported. The levy must be paid within seven days of the week in which the chickens were sold, and can be deducted from the purchase price, with the purchaser remitting the levy to the Commodity Board.
