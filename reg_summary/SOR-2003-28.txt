The Minister of the Environment has adopted the Rules of Procedure for Boards of Review under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, to govern the conduct of inquiries into environmental matters, including procedures for hearings, submissions, expert evidence, intervenor applications, and cost awards. These rules ensure transparency, fairness, and consistency in proceedings while allowing flexibility for the Board to adapt procedures as needed.
