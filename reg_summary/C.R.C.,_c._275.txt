These regulations establish the requirements for hog farm registration in Saskatchewan for interprovincial and export trade, requiring all producers to obtain a farm unit registration number from the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission before marketing hogs. The registration applies only to hogs produced in Saskatchewan and is obtained upon the first shipment of hogs by a producer.
