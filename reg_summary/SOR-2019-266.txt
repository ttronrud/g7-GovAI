These regulations establish an output-based pricing system for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from covered industrial facilities in Canada, setting emission limits based on production levels and defining how emissions are quantified, reported, and verified. They also outline procedures for compensation of excess emissions, issuance of surplus credits, and conditions under which a facility may lose its covered status.
