The Inuvik Airport Zoning Regulations establish height and land-use restrictions around Inuvik Airport to ensure aviation safety, limiting structures and natural growth to stay below specified approach, transitional, and outer surfaces. These regulations apply to lands within a defined radius and around the airport, with specific geometric and elevation requirements for safety zones.
