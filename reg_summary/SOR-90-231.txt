The Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency revokes the previous quota regulations and introduces a new quota system effective May 2, 1990, under which provincial Commodity Boards assign federal quotas to turkey producers for interprovincial and export trade, based on production levels and market changes, ensuring total marketing does not exceed provincial limits. These quotas are divided into breeder, broiler, hen, and tom allotments, with overage penalties and adjustments to future allocations.
