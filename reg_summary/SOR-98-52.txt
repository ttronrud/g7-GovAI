These regulations establish the requirements for proving the origin of imported goods to claim preferential tariff treatment, outlining exemptions for certain goods (such as casual goods, low-value commercial goods, and specific types like textile and apparel goods) and specifying acceptable documentation, including Certificates of Origin, exporter statements, and declarations, which must be submitted at designated times. The regulations also define key terms and provide for translations of documents when necessary, with certificates generally valid for up to four years.
