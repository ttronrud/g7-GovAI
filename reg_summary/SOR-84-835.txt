This regulation establishes a levy system for turkey producers in Manitoba, requiring them to pay 1.5 cents per kilogram of live weight on turkeys sold interprovincially or exported, with payments due within seven days of the week in which the turkeys are sold. The levy can be deducted from the purchaser's payment and remitted to the Board, except for turkeys less than 10 days old.
