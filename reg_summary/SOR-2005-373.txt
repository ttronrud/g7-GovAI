The Public Service Commission has established regulations outlining the requirements for employees seeking permission to engage in political activities or take leave without pay, including detailed disclosures about their duties, position, and electoral involvement, and setting clear timelines and procedures for investigating allegations of improper political conduct. The Commission must review all submitted information, issue written decisions within 30 days, and may disclose personal information if it promotes political impartiality, accountability, or proper practices.
