These regulations establish the operational and administrative framework for the Post Office Savings Bank, outlining account types, withdrawal procedures, closure rules, and the handling of deceased depositors' funds, while granting the Director of Accounting authority to manage accounts, maintain records, and enforce compliance with specific conditions. The regulations also specify procedures for account closure, pass-book management, and the distribution of deposits upon death, with varying rights based on relationship or legal status, and include provisions for record retention and service charges.
