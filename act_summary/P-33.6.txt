The Public Service Pension Adjustment Act increases the annual pension rates of eligible recipients—such as employees, widows, children, and orphans—based on their pension class, salary level, and length of service, with limits to prevent total pension amounts from exceeding specified thresholds. Increases are calculated using a formula tied to salary and service periods, and are subject to caps and conditions, especially when recipients receive multiple pensions or exceed certain income levels.
