The Sioux Valley Dakota Nation Governance Act enacts and gives legal effect to the Governance Agreement and Tripartite Governance Agreement between the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation, the Government of Canada, and the Government of Manitoba, establishing a government-to-government relationship, recognizing the Nation as a legal entity with full rights and powers, and providing that Sioux Valley Dakota Nation laws prevail over conflicting federal laws. It also outlines the jurisdiction of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench, ensures judicial notice of the agreements and laws, and provides mechanisms for dispute resolution involving the Nation’s self-governance.
