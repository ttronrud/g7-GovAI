The Conflict of Interest Act establishes clear rules to prevent conflicts of interest for public office holders in Canada by prohibiting actions that could benefit their private interests, requiring disclosure of assets and liabilities, and restricting relationships with family members, businesses, and public sector entities. It also mandates recusal in cases of conflict, sets limits on gifts and travel, and ensures transparency through regular reporting to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.
