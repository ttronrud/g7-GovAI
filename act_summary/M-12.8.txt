The Multilateral Instrument in Respect of Tax Conventions Act implements the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) multilateral convention in Canada, modifying existing tax treaties to prevent tax avoidance through aggressive international planning, ensure profits are taxed where economic activities occur, and eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation. It supersedes conflicting treaty provisions and requires notification and coordination among jurisdictions to apply consistent, harmonized rules on residency, taxation of income and capital, and treaty benefits.
