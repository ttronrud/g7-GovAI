The Surplus Crown Assets Act establishes a framework for the identification, disposal, and management of surplus Crown assets held by federal departments or federal bodies, allowing the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of these assets, with specific provisions for revenue sharing and administrative expenses. It ensures that departments and federal bodies remain responsible for accepted assets until custody is formally transferred and outlines the Minister’s broad powers to manage and dispose of such assets in the public interest.
