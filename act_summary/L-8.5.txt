This Act designates January 21 as "Lincoln Alexander Day" to honor the legacy of Colonel The Honourable Lincoln MacCauley Alexander, the first Black Canadian elected to Parliament, appointed as a Cabinet minister, and served as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. The day recognizes his contributions to public service, education, and race relations, though it is not a legal holiday.
