The Farm Debt Mediation Act establishes a framework for farmers in financial distress to apply for a stay of proceedings, financial review, and mediation with their creditors—either all creditors or only secured creditors—to reach mutually acceptable debt arrangements, while protecting farmers’ assets during the process. It includes provisions for administrator appointments, mediation, appeals, guardianship of assets, and restrictions on future applications to prevent repeated use of the system.
