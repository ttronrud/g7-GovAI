The Privileges and Immunities (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) Act approves the Ottawa Agreement and Paris Protocol, granting the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and its personnel immunities, privileges, and rights to operate in Canada, including immunity from legal process, tax exemptions, and freedom of movement, while also allowing the Governor in Council to issue orders to implement these provisions. It ensures that NATO officials and international military staff enjoy diplomatic-level immunities and privileges, subject to conditions and the right of member states to waive such immunities when necessary.
