The Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act ensures that consumers and employees in Quebec have the right to communicate and work in French with federally regulated private businesses, mandates the use of French in communications, documents, and workplace operations, and prohibits adverse treatment of employees for exercising these rights. It also establishes a framework for enforcement through the Commissioner of Official Languages and aligns with Quebec’s Charter of the French Language where applicable.
