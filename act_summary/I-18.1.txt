This Act retrospectively treats certain actions taken after November 15, 1994, relating to the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund and the Multilateral Fund for the Montreal Protocol as having been taken in accordance with a specific Order in Council, as if that order had been in force from the start. However, it does not apply to actions taken after or in relation to a later Order in Council, P.C. 1996-1784.
