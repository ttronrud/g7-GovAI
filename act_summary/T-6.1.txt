The Telesat Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act reorganizes Telesat Canada by transferring its shares from Her Majesty in right of Canada and the Canadian National Railway Company to the Minister of Finance, who holds them in trust for the Crown, and authorizes the Minister to sell or dispose of those shares. It also establishes Telesat’s continued operation as a commercial satellite telecommunications provider under the Canada Business Corporations Act, while repealing the Telesat Canada Act and ensuring regulatory and financial qualifications for Telesat’s investments and obligations.
