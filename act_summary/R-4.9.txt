The Regional Development Incentives Act provides for financial incentives—such as development incentives and loan guarantees—to support the establishment, expansion, or modernization of manufacturing or commercial facilities in designated regions that lack sufficient employment opportunities, with conditions related to job creation, environmental impact, and timely commercial production. Incentives are capped based on capital costs and job numbers, and the Minister must determine that the project will significantly contribute to economic growth and social adjustment in the region.
