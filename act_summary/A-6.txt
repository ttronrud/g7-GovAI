The Agricultural Products Marketing Act authorizes the federal government to grant interprovincial and export marketing powers to provincial boards or agencies, allowing them to impose levies or charges on agricultural producers to equalize revenues and manage market conditions. These levies can be used for operational expenses, reserves, and revenue equalization, and violations of regulations are punishable by fine or imprisonment.
