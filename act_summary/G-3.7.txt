The Government Annuities Act establishes a framework for the government to sell annuities to individuals, employers, and fraternal societies in Canada, with restrictions on annuity amounts, terms, and transferability, while providing protections for annuitants and ensuring annuities are exempt from bankruptcy and insolvency laws. It also includes provisions for conversion to spouses or common-law partners, repayment of deposits upon death, and detailed regulations on valuation, administration, and financial accountability.
