The Canadian Navigable Waters Act regulates activities involving works in navigable waters by requiring approvals for major or certain other works that could interfere with navigation, while allowing minor works to be constructed with fewer restrictions. The Minister must consider Indigenous rights and environmental impacts when granting approvals and may impose conditions to ensure navigation safety and public interest.
