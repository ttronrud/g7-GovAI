The Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act establishes a federal-provincial cooperative framework to facilitate the exploration, development, and operation of the Donkin coal block in Nova Scotia, while exempting it from most federal resource and labour laws and reserving royalties for the federal government, with the Province receiving a share through agreed-upon arrangements. It defines the boundaries of the coal block, outlines the roles of the federal and provincial governments, and allows for regulations on employment, environmental standards, and royalty collection.
