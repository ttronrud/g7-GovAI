The Canadian Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act enacts the legal framework to implement the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, promoting the free movement of persons, goods, services, and investments to enhance competitiveness and sustainable development. It establishes procedures for enforcement, appoints representatives, and grants the Governor in Council broad authority to manage implementation, including suspending provincial benefits or enforcing penalties under specific conditions.
