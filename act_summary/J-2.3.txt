The Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law) establishes Canada’s authority to impose economic sanctions on foreign nationals or states responsible for gross human rights violations, particularly those involving torture, extrajudicial killings, or corruption committed against individuals seeking to expose wrongdoing or protect fundamental rights. It enables the government to restrict financial transactions, seize property, and forfeit assets linked to such violations, while ensuring due process and victim compensation.
