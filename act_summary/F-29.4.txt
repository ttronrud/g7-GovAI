The Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act establishes the legal framework for the privileges and immunities of foreign diplomatic missions, consular posts, and international organizations in Canada, aligns them with international conventions, and grants the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Governor in Council authority to grant, withdraw, or restore such privileges and immunities on a case-by-case basis, ensuring comparable treatment for Canadian missions abroad. It also defines specific rights for representatives of international organizations, political subdivisions, and individuals, while setting out enforcement mechanisms, offences for unauthorized representation, and provisions for the security and evidence of such missions.
