The Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation and Offshore Renewable Energy Management Act establishes the Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator to oversee offshore petroleum and renewable energy activities in a shared jurisdiction, ensuring cooperation between federal and provincial governments, protecting Indigenous rights, and providing a framework for decision-making, consultation, and regulatory oversight in the offshore area. It implements the 1986 Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord and introduces new provisions for managing offshore renewable energy projects, while excluding the Accord from applying to renewable energy resources.
