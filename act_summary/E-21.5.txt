The Expungement of Historically Unjust Convictions Act allows for the expungement of convictions related to outdated and discriminatory offences—such as those criminalizing same-sex intimacy or indecent acts—that are now considered historical injustices and inconsistent with modern Canadian values and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Parole Board of Canada can order expungement if certain criteria are met, effectively erasing the conviction from public records and removing its legal and social consequences.
