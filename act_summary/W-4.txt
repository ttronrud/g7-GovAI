The Dominion Water Power Act establishes that all water powers on public lands in Canada are owned by the Crown and subject to the administration of the Minister of Indigenous Services (or Northern Affairs in Nunavut), with the goal of ensuring their development for the general advantage of Canada. It grants the Minister broad powers to regulate, acquire, and manage water-power undertakings, including the right to expropriate land, conduct surveys, and establish controls over water use, power generation, and distribution.
