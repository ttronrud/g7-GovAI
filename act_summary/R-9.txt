The Royal Canadian Mint Act establishes the Royal Canadian Mint as a body corporate under Her Majesty in right of Canada, granting it the authority to mint both circulation and non-circulation coins, produce medals and other objects, and engage in financial and industrial activities related to metals, all subject to ministerial approval and oversight. The Mint operates with specific powers to issue coins, determine their design and specifications, manage its finances, and operate as a corporate entity, while its directors and officers are subject to eligibility requirements and accountability to the federal government.
