The Bills of Lading Act vests consignees and endorsers with full rights and liabilities regarding goods as if they were direct parties to the shipping contract, and makes a bill of lading conclusive evidence of shipment unless there is actual notice of misrepresentation or a contrary stipulation. It preserves existing rights of stoppage, unpaid vendors, and freight claims, and allows the shipper or holder to exonerate the carrier if the misrepresentation was due solely to their own fault.
