The Federal Courts Act establishes the Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court of Canada, defining their structure, jurisdiction, and judicial appointments, while providing for the administration of justice, the powers of judges and associate judges, and procedures for hearings and appeals. It also outlines the rules governing judicial conduct, retirement, and the division of responsibilities between the two courts.
