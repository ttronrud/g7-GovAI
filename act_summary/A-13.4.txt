The Assisted Human Reproduction Act establishes strict regulations on the use of assisted reproductive technologies in Canada, prioritizing the health, safety, and dignity of individuals, particularly women, while prohibiting human cloning, commercialization of reproductive materials, and the creation or use of chimeras or hybrids. It ensures informed consent, protects against exploitation, and restricts the use of sperm, ova, and embryos to specific relationships and ethical boundaries.
