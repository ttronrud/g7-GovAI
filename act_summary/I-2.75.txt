The Impact Assessment Act establishes a comprehensive process to prevent or mitigate significant adverse environmental and social effects within federal jurisdiction by requiring impact assessments for designated projects, integrating Indigenous knowledge, ensuring meaningful public participation, and promoting sustainability and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples of Canada. It defines key terms, outlines responsibilities of federal authorities, and sets standards for fairness, transparency, and scientific integrity in the assessment process.
