The Veterans Benefit Act establishes eligibility and benefits for members of the Canadian Forces who served in theatres of operations during the Korean War, particularly those who served in special forces, and extends certain veterans' benefits, including war service gratuities, insurance, land grants, and pension-related protections, to these individuals and their dependants. It also ensures that prior rights and benefits are not prejudiced, and includes provisions for payment of gratuities upon discharge or death, as well as for dependents or the service estate in the case of death.
