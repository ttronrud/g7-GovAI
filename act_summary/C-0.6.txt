The Canada-Argentina Income Tax Convention Act, 1994 establishes a framework for avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion between Canada and Argentina by defining the tax treatment of income and capital gains, residency rules, permanent establishments, and dividends. It ensures that income earned by residents in one country from sources in the other is taxed only in the appropriate jurisdiction, with specific rules on taxation of profits, dividends, and cross-border business activities.
