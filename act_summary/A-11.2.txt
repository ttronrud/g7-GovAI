The Animal Pedigree Act establishes a framework for the incorporation of animal pedigree associations that register and identify animals of distinct or evolving breeds, with the primary goals of promoting breed improvement and protecting breeders. These associations must be authorized by the Minister, operate under strict conditions, and maintain detailed records, while their by-laws and amendments require Ministerial approval to ensure accountability and public interest.
