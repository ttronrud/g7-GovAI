The Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act establishes strict regulations to prevent pollution in Canada's arctic waters by prohibiting the deposit of waste in these areas and imposing strict liability on individuals and shipowners for any such pollution. It also requires financial responsibility through insurance or bonds for activities that could lead to waste deposition and sets standards for ship navigation, construction, and safety in arctic zones to protect the environment and the rights of Inuit and other arctic inhabitants.
