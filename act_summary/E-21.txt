The Expropriation Act allows the Crown to expropriate land or real rights for public works or purposes, with certain restrictions requiring Governor in Council consent for specific lands or communities. It establishes a process involving notices of intention, public hearings, and objections, and includes provisions for railway companies to request expropriation of land for railway purposes, with associated fees and restrictions on alienation.
