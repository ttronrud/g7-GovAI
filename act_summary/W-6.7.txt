The Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act approves and gives legal effect to the 1984 Agreement between the Inuvialuit and the Government of Canada, settling native claims in the Northwest Territories and Yukon by granting the Inuvialuit rights to land, hunting, fishing, cultural preservation, and economic participation, while extinguishing all prior native title claims in exchange for compensation and other benefits.
