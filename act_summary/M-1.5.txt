The Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act repeals the Canadian Wheat Board and transitions its operations, requiring the Corporation to apply for continuance under a federal corporate act within four years, with specific winding-up provisions, debt settlement, and dissolution rules. It establishes a framework for the Corporation’s final operations, including final pool periods, claim submission, and the transfer of remaining assets to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
