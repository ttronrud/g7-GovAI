The National Health and Fitness Day Act designates the first Saturday in June as National Health and Fitness Day to promote physical activity, improve public health, and encourage participation in recreational sports and fitness activities across Canada. This day is not a legal holiday but serves as a celebration of health and wellness through local events and the use of community facilities and natural environments.
