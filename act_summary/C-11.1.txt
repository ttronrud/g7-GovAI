This Act implements the Canada–Yukon Oil and Gas Accord by establishing the transfer of oil and gas administration from federal to territorial control in the Yukon Territory, ensuring the continuity and protection of existing federal interests while aligning them with Yukon oil and gas laws. It provides for indemnification between the federal and territorial governments, preserves rights under federal licences, and mandates the application of Yukon laws after a specified transfer date.
