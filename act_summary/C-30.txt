The Canada-United Kingdom Civil and Commercial Judgments Convention Act enables the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments between Canada and the United Kingdom, subject to specific exclusions and conditions, and provides for the registration of judgments in each country through streamlined procedures. The Convention applies to judgments involving monetary claims, excludes certain types of judgments (such as those related to family law or bankruptcy), and includes provisions on jurisdiction, public policy, and the rights of judgment debtors, while also allowing for mutual declarations regarding territorial extensions and treaty obligations.
