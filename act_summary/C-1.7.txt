The Canada Cooperatives Act establishes a modern, unified legal framework for cooperatives in Canada, setting out the principles, governance, and operational rules that apply to cooperatives organized and operated on cooperative principles. It defines key terms, outlines requirements for incorporation, and ensures that cooperatives serve their members’ interests through democratic participation, equitable treatment, and community development.
