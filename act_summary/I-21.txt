The Interpretation Act provides comprehensive rules for the interpretation of Acts and regulations in Canada, ensuring clarity, consistency, and fairness in their application. It establishes principles such as the presumption that enactments are remedial, that they uphold Indigenous rights, and that common and civil law are equally authoritative, while also defining key terms, determining effective dates, and governing the operation of public offices and corporate entities.
