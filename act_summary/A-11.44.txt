The Antarctic Environmental Protection Act establishes a comprehensive framework to protect the Antarctic environment by implementing the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, restricting Canadian activities in the region, requiring permits for entry and operations, and prohibiting harmful actions such as disturbing native species, introducing non-indigenous species, or discharging waste. It ensures environmental safeguards through strict regulations, environmental assessments, and enforcement powers.
