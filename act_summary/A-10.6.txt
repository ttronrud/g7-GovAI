The Alberta Natural Resources Act establishes a comprehensive agreement between the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta, transferring administrative control of Crown lands, mines, minerals, water rights, and royalties to Alberta, placing it on equal footing with the original provinces of Confederation in managing its natural resources. It also includes provisions for financial compensation based on population, protection of Indigenous rights and historic sites, and specific exceptions for certain lands, reserves, and national parks.
