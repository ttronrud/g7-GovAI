The Prince Rupert Grain Handling Operations Act reinstates grain handling operations at the Prince Rupert terminal and extends the collective agreement through 1989, ensuring employees resume work and prohibiting strikes or lockouts during the extended term. It also establishes an arbitrator to resolve disputes over staffing, job classifications, and security, with the resulting decisions incorporated into the agreement.
