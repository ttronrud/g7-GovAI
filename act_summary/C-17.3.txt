The Department of Canadian Heritage Act establishes a new federal department to oversee matters related to Canadian identity, culture, heritage, and multiculturalism, including arts, language, sports, broadcasting (excluding spectrum), and national symbols, with the Minister of Canadian Heritage holding broad authority over these areas. The Act also transfers key responsibilities and assets from the National Capital Commission to the Department of Canadian Heritage, and provides mechanisms for fee-setting, funding, and intergovernmental coordination.
