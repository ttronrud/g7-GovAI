The Trademarks Act establishes the legal framework for the registration, use, and protection of trademarks and certification marks in Canada, defining key terms such as distinctive, confusing, and geographical indications, and prohibiting false or misleading use of marks, including those resembling official emblems or protected symbols. It also outlines the conditions under which a mark may be registered or used, including requirements for distinctiveness, non-confusion, and compliance with international agreements.
