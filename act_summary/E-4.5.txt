The Emergencies Act empowers the Governor in Council to declare national emergencies—either public welfare or public order—when a situation seriously endangers lives, health, or security and exceeds provincial capacity, allowing for special temporary measures such as travel restrictions, evacuations, and emergency regulations, all subject to parliamentary oversight, consultation with provincial governments, and safeguards to protect fundamental rights.
