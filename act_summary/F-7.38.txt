This Act establishes a federal framework to address post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by requiring the Minister of Health to convene a conference and develop guidelines on diagnosis, treatment, and best practices, while also creating standardized educational materials and publishing a comprehensive report within 18 months of the Act coming into force. It mandates a five-year review of the framework’s effectiveness and requires periodic reporting to Parliament.
