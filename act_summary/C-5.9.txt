The Canada–Greece Tax Convention Act, 2010 establishes a tax treaty between Canada and Greece to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains, defining residency, permanent establishments, and the taxation of dividends, profits, and income from property. It provides rules for determining which country has the right to tax various types of income and ensures that tax treatments are consistent with international standards.
