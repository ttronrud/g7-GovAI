The Department for Women and Gender Equality Act establishes a new federal department to advance gender equality, promote understanding of the intersection of sex, gender, and other identity factors, and coordinate policies related to women and gender-diverse people across all areas of life. It creates a Minister for Women and Gender Equality with broad powers to develop, implement, and fund programs, research, and partnerships, while ensuring continuity of existing roles and responsibilities.
