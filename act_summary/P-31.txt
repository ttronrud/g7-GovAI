The Public Officers Act authorizes the Governor in Council to regulate which federal officers receive commissions under the Great or Privy Seal and to specify the fees associated with them, with these commissions being recorded and publicly announced in the Canada Gazette. The list of commissions issued each year is presented to Parliament within 15 days of the start of the next session.
