The Canada–United States Enhanced Tax Information Exchange Agreement Implementation Act establishes the legal framework for the automatic exchange of financial account information between Canada and the United States, based on the principles of FATCA, to improve tax compliance while respecting confidentiality and avoiding duplicative reporting. It defines key terms related to financial institutions, accounts, and reporting obligations and provides for regulations, publication of key dates, and the supremacy of the Agreement over conflicting domestic laws.
