The Criminal Code is the principal law of Canada that defines crimes, outlines criminal procedures, and establishes the framework for the administration of justice in criminal matters. It provides definitions of key terms and sets out the legal responsibilities of various individuals and institutions, including peace officers, prosecutors, judges, and participants in the justice system.
