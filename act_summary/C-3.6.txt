The Canada Education Savings Act encourages early savings for children’s post-secondary education by providing CES grants and Canada Learning Bonds to eligible beneficiaries in registered education savings plans. These financial incentives are based on income thresholds, eligibility criteria, and contributions made by or on behalf of a subscriber, with limits on total amounts payable over a beneficiary’s lifetime.
