The Firearms Act establishes a comprehensive framework for the licensing, possession, and regulation of firearms, prohibited weapons, and related items in Canada, including requirements for safety courses, eligibility criteria, and restrictions based on criminal history or mental health. It aims to ensure public safety by controlling who can possess or transfer firearms, while allowing authorized activities such as manufacturing, importing, exporting, and selling under strict conditions.
