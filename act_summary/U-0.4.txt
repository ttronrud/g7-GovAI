This Act designates the fourth Saturday in November each year as Ukrainian Famine and Genocide ("Holodomor") Memorial Day to honor the victims of the 1932–33 famine in Ukraine, which is recognized as an act of genocide under international law. The day is intended for remembrance and education, but is not a legal holiday or a non-juridical day.
