The Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act establishes a fund to provide financial contributions to eligible recipients for large-scale projects that enhance strategic infrastructure, supporting economic growth and quality of life across Canada. Eligible recipients include provincial, municipal, and certain private sector bodies capable of carrying out such projects, with the Minister able to enter into agreements to fund them, and regulations allowing for flexibility in defining infrastructure and project scale.
