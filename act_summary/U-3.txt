The United States Wreckers Act allows U.S. vessels and wrecking appliances to salvage wrecked property and provide aid, including towing, to vessels in distress in Canadian waters adjacent to the United States, without restriction under Canadian customs or coasting laws. The Act expires when the Governor General issues a proclamation indicating that the reciprocal rights for Canadian vessels in U.S. waters have been withdrawn or invalidated.
