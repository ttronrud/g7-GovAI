The National Council for Reconciliation Act establishes an independent, Indigenous-led organization to monitor, evaluate, and report on Canada’s progress toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, ensuring accountability, advancing a rights-based approach, and promoting public education and policy development across all sectors of society. The Council is tasked with advancing reconciliation in line with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, including protecting Indigenous languages and rights, while maintaining distinct governance and consultation principles.
