The Canada–Serbia Tax Convention Act, 2013 establishes the legal framework for the Canada–Serbia tax treaty, ensuring that income and capital gains are not taxed twice and clarifying rules on residency, permanent establishments, taxation of dividends, interest, and profits. It provides mechanisms for resolving tax disputes and ensures that tax treatment aligns with international standards, with specific limits on tax rates for dividends and interest when received by residents of the other country.
