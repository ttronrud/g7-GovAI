The Canada–Hong Kong Tax Agreement Act, 2013 establishes and implements a tax treaty between Canada and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income taxes. It defines key terms such as residency, permanent establishment, and taxable income, and outlines rules for taxing business profits, dividends, and income from immovable property, while ensuring that tax provisions in the treaty prevail over conflicting domestic laws.
