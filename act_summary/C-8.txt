The Canada Pension Plan is a federal social insurance program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible contributors based on their earnings and contributory periods. It defines key terms such as pensionable earnings, contributions, and eligibility criteria, and includes provisions for provincial pension plans that may operate in lieu of the federal plan in certain jurisdictions.
