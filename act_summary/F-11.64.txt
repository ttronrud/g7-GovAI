The First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act empowers the Government of Canada to make regulations governing commercial and industrial undertakings on First Nations reserve lands, only at the request of the First Nation, and provides a framework for economic development while respecting aboriginal and treaty rights. These regulations can establish powers, fees, environmental assessments, and dispute resolution mechanisms, and may allow for the registration and transfer of land interests, all while ensuring that provincial laws are incorporated and that federal and First Nation interests are protected.
