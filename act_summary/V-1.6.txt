The Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act establishes an independent board to review and appeal decisions related to veterans’ pensions and benefits, granting it broad powers to hear applications, conduct hearings, and make decisions with full jurisdiction over appeals and reviews. The board consists of permanent and temporary members, operates with procedural fairness and flexibility, and includes provisions for compassionate awards, independent medical advice, and disciplinary inquiries when necessary.
