The Economic Recovery Act (stimulus) authorizes Canada to contribute up to $200 million per fiscal year (totaling $2.5 billion over time) to international organizations for debt relief on behalf of eligible countries, and provides a one-time payment of $174.5 million to Nova Scotia. It also includes amendments to the Canada Pension Plan and specifies the dates on which various sections come into force.
