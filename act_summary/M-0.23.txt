This Act establishes the Department of Employment and Social Development as the main point of contact for Canadians who have recently lost a loved one, streamlining access to government information related to the deceased person’s social insurance number. It ensures that no individual needs to contact multiple government agencies directly, with specific requirements for the Canada Employment Insurance Commission and the Minister to share relevant information under defined conditions.
