The Canada–Poland Tax Convention Act, 2013 establishes a framework to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income taxes between Canada and Poland, defining residency, permanent establishments, and the taxation of income, dividends, and interest, while ensuring that tax treatments comply with the principles of fairness and mutual agreement. It provides specific limits on tax rates for dividends and interest paid between residents of the two countries, and includes provisions for resolving disputes and ensuring consistency between the Convention and domestic tax laws.
