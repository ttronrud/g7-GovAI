The Salaries Act establishes the annual salaries of key Canadian officials, including the lieutenant governor and federal ministers, with salary adjustments based on industrial wage trends, and includes provisions for retroactive payments and salary indexing starting in 2001. It also outlines the structure and responsibilities of ministerial support departments and applies to members of Parliament who make specific election choices regarding retirement benefits.  

*(Note: This Act was repealed in 2012 and 2019, and its provisions have been superseded by more recent legislation.)*
