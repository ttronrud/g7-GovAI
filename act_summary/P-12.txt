The Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act establishes a tax on the production revenue of petroleum and gas in Canada, focusing on production before October 1986 and certain processing activities, while excluding income from production after that date. It defines key terms such as Crown royalty, production royalty, and approved recovery projects, and outlines rules for determining taxable income, exemptions, and corporate associations to prevent tax avoidance.
