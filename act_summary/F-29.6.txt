The Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act prohibits foreign publishers from supplying advertising services directed at the Canadian market to Canadian advertisers, with exceptions for certain low-volume or culturally significant investments. It establishes a regulatory framework for investigations, enforcement actions, and penalties, including fines and court orders, and provides mechanisms for the Minister to intervene and restrict violations.
