The Anishinabek Nation Education Agreement Act establishes a legal framework for First Nations in Ontario to govern and deliver education on their reserves, with the agreement prevailing over conflicting federal laws and enabling the creation of education bodies like the Kinoomaadziwin Education Body and Regional Education Councils. It grants participating First Nations the authority to make education-related laws, ensure education is comparable to Ontario’s public system, and provides mechanisms for implementation and enforcement.
