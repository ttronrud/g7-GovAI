The Canadian Institutes of Health Research Act establishes the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) as a federal agency to lead and transform health research in Canada by promoting scientific excellence, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensuring transparency and accountability. Its objective is to improve health outcomes for Canadians through the creation of new knowledge, its translation into policy and practice, and the development of a robust, inclusive, and internationally competitive health research environment.
