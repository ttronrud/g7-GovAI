The Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Act provides insurance benefits to returned soldiers, widows, and widowers, offering death benefits of up to $5,000, which can be paid as a lump sum or annuity, with provisions for beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries, and disability benefits. It also establishes rules for premium payments, beneficiary designations, and regulations made by the Minister to administer the Act.
