This Act establishes a national strategy for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of mercury-containing lamps, requiring the Minister of the Environment to develop guidelines, identify safe disposal practices, and promote public awareness, with regular reports to Parliament on the strategy's effectiveness. The strategy must be presented to Parliament within two years of the Act's assent, and comprehensive evaluations must be conducted every five years thereafter.
