The First Nations Elections Act establishes a framework for fair and transparent elections of chiefs and councillors in designated First Nations, including definitions of key terms, eligibility requirements, nomination and voting procedures, and rules to prevent fraud and interference. It also allows the Minister to add or remove First Nations from the schedule based on governance concerns or community election codes, and provides for by-elections, tie-breaking mechanisms, and judicial review of election results.
