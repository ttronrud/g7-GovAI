The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act establishes a legal cause of action allowing victims of terrorism to sue perpetrators and their supporters, including listed entities and foreign states, to recover damages and deter future attacks. It strengthens victims' rights by enabling lawsuits even against entities with immunity, with special provisions for jurisdiction, presumption of liability, and recognition of foreign judgments.
