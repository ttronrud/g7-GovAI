The Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act establishes a framework to promote the creation of decent, sustainable jobs as Canada transitions to a net-zero-emissions economy by 2050, emphasizing inclusive growth, worker support, and meaningful engagement with stakeholders including trade unions, Indigenous peoples, and communities. It creates a Sustainable Jobs Partnership Council to provide independent advice on policies, skills development, and labour market impacts, and mandates the federal government to develop and regularly update a Sustainable Jobs Action Plan with public accountability.
