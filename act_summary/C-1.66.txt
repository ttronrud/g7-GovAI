The Canada–Colombia Tax Convention Act, 2010 establishes the legal framework for the Canada-Colombia tax treaty, governing the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion on income and capital gains. It defines key terms such as residency, permanent establishment, and taxable income, and sets rules for the taxation of dividends, profits from international business activities, and income from immovable property, ensuring that tax obligations are determined fairly and consistently between the two countries.
