The Canadian Victims Bill of Rights establishes a comprehensive framework that guarantees victims of crime specific rights throughout the criminal justice process, including access to information, protection from intimidation, privacy, the right to a victim impact statement, and the right to restitution. It also creates a complaints mechanism for victims to address infringements of their rights and mandates that these rights be respected without unduly interfering with the proper administration of justice.
