The Indian Act Amendment and Replacement Act mandates that the Minister of Indigenous Services report annually to Parliament on progress toward developing new legislation to replace the outdated Indian Act, in collaboration with First Nations and other stakeholders. This act reflects Canada's commitment to modernizing Indigenous governance and ensuring equitable, self-determined community development.
