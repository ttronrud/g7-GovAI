This Act establishes the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Energy Regulator to manage offshore petroleum and renewable energy activities in the Atlantic region, with joint governance by Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador, ensuring neither government can amend the Act or its regulations without mutual consent. It creates a shared regulatory framework that prioritizes cooperation, includes provisions for dispute resolution, and ensures the Regulator has corporate powers and independence while maintaining accountability through conflict of interest rules and insurance protections.
