The Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act prohibits the importation of intoxicating liquor into Canadian provinces from outside Canada unless it is purchased by or on behalf of a province’s government or a licensed entity, with specific exceptions for licensed distillers importing bulk spirits from certain countries for packaging purposes. It establishes penalties for violations and outlines procedures for search warrants, seizure, and forfeiture of illicit liquor.
