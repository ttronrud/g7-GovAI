The Budget Implementation Act, 2004 authorizes direct payments from the federal government to provinces and organizations for public health initiatives, including funding for a national immunization strategy and specific cash payments to Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan, as well as allocations to support sustainable development and health infrastructure. These payments are made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and are subject to the terms of trust agreements or ministerial requisitions.
