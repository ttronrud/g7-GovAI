The Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act establishes collective bargaining rights and employment protections for certain staff working in Parliament, including members of the Senate, House of Commons, and key parliamentary offices, while excluding staff of specific MPs and those employed in managerial or confidential roles. It creates a framework for grievance resolution, arbitration, and dispute management through the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board, ensuring employees can organize, participate in negotiations, and seek redress without interference from employers or managerial staff.
