The Telecommunications Act establishes the regulatory framework for telecommunications in Canada, setting out policy objectives to ensure reliable, affordable, and widely accessible services, promote Canadian ownership and control, and support innovation and competition. It regulates Canadian carriers, international telecommunications services, and international submarine cables through licensing, eligibility requirements, and oversight by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), with provisions for public consultation, appeals, and alignment with national policy goals.
