The Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act establishes strict prohibitions on marriage between certain close relatives, such as lineal descendants, brothers, sisters, or half-siblings, by blood, adoption, or affinity, and defines the circumstances under which such marriages are void. The Act comes into force one year after assent or earlier by provincial order, and it consolidates all existing laws in Canada prohibiting marriage based on familial relationships.
