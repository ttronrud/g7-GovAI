The Trust and Loan Companies Act establishes a regulatory framework for trust and loan companies in Canada, defining key terms and setting out rules related to corporate governance, shareholder rights, fiduciary duties, and financial reporting. It replaces the former Trust Companies Act and Loan Companies Act, with provisions addressing matters such as major shareholder thresholds, significant interests, and the responsibilities of directors, officers, and auditors.
