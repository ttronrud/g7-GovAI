The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act enables Canada to fulfill its international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention by prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling, use, or transfer of chemical weapons, regulating the possession and use of toxic chemicals, and establishing a framework for inspections and enforcement. It grants the Minister authority to designate a National Authority, issue inspection certificates, and impose reporting and record-keeping requirements for persons involved in chemical-related activities.
