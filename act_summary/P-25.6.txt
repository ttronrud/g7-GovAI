The *Protecting Air Service Act* suspends lockouts and strikes involving Air Canada and its unions until a new collective agreement is reached, mandates the resumption of air services and employee duties, and establishes an arbitration process to resolve disputes over terms and conditions of employment, with the goal of ensuring economic viability and pension sustainability. The arbitrator’s decision becomes a binding new collective agreement, effective immediately upon issuance, and no court proceedings may challenge the arbitration process.
