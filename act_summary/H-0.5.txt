This Act establishes the continuation of pension, grant, and allowance payments to survivors of the 1917 Halifax explosion by transferring the Halifax Relief Commission’s assets to the Minister of Finance, with the Canadian Pension Commission assuming its responsibilities. It also creates a special fund to manage these payments and provides for the transfer of superannuation funds to the Public Service Superannuation Account.
