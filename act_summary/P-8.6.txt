The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) establishes a framework to govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by organizations in commercial activities, ensuring individuals' privacy rights while allowing necessary uses by organizations. It defines key terms, outlines conditions under which personal information can be collected or disclosed without consent, and sets out obligations for security, accountability, and access to information.
