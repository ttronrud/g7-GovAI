The Canada Consumer Product Safety Act establishes a regulatory framework to protect public health and safety by preventing dangers posed by consumer products, including those imported from abroad, through mandatory compliance requirements, product testing, incident reporting, and enforcement powers. It empowers the Minister of Health to investigate, inspect, recall, and take action against unsafe products, while balancing the need for transparency with the protection of confidential business and personal information.
