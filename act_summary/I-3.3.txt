The Income Tax Act establishes the framework for calculating taxable income in Canada, defining it as a taxpayer’s total income from all sources, adjusted for capital gains, losses, and allowable deductions, and specifying how income from employment, business, or property is determined, including valuable benefits and allowances. It also outlines rules for allocating deductions and determining income from specific sources or locations, with special provisions for certain types of benefits and employment-related expenses.
