The Railway Belt Water Act establishes that all water within the Railway Belt in British Columbia is vested in the Crown, with no private exclusive rights to watercourses unless lawfully established, and ensures that pre-1913 water rights and administrative actions remain valid. It grants the provincial government authority to administer water under the Water Acts, subject to Crown ownership and oversight by the Board, while preserving the validity of prior grants, claims, and applications, and allowing the Governor in Council to extend provincial water laws to the Railway Belt by order.
