The Rouge National Urban Park Act establishes a national urban park in the Rouge Valley to protect its unique natural and cultural heritage, promote ecological integrity, support sustainable agriculture, and provide accessible recreational and educational opportunities for Canadians. It outlines the management responsibilities of the Minister, prohibits harmful activities like hunting and removing natural resources, and allows for public participation, Aboriginal rights, and adaptive regulation to ensure the park’s long-term conservation and community engagement.
