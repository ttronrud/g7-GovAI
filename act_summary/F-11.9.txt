The First Nations Oil and Gas and Moneys Management Act enables eligible First Nations to assume control over oil and gas exploration, exploitation, and related revenues on their reserve lands, including the management of moneys derived from such activities, subject to specific requirements such as preparing oil and gas and financial codes, holding public votes, and ensuring accountability. It transfers these rights and obligations from the federal government to the First Nation upon a formal vote and agreement, while preserving existing treaty rights and land reserves.
