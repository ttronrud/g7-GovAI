The Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act establishes the legal framework to implement the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, aiming to eliminate trade barriers, promote fair competition, increase investment, and strengthen bilateral cooperation while respecting environmental and labor standards. It creates a dedicated commission, outlines procedures for dispute resolution, and grants the Governor in Council authority to regulate and enforce provisions of the agreement, including suspending or modifying federal laws when necessary.
