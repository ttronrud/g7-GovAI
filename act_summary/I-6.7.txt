This Act establishes the legal framework for the 1986 Indian Lands Agreement between Canada and Ontario, enabling specific agreements between the federal and provincial governments and Indigenous bands on matters related to land, natural resources, and governance. These agreements, once confirmed by both governments and the relevant band, become binding and can supersede provisions of the 1924 Agreement, while remaining subject to band custom and governance processes.
