This Act establishes a framework for resolving and extinguishing claims by Indigenous bands in British Columbia related to "cut-off lands" — lands originally set aside for Indigenous use but later abandoned — through negotiated agreements between the bands and the Canadian and provincial governments. These agreements bind current and future band members and successors, but do not constitute an admission of legal obligations by the Crown, and existing agreements prior to the Act's coming into force are automatically valid.
