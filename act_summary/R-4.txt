The Railway Relocation and Crossing Act establishes a framework for the Canadian Transportation Agency to approve transportation and urban development plans in designated areas, allowing for necessary railway modifications—such as line closures, grade separations, or new construction—to accommodate urban growth, with compensation and relocation grants provided to affected railway companies. It sets detailed rules for determining the net costs of railway relocation, including land value changes and maintenance cost adjustments, and ensures that such changes are balanced against benefits to the public and railway companies.
