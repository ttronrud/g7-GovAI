The Western Economic Diversification Act establishes the Department of Western Economic Diversification to promote and coordinate economic development and diversification in Western Canada—comprising Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia—by supporting small and medium enterprises, improving the business environment, conducting policy research, and implementing programs and projects in collaboration with provincial and private stakeholders. The Minister of Western Economic Diversification oversees these efforts, including the power to make loans, grants, and enter into agreements, and is required to submit annual reports to Parliament.
