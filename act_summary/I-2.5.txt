The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act establishes the legal framework for Canada’s immigration and refugee systems, setting out objectives to promote economic growth, cultural diversity, family reunification, and humanitarian protection while ensuring fair, efficient, and transparent processes that uphold human rights and international obligations. It defines key terms, assigns responsibilities to federal and provincial ministers, and outlines procedures for processing applications, managing federal-provincial agreements, and administering immigration and refugee protections.
