The Identification of Criminals Act allows for the fingerprinting, photographing, or other identification measures of individuals charged with or convicted of certain offences, including indictable offences and specific summary conviction offences, with protections against liability for lawfully conducted procedures and requirements for the destruction of records in certain cases. It also establishes a framework for independent reviews and parliamentary oversight of the use of remote proceedings in criminal justice.
