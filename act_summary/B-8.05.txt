The Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act establishes a framework for the construction, operation, and environmental management of the Detroit River bridge and associated infrastructure, exempting it from certain federal environmental and regulatory requirements while mandating environmental mitigation plans, public consultation, and specific exemptions for key agencies and activities. It also creates a special corporate entity to manage the project, facilitates cross-border cooperation with the United States, and provides mechanisms for regulatory flexibility and enforcement.
