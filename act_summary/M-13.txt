The Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act establishes a framework for federal government payments to taxing authorities in lieu of real property or frontage/area taxes on federal property, ensuring fair and equitable administration by adjusting payments based on property value or dimension, effective tax rates, and specific circumstances such as school-related taxes or under-collection. Payments are capped by the effective rate and property value or dimension, with adjustments made if a taxing authority fails to account for federal property in setting tax rates.
