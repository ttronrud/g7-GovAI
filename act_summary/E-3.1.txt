The Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994 temporarily suspends key provisions of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, including subsection 20(2) and sections 21 to 28, preventing the operation of those provisions until June 22, 1995 or until Parliament makes new rules, after which the suspended sections resume in force. It also temporarily discharges an electoral boundaries commission established in 1991 from its duties until the suspension ends.
