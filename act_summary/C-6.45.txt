The Canada–Jordan Economic Growth and Prosperity Act implements the Free Trade Agreement and related agreements between Canada and Jordan, aiming to establish a free trade area, promote economic cooperation, strengthen environmental and labour standards, and support sustainable development. It establishes the framework for Canada’s participation in the Joint Commission, outlines responsibilities of federal ministers, and ensures that enforcement of rights and obligations under the agreements requires the consent of the Attorney General of Canada.
