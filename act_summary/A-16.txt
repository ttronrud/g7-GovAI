The Nuclear Energy Act grants the Minister authority to conduct research, acquire nuclear substances and related assets, and license technological developments in nuclear energy, with key restrictions on expropriating certain lands—particularly settlement and Tetlit Gwich’in Yukon lands—requiring prior approval from the Governor in Council and public hearings. It also establishes that nuclear energy projects are for the general advantage of Canada and mandates oaths of fidelity and secrecy for company directors and officers.
