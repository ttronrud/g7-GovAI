The Tax Rebate Discounting Act regulates the discounting of tax refunds by setting minimum consideration requirements, establishing enforceable rights between clients and discounters, and imposing strict obligations on discounters to ensure transparency, accountability, and the client’s ultimate receipt of the refund. It prohibits unfair discounts, mandates disclosure of transactions, and creates penalties for non-compliance, including fines and trust obligations for excess refund amounts.
