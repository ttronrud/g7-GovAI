The Postal Services Resumption and Continuation Act mandates the immediate resumption of postal services and employee duties to address work stoppages caused by unresolved collective bargaining disputes between Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers. It extends the terms of expired collective agreements, prohibits strikes and lockouts during the extension period, and establishes a mediator-arbitrator to resolve disputes and facilitate the creation of new collective agreements, with decisions binding on the parties and subject to specific principles ensuring employee safety, fair treatment, and financial sustainability.
