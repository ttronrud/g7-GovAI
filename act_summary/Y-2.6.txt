The Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act establishes the legal framework for self-government agreements between the Government of Yukon and recognized First Nations, enabling them to exercise powers over governance, law-making, taxation, and land management, while recognizing their status as legal entities with rights and responsibilities under Canadian law. It brings into effect self-government agreements already signed with several Yukon First Nations and provides for future agreements, ensuring that these nations have the authority to govern themselves in accordance with their own constitutions and agreements.
