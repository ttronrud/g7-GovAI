The Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act establishes a comprehensive, independent assessment process to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic effects of proposed projects in Yukon, ensuring meaningful participation by First Nations, the public, and other stakeholders, while protecting natural resources, heritage, and the well-being of Yukon communities. It creates the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board to conduct evaluations, including screenings, reviews, and panel assessments, and prioritizes the integration of traditional knowledge and Indigenous rights throughout the process.
