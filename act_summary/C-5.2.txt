The Canada–Finland Tax Convention Act, 2006 establishes a bilateral agreement to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income taxes between Canada and Finland, defining residency, permanent establishments, tax treatment of dividends, profits, and income from property, while ensuring that the Convention takes precedence over conflicting domestic laws. It provides clear rules for taxing income, profits, and dividends, with specific limitations and exceptions to prevent double taxation and ensure fair treatment of residents and businesses in both countries.
