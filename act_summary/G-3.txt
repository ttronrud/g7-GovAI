The Geneva Conventions Act approves the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, establishing that grave breaches of these conventions constitute indictable offences punishable by life imprisonment or up to 14 years, and ensures fair trial rights, including notice to the accused and their protecting power. It also incorporates protections for wounded and sick, prisoners of war, and protected internees, and mandates that proceedings be conducted with due process and respect for international humanitarian law.
