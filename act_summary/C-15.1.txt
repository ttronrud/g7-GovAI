The Canadian Energy Regulator Act establishes an independent regulatory body, the Canadian Energy Regulator, to oversee the safe, secure, and environmentally responsible construction, operation, and abandonment of pipelines, power lines, and offshore renewable energy projects. The Regulator is mandated to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and respect for Indigenous rights, with a board that includes at least one Indigenous person and is accountable to Parliament.
