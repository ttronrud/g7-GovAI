The Excise Act establishes regulations for the manufacture, handling, and taxation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, with key provisions exempting beer, malt liquor, and certain beer concentrates from its application after the coming into force of the Excise Act, 2001. It defines key terms related to excise duties, including breweries, distilleries, and bonded facilities, and outlines specific conditions under which certain transformations—such as diluting beer concentrate—are permitted without excise liability.
