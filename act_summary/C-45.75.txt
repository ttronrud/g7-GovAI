This Act gives legal effect to the 2017 Agreement on Cree Nation Governance between the Crees of Eeyou Istchee, the Cree Nation Government, and the Government of Canada, establishing the Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee as a self-governing entity with its own constitution, laws, and rights, while ensuring that Cree laws and the Agreement prevail over conflicting federal laws and providing extensive protections for property, taxation, and legal autonomy on Category IA land. It also establishes procedures for judicial review, notice requirements, and the rights of Inuit observers in Cree Nation governance.
