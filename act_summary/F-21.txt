The Fisheries Development Act authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to fund and undertake projects that improve the exploitation and development of fishery resources, introduce new fishing technologies, and enhance fishery product processing and distribution, including through partnerships with provinces or private entities. It also establishes requirements for agreements, mandates reporting to Parliament, and allows for regulations to support the Act’s objectives.
