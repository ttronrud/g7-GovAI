The Federal Sustainable Development Act establishes a legal framework for developing and implementing a Federal Sustainable Development Strategy, requiring transparent, accountable, and coordinated government action to promote sustainable development across Canada, with clear goals, targets, and reporting requirements. It mandates the creation of a Sustainable Development Office, a Advisory Council, and annual reporting by designated entities to ensure progress is monitored and publicly accountable.
