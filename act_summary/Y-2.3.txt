The Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act approves, gives effect to, and declares valid four final agreements between the Government of Canada and First Nations in the Yukon, incorporating the 1993 Umbrella Final Agreement, and establishes the legal framework for those agreements, including land rights, self-governance powers, and the supremacy of the agreements over conflicting laws. It also provides for the binding nature of the agreements, the recognition of Indigenous institutions, and the payment of financial obligations under the land claims.
