The Centennial Flame Research Award Act establishes a fund to provide annual awards to eligible disabled Canadian citizens for conducting research on the contributions of disabled individuals to Canadian public life or Parliament. The awards are administered by a committee of Parliament, with recipients required to submit reports on their research, which are then presented to Parliament.
