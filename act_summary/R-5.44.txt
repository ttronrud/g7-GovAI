The Rental Housing Benefit Act establishes a one-time benefit of $500 for eligible Canadian residents who meet specific income and rent criteria, including having an adjusted income of no more than $35,000 (or $20,000 in certain cases) and paying rent for a principal residence in Canada in 2022. The benefit is administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, with strict rules on eligibility, compliance, and recovery of overpayments, and includes provisions for penalties and enforcement.
