This act declares that the navigation of the Ottawa River and all works related to it—such as dams, canals, and embankments—are subject to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, as they serve the general advantage of Canada. These works, regardless of who constructed them, fall under the control and management of the Department of Public Works and Government Services.
