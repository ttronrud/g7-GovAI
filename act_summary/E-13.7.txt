This act grants the Exchequer Court jurisdiction over railways that span multiple provinces or are under federal control, allowing it to order the sale or foreclosure of such railways and their assets when a company becomes insolvent or fails to operate effectively, or when a creditor has a first lien or mortgage. It also establishes the powers of a receiver to manage and operate the railway, and defines insolvency with specific criteria, while preserving provincial court jurisdiction for railways wholly within a single province.  

*(Note: The act has been repealed by R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.), s. 64.)*
