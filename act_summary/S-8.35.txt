The Select Luxury Items Tax Act imposes a tax on certain luxury items, including specific types of aircraft, vehicles, and vessels manufactured after 2018, with exemptions for government, emergency, and essential uses. The Act defines key terms and establishes rules for when a sale is deemed to occur, how ownership transfers are treated, and what constitutes an improvement to a subject item.
