The International River Improvements Act regulates the construction, operation, and maintenance of international river improvements—such as dams or canals—that alter the flow of rivers from Canada to outside its borders, with the primary goal of preventing environmental harm from permanent water loss. It requires a licence for such projects, excludes certain domestic uses, and establishes enforcement powers, including inspections, compliance orders, and seizure, to ensure these improvements do not interfere with the use of international rivers outside Canada.
