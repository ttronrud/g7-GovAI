The Canada–Turkey Tax Convention Act, 2010 establishes a bilateral tax agreement to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains, defining residency, permanent establishments, and the taxation of dividends, interest, and profits. It provides rules for tax treatment of income from immovable property, international traffic, and cross-border business activities, while ensuring that tax benefits prevail over conflicting domestic laws and allowing for adjustments in cases of related-party transactions.
