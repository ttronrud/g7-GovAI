The Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification Act provides for indemnification by Her Majesty, through the Minister, to owners of objects in travelling exhibitions for damage or loss during loan periods, with limits on liability and conditions based on exhibition criteria. The Act allows institutions in Canada to apply for indemnity coverage for exhibitions involving objects borrowed from outside Canada or shown in multiple provinces, with regulations governing eligibility, security standards, and claim processes.
