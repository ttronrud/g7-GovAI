The Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act establishes a regulatory framework in Canada to ensure that rough diamonds exported from or imported into Canada are certified under the Kimberley Process, thereby preventing the trade of conflict diamonds. It requires Canadian Certificates for exports, mandates compliance with certification and container requirements, and provides enforcement powers for inspectors and investigators, with penalties for violations.
