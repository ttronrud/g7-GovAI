The Public Service Superannuation Act establishes a framework for pension contributions and benefits for employees in the Canadian public service, ensuring equality between male and female contributors and defining key terms such as pensionable employment, service periods, and eligibility for retirement benefits. It continues the Superannuation Account and outlines contribution requirements, pensionable service accrual, and provisions for certain employees, including those with limited hours or specific circumstances, while also setting limits on contribution rates and ensuring benefits are based on years of service.
