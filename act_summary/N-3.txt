The National Arts Centre Act establishes the National Arts Centre Corporation, which operates the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, with a Board of Trustees overseeing its governance and a President serving as its chief executive. The Corporation’s primary objectives are to operate and maintain the Centre, develop the performing arts in the National Capital Region, and support the broader development of performing arts across Canada.
