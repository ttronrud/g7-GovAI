This Act authorizes the Province of Quebec to construct and maintain two bridges over the St. Lawrence River and the Beauharnois Canal, along with associated approaches, subject to approval by the Governor in Council based on detailed plans, maps, and environmental data. It also ensures that any changes to the location or design require renewed approval and incorporates provisions to comply with navigation laws and existing federal regulations.
