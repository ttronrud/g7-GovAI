The Special Economic Measures Act enables the Government of Canada to impose economic sanctions on foreign states or individuals involved in grave breaches of international peace and security, gross human rights violations, or significant corruption, by restricting or prohibiting certain activities and seizing property. These measures can be reviewed and challenged by Parliament, and any proceeds from forfeited property may be used for reconstruction, peacekeeping, or victim compensation.
