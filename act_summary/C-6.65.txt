The Canada–Madagascar Tax Convention Act, 2018 enables the implementation of a tax treaty between Canada and Madagascar to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income, defining key terms such as residency, permanent establishment, and taxation of dividends, profits, and income from immovable property. The Convention establishes rules for the taxation of income, ensures that tax rights are not duplicated, and provides mechanisms for resolving disputes and applying tax rules consistently between the two countries.
