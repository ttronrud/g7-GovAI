The Indian Act establishes the legal framework for the status, rights, and governance of Indigenous peoples in Canada, defining who is recognized as an "Indian," maintaining registers and band lists, and outlining the governance structure of bands, including voting rights and council authority. It also sets out specific criteria for registration and membership, including birth, lineage, and band affiliation, while providing mechanisms for bands to self-govern their membership under certain conditions.
