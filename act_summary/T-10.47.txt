The Manitoba Natural Resources Act of 1929 transfers control of Crown lands, mines, minerals, and water rights within Manitoba from the federal government to the provincial government, placing Manitoba on equal footing with the original provinces of Confederation in natural resource management. This transfer is subject to specific exceptions, including Indian reserves, certain federal responsibilities, and ongoing financial and administrative obligations.
