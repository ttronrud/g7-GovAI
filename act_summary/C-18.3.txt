The Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act establishes the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, a body responsible for conducting inquiries into trade-related matters, including whether imported goods under free trade agreements cause serious injury to domestic producers, and for making reports to the Governor in Council or the Minister. The Tribunal has judicial powers, operates with a quorum of three members, and is tasked with reviewing complaints, conducting investigations, and managing appeals related to trade and tariffs.
