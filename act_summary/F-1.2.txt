The Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act enables First Nations to create their own laws governing the use, occupation, and division of family homes and matrimonial interests in structures and lands on reserves, with provisions for community approval, enforcement, and protections in cases of family violence. It ensures that decisions consider the best interests of children and First Nation cultural contexts, while respecting the constitutional rights of First Nations to self-governance.
