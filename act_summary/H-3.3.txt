The Health of Animals Act establishes regulations to prevent the spread of diseases and toxic substances among animals and to protect public and animal health by governing the handling, movement, and disposal of animals, animal products, and by-products. It outlines duties for owners, veterinarians, and inspectors, including immediate reporting of diseases or toxins, restrictions on movement of affected animals, and measures to control the spread of disease through declarations of infected areas.
