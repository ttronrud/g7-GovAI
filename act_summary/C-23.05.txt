The Canadian Securities Regulation Regime Transition Office Act establishes a independent office to assist in creating a unified Canadian securities regulation regime and a national regulatory authority, with powers to develop a transition plan, consult stakeholders, and operate with financial and administrative autonomy, while being exempt from federal public administration rules. The office is led by a president and an advisory committee from participating provinces and territories, and receives direct funding up to $107.5 million from the federal government.
