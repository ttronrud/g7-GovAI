The Industrial and Regional Development Act establishes a framework for promoting economic growth in Canadian provinces by providing grants, contributions, loans, and guarantees to commercial operations and eligible entities that support commercial activities, with funding allocations based on a tiered system determined by a development index. The Minister administers the program through tier groups—based on regional economic need—ensuring targeted support for underdeveloped areas, while regulations govern eligibility, terms, and conditions for financial assistance.
