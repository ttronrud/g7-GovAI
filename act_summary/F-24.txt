The Fishing and Recreational Harbours Act establishes the Minister of Canada as the primary authority for the management, development, and regulation of scheduled fishing and recreational harbours, including the power to enter into agreements with provinces or private entities for projects, set charges, and enforce compliance through inspections, seizures, and potential forfeiture of vessels or goods. It also provides for enforcement powers, including the ability to seize and sell property in cases of non-compliance, with proceeds going to the Crown or being returned to rightful owners under specific conditions.
