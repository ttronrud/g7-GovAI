The Government Services Resumption Act of 1989 mandates the immediate resumption of government services and employee duties following its coming into force, invalidates prior strike authorizations, and establishes conciliation boards to resolve disputes over expired collective agreements, with the goal of reaching agreements that will extend the terms of those agreements—specifically for hospital services, ships’ crews (supervisory and non-supervisory)—no earlier than June 21 or June 30, 1991. It ensures that employees and the Public Service Alliance of Canada must comply with resumption of duties, prohibits disciplinary action for past strikes, and provides for binding, enforceable agreements after mediation.
