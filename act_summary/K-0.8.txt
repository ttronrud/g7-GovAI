The Kingsmere Park Act of 1951 establishes the administration of Kingsmere Park in Quebec according to the bequest and wishes of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, preserving it as a natural forest reserve and wildlife sanctuary, while allowing for the potential use of a portion as a country home for the Prime Minister and providing temporary rent-free access to certain cottages for family members and designated guests. The Federal District Commission and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services are tasked with managing the property in accordance with King’s expressed purposes.
