The Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1999 implements a series of bilateral income tax treaties between Canada and several countries, including Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Algeria, Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan, Jordan, and Luxembourg. These agreements aim to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion by establishing rules on tax residency, permanent establishments, and the application of taxes on income and capital, with provisions for regulatory implementation and dispute resolution.
