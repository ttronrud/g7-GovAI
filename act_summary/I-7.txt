The Indian Oil and Gas Act establishes a regulatory framework for oil and gas exploration and exploitation on First Nation lands, defining key terms, outlining the rights and obligations of contract holders, and setting out rules for royalties, environmental protection, inspections, and ministerial powers, all while ensuring consultation with First Nation councils and preserving Indigenous rights. It also grants the Minister authority to suspend activities, regulate contracts, and enforce compliance, with regulations that may vary by province and include provisions for environmental audits, royalty determination, and the protection of cultural and historical sites.
