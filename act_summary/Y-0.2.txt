The Yale First Nation Final Agreement Act enacts and ratifies the Yale First Nation Final Agreement, a treaty and land claims agreement between the Yale First Nation, the Government of Canada, and the Government of British Columbia, recognizing Aboriginal rights, establishing a new relationship, and providing for the legal effect and implementation of the Agreement, including the repeal of the Indian Act’s application and the supremacy of the Agreement over conflicting federal laws. The Act ensures the Agreement is binding, gives judicial notice to its provisions, and includes mechanisms for dispute resolution involving all three parties.
