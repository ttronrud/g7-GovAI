This Act establishes additional fiscal equalization offset payments to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador to compensate for offshore revenues, with specific payments tied to fiscal years and conditions such as receiving a fiscal equalization payment and meeting per capita debt or net debt thresholds. It also includes provisions for debt reduction payments and transitional payments if conditions are not met, and requires periodic review of the respective Canada-province offshore revenue arrangements.
