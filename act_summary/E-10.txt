The Department of the Environment Act establishes the Department of the Environment under a Minister of the Environment appointed by the Governor in Council, granting the Minister broad powers to manage and promote environmental protection, including air, water, soil quality, renewable resources, and pollution control, while requiring annual reporting to Parliament. The Minister can establish guidelines, enter into agreements with provinces, and coordinate federal programs to enhance environmental quality and advise other government bodies.
