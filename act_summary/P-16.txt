The Postal Services Interruption Relief Act allows individuals who suffer loss or hardship due to a postal service interruption of more than 48 hours to apply to a Federal Court judge for relief, such as a waiver of time limits in Canadian laws, if they can demonstrate they took reasonable steps to comply and did so without undue delay. The judge may grant relief with conditions and may require public notice or allow further opportunities for affected parties to be heard.
