The Public Sector Compensation Act establishes rules for compensation in the Canadian public sector, defining what constitutes compensation, extending existing compensation plans for specified periods, and restricting certain increases or changes during those extensions. It also governs work force adjustment programs, including payments and layoffs, and prohibits collective bargaining over work force adjustment matters for a three-year period.
