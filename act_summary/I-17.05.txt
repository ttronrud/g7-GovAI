The International Bridges and Tunnels Act establishes strict controls over the construction, alteration, operation, and ownership of international bridges and tunnels in Canada, requiring prior approval from the Governor in Council and ensuring public safety, maintenance, and equitable toll policies. It prohibits unauthorized construction, operation, or acquisition of such infrastructure and grants the Minister broad powers to regulate, inspect, and enforce compliance, with penalties for violations.
