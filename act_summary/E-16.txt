The Experimental Farm Stations Act establishes farm stations across Canada to conduct agricultural research and experiments, with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food overseeing their operations and land acquisition. These stations carry out research on crops, livestock, fertilizers, diseases, and other agricultural matters, and are required to submit regular reports to ensure transparency and public accountability.
