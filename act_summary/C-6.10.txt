The Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act implements the Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement and related environmental and labour agreements, aiming to establish a free trade area, promote fair competition and investment, strengthen environmental and labour cooperation, and support sustainable economic development between the two countries. It establishes the Free Trade Commission, outlines the roles of federal ministers in appointing representatives and panel members, and grants the Governor in Council authority to suspend or modify certain trade provisions as needed.
