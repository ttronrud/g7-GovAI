The Canada Elections Act establishes definitions and regulations governing federal elections in Canada, including the roles of candidates, parties, and election officials, the rules for advertising and contributions, and the procedures for voting, including advance polling and recounts. It also defines key terms such as election periods, electoral districts, and the commercial value of assets used in political campaigns.
