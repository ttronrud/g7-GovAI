The Budget Implementation Act, 2003 authorizes direct payments up to $1.5 billion to a trust that funds provinces to acquire diagnostic and medical equipment and train specialized staff, with amounts determined by the trust’s indenture, and includes provisions for funding specific Canadian research and innovation organizations. It also repeals the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account Act for certain fiscal years and establishes transitional provisions for various sections.
