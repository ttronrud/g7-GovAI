The Land Titles Repeal Act provides for the repeal of the federal Land Titles Act in Yukon and the Northwest Territories when a territorial land titles ordinance—based on the Torrens system and meeting specific requirements—is enacted, and includes provisions for indemnification and assurance fund payments to the territories. It also protects territorial laws from being repealed or amended without Governor in Council approval and ensures that certificates of title remain conclusive in courts, subject to certain exceptions.
