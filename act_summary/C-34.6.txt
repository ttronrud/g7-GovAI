The Commercial Arbitration Act establishes the legal framework for commercial arbitration in Canada, based on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law’s Model Law, and applies to disputes involving the Canadian government, Crown or departmental corporations, or maritime matters. It grants arbitration agreements the force of law, ensures the independence and impartiality of arbitrators, and provides rules for appointment, jurisdiction, proceedings, and enforcement of awards, while preserving the right of courts to intervene only as specified.
