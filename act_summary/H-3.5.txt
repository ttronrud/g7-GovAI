The Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act protects designated heritage railway stations and their features from unauthorized alteration, removal, or disposal by railway companies, requiring ministerial and, in some cases, Board approval before any such action can occur. It establishes a process involving public notice, objections, Board review, and final authorization by the Governor in Council to ensure heritage preservation while allowing for emergencies or transfers under specific conditions.
