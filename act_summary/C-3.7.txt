The Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act provides temporary income support payments to eligible Canadian workers who ceased working for at least 14 consecutive days due to COVID-19 during a specified period, with payments capped at 16 weeks and subject to income eligibility rules. The benefit is not subject to garnishment, bankruptcy, or assignment, and overpayments must be repaid, though no interest is charged.
