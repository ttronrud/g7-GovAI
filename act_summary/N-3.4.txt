This Act establishes the National Battlefields Commission to acquire, preserve, and develop key historic battlefields in Quebec, including the Plains of Abraham and other sites of significant military events, into a Canadian National Park. It authorizes the government to fund the project with annual appropriations, allows for contributions from provinces, municipalities, and individuals, and provides for the purchase or expropriation of specific lands to restore and commemorate Canada’s military history.
