The Korean War Veterans Day Act designates July 27 as National Korean War Veterans Day to honour the service, sacrifice, and contributions of Canadian veterans who fought in the Korean War and served as peacekeepers after the armistice. While not a legal holiday, the day serves as a national day of remembrance for their courage, resilience, and the lasting impact of their efforts on Canada’s commitment to peace and democracy.
