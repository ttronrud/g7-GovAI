The Lieutenant Governors Superannuation Act establishes a pension scheme for Lieutenant Governors of Canada, providing entitlements to immediate or deferred pensions based on years of service, age, or disability, with options for a return of contributions. Pensions are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and survivors may receive a portion of the pension or a return of contributions, with specific provisions for elections, interest, and death benefits.
