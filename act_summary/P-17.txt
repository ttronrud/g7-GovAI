The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act establishes advisory committees to advise the Minister on methods to rehabilitate drought- and soil-drifting-affected areas in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, promoting sustainable farm practices and land use. The Minister may develop and manage rehabilitation projects, with certain spending limits and annual reporting requirements to Parliament.
