The Fisheries Improvement Loans Act establishes a framework for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to compensate lenders for losses incurred on guaranteed loans provided to fishermen for specific fishing-related purposes, such as purchasing vessels or equipment, under strict eligibility conditions. The Minister’s liability is limited by thresholds on loan amounts, time periods, and aggregate lending levels, and the Act includes provisions for regulation, enforcement, and repayment of losses.
