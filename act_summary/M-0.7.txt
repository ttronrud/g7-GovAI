The Marine Liability Act establishes liability limits and rights for claims arising in Canadian maritime law, including those involving injury, death, or loss of property at sea. It defines dependants’ rights to compensation for loss of companionship and care, sets maximum liability limits for shipowners and dock owners, and incorporates the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, while allowing for Canadian-specific adjustments.
