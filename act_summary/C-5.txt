The Canada Evidence Act establishes rules governing the admissibility and administration of evidence in both criminal and civil proceedings, ensuring that witnesses—including spouses of accused persons—are competent to testify, protecting against self-incrimination, and providing clear procedures for oaths, affirmations, and the handling of expert and documentary evidence. It also outlines specific rules for minors, the use of prior statements, and the admissibility of government records and official documents.
