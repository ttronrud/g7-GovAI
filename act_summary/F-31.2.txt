The Fort-Falls Bridge Authority Act establishes a binational corporation to construct, maintain, and operate a bridge across the Rainy River between Fort Frances, Ontario, and International Falls, Minnesota, for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The Authority, composed of four Canadian and four U.S. members, may issue bonds, charge tolls, acquire land, and enter into agreements with U.S. authorities, but its powers are limited until a formal agreement is reached and a proclamation is issued by the Governor in Council.
