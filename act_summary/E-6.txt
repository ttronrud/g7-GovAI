The Energy Administration Act establishes a regulatory framework for the export of oil and transportation fuel in Canada, imposing charges on exports and setting rules for pricing, record-keeping, exemptions, and revenue collection. It aims to ensure uniform crude oil pricing, protect consumers from price volatility, and support Canada’s energy self-sufficiency through measures such as tariff-based charges, provincial agreements on pricing, and oversight by the Canadian Energy Regulator.
