The Civil Service Insurance Act establishes a framework for the federal government to provide life insurance to civil and military employees in permanent positions, specifying beneficiaries, apportionment rights, and conditions for payment, while ensuring insurance money is paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and administered by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. It outlines detailed rules on who can be named as beneficiaries (including spouses, children, common-law partners, and dependents), how insurance money can be apportioned, and how it is distributed in cases of death during the insured’s lifetime or after.
