This list of repeals indicates that multiple sections of a prior act or regulation were formally repealed in 2001 (specifically in Chapter 26, Section 332), with some earlier repeals occurring in 1998 and 1985, suggesting the legislation was consolidated or replaced over time. The act itself is no longer in force.
