The United Nations Foreign Arbitral Awards Convention Act enables the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Canada, applying only to commercial disputes and ensuring that such awards are treated no less favourably than domestic awards. It aligns Canadian law with the 1958 UN Convention, providing clear procedures for enforcement, including requirements for documents, grounds for refusal, and rules governing reciprocity and federal jurisdiction.
