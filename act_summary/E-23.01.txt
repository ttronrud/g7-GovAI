The Extradition Act establishes the legal framework for Canada to extradite individuals to foreign jurisdictions for prosecution or to enforce sentences, requiring that the offence be punishable by imprisonment of at least two years (or five years in specific agreements) in the requesting country and that the conduct constitute a criminal offence in Canada. It outlines detailed procedures for requests, provisional arrest, judicial hearings, and the conditions under which extradition can be granted, including protections for the accused and the supremacy of Canadian law over conflicting agreements.
