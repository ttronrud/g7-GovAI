This Act amends the Hazardous Products Act to require persons eligible for exemptions under section 11 to file a notice of intent within six months of the section’s coming into force, and allows the Minister to grant exemptions if reasonable grounds exist. It also mandates a review of the exemptions under section 54 by a parliamentary committee within two years of the section’s expiration.
