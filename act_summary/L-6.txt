The Canada Lands Surveys Act establishes the framework for surveying Canada’s lands in Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, defining the roles of the Minister, Surveyor General, and Canada Lands Surveyors, and setting standards for survey accuracy, monumentation, and official plan confirmation. It also governs special surveys, including procedures for public hearings and appeals, to ensure that surveys are conducted properly and fairly, with final plans confirmed only after review and, where necessary, public input.
