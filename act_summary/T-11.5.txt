The Tobacco and Vaping Products Act establishes comprehensive regulations to protect public health by restricting access to tobacco and vaping products, particularly among young people, limiting the use of harmful additives, requiring transparency in product information, and banning certain sales and advertising practices. It sets standards for product safety, mandates disclosure of ingredients and emissions, and prohibits the sale or delivery of tobacco and vaping products to minors, with exceptions for verified purchases and prescription products.
