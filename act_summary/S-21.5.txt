The Statutes Repeal Act mandates that the Minister of Justice annually report and repeal Acts of Parliament that were assented to nine years or more before the end of the year and had not come into force by December 31 of that year, unless they are brought into force or saved by parliamentary resolution. The Act comes into force two years after royal assent and excludes provisions amended during the nine years before enactment or those essential to the amended provision's effect.
