The Safe Food for Canadians Act establishes strict regulations to ensure the safety, authenticity, and proper handling of food commodities in Canada, prohibiting false advertising, tampering, and unauthorized movement of food across provinces or internationally. It grants inspectors broad powers to enter establishments, conduct inspections, seize items, and enforce compliance, with provisions for registration, licensing, and administrative penalties.
