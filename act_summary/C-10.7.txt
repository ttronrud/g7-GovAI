The Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984 establishes a bilateral agreement to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains between Canada and the United States, defining residency, permanent establishments, tax treatment of business profits, dividends, and other income, while providing mechanisms for resolving disputes and ensuring tax fairness. It implements key provisions to ensure that individuals and companies are not taxed twice on the same income and provides exemptions for certain types of international business activities.
