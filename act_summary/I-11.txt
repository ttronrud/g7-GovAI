The Inquiries Act empowers the Governor in Council to conduct inquiries into matters related to the good government of Canada or public business, allowing for the appointment of commissioners with broad powers to summon witnesses, examine documents, and issue subpoenas, while ensuring due process and protections for individuals involved. It also establishes provisions for representation by counsel, notice before charges, and special provisions for international commissions and the continuation of the Correctional Investigator role.
