The Spirit Drinks Trade Act regulates the use of international spirit drink names in Canada, allowing such names to be used only if the product is produced in the country associated with the name and meets specific legal and geographical requirements, in accordance with Canada’s international trade commitments. It establishes enforcement mechanisms, including inspector and analyst powers, penalties for violations, and provisions for seizure and forfeiture of non-compliant products.
