The CN Commercialization Act enables the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) to transition from a federal Crown corporation to a private corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act, subject to specific ownership and governance constraints, including limits on voting share control to prevent any individual or group from holding more than 25% of voting power. It also grants the Minister of Transport authority to direct CN’s property transfers, regulates share issuance and ownership, and ensures CN continues to serve the public interest through its transportation operations.
