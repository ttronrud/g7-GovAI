The Canada National Parks Act establishes the framework for the creation, management, and protection of national parks and park reserves in Canada, prioritizing ecological integrity and ensuring public access for education and enjoyment while restricting land use and development, particularly in park communities. It grants the Minister broad powers to manage parks, develop management plans, regulate activities, and enter into agreements, with key oversight and public participation requirements.
