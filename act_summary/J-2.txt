The Department of Justice Act establishes the Department of Justice of Canada, headed by the Minister of Justice—who is ex officio the Attorney General of Canada—and outlines the Minister’s responsibilities, including legal advisory roles, oversight of justice administration, and ensuring that legislation is consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also requires the Minister to assess proposed bills and regulations for Charter compliance and to provide public statements on potential Charter impacts of legislation.
