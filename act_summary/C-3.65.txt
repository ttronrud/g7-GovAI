This Act implements the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement by establishing the legal framework for trade between Canada and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states—Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, including specific agreements on agriculture. It outlines the responsibilities of the Government of Canada, including the appointment of representatives, funding of committees and tribunals, and the interpretation of provisions in a manner consistent with the Agreement, while also providing for certain limitations on legal actions and the exclusion of environmental resources from its scope.
