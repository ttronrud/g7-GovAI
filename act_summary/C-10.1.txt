The Canada Prize Act establishes the Federal Court of Canada's jurisdiction over prize cases involving ships, aircraft, or goods captured under Canada’s authority during times of war, and incorporates UK prize laws into Canadian law, with modifications. It also allows for cooperation with foreign governments through consents, enabling the Court to exercise prize jurisdiction in certain international contexts, while regulating procedures, costs, and evidence in such matters.
