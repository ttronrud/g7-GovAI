The Retail Payment Activities Act establishes a regulatory framework to supervise and regulate retail payment activities in Canada, ensuring the safety and efficiency of fund transfers, mitigating operational and national security risks, and fostering competition and innovation in the payment sector. It requires payment service providers to register, maintain robust risk management and incident response systems, safeguard end-user funds, and report regularly to the Bank of Canada.
