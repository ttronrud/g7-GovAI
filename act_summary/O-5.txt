The Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act prohibits acts that compromise Canada’s national security by defining and criminalizing the unauthorized communication, retention, or use of sensitive information—especially related to defence, intelligence, or military operations—by individuals with access to such information, or by foreign entities or terrorist groups. It establishes strict penalties for breaches involving secret documents, munitions-related information, or interference with Canada’s security, intelligence, or economic systems.
