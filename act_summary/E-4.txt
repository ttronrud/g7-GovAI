The Electricity and Gas Inspection Act establishes a regulatory framework for the verification, inspection, and accountability of electricity and gas meters, ensuring accurate measurement and fair billing. It outlines the roles of inspectors, contractors, and accredited meter verifiers, mandates regular verification and sealing of meters, and provides procedures for enforcement, dispute resolution, and the recovery of charges resulting from meter errors.
