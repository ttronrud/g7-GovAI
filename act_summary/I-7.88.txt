The Department of Indigenous Services Act establishes a new federal department to deliver services to Indigenous peoples in a way that respects their rights, promotes reconciliation, and supports Indigenous governance, while gradually transferring responsibilities to Indigenous organizations. The Minister oversees services in key areas such as health, education, housing, and economic development, ensuring collaboration with Indigenous communities and addressing socio-economic disparities.
