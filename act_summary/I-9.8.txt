The Injured Military Members Compensation Act provides compensation to Canadian military members who suffer service-related injuries resulting in specific losses, with eligibility based on service type, injury causation, and timing. Benefits are capped at $250,000 for certain members and $100,000 for others, and the Minister has broad powers to review claims, administer oaths, and manage personal information, while ensuring benefits are tax-free and exempt from seizure.
