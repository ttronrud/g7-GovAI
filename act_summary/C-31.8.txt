This act establishes that the House of Commons must determine, before any negotiations on provincial secession can begin, whether a referendum question is clear and whether a clear majority of voters has expressed a will to secede. It prohibits the Government of Canada from entering into secession negotiations unless both the referendum question is clear and a clear majority of eligible voters have supported secession, and it requires that any constitutional amendment for secession be negotiated with all provinces and the federal government, including provisions for minority rights and Indigenous interests.
