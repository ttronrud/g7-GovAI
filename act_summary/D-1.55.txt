The Dental Benefit Act provides temporary financial assistance to eligible Canadian families for dental care services for children under 12, addressing access and cost barriers by offering benefits of $650, $390, or $260 based on income, with specific eligibility criteria and application periods. It establishes a framework for interim support while the government works toward a long-term national dental care program.
