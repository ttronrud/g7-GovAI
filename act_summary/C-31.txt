The Civilian War-related Benefits Act provides pensions, allowances, and compensation to certain civilians who served in war-related roles during World War II, including salt water fishermen, helpers, overseas staff, air raid precautions workers, and members of civilian aid organizations, recognizing their service and injuries sustained under wartime conditions. These benefits are awarded in accordance with the Pension Act, with specific eligibility criteria and exclusions, and ensure equality of status for male and female beneficiaries.
