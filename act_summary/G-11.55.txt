The Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act establishes a federal greenhouse gas emissions pricing system to reduce emissions across Canada, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to climate change mitigation, while recognizing the importance of provincial systems and the need for a national framework to address the environmental, health, and economic risks of climate change. It implements a "polluter pays" principle by setting a price on emissions that increases over time to incentivize cleaner technologies, energy efficiency, and behavioral change.
