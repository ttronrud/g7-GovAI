The Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act implements the Trade Continuity Agreement between Canada and the United Kingdom, establishing a free trade area, promoting fair competition and investment, and setting out mechanisms for dispute resolution, joint committee operations, and financial responsibilities. It ensures that Canadian federal laws and policies are aligned with the Agreement’s objectives while preserving Parliament’s authority to legislate and protecting certain environmental and labour rights.
