The Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act establishes a supplementary retirement benefit for eligible pension recipients, calculated as a percentage of their pension based on changes in a Benefit Index relative to the pension’s retirement year, with adjustments for partial years and minimum benefit protections. Benefits are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and are tied to inflation through the Consumer Price Index, with specific provisions for survivors, disabled individuals, and those retiring after 1982.
