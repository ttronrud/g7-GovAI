The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act establishes a framework for fair and effective labour-management relations in the Canadian public service, emphasizing collective bargaining, mutual respect, and the protection of the public interest. It defines key terms, outlines the roles of employers, bargaining agents, and the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board, and promotes collaborative processes such as co-development of workplace improvements and dispute resolution through mediation and arbitration.
