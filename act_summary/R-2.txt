The Radiocommunication Act establishes the regulatory framework for radiocommunication in Canada, granting the Minister of Industry authority to issue licenses, certificates, and regulations governing the use of radio frequencies, equipment, and services to ensure orderly and efficient operation while preventing harmful interference. It prohibits unauthorized use of radio apparatus, jammers, and interference-causing equipment and sets out rules for technical standards, spectrum allocation, and enforcement.
