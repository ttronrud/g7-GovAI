The Red Tape Reduction Act establishes a "one-for-one" rule requiring that any new administrative burden imposed by regulations on businesses must be offset by reducing an existing administrative burden, with exceptions for regulatory cooperation between Canada and other jurisdictions. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses while ensuring transparency, accountability, and public health and safety are not compromised.
