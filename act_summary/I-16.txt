The International Boundary Commission Act establishes the powers and responsibilities of the International Boundary Commission to maintain and mark the Canada–United States border, including the right to enter private land, erect boundary monuments, and remove unauthorized structures within ten feet of the boundary. It prohibits individuals from constructing or enlarging works near the boundary without Commission permission and imposes fines or imprisonment for violations.
