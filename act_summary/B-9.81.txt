The Budget Implementation Act, 1997 establishes the Canada Foundation for Innovation as a not-for-profit corporation to make grants to eligible Canadian institutions for research infrastructure projects, with specific governance, funding, and operational rules to ensure independence, transparency, and accountability. The foundation is governed by a board of directors and members representing research and business communities, and it may only make grants for eligible projects without acquiring ownership interests in the recipient’s research infrastructure.
