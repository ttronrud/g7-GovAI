The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act establishes the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), a regulatory body with powers over broadcasting, telecommunications, and digital media, including the appointment of up to 13 members who serve during good behaviour and must reside in Canada, and mandates the Commission to report annually on its activities related to accessibility and barrier removal. The Act also outlines the Commission’s responsibilities, by-law-making powers, and reporting obligations to Parliament under the supervision of the Minister.
