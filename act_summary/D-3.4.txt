The Divorce Act establishes the legal framework for divorce, spousal and child support, parenting arrangements, and related family law matters in Canada, including jurisdiction rules, definitions of key terms, and procedures for resolving disputes through court or alternative dispute resolution. It emphasizes the best interests of the child, provides guidelines for determining child support, and ensures that courts have clear jurisdiction in cases involving custody, contact, and support, particularly when proceedings are initiated or transferred between provinces.
