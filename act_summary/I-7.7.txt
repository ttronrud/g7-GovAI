The Indian (Soldier Settlement) Act, as amended, establishes the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs as the administrator of soldier settlement provisions for Indigenous individuals, granting them authority to acquire land both within and outside Indian reserves and to set apart common band lands without council consent, while ensuring the band’s interest in the land remains unaffected. The Act also clarifies references to the Indian Act and relevant officials, and allows the Governor in Council to resolve administrative ambiguities without expanding existing powers.
