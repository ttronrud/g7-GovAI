This Act adjusts unemployment insurance benefits for claimants whose benefits were reduced or eliminated due to deductions for pension payments made after January 4, 1986, by calculating and paying additional amounts they would have been entitled to. It also allows for the termination of an existing benefit period and the establishment of a new one under specific conditions, with all payments treated as unemployment insurance benefits for accounting and appeal purposes.
