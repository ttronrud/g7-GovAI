The Department of Transport Act establishes a federal department to manage Canada’s canals and railways, including their construction, maintenance, toll collection, and financial oversight, and grants the Minister broad powers to administer these assets, conduct inquiries, and enforce regulations. It also outlines procedures for accountability, contract management, and the collection and use of revenues from tolls and fines.
