The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act establishes a retirement pension system for members of Parliament, defining contributions based on salary, sessional indemnity, and annual allowances, and setting rules for calculating retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and withdrawal allowances. It also provides for elections to continue contributing under the Act, with specific rules on when and how members can opt in or out, and includes provisions for interest, contributions, and the administration of retirement funds by the Chief Actuary.
