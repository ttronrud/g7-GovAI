The Bank of Canada Act establishes the Bank of Canada as a central bank responsible for regulating credit and currency, stabilizing the value of the Canadian dollar, and promoting economic and financial welfare through monetary policy. It outlines the structure, governance, powers, and eligibility requirements for the Bank’s leadership and directors, ensuring independence while maintaining accountability to the government.
