The Canadian Gender Budgeting Act establishes a policy requiring the Government of Canada to consider gender and diversity impacts in budgetary decisions, mandate public reporting on the gender and diversity effects of new budget measures and tax expenditures, and strengthen departmental capacity to integrate gender analysis into policy development. It promotes transparency, accountability, and evidence-based decision-making to advance gender equality and inclusive economic growth.
