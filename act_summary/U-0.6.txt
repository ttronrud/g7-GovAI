The Unemployment Assistance Act allows Canada to enter into agreements with provinces to share the costs of providing financial assistance to unemployed persons in need, with Canada contributing up to 50% of the provincial unemployment assistance costs. The agreement specifies eligibility criteria, reporting requirements, exclusions for certain payments, and a maximum term of five years, renewable until terminated by either party with one year’s written notice.
