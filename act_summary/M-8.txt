The Ministries and Ministers of State Act allows the Governor in Council to establish temporary ministries of State to develop policies on specific matters, with powers and duties defined by proclamation, and mandates that these ministries be presided over by a minister of State appointed by commission. The Act also outlines procedures for creating, modifying, or terminating such ministries, requires parliamentary approval for proclamations, and ensures accountability through annual reports to Parliament.
