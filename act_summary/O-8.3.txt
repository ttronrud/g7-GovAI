The Oil Tanker Moratorium Act prohibits oil tankers carrying more than 12,500 metric tons of crude oil or persistent oil from mooring, unloading, or loading at ports or marine installations in a specific northern coastal area of British Columbia, with exceptions for safety, emergencies, and public interest exemptions. The Act also establishes reporting requirements, enforcement powers for the Minister, and provisions for detaining and, in some cases, selling vessels that violate the moratorium.
