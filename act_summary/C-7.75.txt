The Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act establishes the incorporation and governance of not-for-profit corporations without share capital in Canada, defining key terms, setting out requirements for articles of incorporation, and outlining the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of corporations, including their ability to carry on activities nationwide and outside Canada. It also provides protections for third parties and ensures transparency through mandatory records and registers, while excluding certain financial and educational activities.
