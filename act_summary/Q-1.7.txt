This act establishes the office of Port Warden in Quebec to oversee the harbor’s operations, including cargo inspections, vessel surveys, and disputes between shipowners and cargo parties, with appointments made by the Board of Trade and Industry and oversight of fees, rules, and enforcement. The Port Warden serves without salary, conducts impartial investigations, and his certifications are binding evidence in legal proceedings, while the board retains authority to regulate fees, appointments, and resolve disputes.
