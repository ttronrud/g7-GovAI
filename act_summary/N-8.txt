The National Film Act establishes the National Film Board of Canada to promote and produce films that reflect Canada’s culture both domestically and internationally, while operating under the direction of the Minister of Canada. The Board is empowered to produce, distribute, and promote films, conduct research, and manage its operations independently, subject to ministerial oversight and financial controls.
