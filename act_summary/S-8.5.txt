The Settlement of International Investment Disputes Act establishes the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to provide a neutral, international forum for resolving investment disputes between states and nationals of other states through conciliation or arbitration, while granting the Centre and its personnel immunity, legal personality, and exemptions from taxation and legal process. It also sets out rules for the appointment of arbitrators and conciliators, the enforcement of awards, and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Centre over disputes that parties consent to submit.
