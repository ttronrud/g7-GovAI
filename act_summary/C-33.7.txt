The College of Patent Agents and Trademark Agents Act establishes a regulatory body to oversee patent and trademark agents in Canada, ensuring public protection through licensing, professional conduct standards, disciplinary procedures, and transparency. It grants the College the authority to license agents, investigate misconduct, impose sanctions, and maintain public registers, while providing immunity from liability for actions taken in good faith.
