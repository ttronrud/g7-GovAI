The International Interests in Mobile Equipment (aircraft equipment) Act implements the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment and its Aircraft Protocol to provide legal recognition and protection for interests in aircraft equipment, such as airframes, engines, and helicopters, enabling secure financing and leasing through an international registration system. It gives these interests the force of law in Canada during the period the Protocol is in force, with specific provisions for enforcement, priority, and remedies in insolvency or default.
