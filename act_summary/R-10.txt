The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act establishes the structure, powers, and responsibilities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), including the appointment and management of officers and members, disciplinary procedures, peace officer authority, and oversight mechanisms. It also provides for the Commissioner’s authority to delegate powers, establish rules and regulations, and ensure accountability through internal review and compliance with a Code of Conduct.
