The Federal Framework on Autism Spectrum Disorder Act mandates the Minister of Health to develop a comprehensive, evidence-based national framework to improve timely access to diagnosis, financial support, care, research, and services for autistic Canadians, with strong emphasis on equity, inclusion, and input from autistic individuals, families, and caregivers. The framework must be developed through broad consultation, presented to Parliament within 18 months, and followed by periodic reporting on implementation and effectiveness over a five-year period.
