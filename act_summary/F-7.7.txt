The Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act ensures timely payment to contractors and subcontractors involved in federal construction projects by requiring payment within 28 days of receiving a proper invoice and establishing an adjudication process to resolve disputes over non-payment. It also includes provisions for interest on unpaid amounts, payment obligations throughout the subcontracting chain, and a binding adjudication mechanism to enforce payments.
