The Integrated Circuit Topography Act establishes the rights, registration, and protection of topographies—designs for integrated circuit products—by granting exclusive rights to creators or successors for a ten-year period, subject to conditions such as originality, timely filing, and national or international eligibility. It defines key terms, outlines exceptions for non-infringement (e.g., research, private use), and provides mechanisms for enforcement, including court actions, injunctions, and remedies for infringement.
