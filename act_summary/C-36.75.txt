The Consumer-Driven Banking Act establishes a framework that allows consumers, including small businesses, to choose which financial entities can share their personal data—such as bank account and loan information—while ensuring the data is shared securely and without modification. It creates a regulatory system with technical standards, oversight by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, and clear penalties for misuse or false representation of participation.
