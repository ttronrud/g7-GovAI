The Hazardous Materials Information Review Act allows suppliers and employers to claim exemptions from disclosing certain chemical information—such as chemical names, CAS numbers, and toxicological study details—when they believe the information constitutes confidential business information. If the Minister reviews and validates the claim, the disclosure requirement is exempted for a specified period, with the Minister retaining the authority to suspend or cancel exemptions if conditions are not met, and to disclose such information in emergencies or for public health and safety purposes.
