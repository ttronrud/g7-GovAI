The Payment Clearing and Settlement Act establishes the Bank of Canada as the resolution authority for clearing and settlement systems in Canada, providing for their supervision, risk management, and resolution to ensure financial system stability and minimize public loss. It mandates oversight of systemic and payments risks, requires transparency and reporting, and enables the Bank to take corrective actions or resolve failing systems while protecting the integrity and efficiency of Canada’s financial infrastructure.
