The Weights and Measures Act establishes standards for accurate measurement in trade, mandates approval and inspection of weighing and measuring devices, and prohibits the use of unauthorized units of measurement. It provides for the regulation of devices, inspection procedures, enforcement powers, and penalties for non-compliance, all in alignment with the International System of Units and Canadian-specific measurement standards.
