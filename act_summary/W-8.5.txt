The Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act implements the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species by regulating the import, export, and interprovincial transport of endangered animals and plants, requiring permits for such activities, and establishing enforcement powers to prevent trade in species that are illegally taken or transported. It aims to protect wildlife and plant species from over-exploitation through strict controls on international and domestic trade.
