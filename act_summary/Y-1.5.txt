The Youth Criminal Justice Act establishes a separate, rehabilitation-focused system for young persons (aged 12 to 17), emphasizing proportionate accountability, restorative justice, and the use of extrajudicial measures for non-violent offences to prevent crime and support reintegration. It ensures young people’s rights are protected, promotes family and community involvement, and limits incarceration, reserving it for serious violent offences.
