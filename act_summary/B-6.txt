The Boards of Trade Act establishes the formation, governance, and powers of boards of trade and chambers of commerce in Canadian provinces, including their rights to incorporate, elect officers, adopt by-laws, and regulate grain weighers through licensing and oaths. It also prohibits the unauthorized use of the names "Board of Trade" or "Chamber of Commerce" and provides for the registration, operation, and legal standing of these bodies.
