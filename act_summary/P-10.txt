The Pesticide Residue Compensation Act provides that the Minister of Health may compensate farmers for losses caused by pesticide residues in their agricultural products, provided the residue was from a registered pesticide used according to approved practices and not due to the farmer’s fault. Compensation is subject to strict conditions, including minimum loss thresholds, required steps to reduce loss, and the possibility of legal action being pursued on the farmer’s behalf, with appeals available to an Assessor if compensation is deemed unreasonable.
