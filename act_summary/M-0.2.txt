The Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act establishes land use, land and water, and environmental impact review boards in the Mackenzie Valley to promote coordinated, Indigenous-led resource management and ensure public participation in decisions affecting land and water use. It provides for the governance of these boards, including appointment processes, conflict of interest rules, and the primacy of land claim agreements over the Act.
