The Global Minimum Tax Act establishes a global minimum tax framework to prevent tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) through mechanisms such as the GloBE regime, which adjusts tax liabilities based on income, asset gains, and tax rates across jurisdictions. It defines key terms related to financial accounting, tax regimes, and group structures to ensure consistent application of the rules, including provisions for adjustments, deductions, and reporting requirements.
