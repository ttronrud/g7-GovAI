The Industrial Design Act provides for the registration and protection of industrial designs—features of shape, configuration, pattern, or ornament that appeal to the eye in a finished article—granting the proprietor exclusive rights to prevent unauthorized use, with protections lasting up to 15 years from the filing date. It establishes a Register of Industrial Designs, outlines requirements for registration, including novelty and non-utilitarian features, and includes provisions for priority claims, public disclosure, infringement remedies, and enforcement by the Federal Court.
