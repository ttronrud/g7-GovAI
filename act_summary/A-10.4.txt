The Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act establishes rules for the transfer of airports by the Minister of Transport to designated airport authorities, including provisions on official languages, superannuation rights for employees, tax exemptions for airport-related business, and the authority to seize aircraft for unpaid fees. It also ensures that transferred airports are treated as federal institutions for legal and financial purposes, with specific protections for employees and financial instruments.
