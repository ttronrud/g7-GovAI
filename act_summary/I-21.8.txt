The Investment Canada Act establishes a framework for reviewing significant investments by non-Canadians in Canada to promote economic growth and employment while protecting national security. It requires notification and review of investments that meet certain thresholds—such as those involving control of a Canadian business with assets exceeding specific values—ensuring that such investments do not pose a risk to Canada’s security or public interest.
