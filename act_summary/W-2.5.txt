The War Service Grants Act provides war service gratuities and re-establishment credits to members of the Canadian armed forces who served during World War II, based on the length and location of their service, with specific rules for eligibility, payment, and distribution to dependants upon death. It also outlines conditions under which gratuities and credits can be paid, deducted, or transferred, and ensures support for veterans' re-establishment and dependants.
