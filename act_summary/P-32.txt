The Public Servants Inventions Act vests rights in inventions made by public servants in the course of their duties or with government resources in Her Majesty in right of Canada, requiring public servants to notify the appropriate minister, refrain from filing foreign patent applications without consent, and disclose their status in Canadian patent applications. The appropriate minister determines ownership, may manage and exploit the invention, and can authorize awards to inventors, with appeals to the Federal Court if necessary.
