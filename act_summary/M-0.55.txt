The Maanulth First Nations Final Agreement Act enacts and ratifies the Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement, a treaty and land claims agreement between the Maanulth First Nations, the Government of Canada, and the Government of British Columbia, recognizing aboriginal rights, establishing a new relationship, and providing legal effect to the agreement under Canadian law. The Act confirms the validity of the Agreement and its priority over conflicting federal laws, while also outlining specific rights, land ownership, and procedural protections for the Maanulth First Nations.
