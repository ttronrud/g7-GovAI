This Act implements Canada’s ratification of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), establishing the legal framework for Canada’s participation in the global trading system, including provisions for dispute resolution, trade obligations, and the management of trade-related policies. It grants the Governor in Council authority to suspend or modify federal laws in response to WTO agreements, while ensuring that no individual can enforce rights under the Agreement without the Attorney General’s consent.
