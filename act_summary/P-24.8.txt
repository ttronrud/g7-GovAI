The Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act implements Canada’s commitment to the Convention on Cluster Munitions by banning the use, development, acquisition, and possession of cluster munitions, explosive submunitions, and explosive bomblets, with limited exemptions for military operations, destruction, and humanitarian purposes. It also establishes penalties for violations and provides for the safe handling and disposal of such munitions.
