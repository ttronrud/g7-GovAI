The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act establishes record-keeping, client identification, and suspicious transaction reporting requirements for financial entities to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, while also creating a framework for monitoring politically exposed persons and correspondent banking relationships with foreign entities. It strengthens Canada’s efforts to detect and deter financial crimes, supports international anti-money laundering commitments, and enhances the capacity to protect the financial system from illicit use.
