The Tax Court of Canada Act establishes the structure, jurisdiction, and procedures of the Tax Court of Canada as a superior court of record, granting it exclusive original jurisdiction over appeals and references in tax matters under various federal Acts, including the Income Tax Act, Excise Tax Act, and Customs Act. It outlines the appointment, powers, and responsibilities of judges and associate judges, including provisions for retirement, removal, and the conduct of hearings, while also setting rules for discovery, costs, and the court’s authority to impose penalties for contempt.
