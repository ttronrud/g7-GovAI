The Sex Offender Information Registration Act requires sex offenders to register personal and location details with police services and maintain up-to-date information in a central database to help prevent and investigate sexual crimes, while strictly limiting access to that information to protect the privacy of offenders and support their rehabilitation. The Act establishes clear reporting obligations, including upon conviction, changes in residence or identity, and travel, with specific requirements for those convicted of sexual offences against children.
