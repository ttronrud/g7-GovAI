The Aeronautics Act establishes the framework for the regulation and development of aeronautics in Canada, assigning broad responsibilities to the Minister of Transport (or the Minister of National Defence for defence-related matters), including the supervision of air navigation services, aerodromes, aircraft safety, and aviation security. It also provides mechanisms for charging fees for services, enforcing payment through seizure of aircraft, and regulating aviation safety and security across domestic and international operations.
