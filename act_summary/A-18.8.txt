The Avoiding Complicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act establishes a framework to prevent Canadian government officials from disclosing, requesting, or using information that could lead to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by foreign entities. It requires deputy heads of key federal agencies to follow written directions from the Governor in Council, make those directions and annual reports publicly available (with appropriate security and privacy exceptions), and provide copies to parliamentary and oversight bodies.
