The Government Services Act, 1999 establishes a temporary framework to resume government services and enforce employment continuity during a transitional period following the expiration of collective agreements, ensuring that employees and the Public Service Alliance of Canada (bargaining agent) comply with work obligations and prohibits strikes. It also provides for the temporary application of new terms and conditions of employment, which function as a single collective agreement, and includes provisions for penalties and enforcement to ensure compliance.
