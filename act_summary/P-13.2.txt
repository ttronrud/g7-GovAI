The Pharmacare Act establishes a framework to improve the accessibility and affordability of prescription drugs for all Canadians by guiding the step-by-step implementation of national universal, single-payer pharmacare, in collaboration with provinces, territories, and Indigenous peoples, and includes provisions for a national formulary, bulk purchasing strategy, and a committee of experts to recommend the operation and financing of pharmacare. It commits the federal government to long-term funding and first-dollar coverage for specific drugs, such as those for diabetes and contraception, and mandates the development of a pan-Canadian strategy on appropriate drug use.
