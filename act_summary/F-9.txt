The Feeds Act establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacture, sale, import, and handling of feeds in Canada, requiring all feeds to be approved or registered by the Minister, conform to prescribed standards, and be properly packaged and labelled. It also outlines strict rules on inspection marks, enforcement powers for inspectors, and penalties for violations, while allowing for exemptions and regulations on safety, labelling, and cross-provincial or international feed movements.
