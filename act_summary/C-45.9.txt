The Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act criminalizes genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, with mandatory life imprisonment for those offenses, and extends liability to military commanders and superiors who fail to prevent or report such crimes. It also allows prosecution for these offenses committed outside Canada and establishes strict rules on prosecution, defenses, and parole eligibility.
