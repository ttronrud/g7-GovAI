This Act implements the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement and related agreements by establishing mechanisms for trade, investment, environmental, and labour cooperation, while ensuring that all federal laws and actions are aligned with the agreement’s objectives. It creates a framework for the Joint Commission, outlines the role of the Minister, and requires annual reporting on human rights and trade impacts, all while restricting private enforcement of rights under the agreement.
