The Vimy Ridge Day Act designates April 9 each year as Vimy Ridge Day, honoring Canada's first unified national battle and recognizing its significance in the nation's journey to independence. On this day, the Canadian flag is lowered at half-mast on the Peace Tower, though Vimy Ridge Day is not a legal holiday.
