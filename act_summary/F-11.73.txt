This Act establishes national principles and standards for child and family services for Indigenous children in Canada, affirming the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to self-government, including jurisdiction over child and family services, and prioritizing the best interests of the child, cultural continuity, and substantive equality. It mandates that services be culturally appropriate, family-centered, and provided in a way that respects Indigenous laws, traditions, and rights, while promoting reconciliation and reform of the child welfare system.
