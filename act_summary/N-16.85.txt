The National Strategy Respecting Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice Act mandates the Canadian government to develop a national strategy to assess, prevent, and address environmental racism by examining the links between race, socio-economic status, and environmental risk, and by involving marginalized communities in policy development. The strategy must include a study, specific measures to advance environmental justice, and regular reporting to Parliament every five years to evaluate its effectiveness.
