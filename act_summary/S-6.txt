The Seals Act establishes the authority and framework for the use of royal seals and instruments in Canada, allowing royal instruments to be issued under the Great Seal of Canada or other approved royal seals with the Queen’s approval. It empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations on the use, custody, and authentication of royal seals and documents under the sign-manual, subject to the Queen’s approval.
