The Canada-Belgium Income Tax Convention Act, 1976 establishes and implements a tax treaty to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains for residents of Canada and Belgium. It defines key terms such as residence, permanent establishment, and taxable income, and provides rules on the taxation of dividends, profits, and income from property, with specific limits on tax rates and mechanisms for resolving tax disputes between the two countries.
