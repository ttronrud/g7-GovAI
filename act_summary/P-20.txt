The Prisons and Reformatories Act establishes rules for the confinement, remission, and temporary absences of prisoners in non-penitentiary facilities, including provisions for earned remission based on good conduct and participation in rehabilitation programs, the transfer of prisoners between provinces, and the authorization of temporary absences for medical, humanitarian, or rehabilitation purposes, all guided by principles of fairness, safety, and reintegration. It also ensures that prisoners are entitled to release before the full term of their sentence if they have earned remission, and outlines procedures for the supervision and enforcement of temporary absences.
