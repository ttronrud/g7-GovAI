The Bills of Exchange Act establishes the legal framework for negotiable instruments such as bills of exchange and promissory notes, defining key terms, setting rules for issuance, acceptance, endorsement, and payment, and addressing issues like time limits, holidays, and enforceability. It ensures that such instruments are valid and enforceable under specific conditions, including the requirement for clear payment terms, proper signatures, and the treatment of non-business days, while also providing protections for holders and special provisions for instruments involving patent rights.
