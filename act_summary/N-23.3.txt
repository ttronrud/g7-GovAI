The Nisga’a Final Agreement Act enacts federal legislation to give legal effect to the Nisga’a Final Agreement, a treaty and land claims agreement that establishes a new relationship between the Nisga’a Nation and the Crown, recognizes Nisga’a rights and title, and provides for the application of the agreement over conflicting laws, while affirming the Nisga’a Nation’s self-governance and distinct legal status. It confirms that the agreement is binding, valid, and superior to conflicting federal or provincial laws, and includes provisions on land ownership, taxation, governance, and judicial procedures.
