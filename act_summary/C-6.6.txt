The Canada–Kuwait Tax Agreement Act, 2002 establishes a bilateral tax treaty to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains for residents of Canada and Kuwait. It defines key terms such as residency, permanent establishment, and taxable profits, and provides rules for determining which country has the right to tax income, including income from property and international business activities.
