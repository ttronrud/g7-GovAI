The Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act establishes a framework for Canada to provide and receive legal assistance in criminal matters through international agreements, including treaties, conventions, and administrative arrangements, and grants courts in Canada jurisdiction to enforce certain foreign criminal orders, such as fines, seizures, and forfeitures, under specific conditions. It also includes safeguards against abuse, such as prohibitions on enforcement that would prejudice investigations, violate human rights, or harm national interests.
