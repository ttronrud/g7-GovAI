The Canada–Moldova Tax Convention Act, 2002 establishes a tax treaty to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income taxes between Canada and Moldova, defining rules for residency, permanent establishments, taxation of income, dividends, and profit attribution. It ensures that income earned by residents in one country is not taxed twice, with specific provisions on how profits, dividends, and other income are treated and taxed under defined conditions.
