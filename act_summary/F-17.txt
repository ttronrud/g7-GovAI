The Great Lakes Fisheries Convention Act approves and confirms the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between Canada and the United States, establishing the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to jointly manage fishery conservation, conduct research, and eradicate sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes. The Act enables the Commission to make regulations, enforce compliance through penalties, and continue in force until the Convention is terminated.
