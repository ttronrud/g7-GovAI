This Act designates May 20 as National Seal Products Day to recognize the cultural, historical, and economic significance of seal hunting and seal products among Canada’s Indigenous peoples and coastal communities. The day is not a legal holiday but serves to honor traditional knowledge and the sustainable use of ocean resources.
