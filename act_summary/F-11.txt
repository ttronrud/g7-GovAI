The Financial Administration Act establishes the framework for the management of federal public administration, including the definition of key terms, the structure and powers of the Treasury Board, and the oversight of departments, Crown corporations, and financial operations. It provides the Treasury Board with broad authority over administrative, financial, human resources, and policy matters in the federal government, while also enabling delegation of powers and ensuring accountability through statutory procedures and oversight.
