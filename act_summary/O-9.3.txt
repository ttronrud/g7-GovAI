The Online News Act establishes a regulatory framework to ensure fair compensation and sustainable practices in Canada’s digital news marketplace by requiring digital news intermediaries to engage in structured bargaining, mediation, or arbitration with eligible news businesses. It aims to protect journalistic independence, promote equitable access to news content, and support the sustainability of local, Indigenous, and minority-language news outlets through transparent, rights-based agreements.
