The Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act reorganizes Teleglobe by creating a new corporation to which Teleglobe transfers its business, assets, and liabilities, and subsequently dissolves Teleglobe, renaming it TH(1987), while ensuring regulatory, tax, and pension provisions are adjusted to facilitate the transition and maintain continuity of operations. It also provides for the immediate approval of certain tolls, contracts, and obligations, and ensures the new corporation meets regulatory requirements for investment and trust purposes.
