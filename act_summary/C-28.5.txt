The Children’s Special Allowances Act provides for monthly financial allowances to be paid to support the care, maintenance, education, and advancement of children residing in government or Indigenous-led institutions, foster homes, or private care settings, with payments based on the child’s age and subject to specific eligibility and approval conditions. The allowances are non-taxable, not subject to assignment, and are administered by the Minister of National Revenue, with regulations governing applications, payment timing, and information privacy.
