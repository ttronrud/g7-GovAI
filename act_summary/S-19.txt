The Statistics Act establishes Statistics Canada as a key government body responsible for collecting, analyzing, and publishing official statistical information on economic, social, and demographic matters, while ensuring confidentiality, independence, and transparency in its operations. It outlines the duties of the Chief Statistician, the governance structure, data collection methods, privacy protections, and the conditions under which statistical information may be disclosed or shared.
