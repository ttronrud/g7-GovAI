The Mi’kmaq Education Act enables Mi’kmaq communities in Nova Scotia to exercise jurisdiction over education on their reserves, including the development of constitutions, creation of laws for primary to post-secondary education, and establishment of education boards, all in accordance with the 1997 Agreement between the Crown and the Mi’kmaq Bands. It also establishes Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey as a corporation to support educational programs and ensures that community laws are accessible, enforceable, and independent of federal provisions under the Indian Act.
