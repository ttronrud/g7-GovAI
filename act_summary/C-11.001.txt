The Canada Water Agency Act establishes the Canada Water Agency to coordinate federal efforts in protecting, conserving, and restoring freshwater ecosystems by promoting scientific and Indigenous knowledge, enhancing data access, and improving governance. The Agency is headed by a President appointed by the Governor in Council and operates under the direction of the Minister of the Environment, with a mandate to support sustainable freshwater management through collaboration with provinces, Indigenous peoples, and international partners.
