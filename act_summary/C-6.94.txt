The Canada–Mongolia Tax Convention Act, 2002 establishes a framework to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital taxes between Canada and Mongolia, defining resident status, permanent establishments, taxation of income and capital, and providing tax relief for dividends, interest, and profits. It ensures that taxes on income and capital are applied fairly and consistently, with specific limits on tax rates for dividends and interest paid to residents of the other country.
