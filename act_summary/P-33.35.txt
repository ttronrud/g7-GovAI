The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act establishes a new labour relations and employment board to oversee disputes in the federal public sector, defining its composition, powers, and procedures, including the appointment of members, conduct of hearings, and finality of its decisions. It continues and strengthens the functions of the previous Public Service Labour Relations and Employment Board, ensuring impartiality, procedural fairness, and independence in resolving labour matters.
