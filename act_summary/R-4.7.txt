The Referendum Act establishes the framework for holding referendums in Canada, outlining procedures for proposing, approving, and conducting referendums, including requirements for referendum questions, funding limits, registration of committees, and the conduct of voting. It ensures public participation by requiring the Chief Electoral Officer to adapt election laws and provide accessible ballot formats, while restricting contributions and expenses to maintain fairness and transparency.
