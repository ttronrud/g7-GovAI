The Carriage by Air Act incorporates the Warsaw Convention and its amendments into Canadian law, giving the provisions of the Convention (and related protocols) the force of law for international air carriage regardless of the aircraft’s nationality, and establishing uniform rules for passenger, baggage, and cargo transport, including documentation requirements and liability limits. It also ensures that carriers, passengers, and other parties are bound by these rules in Canadian courts, and provides mechanisms for enforcement, jurisdiction, and liability in cases of injury or loss.
