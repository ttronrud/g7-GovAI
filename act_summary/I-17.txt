The International Boundary Waters Treaty Act confirms and enforces the 1909 Canada–United States treaty on boundary waters, prohibiting bulk removal of water from boundary or transboundary waters without a licence and establishing strict regulations to protect the natural flow of waters that cross the international boundary, with provisions for inspection, enforcement, and penalties for violations. It also grants the Federal Court jurisdiction and establishes the International Joint Commission’s powers to oversee compliance and resolve disputes.
