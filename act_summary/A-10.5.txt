The Air Travellers Security Charge Act imposes a security charge on air transportation services that include a chargeable emplanement, with the amount varying based on the destination and whether excise tax is applicable. The charge is collected by designated air carriers and applies to services acquired after specific dates, with certain exemptions for re-sales, charitable donations, and specific circumstances.
