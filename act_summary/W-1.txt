The Wages Liability Act establishes mechanisms to ensure payment of wages for workers on public works projects by allowing Her Majesty to pay outstanding claims from funds held for contract security, requiring regular wage reporting by contractors, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. It also holds companies incorporated for construction work liable for wages of employees for up to three months and provides workers with legal recourse if wages are not paid by contractors.
