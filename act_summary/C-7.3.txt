The Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act establishes a representative network of marine conservation areas across Canada’s oceans and Great Lakes to protect marine ecosystems, promote biodiversity, and support sustainable use of marine resources, while ensuring the involvement of Indigenous communities, coastal populations, and scientific research. It mandates the creation of managed zones within these areas that balance ecological protection with sustainable human activities, and requires comprehensive planning, public consultation, and regular reporting to ensure long-term environmental and social benefits.
