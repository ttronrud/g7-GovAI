The High Risk Child Sex Offender Database Act establishes a publicly accessible database managed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to store information on individuals found guilty of sexual offences against children who pose a high risk of committing such crimes. The database includes personal and offence-related details, with safeguards for notification, review, and appeal, while ensuring public safety and protecting the rights of individuals involved.
