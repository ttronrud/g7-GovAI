The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Act establishes the criteria and administration for awarding the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal to Canadians who serve in UN or international peacekeeping forces, including provisions for nomination, eligibility, posthumous awards, and regulations on exclusions and next of kin. The Minister of National Defence, along with other relevant ministers, can nominate qualified individuals, and the Governor in Council has authority to set design, eligibility, and operational rules.
