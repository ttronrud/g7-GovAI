The Witness Protection Program Act establishes a federal program administered by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to protect witnesses and individuals who assist in law enforcement or national security matters, providing them with relocation, identity change, counselling, and financial support. It sets out strict rules on admissions, protection agreements, confidentiality, and disclosures, while ensuring the security of protected persons and the integrity of the program.
