The Explosives Act regulates the manufacture, storage, transportation, and use of explosives in Canada, requiring all such activities to be conducted in licensed facilities and restricting the possession and trafficking of unmarked plastic explosives. It establishes strict controls on illicit manufacture and trafficking, mandates safety and security standards, and empowers inspectors to conduct searches and seizures to ensure compliance.
