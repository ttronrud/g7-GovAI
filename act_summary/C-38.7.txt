The Contraventions Act establishes a simplified legal procedure for prosecuting minor regulatory offences (designated as "contraventions"), distinguishing them from criminal offences and providing for quick resolution through tickets, plea options, and limited hearings. It ensures that such offences are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their nature, with provisions for young persons, language preferences, and specific rules on fines, service of tickets, and trial rights.
