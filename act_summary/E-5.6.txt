The Employment Insurance Act establishes the framework for unemployment benefits in Canada, defining eligibility criteria, insurable employment, benefit calculations, and administrative responsibilities of the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. It sets out conditions for qualifying for benefits, including minimum hours of insurable employment based on regional unemployment rates, and includes provisions for monitoring the impact of benefits on employment and economic stability.
