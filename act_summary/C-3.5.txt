The Canada Disability Savings Act encourages long-term savings for individuals with severe and prolonged disabilities by providing Canada Disability Savings Grants and Bonds, which are paid into registered disability savings plans based on income thresholds and eligibility criteria. These financial incentives aim to enhance the financial security of persons with disabilities and their families.
