The Canadian Multiculturalism Act establishes multiculturalism as a fundamental aspect of Canadian identity and enacts a comprehensive policy to promote the recognition, preservation, and celebration of Canada’s cultural and racial diversity. It requires federal institutions to ensure equal opportunity, respect diversity, and implement practices that support the full participation of all Canadians in economic, social, cultural, and political life.
