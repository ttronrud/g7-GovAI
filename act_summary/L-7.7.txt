The Library and Archives of Canada Act establishes a federal institution to preserve, manage, and provide access to Canada’s documentary heritage, including government publications and records, ensuring its availability for cultural, social, and educational purposes. It creates the Library and Archives of Canada as a central repository with responsibilities for acquisition, preservation, access, and coordination of knowledge across government institutions.
