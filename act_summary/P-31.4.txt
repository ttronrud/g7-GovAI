The Public Pensions Reporting Act requires the Minister to direct the Chief Actuary to conduct regular actuarial reviews of key federal pension plans, with reviews occurring no more than three years apart and including assessments of benefit costs, unfunded liabilities, and asset valuations. These reviews must result in the filing of cost certificates, valuation reports, and asset certifications, which are then laid before Parliament or published in the Canada Gazette if Parliament is dissolved.
