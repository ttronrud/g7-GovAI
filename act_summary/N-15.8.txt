This act allows Atomic Energy of Canada Limited to temporarily resume operations of the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River for up to 120 days to address a critical shortage of medical isotopes, despite licence conditions related to earthquake-proof backup units, provided safety is confirmed. The temporary operation does not override the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s authority, except for the specified licence conditions.
