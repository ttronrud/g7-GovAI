The Marine Insurance Act establishes the legal framework for marine insurance in Canada, defining key terms such as insurable interest, marine perils, and types of policies (e.g., voyage, time, valued, unvalued), and setting out requirements for good faith, disclosure, and warranties. It ensures that contracts of marine insurance are valid, enforceable, and grounded in principles of utmost good faith, while providing clear rules on when losses are recoverable and how claims are assessed.
