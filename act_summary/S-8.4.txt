The Service Fees Act establishes a framework for federal fees, requiring responsible authorities to set transparent, performance-based fees, consult stakeholders, and ensure accountability through public reporting and review processes. It mandates performance standards, public consultation, fee adjustment based on inflation, and regular reporting to Parliament, while providing exemptions for certain fees or circumstances.
