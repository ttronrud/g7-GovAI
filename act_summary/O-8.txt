The Oil Substitution and Conservation Act provides for financial payments to individuals who convert oil-dependent heating units or install energy-conserving improvements in specified buildings, with eligibility and timing restrictions, and authorizes the Minister of Natural Resources to offer broader financial assistance to promote the use of non-oil energy sources. The Act also allows for regulations to define key terms, set eligibility criteria, and specify conditions for payments, while enabling the Minister to administer the program and spend funds, including amounts received from provinces under intergovernmental agreements.
