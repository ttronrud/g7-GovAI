The Canada Student Financial Assistance Act establishes a framework for providing student financial assistance to qualifying Canadian students, including loans and other forms of support, with provisions for interest relief, loan forgiveness for those working in under-served communities, and oversight by designated authorities and the Minister. It also outlines rules for loan eligibility, repayment, administrative agreements, and the conditions under which loans may be forgiven or terminated due to disability or death.
