This Act establishes the legal framework for implementing the settlement of Indian lands and affairs in British Columbia, as agreed upon between the Dominion of Canada and the Province, by giving effect to the Royal Commission’s recommendations, including adjustments to reserve sizes, without requiring Indian surrenders, and enabling further negotiations to fully resolve outstanding differences. It authorizes the Governor in Council to carry out these adjustments and ensure the final settlement of all disputes related to Indian lands and affairs in the province.
