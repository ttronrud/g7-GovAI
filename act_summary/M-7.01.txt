The Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 implements the international Migratory Birds Convention by protecting and conserving migratory birds and their nests in Canada and its exclusive economic zone, prohibiting the possession, trade, or harmful deposition of substances in areas frequented by these birds. It establishes strict penalties for violations and grants game officers broad enforcement powers, including inspections, arrests, and vessel detentions, with protections for employees who report violations in good faith.
