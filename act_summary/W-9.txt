The Canada Wildlife Act establishes a framework for the conservation and protection of wildlife and their habitats, empowering the Minister of the Environment to promote research, conservation efforts, and public cooperation. It grants wildlife officers broad enforcement powers, including inspections, searches, seizures, and the issuance of compliance orders, while ensuring accountability and legal protections for those involved.
