The Alternative Fuels Act mandates that federal bodies and Crown corporations progressively replace petroleum-based fuels with alternative fuels in their motor vehicles, aiming for 75% alternative fuel use by the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1999, and thereafter, where cost-effective and operationally feasible. The Act establishes specific targets for alternative fuel vehicle adoption across fiscal years and allows the Treasury Board to issue regulations to define alternative fuels, vehicle classes, and criteria for feasibility.
