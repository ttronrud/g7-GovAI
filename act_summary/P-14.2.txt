The Pioneer Trust Payment Continuation Act allows the Canadian government to continue payments on guaranteed income averaging certificates issued by the Pioneer Trust Company for terms exceeding five years, with costs shared between the federal government and Saskatchewan, and total payments capped at five million dollars. The funds are drawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, with expenditures limited by the amount of revenue received through agreements with Saskatchewan.
