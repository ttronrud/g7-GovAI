The Federal Law—Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1 harmonizes federal legislation with Quebec's civil law tradition by repealing outdated provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada and ensuring that federal laws in Quebec reflect both common law and civil law principles. It also updates key provisions in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to align with civil law principles, with most provisions coming into force on June 1, 2001.
