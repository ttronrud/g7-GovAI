The Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination in areas such as employment, goods and services, and housing based on grounds like race, sex, disability, and sexual orientation, and establishes the Canadian Human Rights Commission to enforce these protections, investigate complaints, and promote equality. It also allows for exceptions where discrimination is based on bona fide occupational requirements or where special programs are designed to address disadvantages faced by specific groups.
