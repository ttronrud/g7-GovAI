The National Strategy for Eye Care Act mandates the development of a comprehensive national strategy by the Minister of Health to prevent, treat, and rehabilitate eye diseases, promote research and data collection, enhance coordination between federal and provincial governments, and ensure timely review of eye disease treatments. The strategy must be completed within 18 months, with a follow-up evaluation required within five years, and February is designated as "Age-Related Macular Degeneration Awareness Month" across Canada.
