The Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2001 implements several bilateral income tax treaties between Canada and various countries, including Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Senegal, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic. These treaties establish rules for avoiding double taxation and fiscal evasion, define key terms such as residency and permanent establishment, and provide that the treaty provisions prevail over conflicting domestic laws, with regulations and notices published in the Canada Gazette.
