The Motor Vehicle Safety Act establishes safety standards for vehicles and equipment in Canada, requiring manufacturers, importers, and sellers to ensure compliance with prescribed safety standards, apply a national safety mark, provide required documentation and records, and notify the Minister and owners of defects or non-compliance. It also allows for exemptions under specific conditions and empowers the Minister to require corrective actions or testing to protect public safety.
