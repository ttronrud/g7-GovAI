The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act establishes a framework to ensure Canada meets ambitious, science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. It mandates the Minister of the Environment to set and regularly update national emissions targets for key milestone years (2030, 2035, 2040, 2045), publish detailed emissions reduction plans, and maintain transparency through public reporting, parliamentary tabling, and consultation with Indigenous peoples and experts.
