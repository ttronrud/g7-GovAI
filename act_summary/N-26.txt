The Northern Pipeline Act establishes the Northern Pipeline Agency to implement the 1977 Canada-United States agreement on a natural gas pipeline, ensuring federal responsibilities are met, promoting consultation with provinces and Indigenous communities, and facilitating efficient planning, construction, and operation of the pipeline while maximizing economic and social benefits and ensuring Canadian participation. It creates a framework for oversight, decision-making, and coordination through appointed officials, advisory councils, and regulatory mechanisms, all aimed at fulfilling the pipeline’s objectives in a just and equitable manner.
