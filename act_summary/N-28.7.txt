The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act ratifies the 1993 land claims agreement between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and the Government of Canada, recognizing Inuit aboriginal title, granting them rights to land, resources, wildlife harvesting, and participation in decision-making, and establishing the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board to manage wildlife resources. The Agreement supersedes any conflicting laws and remains binding on all parties, including non-parties, to the extent provided.
