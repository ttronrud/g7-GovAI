The Status of the Artist Act recognizes artists as professionals who play a vital role in Canada’s cultural and economic life, establishing a framework to protect their rights, promote freedom of association, and ensure fair working conditions through scale agreements between artists and producers. It creates a regulatory framework under the Canada Industrial Relations Board to govern professional relations, including certification of artists’ associations, representation votes, and dispute resolution, while excluding employees covered by other labor laws.
