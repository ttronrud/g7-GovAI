The Budget Implementation Act, 2009, implements various fiscal and regulatory measures, including funding for infrastructure, housing, economic development in specific regions, and the establishment of a Canadian securities regulation regime, with many provisions coming into force on specific dates or by order of the Governor in Council. It also includes transitional provisions and amendments to existing laws, particularly in areas such as employment insurance, public sector compensation, and health technology.
