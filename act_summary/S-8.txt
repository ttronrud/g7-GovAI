The Seeds Act establishes regulations for the sale, import, export, and handling of seeds in Canada, requiring seeds to meet prescribed standards for purity, germination, and safety, and mandating proper labelling, packaging, and documentation. It also outlines the powers of inspectors and analysts to enforce compliance, including the ability to seize, inspect, and forfeit non-compliant seed, and provides for penalties for violations.
