The Food and Drugs Act establishes regulations for the safe manufacture, sale, advertising, and use of food, drugs, cosmetics, and devices in Canada, defining key terms and setting strict requirements to protect public health, prevent misleading claims, and ensure product safety—particularly regarding clinical trials, labeling, unsanitary conditions, and animal testing. It also excludes certain products like tobacco and vaping devices from its scope unless used for medical purposes.
