The Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act establishes the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board (Board) to independently investigate transportation occurrences—such as aviation, marine, rail, and pipeline incidents—to identify safety deficiencies and make non-binding recommendations for improving safety, without assigning fault or liability. The Board operates with independence, has specific membership and conflict-of-interest rules, and reports to Parliament annually.
