This Act formally establishes the *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985* by declaring the contents of a certified Statute Roll—consisting of consolidated public general statutes—as law, repealing specified older Acts before their coming into force, and providing a framework for their operation, including provisions for supplements, transitional effects, and continuity of references. It also outlines the procedures for publishing, amending, and administering the Revised Statutes, ensuring they serve as a consolidated and authoritative version of Canadian law.
