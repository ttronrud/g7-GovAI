The Parks Canada Agency Act establishes the Parks Canada Agency to protect and manage Canada’s national parks, national historic sites, and other heritage areas, ensuring their ecological and commemorative integrity while providing quality services to the public and promoting national pride and identity. The Agency operates under the Minister of the Environment, with autonomy in human resources and operations, and is responsible for implementing policies, managing visitor use, and acquiring or designating new protected areas.
