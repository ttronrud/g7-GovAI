The Employment Support Act establishes a framework to provide employment support grants to Canadian manufacturers affected by foreign import surtaxes or similar measures that threaten job losses, with the Board administering grants to maintain employment levels during specified periods. Grants are limited in amount and subject to conditions, and the Board must ensure employment is maintained at prescribed levels upon termination of the assistance period.
