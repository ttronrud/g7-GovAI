The Government Property Traffic Act empowers the Governor in Council to regulate traffic on Crown lands, including speed, parking, one-way routes, noise, and vehicle prohibitions, with penalties for violations and liability extending to vehicle owners. It also establishes procedures for proving Crown ownership of land for enforcement purposes.
