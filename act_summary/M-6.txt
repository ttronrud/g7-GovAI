The Merchant Seamen Compensation Act provides for compensation to seamen and their dependants in the event of injury or death arising out of or in the course of their employment, treating certain disabilities as if caused by accident even if not directly due to an accident. It establishes the Minister of Labour as the sole authority to determine claims, ensures compensation is paid without being subject to deductions or legal claims, and includes provisions for notice requirements, medical examinations, and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Minister to resolve disputes.
