The National Housing Act establishes the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to promote affordable and accessible housing by regulating housing finance, supporting low-income families, and ensuring stability in the housing market through insurance, guarantees, and lending programs. It enables the Corporation to provide insurance and guarantees for housing loans, administer loans, and protect borrowers and lenders while maintaining limits on risk exposure to ensure financial stability.
