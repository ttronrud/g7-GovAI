The Civil Marriage Act extends the right to marry for civil purposes to couples of the same sex, ensuring equal access to marriage under Canadian law in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, while preserving the freedom of conscience and religion of religious groups. It establishes that marriage is a lawful union between two persons, valid regardless of sex, and provides clear legal recognition and protections for same-sex marriages, including retroactive validity and divorce procedures.
