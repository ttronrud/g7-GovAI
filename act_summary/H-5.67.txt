The Human Pathogens and Toxins Act establishes a comprehensive safety and security regime to protect the public from risks posed by human pathogens and toxins, requiring licences for activities such as possession, production, storage, and transfer, and mandating strict safety measures, reporting obligations, and oversight by the Minister of Health. It defines risk groups, outlines procedures for regulating substances, and includes provisions for emergency suspensions, reviews, and public transparency.
