The Canada Small Business Financing Act establishes a framework for financing small businesses in Canada by defining eligible borrowers, lenders, and loan conditions, while setting limits on loan amounts, interest, and the Minister’s liability for lender losses. It also outlines regulatory provisions, audit rights, and eligibility criteria, with specific limits and exemptions based on the timing of loan approvals and borrower-related obligations.
