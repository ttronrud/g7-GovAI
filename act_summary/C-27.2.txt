This act declares invalid a 1906 Order in Council that improperly attempted to consolidate the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve into one section, as it lacked legal authority under the Indian Act or other statutes, and validates all actions taken under that void order. It also provides for the reserve to be re-divided into its original six sections.
