The Publication of Statutes Act establishes the procedures for the custody, certification, and publication of Canadian Acts of Parliament, designating the Clerk of the Senate as the Clerk of the Parliaments responsible for issuing certified copies of statutes, ensuring their authenticity, and overseeing their distribution to legislative bodies and government departments. It also outlines the requirements for printing, bilingual publication, and distribution of statutes, as well as the fees and certification processes involved.
