The Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987 exempts certain agreements among ocean carriers (conferences) and between conferences from the Competition Act, provided they meet specific conditions such as tariff use, loyalty contracts, and rate structures, while still allowing the Canadian Transportation Agency to investigate and regulate practices that reduce competition or increase costs. The Act establishes transparency requirements, including public access to tariffs and documents, and enables the Agency to intervene if practices harm competition or transportation service.
