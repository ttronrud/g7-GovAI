The Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act establishes that, when applying tax conventions between Canada and other countries, terms not defined or ambiguously defined in the convention are interpreted using the current meaning of those terms under the Income Tax Act, not their meaning at the time the convention was enacted. It also clarifies how profits from business activities in Canada are calculated under the convention, ensures certain provisions of the Income Tax Act (such as deductions and pension definitions) apply, and defines key terms like "pension" and "periodic pension payment" to align with Canadian tax law.
