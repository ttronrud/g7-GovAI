The Canada–Norway Tax Convention Act, 2002 establishes the legal framework for the Canada–Norway tax treaty, defining rules for the taxation of income, capital gains, dividends, and interest to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion. It specifies conditions under which income is taxable in either country, outlines rules for permanent establishments, and sets limits on tax rates for dividends and interest paid to residents of the other country.
