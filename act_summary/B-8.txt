The Bridges Act establishes strict requirements for the safe opening and operation of bridges, including mandatory notice to the Minister before public use, mandatory engineering inspections, and provisions for postponing or condemning bridges deemed unsafe. It also imposes fines for violations such as opening a bridge without proper notice, ignoring safety orders, or failing to report accidents or submit required returns.
