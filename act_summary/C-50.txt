The Crown Liability and Proceedings Act establishes that the Canadian Crown is liable for damages caused by the fault of its servants or by the ownership, control, or custody of Crown property, with liability defined differently in Quebec (extracontractual civil liability) and other provinces (tort). It also provides specific rules on civil salvage, limits Crown liability for actions taken in the exercise of official powers, and outlines procedures for claims against the Crown, including exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Court and restrictions on remedies such as injunctions or specific performance.
