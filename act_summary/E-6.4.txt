The Energy Efficiency Act establishes mandatory energy efficiency standards for energy-using products in Canada, requiring dealers to ensure products comply with these standards and are properly labelled before sale or import. It also creates a regulatory framework for inspection, testing, seizure, and forfeiture of non-compliant products, while allowing the Minister to issue regulations on standards, labelling, testing, and reporting to promote energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
