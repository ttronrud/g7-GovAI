The Canada–Korea Tax Convention of 2006 establishes rules to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income taxes, defining residency, permanent establishments, and the taxation of income from sources in the other country. It specifies limits on tax rates for dividends, interest, and profits, and ensures that tax treatments are fair and consistent between Canada and the Republic of Korea.
