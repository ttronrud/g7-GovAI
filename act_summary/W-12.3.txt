The Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act establishes regulations to protect the public, environment, and infrastructure by governing hazardous wrecks and abandoned vessels, imposing liability on owners, and aligning with the Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks, 2007, particularly in Canadian waters and for Canadian vessels. It outlines reporting requirements, hazard assessments, marking or removal of wrecks, and financial responsibility for cleanup and damages, while also allowing for delegation of powers and coordination between federal agencies.
