The Security of Canada Information Disclosure Act establishes a legal framework to enable Government of Canada institutions to share information responsibly and effectively in order to protect Canada from activities that undermine its security, while ensuring compliance with privacy laws and respecting the rights of individuals. It allows for the disclosure of information between designated institutions when it contributes to the protection of national security, with strict safeguards on privacy, accountability, and record-keeping.
