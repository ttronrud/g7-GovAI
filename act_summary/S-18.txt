The State Immunity Act establishes that foreign states are generally immune from the jurisdiction of Canadian courts, but this immunity is waived or overridden in specific circumstances, such as when the state engages in commercial activities, causes personal injury or property damage in Canada, or supports terrorism. Additionally, the Act allows for a designated list of foreign states that have supported terrorism to be created and maintained, after which those states are no longer immune from judicial proceedings related to terrorism or its support.
