The Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act allows the Governor in Council to transfer or amalgamate powers, duties, and functions among federal ministers and departments, and ensures that the receiving minister or department assumes the responsibilities of the transferred entity. If a minister to whom powers are transferred dies or resigns, those powers may be transferred to another minister.
