The National Strategy for Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias Act establishes a comprehensive national strategy to improve care, support, and research for people living with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, including setting national objectives, promoting early diagnosis, advancing research, and developing evidence-based care guidelines. The Minister must convene a conference and establish an advisory board to develop and evaluate the strategy, with annual reports submitted to Parliament to assess its effectiveness.
