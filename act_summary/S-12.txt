The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act establishes a corporation to promote and support research and scholarship in the social sciences and humanities, advise the Minister on related matters, and manage its operations through a president, vice-president, and appointed members. The Council operates as an agent of Her Majesty, with powers to administer funds, enter into contracts, and establish committees, while submitting annual reports to Parliament.
