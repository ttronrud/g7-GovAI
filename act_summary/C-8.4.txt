This Act implements the Canada–Peru Free Trade Agreement and related agreements by establishing mechanisms for trade, investment, and cooperation, including the creation of a Joint Commission and defining the roles of the Minister and Government agencies. It ensures that federal laws and actions are aligned with the Agreement’s objectives of promoting fair trade, sustainable development, environmental protection, and labour rights, while restricting individual legal actions without the Attorney General’s consent.
