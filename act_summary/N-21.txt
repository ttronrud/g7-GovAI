The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act establishes a corporation to promote and assist research in the natural sciences and engineering (excluding health sciences), advise the Minister on related matters, and manage its operations with financial and administrative autonomy. The Council is led by a President and up to 18 members, who serve without pay (except for reasonable expenses), and it operates as an agent of Her Majesty, with powers to enter into contracts, appoint staff, and establish committees, all subject to oversight by the Minister and Parliament.
