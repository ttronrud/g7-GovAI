The Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act establishes a framework for determining whether a person is "Canadian controlled" and sets out the procedures for issuing certificates that reflect a person's Canadian ownership rate and control status, based on formal and informal equity, with the Minister having the authority to adjust determinations and issue revised certificates as needed. It applies to individuals, corporations, partnerships, and trusts, and provides mechanisms for reviewing, amending, or redetermining ownership status in response to changes in equity or control.
