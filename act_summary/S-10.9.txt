The Small Business Investment Grants Act provides for grants of up to 4% per annum of a small business’s outstanding debt obligation balance to reduce the effective interest rate to at least 12% per annum, but only for debts incurred before April 1, 1983. Grants are subject to strict eligibility criteria, regulations, and repayment obligations if conditions are not met or the grant is unauthorized.
