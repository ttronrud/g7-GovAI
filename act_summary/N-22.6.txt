The New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act establishes the creation and management of a new bridge connecting the Island of Montreal to Brossard, including related infrastructure, and grants the federal Minister broad powers to oversee its design, construction, operation, and toll collection, while exempting certain construction activities from standard federal permitting requirements. It also allows for the imposition of tolls, fees, and charges, which are treated as debts owed to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
