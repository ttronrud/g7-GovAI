The Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act mandates that federal public sector employers provide equal pay for work of equal value, particularly in female predominant job groups, by requiring equitable compensation assessments and ensuring transparency in pay practices for both unionized and non-unionized employees. It establishes a framework for employers to identify gender-based pay disparities, conduct impartial assessments, and implement corrective actions, with oversight by the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board.
