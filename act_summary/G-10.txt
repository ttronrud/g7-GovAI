The Canada Grain Act establishes the Canadian Grain Commission to set and maintain quality standards for Canadian grain, regulate grain handling, and ensure a dependable supply for domestic and international markets. It defines key terms related to grain production, storage, transportation, and grading, and outlines the Commission’s responsibilities, including grading, inspection, research, and oversight of elevators and grain dealers.
