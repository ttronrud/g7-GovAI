The Statutory Instruments Act establishes a comprehensive framework for the creation, examination, registration, publication, and access of statutory instruments (including regulations) in Canada, ensuring transparency, legal validity, and public accountability through processes involving the Clerk of the Privy Council, the Deputy Minister of Justice, and parliamentary scrutiny. It mandates that regulations be properly authorized, reviewed for compliance with rights and freedoms, registered, published in the Canada Gazette, and accessible to the public, while also providing mechanisms for revocation and incorporation of referenced documents.
