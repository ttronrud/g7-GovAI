The Copyright Act defines key terms related to intellectual property, including works such as literary, artistic, musical, and dramatic creations, and establishes the rights of authors, performers, and sound recording makers, while outlining rules on copyright protection, publication, infringement, and the use of communication signals. It also sets out definitions for collective societies, educational institutions, and various types of works, ensuring clarity on the scope and application of copyright in Canada.
