The Haida Nation Recognition Act formally recognizes the Haida Nation’s inherent rights of governance and self-determination, establishes the Council of the Haida Nation as the legal government of the Haida Nation with the capacity of a natural person, and transfers all assets and liabilities of the Haida Nation’s Secretariat to the Council, effective upon enactment. It also provides legal protections for the Council and its officials, including immunity from personal liability for actions taken in good faith.
