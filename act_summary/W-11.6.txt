The World Autism Awareness Day Act designates April 2 each year as World Autism Awareness Day in Canada, raising awareness of autism spectrum disorders and promoting early diagnosis, intervention, and the rights of individuals with autism. This observance aligns with international efforts and Canada’s commitments to the rights of persons with disabilities and children.
