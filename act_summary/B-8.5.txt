The British Columbia Treaty Commission Act establishes the British Columbia Treaty Commission to facilitate treaty negotiations between First Nations, the Government of Canada, and the Government of British Columbia, as outlined in the 1992 British Columbia Treaty Commission Agreement. The Commission has the powers of a natural person, operates independently of the principals, and is responsible for assessing readiness, allocating funds, supporting negotiations, and maintaining a public record of treaty processes.
