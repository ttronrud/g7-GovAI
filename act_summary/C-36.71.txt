This Act ensures that provinces do not lose representation in the House of Commons by requiring that if the new calculation of seats results in fewer members than during the 43rd Parliament, the number of seats is adjusted to match that historical level. It also invalidates previous reports and representation orders based on the old calculation and mandates new ones based on the updated seat allocation, with specific provisions for when and how these changes take effect.
