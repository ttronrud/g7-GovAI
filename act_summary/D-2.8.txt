The Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Act prohibits promoters from charging fees for disability tax credit requests that exceed a set maximum fee and requires them to notify the Minister of any such fees. Promoters who violate these rules face fines, with penalties based on the amount of overcharge, and the Act includes provisions for enforcement, exemptions, and regulatory flexibility.
