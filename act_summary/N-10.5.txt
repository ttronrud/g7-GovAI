This Act establishes a National Holocaust Monument in the National Capital Region to honour the victims and Canadian survivors of the Holocaust, ensuring that future generations remember the atrocities of the Holocaust and the dangers of hatred and genocide. It creates a National Holocaust Monument Development Council to oversee planning, design, public consultations, and fundraising, with the monument to be completed within three years of sufficient funding being raised.
