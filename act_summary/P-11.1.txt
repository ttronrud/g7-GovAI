The Petro-Canada Public Participation Act reorganizes Petro-Canada and Petro-Canada Limited by changing their names, transferring shares to the Minister, and imposing ownership and transaction restrictions to prevent concentration of control. It also establishes public access to services, limits transfers of assets to non-residents, and provides for the dissolution of Petro-Canada Limited, with provisions for employee superannuation rights and regulatory flexibility.
