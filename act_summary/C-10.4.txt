The Canada Transportation Act establishes the regulatory framework for transportation in Canada, affirming the supremacy of its provisions over other parliamentary regulations for specific modes of transport, while promoting competition, safety, efficiency, and accessibility. It creates the Canadian Transportation Agency to oversee transportation matters, ensures public access to information and processes, and enables the use of electronic means for administrative functions, all within a system designed to support a competitive, sustainable, and equitable national transportation network.
