The Official Development Assistance Accountability Act ensures that Canada’s foreign aid is focused on poverty reduction and aligns with Canadian values, human rights, democracy, and sustainable development, requiring that aid be provided only when it meets specific criteria and includes consultation with civil society and governments. It establishes transparency through annual reports and statistical disclosures on aid disbursements.
