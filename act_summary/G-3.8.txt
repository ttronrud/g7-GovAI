The Government Annuities Improvement Act establishes a new interest rate of seven per cent per annum for calculating annuity values from April 1, 1975, and allows for regulatory adjustments to this rate or annuity payments, while also enabling certain changes to annuity contracts and commutation of remaining payments after annuitant death. It modernizes annuity administration, repeals outdated provisions, and mandates annual reporting and auditing of annuity-related financial transactions.
