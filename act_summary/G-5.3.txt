This act appropriates the site of Ontario Government House in Toronto—bounded by Wellington, John, King, and Simcoe streets—for the use of the provincial government, confirming its transfer and ownership under the British North America Act, 1867. The lands are declared the property of the province of Ontario from the date of the 1871 order in council.
