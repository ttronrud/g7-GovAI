The First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act grants participating First Nations jurisdiction over education on their land, enabling them to enact education laws and delegate powers to the First Nations Education Authority, which supports and standardizes education delivery while ensuring student transfer rights and accountability. It establishes a framework for self-governance in education, including co-management agreements, teacher certification, and legal protections for First Nations, with the authority and rights of individual agreements prevailing over conflicting federal laws.
