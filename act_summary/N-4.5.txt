This Act establishes the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to honour First Nations, Inuit, and Métis survivors of residential schools and advance reconciliation by ensuring public commemoration of their history. The holiday comes into force on the same calendar date in the second month after royal assent, or the last day of that month if no such date exists.
