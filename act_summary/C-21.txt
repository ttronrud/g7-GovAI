The Canadian Payments Act establishes the Canadian Payments Association (CPA) to develop, operate, and promote national payment systems that enhance the efficiency, safety, and soundness of payment clearing and settlement in Canada. The CPA brings together key financial institutions—such as banks, credit societies, and insurance companies—to facilitate interoperability, innovation, and the adoption of new payment technologies.
