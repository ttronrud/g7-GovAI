The Aviation Industry Indemnity Act allows the Minister of Transport to provide indemnification to aviation industry participants or their beneficiaries for losses or damages caused by certain events—such as acts of terrorism or armed conflict—provided those losses are not covered by insurance and are not solely related to lost income. The Minister may set conditions on indemnification, including coverage limits, exclusions, and requirements for insurance, and must regularly report on the Act’s implementation and assess the feasibility of industry insurance for such events.
