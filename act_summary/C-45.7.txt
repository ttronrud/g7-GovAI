The Naskapi and the Cree-Naskapi Commission Act establishes the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach as a local government entity with the authority to administer, manage, and control its Category IA-N land, protect Naskapi rights, and promote community development, while ensuring that the Indian Act does not apply to the band or its land. It also provides for the band’s governance structure, including a council and chief, and allows for the use of the Naskapi language in official proceedings.
