The Museums Act establishes six national museums in Canada—The National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of History, the Canadian Museum of Nature, the National Museum of Science and Technology, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, and the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21—each with specific purposes, powers, and responsibilities to preserve, promote, and share Canada’s cultural, historical, scientific, and human rights heritage. Each museum is granted the capacity of a natural person to carry out its mission, including collecting, researching, exhibiting, and operating facilities, while ensuring property is managed only in accordance with acquisition terms.
