The First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act allows recognized First Nations to enact their own tax laws on taxable supplies, the bringing of tangible personal property onto their lands, and imported taxable supplies, despite existing federal exemptions under the Indian Act. These taxes are administered through agreements with the federal government, which shares revenue based on a formula that accounts for tax attributable to the First Nation, while ensuring compliance with federal excise tax rules.
