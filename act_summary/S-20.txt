The Legislation Revision and Consolidation Act establishes a Statute Revision Commission to revise and consolidate Canada’s public general statutes and regulations, ensuring clarity, consistency, and up-to-date legal texts through standardized language, omission of obsolete provisions, and proper legislative process involving parliamentary review. It enables the creation of Revised Statutes and Revised Regulations, which serve as consolidated, authoritative versions of the law, with provisions that prevail over repealed enactments and are treated as declaratory rather than new legislation.
