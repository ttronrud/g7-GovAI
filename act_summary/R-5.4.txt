The Remote Sensing Space Systems Act establishes a regulatory framework for the operation of remote sensing space systems in Canada, requiring all such activities to be conducted under a licence issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It sets out strict conditions on data control, security, international data sharing, system disposal, and oversight, while also allowing for suspensions, amendments, and government access to data for national security and international obligations.
