The Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act establishes fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles in Canada, requiring manufacturers and importers to register fuel consumption numbers, affix fuel consumption labels, and ensure vehicles meet specified standards. It also imposes penalties for non-compliance and includes provisions for exemptions, reporting, and enforcement by the Minister of Transport.
