The Precious Metals Marking Act regulates the application of marks to precious metal articles in Canada, requiring that only authorized quality marks be used and prohibiting false or misleading marks that suggest a product is made of precious metal. It establishes standards for marking, allows for inspections, and imposes penalties for unauthorized or deceptive marking, including fines and forfeiture of the article or related materials.
