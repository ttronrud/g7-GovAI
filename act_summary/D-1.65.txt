The Digital Services Tax Act imposes a 3% tax on certain digital service providers' Canadian digital services revenue if they meet specific revenue and group revenue thresholds, with the tax applied to taxable Canadian digital services revenue derived from online marketplaces, online advertising, social media, and user data. The Act defines key terms related to digital services, user location, and consolidated groups, and includes provisions for the first year of application and elections for taxpayers.
