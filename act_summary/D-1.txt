The Defence Production Act empowers the Canadian government to prioritize and manage the production, acquisition, and supply of defence supplies and projects by granting the Minister broad authority to buy, construct, loan funds, and regulate related activities, including the ability to override normal commercial practices and royalty obligations in the interest of national defence. It establishes the Defence Production Loan Account and allows for cost controls and audits to ensure efficiency and accountability in defence-related expenditures.
