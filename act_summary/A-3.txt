The Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA) enables the federal government, through the Minister designated by the Governor in Council, to enter into agreements with provinces to jointly develop rural lands, conserve water and soil, create income and employment opportunities, and conduct research for rural economic development. These agreements specify cost-sharing, revenue distribution, and operational responsibilities, require parliamentary appropriation for funding, and mandate annual reporting to Parliament.
