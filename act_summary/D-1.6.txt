The Depository Bills and Notes Act establishes the legal framework for depository bills and notes in Canada, defining their structure, requirements, and obligations, and governing their negotiation, settlement, and enforcement through clearing houses. It ensures that these instruments are treated as negotiable and enforceable, with clear liability rules for drawers, acceptors, makers, and endorsers, and provides that clearing houses must enforce payment and hold funds free from most defenses.
