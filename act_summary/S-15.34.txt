This act consists entirely of repeals, specifically the removal of provisions from previous legislation, most notably those repealed in 2008 under Bill C-22, section 52, and one repealed in 2003 under the same bill, section 278. As no new provisions are enacted, the act effectively has no substantive content—only the cancellation of prior laws.
