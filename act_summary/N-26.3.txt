This Act authorizes the Minister of Transport to sell the shares of the Northern Transportation Company Limited and to dispose of its assets, with specific provisions for the transfer of property and tax treatment, while also allowing for the forgiveness of debts and the cessation of the Corporation’s status as a Crown corporation. It ensures that the Corporation is treated as if it had owned the property and debts from the outset for tax purposes and provides for adjustments in government accounts upon disposal.
