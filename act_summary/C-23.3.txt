The Canadian Tourism Commission Act establishes a federal corporation, the Canadian Tourism Commission, to promote and market Canada as a desirable tourist destination, support collaboration between the federal government, provinces, territories, and the private sector, and sustain a vibrant tourism industry. The Commission is governed by a Board of Directors, with a President as chief executive, and is authorized to carry out its objectives through marketing, information sharing, and partnerships, while being subject to specific limitations on property acquisition and operational independence.
