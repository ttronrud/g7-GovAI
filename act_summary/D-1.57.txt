The Dental Care Measures Act requires taxpayers to report whether a recipient or their family members were eligible for dental care insurance during the taxation year, to assist the Minister of Health in administering the Canadian Dental Care Plan. A penalty of $100 per violation may be imposed for non-compliance or false reporting, with certain limits and review provisions.
