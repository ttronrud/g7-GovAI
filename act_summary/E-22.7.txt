The Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act requires entities involved in the commercial development of oil, gas, or minerals in Canada to report payments made to government bodies or other designated payees, with specific thresholds for disclosure, and mandates transparency, record-keeping, and compliance measures to combat corruption in the extractive sector. These reporting obligations apply to entities meeting certain financial or operational thresholds, and the reports must be made publicly available for a minimum of five years.
