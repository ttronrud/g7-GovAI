The Lobbying Act establishes a transparent system for the registration of paid lobbyists in Canada, requiring individuals and organizations to disclose their communications with designated public office holders on matters involving legislation, regulations, policies, or government awards. It ensures public access to information about lobbying activities while protecting the privacy and safety of individuals, and it creates an independent Commissioner of Lobbying to oversee the process and promote public awareness.
