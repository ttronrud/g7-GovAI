The Canada–United Arab Emirates Tax Convention Act, 2002 establishes a framework to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains between Canada and the United Arab Emirates, defining residency, permanent establishments, taxation of profits, dividends, and other income, while ensuring that tax rules in the Convention prevail over conflicting domestic laws. It provides clear rules for determining where income is taxable, including for businesses, individuals, and investments, and includes limitations on tax rates on dividends and adjustments for related-party transactions.
