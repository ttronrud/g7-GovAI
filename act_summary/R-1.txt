The Radiation Emitting Devices Act regulates the sale, lease, import, labelling, packaging, and advertising of radiation-emitting devices in Canada to ensure they are safe and perform as claimed, prohibiting false or misleading information and establishing strict compliance requirements, inspection powers, and enforcement mechanisms. It also provides for the seizure, forfeiture, and disposal of non-compliant devices and allows for interim measures to address urgent health and safety risks.
