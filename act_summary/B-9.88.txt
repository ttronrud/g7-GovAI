The Building a Green Prairie Economy Act establishes a federal framework to coordinate cross-sectoral efforts across the Prairie provinces to promote a sustainable, green economy by addressing transportation challenges, creating green jobs, supporting clean energy, and enhancing environmental resilience. The Minister must develop and regularly review this framework through extensive consultations and public reporting, with key progress reports to be submitted every two years and every five years thereafter.
