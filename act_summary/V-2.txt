The Visiting Forces Act establishes the legal framework for the presence and operations of foreign armed forces in Canada, defining jurisdiction, rights, and responsibilities of both Canadian and visiting forces, including protections for members and dependants, immunity, taxation exemptions, and procedures for trials and detention. It ensures that members of visiting forces and their dependants are subject to Canadian law while preserving the primary jurisdiction of service courts for offences related to official duties, and provides clear rules on military authority, arrest, punishment, and liability.
