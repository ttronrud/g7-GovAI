The Budget Implementation Act, 2000 enables bands listed in a schedule to impose direct taxes on taxable supplies of alcoholic beverages, fuel, or tobacco products made on their reserves, at the same rates as those imposed under the Excise Tax Act, with specific provisions for administration, collection, and enforcement, while ensuring those taxes are not considered Indian moneys and are subject to certain governance and procedural requirements. The Act also provides for the application of Excise Tax Act rules to these by-laws and establishes mechanisms for their validity, publication, and enforcement.
