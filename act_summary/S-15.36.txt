The Specific Claims Tribunal Act establishes an independent tribunal to fairly and timely resolve valid specific claims by First Nations relating to historical breaches of legal obligations by the Crown, such as failed land promises or improper disposals of reserve lands, with compensation limited to monetary awards and subject to strict criteria. The Tribunal ensures justice through culturally sensitive procedures, prevents claims based on aboriginal rights or treaty rights related to ongoing activities, and provides a structured process for claims that have been rejected or unresolved by negotiation.
