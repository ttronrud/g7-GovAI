The Courts Administration Service Act establishes an independent administrative body to provide efficient and coordinated services to Canada’s federal courts—such as the Federal Court of Appeal, Federal Court, Court Martial Appeal Court, and Tax Court—while safeguarding judicial independence by placing administrative functions at arm’s length from the Government of Canada. The Chief Administrator, appointed by the Governor in Council with ministerial consultation, oversees court administration and reporting, operating under the supervision of the Chief Justices, who retain full control over judicial matters.
