The Air Canada Public Participation Act establishes the corporate framework for Air Canada, designating it as a corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act, and mandates that it carry out aircraft maintenance in Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba with its head office in the Montreal Urban Community. It also grants the Minister authority to acquire shares, ensures official language rights for customers of subsidiaries, and provides for the deemed approval of certain transactions and affiliations, while repealing the Air Canada Act upon the Corporation’s incorporation.
