The Canada–Azerbaijan Tax Convention Act, 2004 establishes a tax treaty between Canada and Azerbaijan to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains, defining residency, permanent establishments, tax treatments for dividends, profits, and income from property, and providing mechanisms for resolving disputes and ensuring consistency between the treaty and domestic tax laws. It grants the Minister of National Revenue authority to issue regulations and requires publication of the treaty’s entry into and termination dates.
