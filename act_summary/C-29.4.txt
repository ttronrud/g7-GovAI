This Act establishes the Department of Citizenship and Immigration in Canada, creating a new federal department headed by a Minister appointed by the Governor in Council, who oversees all matters related to citizenship and immigration not assigned to other agencies. It also enables the Minister to enter into agreements with provinces, foreign governments, and international organizations for policy coordination, information sharing, and service delivery, while ensuring continuity of public service positions and financial appropriations.
