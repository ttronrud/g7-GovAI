The Insurance Companies Act establishes the regulatory framework for insurance companies in Canada, defining key terms and outlining the responsibilities of insurers, shareholders, directors, and regulators. It governs the structure, operations, financial reporting, and oversight of insurance companies, including mutual and holding companies, and includes provisions related to consumer protection, financial transparency, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
