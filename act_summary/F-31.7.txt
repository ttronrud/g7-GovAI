This Act validates customs duties collected between 1972 and January 10, 1985 on imported fresh fruits and vegetables, and remits duties that were imposed but not collected between June 28, 1984, and January 10, 1985, under specific tariff provisions. It ensures the validity of those orders and corrects inconsistencies in duty collection during that period.
