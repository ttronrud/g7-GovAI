This Act authorizes the Province of Quebec to construct and maintain a bridge and a tunnel across the St. Lawrence River to connect Montreal and Jacques Cartier to Charron Island, with strict requirements for navigation safety, prior approval of plans, and compliance with regulations set by the Governor in Council. The project must be designed and implemented in a way that safeguards river navigation and requires government oversight throughout construction.
