The Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada Act establishes a federal agency to provide administrative support services to various administrative tribunals, with the Chief Administrator serving as its head and having broad powers to manage operations, enter into agreements, and oversee the provision of services. The Service assumes responsibilities previously held by tribunal offices and registries, and existing personnel, funding, and contracts are transferred to the Service without disruption.
