The Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act establishes a regulatory framework for pooled registered pension plans that allow employees and self-employed individuals to pool their retirement savings, reducing administrative and investment costs. It sets out the responsibilities of administrators, employers, and the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, including requirements for plan registration, investment management, member protections, and oversight to ensure safe and sound financial practices.
