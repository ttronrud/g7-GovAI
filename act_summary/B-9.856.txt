The Budget Implementation Act, 2007, authorizes direct payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to provinces, territories, and Canadian organizations to support initiatives in areas such as corporate tax transition, environmental sustainability, healthcare, education, child care, and international development assistance, with specific allocations and conditions for use. It also establishes trusts to fund projects related to greenhouse gas reductions, immunization, patient wait times, and post-secondary education, with payments determined by trust agreements and population-based formulas.
