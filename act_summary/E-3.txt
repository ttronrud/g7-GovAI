The Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act establishes a process for adjusting electoral district boundaries in Canada following each decennial census to ensure fair representation, with commissions appointed to assess population data and recommend district divisions based on population equity, community identity, and geographic feasibility. These recommendations are reviewed by the House of Commons, and if no objections are raised, a formal representation order is issued by proclamation, setting the official electoral boundaries for each province.
