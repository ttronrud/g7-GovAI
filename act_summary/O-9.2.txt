The Olympic and Paralympic Marks Act protects the integrity of Olympic and Paralympic marks by prohibiting their unauthorized use as trademarks or in business contexts, with limited exceptions for organizing committees, the COC and CPC, and specific permitted uses such as news reporting, artistic works, or individual participation. It also establishes legal remedies for infringement, including injunctions and damages, and allows for the regulation of mark usage and expiry dates.
