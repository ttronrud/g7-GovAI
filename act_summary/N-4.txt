The National Capital Act establishes the National Capital Commission (NCC) as a body responsible for planning, developing, conserving, and improving the National Capital Region to ensure the Government of Canada’s seat reflects its national significance. It outlines the Commission’s powers, including land use approval, property management, infrastructure development, and grant-making, while setting rules for membership, governance, and financial operations.
