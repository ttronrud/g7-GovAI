The Employment Equity Act aims to achieve workplace equality by addressing historical disadvantages faced by women, Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minorities through special measures, reasonable accommodations, and affirmative actions, rather than just equal treatment. It requires private sector employers and certain public sector entities to conduct workforce analyses, eliminate employment barriers, develop and implement employment equity plans with measurable goals, and report regularly on progress.
