The Charities Registration (Security Information) Act allows the Canadian government to deny charitable registration to organizations that may be providing support to terrorist entities, based on security intelligence, while ensuring a fair and transparent process that protects national security and allows for limited review under strict conditions. The Act establishes a judicial review mechanism to assess whether a certificate of suspected terrorist ties is reasonable, with final decisions being binding and non-appealable.
