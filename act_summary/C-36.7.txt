This act requires that any proposed constitutional amendment—except those involving provincial vetoes or dissent under specific sections of the Constitution Act, 1982—must first receive consent from a majority of provinces, including Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and at least two of the Atlantic or Prairie provinces whose combined populations represent at least 50% of their respective regions. This ensures broader provincial representation and population-based balance in constitutional changes.
