The National Fiddling Day Act designates the third Saturday in May each year as National Fiddling Day to celebrate the cultural and historical significance of fiddle music in Canada. This day is intended to raise awareness and appreciation of fiddle playing, particularly among Canadians and newcomers, but is not a legal holiday.
