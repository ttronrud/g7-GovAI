The Customs and Excise Offshore Application Act establishes that certain goods used on Canada’s continental shelf—such as drilling rigs, platforms, and related equipment—are subject to federal customs laws as if they were imported into Canada, with key exemptions and transitional provisions for goods leased or used before 1983, particularly when held by Canadian-owned entities or under specific lease agreements. It also provides that certain ships engaged in Canada’s coasting trade prior to January 6, 1983, are deemed duty and tax paid under federal customs laws for the duration of their lease or operation.
