The Borrowing Authority Act grants the Minister of Finance authority to borrow money on behalf of Canada, subject to a strict cap of $2,126 billion on total borrowing by the government, agent corporations, and Canada Mortgage Bonds, with specific exclusions and reporting requirements. The Minister must regularly report on borrowing levels and assess whether the borrowing limit should be adjusted.
