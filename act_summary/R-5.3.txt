This Act retroactively validates certain Air Regulations and administrative actions by treating them as having been issued or taken under the authority of the Minister of Transport with Governor in Council approval, effective from the date they were originally purported to have been made. It also allows ongoing legal proceedings that were commenced before May 27, 1970, to proceed as if the Act had not come into force, without invalidating the regulations or actions involved outside the scope of those proceedings.
