The International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act allows Canada to provide financial assistance to designated international financial institutions to promote the social and economic development of developing countries, through direct payments, issuing demand notes, purchasing shares, or providing guarantees, all subject to ministerial approval and parliamentary oversight. Any changes to the list of eligible institutions require parliamentary review and approval through specific procedures involving both the House of Commons and the Senate.
