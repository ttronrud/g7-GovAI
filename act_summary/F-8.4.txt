The Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act establishes the rules for the granting, leasing, and management of federal real property and immovables in Canada, including the forms and procedures for transfers, the authority of Ministers and the Minister of Justice, and the conditions under which such property can be disposed of or licensed. It also provides for the administration of such property by designated departments or individuals, and ensures that all transactions comply with legal standards, including the ability to grant property in fee simple or by plan, with specific rules on delivery, effect, and restrictions on covenants.
