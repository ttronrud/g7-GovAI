The Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2013 enacts several Canada–foreign tax conventions, including those with Namibia, Serbia, Poland, Hong Kong, and Switzerland, and approves related protocols and agreements, establishing their legal force in Canada and setting conditions for their implementation. It also confirms an agreement between Canada and Switzerland on the interpretation of Article 25 of their double taxation convention, ensuring effective information exchange while respecting procedural safeguards.
