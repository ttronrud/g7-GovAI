The Cultural Property Export and Import Act establishes a framework to control the export of Canadian cultural property by creating a Control List of objects of archaeological, historical, artistic, or scientific significance, and by requiring permits for exports. It outlines a process involving permit officers, expert examiners, and a Review Board to assess whether objects should be exported, with special protections for items deemed to have outstanding national significance or high heritage value.
