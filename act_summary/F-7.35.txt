The Federal Framework on Lyme Disease Act establishes a national effort to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of Lyme disease in Canada by requiring the development of updated guidelines, a national surveillance program, and standardized public education materials. It mandates a comprehensive federal framework to be developed within 12 months of the Act coming into force, with ongoing review and transparency through parliamentary reporting.
