The Pay Equity Act aims to achieve gender-based pay equity by requiring employers to establish pay equity plans and make reasonable efforts to create pay equity committees, ensuring that employees in predominantly female job classes receive equal compensation for work of equal value, while considering the needs of employers. The Act applies to certain federal employers and groups of employers with 10 or more employees, with specific timelines and requirements for notice, committee formation, and compliance.
