The Canada Development Corporation Reorganization Act reorganizes the Canada Development Corporation (CDC) by enabling its continuation under the Canada Business Corporations Act, establishing share structures with voting restrictions to prevent any single resident or non-resident from holding excessive control, and allowing the Minister to appoint up to five directors in lieu of Her Majesty’s voting rights. It also repeals the original Canada Development Corporation Act upon the issuance of the certificate of continuance and sets specific limits on share ownership and director appointments.
