The Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act establishes a Canada-wide, inclusive, and high-quality early learning and child care system, committed to affordability, accessibility, and cultural relevance—particularly for Indigenous families—and mandates long-term federal funding through agreements with provinces and Indigenous governing bodies. It creates the National Advisory Council on Early Learning and Child Care to provide ongoing advice, ensure broad stakeholder engagement, and monitor progress toward equitable access and development for all children.
