The Special Areas Act establishes a framework for Canada to designate areas with inadequate employment opportunities as "special areas" and provide targeted economic and social assistance through plans, grants, loans, and agreements with provinces to promote economic expansion and social adjustment. These measures are implemented by the Minister with provincial cooperation and require Governor in Council approval, with regulations governing eligibility, assistance levels, and implementation.
