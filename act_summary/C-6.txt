The Canada Health Act establishes national standards for publicly funded health care in Canada, ensuring that insured health services are provided on the principles of universality, comprehensiveness, portability, accessibility, and public administration, without user charges or extra-billing, to guarantee equitable and accessible health care for all residents. Provinces must meet these criteria to receive full federal funding through the Canada Health Transfer, and failure to comply can result in reduced or withheld funding.
