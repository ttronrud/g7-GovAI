The Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act establishes a fair and efficient administrative penalty system to enforce compliance with agri-food legislation, offering an alternative to criminal prosecution. It allows the Minister to designate violations, set penalties (ranging up to $25,000 for very serious violations), and provide options such as compliance agreements, payment in full, or review by a Tribunal, while ensuring penalties are enforceable and final.
