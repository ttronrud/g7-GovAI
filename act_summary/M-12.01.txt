The Motor Vehicle Transport Act establishes a unified national regulatory framework for extra-provincial bus and truck transport, ensuring safety and consistent operating standards across Canada by requiring safety fitness certificates issued by provincial authorities and aligning provincial regulations with national objectives, including the National Safety Code. It grants the Minister authority to issue transportation policy statements, enter into agreements with provinces or foreign states, and regulate safety, licensing, and operations, while also providing for oversight, review, and enforcement mechanisms.
