The Emergency Management Act establishes the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness as the lead official responsible for coordinating federal emergency management activities, including policy development, plan oversight, intergovernmental cooperation, and response to emergencies across Canada. It outlines the responsibilities of federal ministers, provincial authorities, and the federal government in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from emergencies, while also enabling coordination with the United States and promoting public awareness and preparedness.
