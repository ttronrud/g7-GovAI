The Cannabis Act legalizes the possession, distribution, and sale of cannabis for adult use in Canada while setting strict limits on access for young people, prohibiting illicit activities, and establishing penalties for violations. Its primary goals are to protect public health and safety, particularly youth, by restricting access, ensuring quality control, and reducing illicit activity through regulated enforcement.
