This Act, known as the Nelson House First Nation Flooded Land Act, clarifies the legal status of payments and land transfers made under the 1977 Flood Agreement and ensures that amounts paid to the Nelson House First Nation are not considered "Indian moneys" under the Indian Act, while also establishing rules for the transfer of funds and the application of Manitoba arbitration laws in disputes. It confirms that certain claims and land rights are governed by the agreement and not by the Indian Act.
