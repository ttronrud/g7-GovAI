The Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act implements the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement by establishing mechanisms for trade, investment, labour, and environmental cooperation, and by designating the Minister of International Trade as the principal representative of Canada on the Joint Commission. It aims to promote fair competition, expand economic relations, and ensure the harmonious development of trade between Canada and the Republic of Korea.
