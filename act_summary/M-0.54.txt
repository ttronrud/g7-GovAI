The Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act establishes a land endowment of up to 150,000 acres for the University of Manitoba to support its education mission, and confirms the continued application of English laws in Manitoba, as they existed in 1870, unless amended or repealed. The Act also defines key terms such as "Commissioners," "Minister," and "Province," and includes provisions that were later repealed in 1992.
