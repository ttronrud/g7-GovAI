The National Security and Intelligence Review Agency Act establishes an independent review body to oversee activities related to national security and intelligence, including those of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the Communications Security Establishment, with powers to investigate complaints, review departmental actions, and ensure compliance with laws and ministerial directions. The Agency is composed of a Chair and up to six members appointed by the Governor in Council on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, with broad access to information and the authority to make findings and recommendations, while respecting legal privileges and existing oversight mechanisms.
