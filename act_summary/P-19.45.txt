The Prevention of Terrorist Travel Act allows individuals whose passports are cancelled on grounds of terrorism or national security to appeal the decision to a judge within 30 days (or a further period set by the judge), who must determine whether the cancellation is reasonable and may quash it if found unreasonable. The judge must ensure fair hearings, may consider non-court admissible evidence, and must maintain confidentiality, with similar rules applying to appeals involving passport refusals or revocations based on terrorism or national security concerns.
