The Thunder Bay Grain Handling Operations Act reinstates grain handling operations and employee duties in Thunder Bay, Ontario, following a strike, by extending the expired collective agreement and prohibiting strikes or lockouts during the extended term, while establishing a mediator-arbitrator to resolve disputes and finalize amendments to the agreement. It ensures that employees and employers resume work without penalty for prior strike activity and provides a clear framework for resolving future disagreements through mediation or arbitration.
