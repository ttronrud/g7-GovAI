The Canadian Forces Superannuation Act establishes the framework for pension contributions and benefits for members of the Canadian Forces, continuing the former Permanent Services Pension Account as the Canadian Forces Superannuation Account, and defines eligibility, contribution rates, pensionable service, and rights for contributors and survivors. It ensures equality for male and female contributors and allows for the adaptation of provisions to reserve force members through regulations.
