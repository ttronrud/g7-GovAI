The Canadian Dairy Commission Act establishes the Canadian Dairy Commission as a corporate body responsible for regulating the production, marketing, and pricing of dairy products to ensure fair returns for producers and a stable supply for consumers. It grants the Commission broad powers to manage milk and cream markets, including setting prices, operating pools, making payments to producers, conducting investigations, and enforcing compliance, all while operating under the oversight of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and subject to parliamentary appropriations.
