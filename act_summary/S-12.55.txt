The Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 imposes a charge on exports of softwood lumber products to the United States, with the rate depending on the product’s export price, region of origin, and whether certain thresholds are exceeded. The charge is calculated based on a tiered rate system tied to the reference price of framing lumber and includes additional surcharges when export volumes exceed monthly trigger levels, particularly for regions outside the BC Coast.
