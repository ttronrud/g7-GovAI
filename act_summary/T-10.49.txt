The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act of 1930 transfers ownership and administrative control of Crown lands, mines, minerals, and water rights within Saskatchewan from the federal government to the provincial government, placing Saskatchewan on equal footing with the original provinces of Confederation. It includes specific provisions for fishery rights, Indian reserves, national parks, school lands, and financial compensation based on population, while preserving certain federal rights and obligations.
