The Public Sector Pension Investment Board Act establishes an independent body corporate, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to manage and invest pension funds for federal public service, Canadian Forces, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police employees, with a focus on maximizing returns while minimizing risk and ensuring compliance with pension plan obligations. The Board operates independently of federal public administration, has broad powers akin to a natural person, and is governed by a 13-member board with specific eligibility and appointment rules, including oversight by a nominating committee and consultation with relevant ministers.
