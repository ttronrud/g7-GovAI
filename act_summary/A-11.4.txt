The Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario) establishes that the law of England regarding marriage annulment, as it stood on July 15, 1870, applies in Ontario—except where repealed or modified by Canadian or UK legislation or this Act—and grants the Supreme Court of Ontario jurisdiction over annulment matters.
