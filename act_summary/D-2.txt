The Diplomatic Service (Special) Superannuation Act establishes superannuation benefits for Canadian diplomatic officials and persons of comparable status, including pensions based on years of service and salary, deferred pensions, and death benefits for survivors, with special provisions for common-law partners and survivors sharing benefits in proportion to cohabitation periods. It also allows for the return of contributions and includes interest calculations, with rules on eligibility, deductions, and pension apportionment.
