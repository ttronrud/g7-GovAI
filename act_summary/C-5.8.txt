The Canada–Gabon Tax Convention Act, 2004 establishes a bilateral tax agreement to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion by defining rules for the taxation of income and capital gains, including provisions on residents, permanent establishments, dividends, interest, and profits from business activities. It grants precedence to the Convention and its provisions over conflicting domestic laws, while allowing for mutual notification of tax changes and ensuring tax treatment of income derived from immovable property, ships, aircraft, and business operations in one country by residents of the other.
