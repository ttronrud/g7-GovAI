The Criminal Records Act establishes the Parole Board of Canada's exclusive authority to grant, revoke, or refuse record suspensions for individuals convicted of offences, allowing them to have their criminal records kept separate and removing most disqualifications, subject to eligibility criteria and specific exceptions. It sets out detailed conditions for eligibility, including time limits, types of offences, conduct requirements, and safeguards for privacy and public safety, particularly in relation to vulnerable persons and employment applications.
