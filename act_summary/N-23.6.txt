The Non-smokers’ Health Act prohibits smoking in work spaces and requires employers to designate smoking areas or rooms only under strict conditions, including ventilation standards and employee consultation, with penalties for violations. It applies to workplaces in Canada and certain international travel contexts, and allows for regulations on smoking designations, ventilation, and enforcement.
