The Dry Docks Subsidies Act authorizes the Canadian government to provide subsidies to approved companies for constructing dry docks—both fixed and floating—on the condition that the docks serve a public interest and meet specified size and capacity requirements, with subsidies calculated based on cost and tiered by dock class. Subsidies are paid over a set period, with conditions on construction, maintenance, and operational oversight, including requirements for public use, repair obligations, and approval of tolls by the Governor in Council.
