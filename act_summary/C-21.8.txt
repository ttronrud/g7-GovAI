The Canadian Race Relations Foundation Act establishes a nonprofit corporation dedicated to eliminating racism and racial discrimination in Canada by promoting research, education, public awareness, and collaboration across sectors. The Foundation is funded with $24 million, including $12 million in commemoration of Japanese Canadians who suffered injustices during and after World War II, and operates under a governance structure with a Board of Directors and an Executive Director, all tasked with advancing race relations through knowledge sharing and policy development.
