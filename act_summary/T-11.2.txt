The Tla’amin Final Agreement Act enacts and ratifies the Tla’amin Final Agreement between the Tla’amin Nation, the Government of Canada, and the Government of British Columbia, recognizing it as a treaty and land claims agreement under the Constitution Act, 1982, and establishing a new relationship based on mutual rights, responsibilities, and land ownership, while ensuring the Agreement prevails over conflicting federal laws. It also provides for the legal validity, implementation, and judicial recognition of the Agreement and related instruments, including provisions on land title, tax treatment, and procedural safeguards for disputes.
