The National Housing Strategy Act establishes a comprehensive national framework to realize the right to adequate housing as a fundamental human right, setting out a long-term vision, national goals, and a participatory approach involving governments, civil society, and people with lived experience. It creates the National Housing Council and a Federal Housing Advocate to oversee implementation, monitor progress, conduct research, and ensure accountability through regular reporting and public engagement.
