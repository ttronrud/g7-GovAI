The Preclearance Act, 2016 establishes the legal framework for reciprocal preclearance operations between Canada and the United States, allowing border officers from each country to conduct inspections of travellers and goods in the other country’s territory. It ensures that all preclearance activities are carried out in compliance with Canadian law, including fundamental rights protections, while enabling the efficient and secure movement of people and goods.
