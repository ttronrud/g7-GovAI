The Railway Belt Act defines a specific tract of land in British Columbia designated for the Canadian Pacific Railway and establishes rules for the entry of settlers, the rights of squatters who made improvements, and the administration of the land by the Dominion Lands Board. It also provides that land grants issued to a deceased person remain valid and pass to their legal representatives.
