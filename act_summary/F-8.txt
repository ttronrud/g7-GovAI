The Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act establishes a framework for fiscal equalization payments from the federal government to provinces, based on revenue disparities, ensuring that provinces with lower per capita tax revenues receive financial support. It also defines key terms related to tax collection, administration agreements, and specific agreements for cannabis, vaping products, and sales tax harmonization, while outlining detailed formulas and conditions for determining and adjusting these payments.
