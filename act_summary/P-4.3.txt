The Payment Card Networks Act regulates national payment card networks and the commercial practices of payment card network operators to ensure fair and transparent operations, with the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada responsible for supervision and enforcement. It establishes requirements for transparency in fees, conditions in agreements with issuers and acquirers, and allows for compliance agreements and regulatory flexibility through the Governor in Council.
