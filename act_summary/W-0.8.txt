The Wage Earner Protection Program Act establishes a framework to ensure that employees receive payments for eligible wages when their employer becomes insolvent, including through bankruptcy, receivership, or foreign proceedings. Payments are limited to eligible wages, capped at seven times the maximum weekly insurable earnings, and individuals must meet specific eligibility criteria, such as the termination of employment due to insolvency, while being excluded from payments if they held managerial or controlling positions or did not deal at arm’s length with the employer.
