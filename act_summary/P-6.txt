The Pension Act establishes the framework for providing pensions, compensation, and allowances to members of the Canadian Forces and their dependants who have suffered disability or died as a result of military service, with provisions ensuring liberal interpretation to fulfill the Government's obligation to support veterans and their families. It outlines eligibility criteria, defines key terms, and grants the Minister broad authority to assess and administer awards, while ensuring equality and fairness in decision-making.
