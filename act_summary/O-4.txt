The Official Residences Act designates specific lands and buildings in Ottawa and surrounding areas as official residences for the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Speaker of the House of Commons, and establishes the responsibilities of the government for their maintenance, staffing, and funding. It also provides that benefits received by these officials are treated as living expense allowances and outlines the procedures for allocating summer residences and managing associated costs.
