The Communications Security Establishment Act establishes Canada’s national signals intelligence agency, granting it a mandate in foreign intelligence, cybersecurity, defensive and active cyber operations, and technical assistance to federal agencies, while ensuring all activities comply with the rule of law, respect privacy rights, and are subject to oversight and authorizations. The Act provides the Establishment with broad powers to conduct intelligence and cyber activities, including access to global information infrastructure, but limits such activities to specific, authorized purposes and ensures they do not target Canadians or infringe on their rights without proper oversight and legal justification.
