The Kanesatake Interim Land Base Governance Act establishes a framework for the Mohawks of Kanesatake to exercise jurisdiction over their interim land base, designating certain lands as reserved for Indians under the Constitution Act, 1867 but not as reserves under the Indian Act. It grants the Mohawks the authority to create laws on land use, environmental protection, and local governance, while ensuring harmonious relations with the Municipality of Oka through land use agreements and dispute resolution mechanisms.
