This 1943 agreement between the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia confirms that the Province of British Columbia will administer and develop mineral resources (both precious and base) on Indian Reserves within its territory, with revenues split equally—half retained by the Province and half remitted to Canada—while preserving the constitutional rights of both governments and the existing status of Indian Reserves. The agreement also establishes strict controls on prospecting and mineral claims, ensuring approval from Indian Agents and the Gold Commissioner, and maintains the Crown’s ownership of mineral rights under the Indian Act.
