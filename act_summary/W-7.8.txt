The Western Grain Transition Payments Act provides for transition payments to farmers who owned farmland in designated western Canadian regions (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and parts of British Columbia) on February 28, 1995, based on the land’s productivity and distance from port, with payments capped at $1.6 billion and distributed proportionally among the provinces. The payments are designed to support farmers transitioning from grain farming, with specific tax treatment and regulatory provisions to ensure compliance and equitable distribution.
