The International Transfer of Offenders Act enables the transfer of Canadian and foreign offenders between Canada and other countries under specific conditions, with the primary goal of enhancing public safety, ensuring justice, and supporting offender rehabilitation. Transfers are subject to strict requirements, including consent from the offender, the foreign entity, and Canada, and the Minister must assess factors related to public safety, the offender’s background, and the nature of the sentence before approving a transfer.
