The Celebrating Canada’s Seniors Act designates October 1 each year as National Seniors Day to recognize and honor the contributions of seniors to Canadian society and the economy. This day is not a holiday or a non-juridical day, but serves as a formal acknowledgment of seniors' ongoing value and experience.
