The Access to Information Act grants Canadian citizens and permanent residents a right to access government records, promotes transparency and accountability in federal institutions, and ensures that information is made available to the public while allowing limited exceptions for national security, privacy, and sensitive matters. It also requires proactive publication of information and establishes a review process through the Information Commissioner to ensure fair and independent decisions on disclosure.
