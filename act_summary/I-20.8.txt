The Internment of Persons of Ukrainian Origin Recognition Act acknowledges the wrongful internment of Ukrainian Canadians during World War I and calls for public education and commemorative measures to promote multiculturalism, inclusion, and respect for human rights. It establishes a framework for the Government of Canada to negotiate with Ukrainian Canadian organizations to implement initiatives such as commemorative plaques, exhibitions, and educational materials, without admitting any legal liability.
