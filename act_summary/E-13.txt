The Escheats Act establishes that when property becomes ownerless due to death without heirs or the dissolution of a corporation or association, the Attorney General of Canada may take possession or file suit to recover it. The Governor in Council can grant such property to individuals with legal or moral claims, to carry out intended dispositions, or to reward discoveries, with no action allowed against the Crown more than five years after the relevant event.
