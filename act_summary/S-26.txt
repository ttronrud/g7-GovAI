The Supreme Court Act establishes the Supreme Court of Canada as the highest court of appeal in the country, outlining its structure, jurisdiction, appointment of judges, procedures for appeals, and rules for conducting sessions and delivering judgments. It grants the Court appellate authority over final judgments from provincial and federal courts, with special provisions for cases involving public importance or significant legal issues, and includes mechanisms for quorum, ad hoc judges, and leave to appeal.
