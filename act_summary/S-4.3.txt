The Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act establishes a dedicated fund to manage Canada’s treaty land entitlement obligations for specific Indigenous bands in Saskatchewan, confirms key agreements like the Framework Agreement and the Nekaneet Settlement Agreement, and outlines the financial and land-related responsibilities between the federal government, the province, and the bands, including the transfer of mineral revenues and the release of Saskatchewan’s obligations once payments and land entitlements are fulfilled.
