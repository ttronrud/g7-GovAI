The Canada–Ireland Tax Convention Act, 2004 establishes and implements a tax treaty between Canada and Ireland to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains, defining rules for residency, permanent establishments, taxation of profits, dividends, and other income, while ensuring that the treaty prevails over conflicting domestic laws. It provides a framework for determining which country has the right to tax income earned by residents of either country, with specific provisions on tax treatment for international business activities, dividends, and the avoidance of double taxation.
