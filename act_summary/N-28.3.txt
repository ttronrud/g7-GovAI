The Nuclear Safety and Control Act establishes the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) to regulate the development, production, and use of nuclear energy and nuclear substances in a way that minimizes risks to health, safety, the environment, and national security, while ensuring compliance with international obligations such as non-proliferation. The CNSC has broad powers to inspect, license, enforce regulations, and issue decisions, all aimed at maintaining safe and secure nuclear practices in Canada.
