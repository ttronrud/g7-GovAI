The Cooperative Energy Act establishes two corporations—the Cooperative Energy Corporation and the Cooperative Energy Development Corporation—to support cooperative energy initiatives in Canada, with specific provisions on share issuance, ownership restrictions, and governance, while ensuring they are not considered Crown corporations. The Act is grounded in the Canada/Cooperative Energy Investment Agreement of 1981 and includes mechanisms for Canadian ownership requirements, share constraints, and trust fund management to promote energy development through cooperatives.
