The Federal Accountability Act restructures and consolidates Canada’s conflict of interest and ethics framework by merging the roles of the Ethics Commissioner and the Conflict of Interest Commissioner into a single Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, with transitional provisions ensuring continuity of duties, responsibilities, and legal rights. It also updates related legislation, including the Lobbying Act and the Access to Information and Privacy Acts, with specific implementation dates and exemptions for certain institutions like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
