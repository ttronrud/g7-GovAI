The Spending Control Act establishes spending limits for specific fiscal years and restricts the Government of Canada’s program spending to those limits, allowing for adjustments under certain conditions such as emergencies, certified program increases, or excess spending allocations to future years. It also mandates reporting on compliance and includes provisions for auditing and resolving discrepancies between proposed spending and the established spending limits.
