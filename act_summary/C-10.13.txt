The Canada School of Public Service Act establishes the Canada School of Public Service as a federal agency to enhance public sector management through training, research, and development, with the authority to operate independently, enter into contracts, and manage its own programs and property. The School is led by a President appointed by the Governor in Council, who serves as its chief executive, and it continues the operations and assets of the former Canadian Centre for Management Development.
