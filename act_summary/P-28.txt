The Public Documents Act establishes that public documents issued under Canada's Great or Privy Seal, including letters patent, do not need to be on parchment and are valid if written or printed on paper, with no requirement for parchment since 1869. It also allows for the cancellation and correction of defective documents issued to the wrong person or containing errors, with corrected versions relating back to the original date.
