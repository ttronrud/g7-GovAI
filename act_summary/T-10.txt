The Textile Labelling Act requires dealers to accurately label consumer textile articles with clear information about their fibre content, prohibits false or misleading representations in advertising or labels, and establishes enforcement mechanisms including inspections, seizures, and penalties for non-compliance. It also allows for exemptions and regulatory flexibility, with provisions for fair treatment of early adopters of labelling requirements.
