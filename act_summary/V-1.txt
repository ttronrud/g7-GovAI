The Department of Veterans Affairs Act establishes a federal department to oversee the care, treatment, and benefits for veterans, their dependants, and survivors of those who served in the Canadian Forces, merchant navy, or other war-related services, including provisions for financial assistance, medical care, funeral support, and gravemarker services. It outlines the powers, duties, and regulatory framework for the Minister and Deputy Minister, including the administration of benefits, handling of overpayments, and access to personal information for eligibility verification.
