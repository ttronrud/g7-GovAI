The Freshwater Fish Marketing Act establishes the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation to oversee the marketing, trading, and distribution of freshwater fish in Canada, with exclusive rights to conduct interprovincial and export trade. It grants the Corporation authority to buy fish from fishermen, process and market them, make loans to fishers, and enter into agreements with provinces to share costs and manage fish trade, all while ensuring fair pricing and orderly markets.
