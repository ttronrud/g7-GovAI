The Marine War Risks Act establishes a government-backed insurance account to cover war-related losses for Canadian vessels and cargo, allowing the Minister of Transport to enter into insurance or reinsurance agreements to ensure maritime commerce is not disrupted by lack of insurance. It provides for regulations on coverage, cargo definitions, and vessel eligibility, and mandates audits and parliamentary reporting on the account’s operations and financial transactions.
