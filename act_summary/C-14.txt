The Canadian Commercial Corporation Act establishes a federal corporation tasked with promoting trade between Canada and other nations by importing and exporting goods, acting on behalf of the Minister in specified capacities, and managing its operations with financial and administrative autonomy. The Corporation is governed by a Board consisting of a Chairperson, President, and up to nine directors, with powers to borrow, charge fees, and operate independently while remaining accountable to the Minister and subject to oversight by the Auditor General.
