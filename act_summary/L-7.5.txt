The Legislative Instruments Re-enactment Act requires the re-enactment in both official languages of certain legislative instruments that were originally enacted in only one language and published in only one language, ensuring they are equally authoritative and retroactive to their original effective dates. It also allows for re-enactment even if the original enabling power or body no longer exists, and mandates a review and reporting process to assess implementation and outcomes.
