The Veterans Well-being Act establishes a framework to recognize and support members and veterans of the Canadian Forces by providing compensation, education and training benefits, career transition services, and rehabilitation support, with a focus on those injured or affected by service, their families, and survivors. It defines key terms related to service, disability, and eligibility, and outlines specific benefits such as education funding, income support, and vocational assistance, while ensuring the rights of veterans and their dependents are protected.
