The Oceans Act establishes Canada’s legal framework for ocean governance, defining its sovereign rights and jurisdiction in key maritime zones—including the territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, and continental shelf—while affirming Canada’s commitment to sustainable management, conservation, and the equitable use of marine resources. It also outlines the application of provincial and federal laws in these areas and provides for the regulation of maritime boundaries, installations, and fishing zones through a collaborative, ecosystem-based approach.
