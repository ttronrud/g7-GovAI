The Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act establishes civil liability and compensation for damage resulting from nuclear incidents in Canada and among Contracting States, holding operators absolutely liable for such damage, with liability limits increasing over time and subject to review. It defines key terms related to nuclear installations, materials, and incidents, and outlines compensable damages, including bodily injury, property damage, psychological trauma, and economic losses, while excluding certain types of damage such as those from transportation of nuclear material or failure to provide electricity.
