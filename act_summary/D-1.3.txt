The Defence Services Pension Continuation Act establishes pension entitlements for officers and militiamen in the Canadian permanent force, based on length of service, rank, and circumstances of retirement or disability, with provisions for including service in other military or public roles and adjusting pensions for non-continuous service or secondment. It also outlines gratuities for early retirement, disability, or death, and includes specific rules for calculating pensions and deductions from pay.
