The Competition Tribunal Act establishes the Competition Tribunal, a court-like body composed of up to six judicial members and eight lay members, to hear and decide disputes under the Competition Act, including applications related to anti-competitive practices and mergers. The Tribunal has broad powers similar to a superior court, including the ability to hear evidence, award costs, and make decisions with appeals to the Federal Court of Appeal.
