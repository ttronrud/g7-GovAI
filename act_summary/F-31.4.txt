The Fort Nelson Indian Reserve Minerals Revenue Sharing Act establishes a revenue-sharing arrangement between Canada and the Province of British Columbia, granting the Province ownership and control of minerals (including coal, petroleum, and natural gas) underlying the Fort Nelson Indian Band’s reserve, while requiring equal sharing of net profits and gross revenues from their disposition. The Act also provides for a one-time payment of $4,329,377 to Canada for the Band’s use and benefit, and ensures that all revenue from mineral development is shared equally between the parties.
