The National Framework for Diabetes Act mandates the development of a national strategy to improve diabetes prevention and treatment in Canada, involving federal-provincial collaboration, education, research, and equity-focused initiatives. It requires the Minister of Health to produce and publish a comprehensive framework within one year, followed by periodic evaluations to assess its effectiveness and impact.
