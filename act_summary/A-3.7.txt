The Agricultural Marketing Programs Act establishes a framework to improve cash flow for Canadian agricultural producers by guaranteeing the repayment of advances made to them, particularly for specific agricultural products like livestock, plants, and honey or maple syrup produced in Canada. It defines key roles, such as administrators and lenders, sets conditions for advance eligibility and repayment, and includes provisions for emergency advances in cases of natural disasters or economic hardship.
