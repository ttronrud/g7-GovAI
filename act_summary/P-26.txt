The Provincial Subsidies Act establishes annual financial subsidies and allowances for several Canadian provinces to compensate for lost export duties, population-based per capita payments, historical debt adjustments, and other financial settlements, with specific provisions for Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and others, including interest-bearing capital claims and conditions for provincial advances. It also provides for the full settlement of historical claims related to boundary disputes and provincial governance costs.
