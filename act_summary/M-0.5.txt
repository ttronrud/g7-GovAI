The Manganese-based Fuel Additives Act regulates the interprovincial trade and importation of manganese-based fuel additives by requiring authorization from the Minister, ensuring these substances are not mixed with unleaded gasoline, and establishing record-keeping and enforcement provisions to prevent environmental and public health risks. It also provides for penalties, reporting requirements, and court-ordered remedies to address violations.
