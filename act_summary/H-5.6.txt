This Act declares that Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited's operations in the Flin Flon area straddle Manitoba and Saskatchewan and are therefore of joint provincial benefit, subjecting the company and its employees to Manitoba’s employment safety and health laws—specifically those listed in the schedule—while excluding the application of the federal Canada Labour Code. Violations of these Manitoba laws constitute offences punishable under the Act, with fines and forfeitures going to Manitoba’s treasury, and no impact on workers’ compensation rights.
