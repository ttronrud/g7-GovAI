The Trade Unions Act establishes the legal framework for the formation, registration, and operation of trade unions in Canada, defining what constitutes a trade union, setting out requirements for registration and rules, and outlining the rights and responsibilities of members, officers, and trustees. It prohibits courts from enforcing certain internal union agreements and ensures transparency through annual financial reporting and audit requirements, while also imposing penalties for violations such as false statements, failure to report, or misuse of union funds.
