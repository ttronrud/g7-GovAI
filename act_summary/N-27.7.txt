The Nuclear Fuel Waste Act establishes a framework for the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste in Canada by creating a non-profit waste management organization owned by nuclear energy corporations and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. This organization must propose and implement economically sound, scientifically based approaches—such as deep geological disposal, storage at reactor sites, or centralized storage—after public and expert consultation, with decisions ultimately made by the Governor in Council based on comprehensive studies and financial sustainability.
