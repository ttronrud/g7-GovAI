The Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act allows the Canadian government to freeze the property of politically exposed foreign persons—such as heads of state or government officials—when a foreign state alleges misappropriation of assets and when there is political instability, all in the interest of international relations. The measures include restrictions on financial transactions, property dealings, and financial services, with provisions for appeals, permits, and reviews, and require a five-year sunset unless extended.
