This Act establishes the legal framework for the management of funds and land related to the Split Lake Cree First Nation's flood compensation, clarifying that payments made under a 1992 agreement are not considered "Indian moneys" and must be transferred to the Nation in accordance with that agreement. It also excludes certain provisions of the Indian Act from applying to land and payments under the agreement, and ensures disputes are resolved through Manitoba's arbitration laws as agreed.
