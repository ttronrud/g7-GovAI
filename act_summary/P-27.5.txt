The Public Complaints and Review Commission Act establishes an independent commission to investigate and review complaints related to the conduct of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), including service standards, time limits for responses, and protections for complainants. The Commission is composed of a Chairperson, Vice-chairperson, and up to three members, appointed with diversity and inclusivity considerations, and is granted broad powers to access information, conduct investigations, and ensure accountability, while being protected from legal liability for actions taken in good faith.
