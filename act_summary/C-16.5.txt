The Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act establishes a single, centralized federal agency to oversee food, animal, and plant health inspections, aiming to improve consumer protection, ensure consistent safety standards, promote trade, and enhance intergovernmental collaboration. The Agency is responsible for enforcing key food and agricultural regulations, conducting inspections, managing recalls, and operating with financial and administrative independence under the direction of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
