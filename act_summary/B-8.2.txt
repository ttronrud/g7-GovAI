The British Columbia Grain Handling Operations Act extends the term of a 1989 collective agreement between the B.C. Terminal Elevator Operators’ Association and the Grain Workers’ Union, Local 333, to cover the period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1992, and mandates the resumption of grain handling operations in both Vancouver and Prince Rupert, prohibits strikes or lockouts during this period, and establishes a mediator-arbitrator to resolve disputes and amend the agreement.
