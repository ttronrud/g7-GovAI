The Civil International Space Station Agreement Implementation Act establishes Canada’s legal framework for fulfilling its obligations under the 1998 Agreement on cooperation in the development and operation of the International Space Station, including provisions for information sharing, confidentiality, enforcement, and the management of space station elements by the respective governments and their agencies. The Act ensures compliance with international space law and enables Canada to participate in the joint civil space station program with the United States, European states, Japan, and Russia.
