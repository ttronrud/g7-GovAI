The Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act removes federal barriers to the interprovincial movement of goods, services, and labour by recognizing provincial and territorial requirements as comparable to federal ones, promoting mutual recognition across jurisdictions while maintaining health, safety, and environmental protections. It establishes a framework for federal regulatory bodies to recognize provincial occupational authorizations and mandates a five-year review of the Act’s implementation.
