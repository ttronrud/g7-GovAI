The Canada Lands Surveyors Act establishes the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors as a regulatory body to set and maintain standards for Canada Lands Surveyors, regulate their practice, and oversee professional conduct through a system of complaints and disciplinary actions. It defines key terms, outlines the governance structure of the Association, and provides mechanisms for licensing, investigation, discipline, and member accountability.
