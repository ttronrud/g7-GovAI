The Physical Activity and Sport Act establishes a framework to promote physical activity and sport in Canada by setting national policy objectives, supporting research and public awareness, and enabling federal action to increase participation, especially among underrepresented groups. It also creates the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada to provide independent, bilingual alternative dispute resolution services for the sport community.
