The Northwest Territories Act establishes the legal framework for the governance of the Northwest Territories, including the powers of the Legislature to make laws on local matters, the role of the Commissioner and Executive Council, and provisions related to Aboriginal rights, resource development, and environmental management. It also outlines specific rules for consultation, land and water rights, and the regulation of natural resources, while respecting federal responsibilities and constitutional limits.
