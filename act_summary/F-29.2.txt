The Foreign Influence Transparency and Accountability Act establishes a transparent system to track and regulate foreign interference in Canada’s political and governmental processes by requiring individuals involved in arrangements with foreign principals to register their activities. It creates an independent Foreign Influence Transparency Commissioner to oversee the process, maintain a publicly accessible registry, and enforce compliance through administrative penalties, while protecting democratic freedoms and national security.
