The Representation Act, 1974 establishes a new framework for electoral boundaries in Canada, reactivating suspended sections of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act and requiring boundary commissions to operate as if the 1971 census had just occurred, while preserving the existing number of House of Commons members until future readjustment. It also sets a process for the House of Commons to review and potentially amend the rules governing representation under the British North America Act, with a review to occur by June 30, 1979.
