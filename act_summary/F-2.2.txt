The Farm Credit Canada Act continues the Farm Credit Corporation as Farm Credit Canada, establishing it as a federal agency to provide specialized financial and business services to farming operations and rural businesses, with a focus on supporting family farms and agricultural-related enterprises. It outlines the Corporation’s powers, governance structure, financial regulations, and liability protections, while also repealing the Farm Syndicates Credit Act and ensuring continuity of rights and obligations.
