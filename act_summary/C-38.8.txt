The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act establishes strict regulations on the possession, production, trafficking, and import/export of controlled substances in Canada, with escalating penalties based on the schedule of the substance and specific aggravating factors. It emphasizes a public health approach to drug use, prioritizing rehabilitation, harm reduction, and addressing root causes over punitive criminal sanctions.
