This Act establishes the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness in Canada, creating a new federal department headed by a Minister who oversees public safety and emergency preparedness, coordinates key agencies, and has broad authority to develop policies, promote cooperation, and manage resources. The Minister succeeds the Solicitor General in all related duties and responsibilities, with certain powers and appointments transitioning seamlessly upon the Act’s coming into force.
