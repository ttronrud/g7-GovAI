The Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act establishes the Nunavut Water Board as a statutory institution responsible for managing the use of waters in Nunavut, ensuring Inuit rights to water on Inuit-owned land, and conducting licensing and regulatory activities in accordance with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. It defines key terms, outlines the Board’s structure, appointment process, duties, and powers, and prioritizes Inuit rights and language access in its operations.
