The Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act prohibits non-Canadians from directly or indirectly purchasing residential property in Canada, with limited exceptions for temporary residents, spouses or common-law partners of Canadians, and certain prescribed categories. Violations are punishable by a fine, and courts may order the sale of such property if a non-Canadian is convicted, with proceeds restricted to the original purchase price.
