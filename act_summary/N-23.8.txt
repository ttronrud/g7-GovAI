The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act puts into effect the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by establishing legal frameworks for trade, investment, dispute resolution, and cooperation among Canada, Mexico, and the United States, while ensuring compliance with environmental, labor, and intellectual property standards. It creates institutions like the Free Trade Commission and the Canadian Section of the Secretariat to administer and enforce the agreement, and grants the federal government authority to regulate and manage trade-related policies in accordance with NAFTA’s principles.
