The Judges Act establishes eligibility, retirement ages, salaries, and compensation standards for judges and associate judges in Canada, including provisions for salary adjustments based on economic indicators and the creation of the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission to review judicial pay and benefits every four years. It also outlines specific retirement provisions for judges who held lower court positions prior to 1990 and ensures that associate judges are subject to certain provisions of the Act, including continuing education on sexual assault law and systemic discrimination.
