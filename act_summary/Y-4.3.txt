The Yukon Surface Rights Board Act establishes the Yukon Surface Rights Board to manage surface rights on settlement land in the Yukon Territory, with specific provisions governing land use, expropriation for infrastructure, and compensation, while giving precedence to land claims agreements and the Transboundary Agreement. It also outlines the composition, appointment, and operational rules of the Board, including its independence, membership diversity, and authority to resolve surface rights disputes.
