The Forestry Act empowers the Minister of Natural Resources to conduct research, promote public cooperation, enter into agreements, and manage forest resources across Canada, including establishing Forest Experimental Areas and regulating activities related to timber, protection, and research. It also provides for regulations on land use, enforcement of offences, and forfeiture of items related to violations.
