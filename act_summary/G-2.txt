The Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act allows for the garnishment of salaries and remuneration from Her Majesty (the Crown) and parliamentary entities, subject to specific procedures, timelines, and limitations, including binding service of garnishee summonses and protections against erroneous payments. It also establishes that garnishment proceedings for maintenance, alimony, or support take priority over other claims and overrides provincial garnishment laws where there is inconsistency.
