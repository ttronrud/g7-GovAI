The Government Corporations Operation Act establishes federal corporations as agents of Her Majesty in right of Canada, granting them autonomy in hiring, managing, and compensating employees, while exempting them from the Public Service Superannuation Act—allowing them to create their own pension or insurance plans with approval from the Governor in Council. It also ensures continuity of public service benefits and compensation rights for certain employees and provides mechanisms for the Act’s application and termination through proclamation.
