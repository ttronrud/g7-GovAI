The Labour Adjustment Benefits Act provides labour adjustment benefits to eligible employees who are laid off due to significant economic adjustment in a designated industry, such as industrial restructuring or import competition. These benefits, which are calculated as 60% of the employee’s average weekly insurable earnings and adjusted annually using the Pension Index, are payable for a set period, beginning after the employee exhausts Employment Insurance benefits, and cease upon reaching age 65 or death.
