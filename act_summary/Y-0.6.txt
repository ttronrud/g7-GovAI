This Act, known as the York Factory First Nation Flooded Land Act, clarifies the legal treatment of payments and land transfers made under the 1977 Flood Agreement, ensuring that amounts paid to the York Factory First Nation are not considered "Indian money" under the Indian Act and that certain provisions of the Indian Act do not apply to these transactions. It also establishes the parties eligible to exercise claims under the agreement and specifies that Manitoba's arbitration laws apply to disputes settled by arbitration under the agreement.
