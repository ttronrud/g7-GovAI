The Northumberland Strait Crossing Act authorizes the Canadian government to enter into agreements for the design, construction, financing, and operation of a fixed structure to cross the Northumberland Strait, including provisions for annual subsidies, tolls, and industrial benefits, with payments adjusted using the consumer price index. The Minister of Public Works and Government Services has broad powers to manage the project, including leasing land, enforcing rights, and managing financial and operational terms, while ensuring the subsidy is not offset against any government debt owed by the recipient.
