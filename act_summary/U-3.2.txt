The Universal Child Care Benefit Act provides direct financial support to eligible individuals for child care, with benefits ranging from $50 to $160 per month depending on the child's age and whether the parent has shared custody, and the payments are made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The benefit is not subject to garnishment or assignment and includes specific provisions for repayment of overpayments, with a six-year limitation period for recovery.
