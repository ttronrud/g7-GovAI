The First Nations Fiscal Management Act empowers First Nations to establish local revenue systems, including property taxation and fee structures, and to borrow funds using local revenues, while ensuring transparency, consultation, and approval by the First Nations Tax Commission. It supports economic self-determination by enabling First Nations to manage their financial affairs, including taxation, service delivery, and borrowing, in alignment with the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action 44.
