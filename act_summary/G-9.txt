The Governor General’s Act establishes the Governor General of Canada as a corporation sole, defines the legal status and responsibilities of the office, outlines the salary and cost-of-living adjustments based on Statistics Canada data, and provides for retirement and survivor annuities with specific rules for eligibility, payment, and distribution. It also includes provisions for retroactive salary increments and death benefits for former Governors General and their survivors.
