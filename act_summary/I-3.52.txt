The Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1997 implements several bilateral income tax conventions between Canada and foreign countries, including Sweden, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland, and Denmark, by giving them legal force in Canada and establishing rules for tax residency, permanent establishments, taxation of income, and the resolution of conflicts between the conventions and other laws. These conventions aim to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion by defining how income is taxed for residents and non-residents of the respective countries.
