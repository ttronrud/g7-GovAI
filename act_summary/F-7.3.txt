The Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention Act establishes a national framework to address suicide as a public health issue, requiring the Canadian government to create a coordinated strategy that promotes awareness, disseminates research and data, fosters collaboration across sectors, and reports on progress every two years. It emphasizes prevention through knowledge, care, and compassion, and mandates consultations with provinces, territories, and non-governmental organizations to align efforts with existing initiatives.
