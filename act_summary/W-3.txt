The War Veterans Allowance Act provides for monthly allowances to veterans, survivors of veterans, and orphans who are residents of Canada, with payments based on factors such as age, disability, and income, and includes special provisions for dependents and those living abroad. The Act emphasizes a liberal interpretation to fulfill the Government's obligation to support those who have served in the military and their dependants.
