The International Financial Assistance Act empowers the Minister of Foreign Affairs or Minister for International Development to provide loans, guarantees, and securities to foreign states or entities to support federal sovereign loan programs, innovative financing initiatives, and climate change adaptation efforts, with strict regulatory oversight and financial accountability. It also establishes provisions for fee collection, limits on payments to Development Finance Institute Canada, and regulatory authority to set eligibility, terms, and conditions for these financial instruments.
