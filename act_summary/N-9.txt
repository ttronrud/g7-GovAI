The National Flag of Canada Manufacturing Standards Act establishes manufacturing standards for the Canadian national flag, set by the Canadian General Standards Board, to ensure quality and durability under various uses, and mandates that government entities use only flags made compliant with these standards after June 28, 1986. Flags meeting these standards must bear a certification mark, and the standards are reviewed every three years to account for technological advances.
