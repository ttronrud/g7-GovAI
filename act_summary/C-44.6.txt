The Corrections and Conditional Release Act establishes the framework for Canada’s correctional system, outlining the roles of the Commissioner and institutional heads, defining key terms such as inmate, offender, and contraband, and setting out principles for humane, effective, and safe custody and supervision. It emphasizes rehabilitation, reintegration, and the protection of society while ensuring offenders have access to programs, mental health assessments, and fair processes throughout their sentence.
