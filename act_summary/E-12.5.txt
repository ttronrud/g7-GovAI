The Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act establishes a fair and efficient administrative monetary penalty system as an alternative to criminal penalties for violations of designated environmental laws, allowing for quicker enforcement while ensuring accountability through review processes and specific rules on penalties, notice, and appeals. It applies to a range of environmental acts, sets maximum penalty amounts, and provides for review by a Chief Review Officer or panel, with final determinations binding unless subject to judicial review.
