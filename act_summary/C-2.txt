The Canada Council for the Arts Act establishes a corporation, the Canada Council for the Arts, to foster and promote the arts in Canada through grants, scholarships, awards, exhibitions, and international exchange, with funding derived from an endowment and university capital grants fund. The Council is governed by a board of members and a Director, operates independently of federal public administration, and is accountable to Parliament through annual reporting and auditing.
