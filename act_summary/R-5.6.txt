The Representation Act, 1985 (also known as the Constitution Act, 1985 (Representation)) mandates that the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act be applied as if the constitutional provision on electoral boundaries had been in force from the 1981 census onward, effectively resetting the process for redrawing electoral boundaries across Canada, with special provisions for the Northwest Territories. The Act comes into force on a date to be proclaimed, and it ensures that prior boundary decisions are nullified for the purposes of applying the updated redistricting rules.
