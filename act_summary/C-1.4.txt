The Canada Border Services Agency Act establishes the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) as a body corporate responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security, public safety, and the free flow of persons and goods, while administering and enforcing various federal program legislation. The Act also outlines the agency’s structure, powers, responsibilities, and transitional provisions to ensure continuity in operations and personnel from the former Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.
