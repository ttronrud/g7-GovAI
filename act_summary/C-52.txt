The Currency Act establishes the dollar as Canada’s monetary unit, defines the legal tender status of coins and notes, sets limits on the legal tender value of certain coins, and outlines the rules for the issuance, redemption, and regulation of currency. It also creates the Exchange Fund Account to manage foreign currency exposures and provide liquidity, with specific reporting and financial transparency requirements.
