The International Mother Language Day Act designates February 21 as International Mother Language Day across Canada to recognize and celebrate linguistic and cultural diversity. This day is not a legal holiday but serves as a symbolic observance to promote the preservation and protection of all languages, including Indigenous and other minority languages.
