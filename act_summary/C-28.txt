The Children of Deceased Veterans Education Assistance Act provides financial support, including monthly allowances and payment of education costs, to eligible children of deceased Canadian Veterans who died from service-related injuries or diseases, or who were disabled due to service, enabling them to pursue full-time education. The assistance is limited to four academic years (or 36 months), with adjustments for inflation and specific provisions for students who meet certain conditions or have exceptional academic progress.
