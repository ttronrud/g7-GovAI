The Port of Montreal Operations Act, 2021 establishes an exceptional framework to prevent a work stoppage at the Port of Montreal by extending the expired collective agreement, prohibiting strikes or lockouts during the dispute resolution period, and appointing a mediator-arbitrator to resolve disagreements over the terms of a new agreement. The Act ensures immediate resumption of operations, provides for binding decisions by the mediator-arbitrator, and mandates that the resulting agreement be effective and enforceable, with provisions for future amendments.
