The Intelligence Commissioner Act establishes a part-time, independently appointed Intelligence Commissioner—appointed by the Governor in Council on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, typically a retired superior court judge—who oversees the human resources management of intelligence agencies and reviews the reasonableness of key authorizations and determinations under the Communications Security Establishment Act and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act. The Commissioner has broad authority over staffing, compensation, discipline, and employee development, and must provide written decisions on reviews of intelligence authorizations, with reports submitted annually to the Prime Minister and Parliament.
