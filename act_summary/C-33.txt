The Coastal Fisheries Protection Act establishes strict controls on foreign fishing vessels entering Canadian fisheries waters, prohibiting unauthorized fishing, landing, or importation of fish and marine plants, and requiring compliance with international conservation and management measures—particularly for straddling stocks in the Northwest Atlantic—while allowing for enforcement actions and regulatory flexibility through ministerial regulations. It strengthens Canada’s ability to protect fish stocks, especially those on the Grand Banks, by ensuring foreign vessels adhere to agreed-upon conservation measures in both Canadian and international waters.
