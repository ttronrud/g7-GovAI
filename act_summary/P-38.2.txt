This Act establishes the Department of Public Works and Government Services as a central agency of the Canadian government responsible for providing common services such as construction, procurement, telecommunications, translation, and administrative support to other federal departments. It grants the Minister broad powers to manage materiel, services, and federal real property, while also creating a Procurement Ombudsman to ensure fairness and transparency in government contracting.
