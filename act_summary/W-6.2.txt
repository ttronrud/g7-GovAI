This Act enacts the Westbank First Nation Self-Government Act, giving legal force to the 2003 Self-Government Agreement between the Westbank First Nation and the Government of Canada, establishing the Nation’s self-governance powers, and exempting it from certain federal laws, while ensuring the Agreement is binding and enforceable. It also outlines procedural rules for judicial review, notice requirements, and the role of federal authorities in relation to the Agreement.
