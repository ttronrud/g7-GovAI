The Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act prohibits offering, giving, or agreeing to give bribes or benefits to foreign public officials to influence their actions in the course of business, and establishes penalties, including up to 14 years in prison, for such offences. It also extends jurisdiction to acts committed abroad by Canadians or Canadian entities and requires annual reporting on the Act’s implementation and enforcement.
