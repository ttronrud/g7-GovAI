The Canada-Brazil Income Tax Convention Act, 1984 establishes a tax treaty to avoid double taxation of income between Canada and Brazil, defining residency, permanent establishments, and the taxation of income such as dividends, interest, and royalties, while setting limits on tax rates and ensuring that profits and income are taxed in the appropriate country based on the nature of the activity or business. The treaty provides mechanisms for resolving disputes and ensures that tax rules are applied consistently and fairly between the two countries.
