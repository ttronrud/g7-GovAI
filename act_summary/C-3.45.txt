The Canada Disability Benefit Act establishes a new financial support program to reduce poverty among working-age persons with disabilities by providing them with a targeted benefit that is designed to address economic exclusion, intersectional barriers, and the challenges of employment. The Act emphasizes inclusive, barrier-free development of regulations and processes, with mandatory engagement of the disability community and regular reviews to ensure effectiveness and equity.
