The Department of Employment and Social Development Act reorganizes and strengthens the federal government’s responsibilities for human resources and social development by establishing the Department of Employment and Social Development, defining its powers and functions, and outlining the roles of the Minister, Deputy Minister, and key bodies such as the Canada Employment Insurance Commission and the Social Security Tribunal. It also grants the Minister authority to provide public services, collect personal and business identifiers, establish programs, and set fees, while ensuring coordination with provincial authorities and compliance with statutory and financial regulations.
