The Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1995 implements Canada’s double taxation avoidance agreements with Latvia, Estonia, and Trinidad and Tobago, establishing the legal framework for applying the conventions in Canada, including rules on residency, permanent establishments, taxation of income and capital, and profit attribution. The conventions allow each country to tax income derived from sources in the other country under specific conditions, with provisions to prevent double taxation and ensure fair treatment of residents and enterprises.
