The United Nations Act enables Canada to implement measures decided by the UN Security Council, such as economic sanctions or communication disruptions, through orders and regulations made by the Governor in Council, with provisions for enforcement, penalties, and parliamentary review. If Parliament votes to annul such orders within 40 days, they cease to have effect, though prior actions remain valid.
