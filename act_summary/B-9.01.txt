The Broadcasting Act establishes the policy and regulatory framework for Canada’s broadcasting system, emphasizing the importance of Canadian content, linguistic duality, cultural diversity, and accessibility, while ensuring that all broadcasting undertakings—public, private, and community—contribute to a vibrant, independent, and inclusive national media system. It defines key terms, outlines the responsibilities of broadcasters, and ensures that programming reflects the needs of all Canadians, including Indigenous peoples, racialized communities, persons with disabilities, and official language minority groups.
