The Canada–Oman Tax Agreement Act, 2004 establishes the legal framework for the Canada–Oman tax treaty, which aims to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion by defining rules for the taxation of income and capital, including residency, permanent establishments, profits, dividends, and other forms of income. It provides that income derived by residents of one country from sources in the other is generally taxable only in the country where the income is earned, with specific exceptions and rules for taxing profits, dividends, and international transport activities.
