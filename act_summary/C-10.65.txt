The Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act implements the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by establishing a free trade area with goals to promote trade, investment, environmental protection, labour rights, and transparency while creating a clear legal framework for business operations. It outlines the roles of the Free Trade Commission, defines key entities and procedures, and ensures continuity of existing trade mechanisms, including the Secretariat, while providing for the enforcement of obligations and transitional provisions for ongoing proceedings.
