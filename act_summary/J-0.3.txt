The James Bay and Northern Quebec Native Claims Settlement Act approves and gives effect to a 1975 agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, and Indigenous groups (Crees and Inuit), settling their native title claims in northern Quebec by granting land rights, hunting and fishing privileges, cultural protection, environmental management, and financial compensation, while extinguishing all prior native claims in the Territory. The Act establishes a framework for Indigenous participation in governance, economic development, and environmental stewardship, and ensures that compensation and benefits are tax-exempt and subject to parliamentary oversight.
