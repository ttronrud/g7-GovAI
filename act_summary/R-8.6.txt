The Royal Assent Act allows royal assent to bills to be given either in person during a Parliament session or by written declaration, with certain requirements for notification and validity, while preserving the traditional practice of royal assent and enhancing legislative efficiency. The Act ensures that royal assent is valid even if given by written declaration, and it does not require the ceremonial assembly of Parliament to be held twice each year.
