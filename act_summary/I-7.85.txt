The Indigenous Languages Act establishes a framework to support, promote, and revitalize Indigenous languages in Canada by providing long-term funding, facilitating partnerships with Indigenous governments and organizations, and creating the Office of the Commissioner of Indigenous Languages to advance language rights, conduct research, and resolve disputes. It aligns with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, emphasizing Indigenous self-determination and the vital role of language in cultural survival and reconciliation.
