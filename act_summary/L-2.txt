The Canada Labour Code establishes the legal framework for labour relations in federal workplaces, promoting free collective bargaining and protecting the rights of employees and employers. It creates the Canada Industrial Relations Board to oversee labour disputes, certify bargaining units and agents, and ensure fair treatment of workers, while defining key terms such as strike, lockout, and employee status.
