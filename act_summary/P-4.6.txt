This act authorizes the Minister of Finance to make direct payments up to $1 billion to a trust that will provide funding to provinces and territories to support initiatives helping vulnerable communities and workers affected by international economic volatility. The amount distributed to each jurisdiction is determined by the trust's indenture and can be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund as the Minister deems appropriate.
