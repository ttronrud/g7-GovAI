The Canada–Namibia Tax Convention Act, 2013 establishes and implements a tax treaty between Canada and Namibia to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion with respect to income and capital taxes. It defines key terms such as residency, permanent establishment, and taxable income, and provides rules on the taxation of dividends, profits from international operations, and income from immovable property, while ensuring that tax treaties prevail over conflicting domestic laws.
