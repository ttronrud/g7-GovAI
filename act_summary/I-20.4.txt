This Act incorporates the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (the "Convention") into Canadian law, making it binding in respect of international sales contracts between parties with businesses in different countries, subject to certain exclusions and the ability of parties to exclude or modify its application. The Convention establishes uniform rules for the formation and performance of such contracts, including requirements for offers, acceptances, delivery, and quality of goods, while providing for remedies and the interpretation of contractual intent.
