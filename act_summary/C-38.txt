The Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act ensures that prepackaged products in Canada are accurately labelled with clear, truthful declarations of net quantity and other required information, prohibits false or misleading representations, and establishes enforcement mechanisms including inspections and seizure powers to protect consumer rights. It applies to most products but excludes devices, drugs, and food commodities, and allows for regulations to address packaging issues and consumer confusion.
