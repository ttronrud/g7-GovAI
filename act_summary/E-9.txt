The Energy Supplies Emergency Act establishes the Energy Supplies Allocation Board to manage and allocate petroleum and other controlled products during national emergencies caused by shortages or market disturbances, enabling mandatory allocation programs and rationing to ensure equitable distribution and national security. It grants the Board broad powers to regulate supply, pricing, imports, exports, and use of controlled products, with oversight by the Governor in Council and accountability to Parliament.
