The Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act requires government institutions and certain businesses in Canada to annually report on their efforts to prevent and eliminate forced and child labour in their supply chains, including policies, risk assessments, and remediation measures. These reports must be made public, and non-compliance is punishable by fines, with a comprehensive review mandated after five years.
