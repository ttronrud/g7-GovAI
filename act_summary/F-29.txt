The Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act empowers the Attorney General of Canada, with ministerial concurrence, to restrict the production or disclosure of Canadian records to foreign tribunals or to prohibit compliance with foreign trade or antitrust measures that adversely affect Canadian interests, and to block or modify the enforcement of foreign judgments that harm Canadian sovereignty or trade. It also allows Canadian citizens or residents to recover expenses, losses, or damages resulting from enforcement of such judgments, and provides mechanisms for judicial enforcement of these orders.
