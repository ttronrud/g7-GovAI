The Building Canada Act establishes an accelerated regulatory process to advance nationally significant projects—such as infrastructure, energy development, and economic corridors—by granting them expedited approvals while ensuring environmental protection, Indigenous rights are respected, and investor confidence is maintained. It creates a public registry of these projects, mandates transparency in decision-making, and requires consultations with Indigenous peoples, provincial governments, and relevant regulatory bodies before authorizations are granted.
