The Winding-up and Restructuring Act establishes the legal framework for the winding up of insolvent companies, including those that are foreign insurance companies or authorized foreign banks, and provides conditions under which a court may issue a winding-up order. It defines insolvency, outlines procedures for initiating and adjudicating winding-up proceedings, and specifies the circumstances and parties who may apply for such orders, with special provisions for financial institutions and foreign entities operating in Canada.
