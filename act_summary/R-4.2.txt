The Railway Safety Act establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure the safety and security of the public, personnel, and property in railway operations by promoting risk-based safety management, requiring engineering standards, and enabling regulatory oversight by the Minister of Transport. It applies to railways under federal jurisdiction, excludes certain railway types, and mandates public consultation, safety assessments, and compliance with engineering and safety standards before any railway work can proceed.
