This act repeals the Family Allowances Act and replaces it with the Children’s Special Allowances Act, which comes into force on January 1, 1993, ensuring continuity of payments by maintaining the same amounts that would have been payable under the old act for overlapping periods. It also establishes that eligibility and payments for special allowances for children transition smoothly from the Family Allowances Act to the new legislation.
