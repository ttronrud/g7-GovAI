The Energy Monitoring Act requires energy enterprises and oil and gas dealers in Canada to file regular reports on their financial activities, ownership, operations, and resources related to oil, gas, and other designated energy commodities, with the aim of providing transparency and oversight to the Minister of Natural Resources. The Act includes provisions for exemptions, reporting thresholds, confidentiality, and penalties for non-compliance or false information.
