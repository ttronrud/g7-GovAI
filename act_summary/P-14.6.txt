The Plant Breeders’ Rights Act grants exclusive rights to breeders of new, distinct, stable, and homogeneous plant varieties, allowing them to control the production, sale, and use of propagating material and harvested plants, with protections lasting up to 25 years for trees, vines, or specified categories and 20 years otherwise. The Act establishes clear criteria for novelty, distinctiveness, stability, and homogeneity, defines the rights and limitations of holders, and includes provisions for international protection, priority claims, and exceptions for private, experimental, or farming use.
