The Succession to the Throne Act, 2013 removes gender-based barriers to succession to the British Crown and ends the disqualification for marrying a Roman Catholic, aligning with changes agreed upon by the Realms and enacted through the UK Parliament, with the Act coming into force on March 26, 2015. It reflects a constitutional commitment to equality and modernizes the rules of royal succession in accordance with the principles of the Commonwealth.
