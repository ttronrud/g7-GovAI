The Foreign Enlistment Act prohibits Canadians from joining or being induced to join the armed forces of a foreign state at war with a friendly foreign state, and criminalizes activities such as building, equipping, or dispatching ships for such use, as well as recruiting for foreign armed forces. Offenders face fines and imprisonment, and ships or equipment involved in such activities may be forfeited to Her Majesty.
