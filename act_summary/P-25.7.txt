The Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act establishes a framework to protect homeowners by providing government-backed insurance coverage for residential mortgage loans, ensuring financial stability in the housing market and mitigating risks to the Canadian financial system. It governs the designation, oversight, and responsibilities of approved mortgage insurers and qualified lenders, including requirements for capital, reporting, and payment obligations in the event of insolvency.
