The Public Health Agency of Canada Act establishes a dedicated federal agency to strengthen public health protection, promotion, and emergency preparedness by creating a Chief Public Health Officer and a President to provide scientific advice, coordinate federal and provincial efforts, and oversee public health initiatives. It enables the Minister of Health to delegate powers to the Agency’s officers while ensuring the Chief Public Health Officer has authority to advise government, communicate with stakeholders, and publish reports on public health issues.
