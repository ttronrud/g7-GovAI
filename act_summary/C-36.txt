The Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) provides a legal framework for insolvent companies to restructure their debts and operations without going into bankruptcy, allowing for compromise or arrangement proposals with creditors, including secured and unsecured creditors, while ensuring protections for employees, pension obligations, and government claims. It enables courts to sanction such arrangements if they are fair, reasonable, and meet specific requirements related to employee payments, pension obligations, and tax liabilities.
