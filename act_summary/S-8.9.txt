The Shared Services Canada Act establishes a centralized, shared services entity to standardize and consolidate administrative services across federal government institutions, improving efficiency and the use of public funds. It creates Shared Services Canada as a department under the Minister of Public Services and Procurement, granting the Minister authority to provide, delegate, and regulate specific services to departments and Crown corporations, while preserving certain rights and responsibilities for existing employees and records.
