The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act establishes an independent parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the legislative, regulatory, and operational frameworks of Canada’s national security and intelligence activities, ensuring accountability while protecting sensitive information. The Committee, composed of non-ministerial members from both Houses of Parliament, has access to relevant departmental information, including privileged data, and is required to submit annual reports to the Prime Minister, with certain restrictions on disclosure to preserve national security.
