This Act authorizes the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to sell shares or dispose of assets of Canadian Arsenals Limited, with specific restrictions on non-resident ownership of securities and amendments to the corporation’s articles, while also providing for the continuation of certain superannuation benefits for employees under specific conditions. It effectively divests the federal government of its ownership and operational control over the corporation, transferring control to the corporation itself while maintaining regulatory oversight.
