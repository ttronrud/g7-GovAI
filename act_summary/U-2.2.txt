The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act affirms the UN Declaration as a binding standard in Canadian law and establishes a framework for the Government of Canada to implement its principles through consultation with Indigenous peoples, including measures to address historical injustices, eliminate discrimination, promote self-determination, and ensure the rights of Indigenous peoples to their lands, cultures, languages, and education. It mandates the development and regular review of an action plan and annual reports to track progress in achieving these goals.
