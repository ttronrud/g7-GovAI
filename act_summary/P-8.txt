The Pension Fund Societies Act establishes a framework for corporations in Canada to create pension fund societies to provide pensions and annuities to officers and employees, including their survivors and minor children, through a process involving declarations, by-laws, and ministerial approval. These societies are corporate bodies governed by boards of directors, with funds dedicated solely to pension purposes and subject to strict regulations on governance, voting, and financial reporting.
