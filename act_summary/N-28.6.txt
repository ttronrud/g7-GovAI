The Nunavut Act establishes Nunavut as a new territory of Canada, comprising the area north of the 60th parallel and east of a specified boundary, including islands in Hudson, James, and Ungava Bays. It creates a self-governing legislative and executive structure for Nunavut, including a Legislative Assembly, an Executive Council, a Commissioner of Nunavut, and a court system, while preserving certain powers from the Northwest Territories and providing for the transition of laws and rights into the new territory.
