The Historic Sites and Monuments Act establishes the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada to identify, mark, and preserve places of national historic significance, and to advise the Minister on the administration and maintenance of such sites and historic museums. It grants the Minister powers to commemorate historic places, acquire them, and establish museums, while the Board oversees recommendations and reports on these activities.
