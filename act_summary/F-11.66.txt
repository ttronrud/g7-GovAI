The First Nations Financial Transparency Act requires First Nations in Canada to prepare and publicly disclose audited consolidated financial statements and detailed schedules of remuneration and expenses paid to their chief and councillors, enhancing financial accountability and transparency. It also establishes penalties and enforcement mechanisms, including the potential withholding of grants or termination of agreements, for non-compliance.
