The Oaths of Allegiance Act establishes a standardized form of oath of allegiance that all eligible individuals must take when required by law, allowing solemn affirmations in place of oaths for those permitted under civil law, and grants authority to the Governor in Council to require specific oaths of allegiance and office for certain public officials. It also specifies that only the prescribed oath of allegiance and relevant oaths of office or profession are required, and that these oaths must be taken within prescribed periods and under applicable legal conditions.
