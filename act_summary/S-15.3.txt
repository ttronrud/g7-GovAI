The Species at Risk Act establishes a comprehensive framework to prevent wildlife species from becoming extinct by providing legal protection, requiring the development of recovery strategies and action plans, and promoting cooperation among federal, provincial, and territorial governments. It emphasizes the importance of scientific and traditional knowledge, habitat conservation, and public stewardship in protecting Canada’s biodiversity.
