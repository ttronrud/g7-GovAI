The Cooperative Credit Associations Act establishes the regulatory framework for cooperative credit societies in Canada, defining key terms and outlining the responsibilities of associations, their members, directors, and affiliated entities. It also empowers the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to determine whether associations are "distributing" and to assess whether such status affects security holders.
