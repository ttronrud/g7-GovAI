The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act establishes pension and compassionate allowance provisions for retired or deceased officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, including eligibility based on length of service, survivorship, and special circumstances such as disability or prior service. It outlines specific rules for pension calculations, survivor benefits, gratuities, and the inclusion of prior service in pension eligibility, while also setting conditions for granting pensions to spouses or children.
