The Marine Transportation Security Act establishes a framework for securing marine transportation in Canada by enabling the Minister of Transport to implement security measures and rules, require screening of persons and goods, and authorize operators of vessels and marine facilities to develop and implement their own security rules. It also provides for oversight, enforcement, and review mechanisms, including penalties for non-compliance and protections for sensitive security information.
