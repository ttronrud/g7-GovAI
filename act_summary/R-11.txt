The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act establishes a superannuation system for RCMP members, ensuring equality between male and female contributors and defining pensionable service, contribution rates, and eligibility for benefits. It continues the former pension account, outlines conditions under which service can be counted as pensionable, and sets rules for contributions, including caps and exemptions for certain periods or circumstances.
