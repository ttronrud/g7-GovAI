The Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act transfers the responsibility for providing civil air navigation services in Canada from the Department of Transport to NAV CANADA, a corporation, effective on a specified transfer date. It establishes NAV CANADA as the designated authority for key air navigation services, including air traffic control and aeronautical information services, while setting out rules for service changes, public notice requirements, and safeguards for users, particularly in remote or northern regions.
