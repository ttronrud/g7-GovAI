The Canada Marine Act establishes a framework for the governance, operation, and development of Canada’s marine infrastructure by creating port authorities to manage ports and port facilities, promoting economic competitiveness, safety, and environmental protection while ensuring alignment with international standards and local needs. It defines key terms, outlines the powers and responsibilities of port authorities, and provides for their incorporation through letters patent, including provisions for transition from previous port entities like harbour commissions and local port corporations.
