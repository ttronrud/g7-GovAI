The Farm Income Protection Act establishes a framework for provinces and the federal government to enter into agreements to create agricultural insurance and income stabilization programs, including crop, revenue, and net income stabilization programs, with provisions to ensure equitable, sustainable, and environmentally responsible support for farmers. These programs are subject to strict governance, transparency, and accountability measures, including regular audits, environmental assessments, and oversight by national committees, while also allowing for special measures in exceptional circumstances.
