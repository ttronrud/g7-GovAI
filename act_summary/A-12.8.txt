The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Agreement Act approves Canada’s participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), enabling the Governor in Council to implement Canada’s obligations under the Agreement, including making appointments, regulations, and managing financial commitments, while ensuring the Bank’s operations focus on financing infrastructure development in Asia to promote sustainable economic growth and regional cooperation. The Bank is established as a multilateral financial institution with a mandate to invest in infrastructure and productive sectors, operate under sound banking principles, and maintain financial discipline through limits on lending and equity investments.
