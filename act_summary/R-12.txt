This Act grants Canadian parliamentary approval for a Royal Proclamation that establishes the official Royal Style and Titles for Canada, recognizing Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada, the United Kingdom, and Her other Realms and Territories, and Head of the Commonwealth. It reflects the Commonwealth's evolving constitutional relationships by maintaining a common element while allowing each country to adapt its title to its own circumstances.
