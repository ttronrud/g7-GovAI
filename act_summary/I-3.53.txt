The Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1998 implements Canada’s double taxation avoidance agreements with Vietnam, Croatia, and Chile, establishing the legal framework for taxing income in accordance with those treaties. It defines key terms such as residency, permanent establishment, and taxable income, and provides that the treaties prevail over conflicting domestic laws, while ensuring that profits from business operations and international traffic are taxed in the appropriate jurisdiction.
