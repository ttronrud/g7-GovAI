The Restoring Rail Service Act, enacted on June 1, 2012, mandates that Canadian Pacific Railway resume rail operations and employee duties without delay, prohibits lockouts and strikes during the extended term of expired collective agreements, and establishes an arbitration process to resolve disputes, with the arbitrator’s decision becoming a binding new collective agreement. It ensures continuity of service and employment while protecting employees from retaliation and providing a structured path to agreement resolution.
