The Journey to Freedom Day Act designates April 30 as a day to remember and commemorate the Vietnamese boat people exodus, the lives lost during their journey, the humanitarian efforts of Canada in accepting Vietnamese refugees, and the contributions of Vietnamese-Canadian communities. It is not a legal holiday but serves as a day of remembrance and gratitude.
