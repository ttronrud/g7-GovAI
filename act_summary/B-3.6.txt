The Bell Canada Act establishes the responsibilities and restrictions for Bell Canada, including its obligation to provide telephone services to eligible customers and limits on its ownership of businesses involved in research or product manufacturing related to its telecommunications activities. It also imposes regulatory oversight on the Company’s share sales, asset disposals, and property encumbrances, requiring prior Commission approval in most cases.
