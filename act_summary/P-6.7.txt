The Pension Benefits Division Act allows a member of a pension plan or their spouse, former spouse, or former common-law partner to apply for a division of pension benefits under specific circumstances, such as a court order, separation, or written agreement. The Minister approves the division, typically transferring 50% of the accrued benefits to the entitled party and adjusting the remaining benefits, with certain exemptions and protections for the recipient, including immunity from assignment or seizure.
