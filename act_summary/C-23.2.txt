The Canadian Space Agency Act establishes the Canadian Space Agency as a federal agency to promote the peaceful use of space, advance space science, and ensure that space technologies provide social and economic benefits to Canadians. The Agency is responsible for coordinating national space policies, conducting research, supporting commercial applications, and operating space programs, all under the oversight of the Minister and with powers to enter into agreements, issue licenses, and collect fees for services.
