The Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act establishes a framework for the cross-provincial enforcement of family provisions, such as child support, custody, access, and parenting arrangements, by enabling the sharing of information through designated information banks and agreements between the federal government and provinces. It allows courts, enforcement services, and other authorized entities to request and receive information to establish or enforce family orders, with safeguards to protect privacy and ensure lawful use.
