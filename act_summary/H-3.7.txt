The Hibernia Development Project Act establishes the legal framework for the development of the Hibernia oil project off the coast of Newfoundland, including provisions for federal and provincial law application in the offshore area, financial guarantees by the Canadian government, and the enforcement of rights and obligations related to the project. It also ensures that the regulatory and legal decisions made in 1986 remain valid and grants the Minister authority to enter into agreements with specific financial and operational terms, while preserving the jurisdiction of courts and the rights of the Province of Newfoundland.
