The Integrated Cross-border Law Enforcement Operations Act implements the 2009 Canada-U.S. Framework Agreement by establishing a framework for joint maritime law enforcement operations along the Canada-U.S. border, enabling Canadian and U.S. officers to conduct integrated operations in undisputed waters while respecting sovereignty, the rule of law, and each country’s legal rights. It grants designated officers the same powers as Royal Canadian Mounted Police members and ensures that Canadian law applies to operations, detentions, and seized property within Canada, with limited exceptions for operational necessity involving transit through U.S. or Canadian waters.
