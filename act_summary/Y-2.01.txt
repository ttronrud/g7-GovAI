The Yukon Act establishes the legislative and executive framework for the self-governing territory of Yukon, enabling it to make laws on a wide range of local and territorial matters, including natural resources, taxation, education, justice, and public finance, while maintaining certain powers reserved to federal authority. It also outlines the structure of Yukon’s government, including the roles of the Commissioner, Legislative Assembly, and Auditor General, and ensures that Yukon’s powers are balanced with federal oversight and constitutional limits.
