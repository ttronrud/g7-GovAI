This act confirms a 1924 agreement between the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario regarding the administration and disposition of Indian Reserves in Ontario. It grants the Dominion full authority to sell, lease, or convey land from surrendered Reserves for the benefit of the Indigenous bands, with proceeds shared equally—half going to Ontario and half retained by Canada—after band extinction or when the Reserve is no longer needed for Indigenous benefit.
