The Special Retirement Arrangements Act establishes special pension plans and retirement compensation arrangements for certain public service employees who are excluded from standard pension plans, ensuring they receive pension benefits and supplementary benefits on par with those available under existing pension acts, while maintaining compliance with income tax and pension plan regulations. It also provides for the funding, valuation, and oversight of these arrangements through dedicated accounts and requires the Minister to take remedial action if individuals are wrongfully denied benefits due to administrative or advisory errors.
