The Farm Products Agencies Act establishes marketing and promotion-research agencies to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of farm products, with powers defined by marketing or promotion and research plans. It creates the National Farm Products Council to advise the Minister, review agency operations, and ensure that agency establishment or expansion reflects the majority support of producers, through public hearings and consultations.
