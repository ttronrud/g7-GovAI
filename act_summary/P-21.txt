The Privacy Act establishes the rights of Canadian individuals to access personal information held by government institutions and sets out rules for the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of such information, ensuring privacy and accountability in government handling of personal data. It defines key terms, limits the use of personal information to administrative purposes, and requires institutions to provide individuals with access to their personal information, while also mandating transparency through public indexes of personal information banks.
