The Territorial Lands Act establishes the framework for the administration, disposal, and protection of territorial lands in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, granting the Governor in Council broad powers to set aside lands for public use, regulate land use and leasing, and enforce compliance through penalties and judicial procedures. It ensures that certain rights—such as access to water, minerals, and surface use—are reserved to the Crown and restricts private ownership and leasing to prevent environmental harm and protect Indigenous interests.
