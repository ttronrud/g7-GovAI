The Coasting Trade Act regulates the operation of foreign and non-duty-paid ships in Canadian waters and above the continental shelf, requiring a licence for engagement in coasting trade unless exempted. It provides specific exemptions for activities such as fishing, research, dredging, and certain passenger or container movements, while ensuring safety and pollution prevention standards are met.
