The Citizenship Act establishes the criteria for Canadian citizenship, including birth in Canada, parentage, naturalization, and restoration of citizenship, while addressing special provisions for individuals whose parents were citizens under older laws or who lost citizenship due to renunciation or fraud. It also includes provisions for deeming certain individuals as born in Canada and outlines specific exceptions and conditions under which citizenship is granted or lost.
