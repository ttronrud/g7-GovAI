The Veterans’ Land Act provides for the acquisition, sale, and transfer of land and farm-related property to eligible veterans, allowing them to purchase land, buildings, livestock, and farm equipment at reduced costs with favorable repayment terms, including interest rates and payment extensions. The Director of the Act, acting as a corporation sole, administers the program and ensures that veterans receive support in establishing farms, with provisions for joint ownership by veterans and their spouses or common-law partners.
