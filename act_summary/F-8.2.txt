The Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, 1972 establishes a system of provincial revenue equalization and stabilization payments to ensure fair distribution of fiscal resources among Canadian provinces. Equalization payments are calculated based on differences between a province’s population and revenue base relative to the national average, while stabilization payments compensate provinces for declines in tax revenue due to changes in tax rates or structures.
