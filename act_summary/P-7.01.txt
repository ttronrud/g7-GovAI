The Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 establishes standards for the registration, operation, and administration of pension plans in Canada, ensuring fair and equitable pension benefits for employees, including those in included employment, while allowing for flexibility through defined benefit and defined contribution plans. It also provides the Superintendent of Financial Institutions with oversight powers and enables federal-provincial cooperation to adapt pension legislation to specific plans.
