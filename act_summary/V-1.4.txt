The Veterans Insurance Act provides for life insurance coverage of veterans and certain eligible individuals who served in Canada’s armed forces during World War II, with benefits payable upon death, including options for lump sum or annuity payments. It outlines detailed rules for beneficiaries, disability provisions, premium payments, and administrative powers for the Minister, while ensuring insurance funds are managed through the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
