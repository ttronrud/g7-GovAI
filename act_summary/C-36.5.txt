The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Implementation Act establishes Canada’s legal framework for fulfilling its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, including provisions for monitoring nuclear explosions, conducting on-site inspections, enforcing prohibitions on nuclear testing, and protecting the privileges and immunities of inspectors and observers. It also creates criminal penalties for unauthorized nuclear explosions and mandates reporting of large-scale chemical explosions to ensure transparency and compliance with the Treaty.
