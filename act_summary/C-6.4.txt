The Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act implements the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, aiming to strengthen bilateral trade by reducing tariffs, eliminating non-tariff barriers, promoting environmental and labour standards, advancing gender equality, and improving market access for Canadian businesses, particularly SMEs. It establishes the Joint Commission, outlines responsibilities of federal ministers, and provides mechanisms for enforcement and implementation, all under the authority of the Governor in Council and with the consent of the Attorney General of Canada.
