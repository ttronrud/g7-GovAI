The Canada–Mexico Tax Convention Act, 2006 establishes the legal framework for the Canada–Mexico tax treaty, defining how income, profits, and dividends are taxed to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion. It outlines rules for determining residency, permanent establishments, taxation of business profits, international traffic, and dividend taxation, with provisions ensuring that tax benefits prevail over conflicting domestic laws and that mutual agreements resolve disputes.
