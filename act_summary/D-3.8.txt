The DNA Identification Act establishes a national DNA data bank to assist law enforcement in identifying offenders, locating missing persons, and identifying human remains through the use of DNA profiles, while strictly regulating access, use, and privacy protections to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards. The Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police oversees the data bank, which includes multiple indexes for criminal investigations, missing persons, and human remains, with strict conditions on when and how DNA profiles can be added, shared, or accessed.
