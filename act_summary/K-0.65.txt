The Kelowna Accord Implementation Act mandates the Government of Canada to take immediate steps to implement the commitments outlined in the Kelowna Accord, which aims to reduce disparities in education, health, employment, and other key areas between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. The Act also requires annual progress reports to be submitted to Parliament, starting at the end of the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2007.
