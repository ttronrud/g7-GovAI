The Canada Revenue Agency Act establishes the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as a body corporate and outlines its structure, powers, and responsibilities, including the administration and enforcement of federal tax and program legislation. It defines key roles such as the Minister, Commissioner, and Board of Management, and sets out rules for accountability, governance, financial oversight, and conflict of interest among directors and officers.
