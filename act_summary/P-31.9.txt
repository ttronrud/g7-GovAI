The Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act establishes a framework to protect public servants who report wrongdoing in the federal public sector, ensuring they can do so safely and without fear of reprisal, while also promoting accountability, integrity, and ethical conduct through codes of conduct and procedures for disclosure and investigation. It balances the duty of loyalty to the employer with the right to freedom of expression, and provides a mechanism for addressing reprisals through an independent commissioner and tribunal.
