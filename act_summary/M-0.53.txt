This Act implements the settlement of claims between the Government of Canada, the Government of Manitoba, the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, and the Norway House Cree Nation, specifically addressing land and financial compensation related to the 1977 Flood Agreement, and ensures that amounts paid under the Agreement are not considered "Indian money" under the Indian Act. It also establishes rules for land transfers, dispute resolution, and the continuation of reserve designation processes under applicable legislation.
