This Act establishes the Department of Natural Resources in Canada, transferring responsibilities from the former Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and the Department of Forestry, and assigns the Minister of Natural Resources broad authority over natural resources, explosives, and technical surveys, with a focus on sustainable development and international cooperation. It also ensures continuity of employee positions and funding, and mandates that all references to the old departments be read as references to the new Department of Natural Resources.
