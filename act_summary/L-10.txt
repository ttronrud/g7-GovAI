The Livestock Feed Assistance Act establishes a framework to ensure the availability and stable pricing of feed grain for livestock feeders in Eastern Canada, British Columbia, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, by enabling the Minister to make payments for storage and transportation, negotiate storage and importation, and conduct studies on feed grain needs. It also creates an Advisory Committee to advise on the Act’s administration and provides for regulations on eligibility, pricing, and definitions, while establishing penalties for false statements or non-compliance.
