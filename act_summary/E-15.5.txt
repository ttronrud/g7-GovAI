The Expenditure Restraint Act imposes strict limits on pay increases and additional remuneration for federal public sector employees during a specified "restraint period" (April 1, 2006, to March 31, 2011), ensuring that rate of pay increases do not exceed prescribed percentages and that no new or increased additional remuneration can be introduced during this time, with certain exceptions for restructuring or national rate harmonization. The Act applies to specific federal employees and agencies, preserves collective bargaining rights, and supersedes conflicting provisions in other legislation.
