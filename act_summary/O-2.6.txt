This Act repeals outdated legislation relating to the Harbour of Montreal and establishes a new, comprehensive framework for the administration of the port, creating a Port Warden and Deputy Port Wardens appointed through a Board of Examiners. It grants the Port Warden extensive powers to inspect vessels, survey cargo and damages, regulate grain loading, arbitrate disputes, and ensure vessels are seaworthy before departure, with all actions subject to oversight by the Board of Trade and binding legal effect in courts.
