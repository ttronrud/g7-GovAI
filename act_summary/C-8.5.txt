The Canada Petroleum Resources Act establishes a framework for the issuance, management, and surrender of petroleum interests on frontier lands, emphasizing competitive bidding for Crown reserve lands and setting conditions for exploration and production. It provides mechanisms for the Minister to manage access to frontier lands, including the ability to cancel or cancel interests in certain circumstances, and ensures that compensation is provided to interest owners in such cases.
