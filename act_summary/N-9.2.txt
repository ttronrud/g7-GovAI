The National Framework on Cancers Linked to Firefighting Act establishes a national strategy to raise awareness of cancer risks among firefighters, improve prevention and treatment access, and promote research and data collection through a framework developed with stakeholder input. It mandates the Minister of Health to publish a report on the framework within one year and evaluate its effectiveness within five years, while designating January as "Firefighter Cancer Awareness Month."
