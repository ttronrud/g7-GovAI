The Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19) temporarily suspends or extends time limits and periods related to court proceedings and administrative actions during a specified pandemic-related period to ensure fairness and practicality amid the impacts of COVID-19, without affecting investigations of offences or periods set by the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. The suspensions or extensions are limited to six months, may have retroactive effect, and must be published and tabled in Parliament, with specific provisions to ensure legal certainty and respect for the rule of law.
