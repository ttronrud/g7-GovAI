The International Rapids Power Development Act approves a 1951 agreement between Canada and Ontario to develop hydroelectric power in the International Rapids Section of the St. Lawrence River, subject to the Boundary Waters Treaty, and grants Ontario authority to construct, operate, and maintain the project, with shared responsibilities for navigation, environmental protection, and dispute resolution through arbitration. The Act establishes the framework for land transfers, compensation, and cooperation between the governments, including provisions for navigation, power sharing, and joint oversight.
