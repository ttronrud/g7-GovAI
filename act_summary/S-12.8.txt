The Soldier Settlement Act provides for the acquisition, settlement, and distribution of agricultural land in Canada to veterans of World War II, establishing a framework for the Board (now the Director of Soldier Settlement) to purchase land compulsorily or by agreement, grant free soldier grants to eligible settlers, and sell land to settlers under specific conditions, including payment terms and acreage limits. It also outlines the rights of settlers, the valuation of land, and provisions for training, instruction, and support for successful farming.
