The Weather Modification Information Act requires individuals or corporations proposing to conduct weather modification activities in Canada to submit detailed information and obtain written notification to the Administrator before carrying out such activities. It also mandates the maintenance of daily records and monthly reports on the activity, with the Administrator having the authority to inspect records and make information public, and imposes penalties for non-compliance.
