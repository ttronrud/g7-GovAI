The Public Service Modernization Act modernizes Canada’s public service framework by amending key legislation, replacing the term "public service of Canada" with "federal public administration," and introducing changes to labour relations and employment rules, all while specifying transitional provisions and phased implementation dates. The Act ensures that these changes are treated as terminology updates, not new laws, and sets conditions for when various provisions come into force.
