The Canada Student Loans Act establishes the framework for providing guaranteed student loans to qualifying Canadian citizens or permanent residents attending post-secondary education, including eligibility criteria, loan limits, interest policies (with no interest payable after April 1, 2023), repayment terms, and provisions for loan forgiveness and death or disability. It also outlines the roles of provincial authorities, the Minister of Employment and Social Development, and the mechanisms for loan administration, allocation, and financial oversight.
