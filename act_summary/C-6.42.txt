The Canada–Israel Tax Convention Act, 2016 implements a tax treaty between Canada and Israel to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital gains, defining rules for residency, permanent establishments, business profits, dividends, and tax treatment of various types of income. The Convention applies to residents of either country and establishes specific limitations on tax rates, particularly for dividends, while ensuring that tax rules are consistent with the domestic laws of both countries.
