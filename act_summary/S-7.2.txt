The Security Screening Services Commercialization Act establishes a framework for the commercialization of aviation security screening in Canada by designating a body corporate (the designated screening authority) to oversee and manage screening services at designated aerodromes, with strict regulations on certification, charges, transparency, and compliance with aviation security standards. It ensures that screening services are provided efficiently and fairly, with charges set in accordance with specific principles, subject to review by the Canadian Transportation Agency and approval by the Minister of Transport when necessary.
