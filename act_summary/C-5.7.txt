The Canada Fund for Africa Act establishes a program to provide financial contributions to eligible foreign entities that carry out activities promoting the objectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, particularly those outlined in the Africa Action Plan and supported by the Group of Eight. The Minister determines eligibility and can enter into agreements to fund these activities, with regulations set by the Governor in Council to govern the program.
