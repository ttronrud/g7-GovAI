The Canada–Armenia Tax Convention Act, 2004 implements a double taxation avoidance agreement between Canada and Armenia, establishing rules for the taxation of income and capital gains, defining residency, permanent establishments, and tax treatment of dividends, profits, and international business activities. It ensures that income is not taxed twice and provides mechanisms for resolving tax disputes and allocating profits to permanent establishments in a fair and consistent manner.
