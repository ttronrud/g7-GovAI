The Canada-Mexico Tax Information Exchange Convention Act, 1991 establishes a legal framework for the exchange of tax-related information between Canada and Mexico to combat fiscal evasion and fraud, covering federal taxes such as income, employment, and asset taxes, while ensuring compliance with national laws, protecting confidentiality, and allowing mutual cooperation through automatic and requested information sharing. The Convention enters into force on a specified date and remains in effect until terminated by either country with at least three months' notice.
