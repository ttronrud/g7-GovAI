The Public Service Employment Act establishes a merit-based, non-partisan, and inclusive public service in Canada, ensuring accountability, transparency, and equity in appointments and employment practices. It vests appointment authority in the Public Service Commission, which can delegate it to deputy heads, while maintaining oversight and safeguards to promote fairness, diversity, and integrity across the federal public service.
