The Poverty Reduction Act establishes a national framework to reduce poverty in Canada by setting ambitious targets—20% below 2015 levels by 2020 and 50% below by 2030—and creating the National Advisory Council on Poverty to provide expert advice, monitor progress, and report annually on poverty reduction efforts using the Official Poverty Line and additional metrics. The Act mandates the development and implementation of a poverty reduction strategy by the Minister and ensures accountability through parliamentary reporting and periodic review of poverty metrics.
