The Export and Import Permits Act establishes frameworks for controlling the export and import of goods and technology in Canada, allowing the Governor in Council to create lists such as the Export Control List, Import Control List, Area Control List, and Brokering Control List based on national security, economic protection, and international commitments. It enables restrictions on trade to protect domestic industries, ensure strategic supply chains, and prevent harm to Canadian producers, with specific provisions for review, extension, and transparency.
