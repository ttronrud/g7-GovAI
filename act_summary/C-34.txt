The Competition Act establishes a framework to promote and maintain fair competition in Canada by ensuring efficient markets, protecting consumers, supporting small businesses, and preventing anti-competitive practices, while defining key terms and outlining the powers of the Commissioner of Competition to investigate and enforce compliance. It also sets out procedures for public inquiries into market conditions and provides mechanisms for gathering evidence, including the ability to compel testimony and production of records from individuals and corporations.
