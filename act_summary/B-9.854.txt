The Budget Implementation Act, 2005, implements various fiscal measures, including direct payments to provinces, territories, and Indigenous organizations for specific purposes such as environmental sustainability, Indigenous healing, and addressing natural resource challenges like the mountain pine beetle infestation. It also establishes funding for initiatives like the Northern Strategy and the Green Municipal Fund, with payments made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund upon ministerial requisition.
