The Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park Act establishes a marine park in the Saguenay River and St. Lawrence estuary to protect its ecosystems for present and future generations, while allowing for educational, recreational, and scientific use. It defines four types of zones, outlines management responsibilities shared between Canada and Quebec, and provides for public participation, enforcement powers, and strict penalties for violations.
