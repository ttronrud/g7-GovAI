The Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act establishes the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) as a civilian intelligence agency responsible for protecting Canada’s national security, with strict adherence to the rule of law and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It outlines the structure, powers, reporting requirements, and oversight mechanisms for CSIS, including limits on data collection, employee management, and mandatory consultation with the Deputy Minister and the Review Agency.
