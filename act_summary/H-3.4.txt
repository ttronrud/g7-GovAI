The Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act establishes a framework to conserve and protect Canada’s heritage lighthouses by designating them, preventing unauthorized alterations or disposals, requiring reasonable maintenance, and ensuring public access and purpose. It sets out specific criteria, public consultation processes, and restrictions on transfers, sales, and demolitions to safeguard their cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance.
