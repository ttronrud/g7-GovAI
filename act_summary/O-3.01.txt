The Official Languages Act ensures the equal status and use of English and French in all federal institutions, including Parliament, courts, and public services, and promotes the vitality of both official language communities, particularly French-speaking minorities, through language rights, accessibility, and strategic government action. It establishes clear duties for federal institutions to provide services, publications, and judicial proceedings in both official languages and supports efforts to restore and strengthen French linguistic communities across Canada.
