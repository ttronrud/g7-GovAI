The Pest Control Products Act establishes a scientifically based federal regulatory framework to ensure that pest control products pose acceptable risks to human health and the environment, prioritizing safety, sustainability, and public participation while supporting innovative, low-risk pest management strategies. It requires that only products with demonstrated efficacy and acceptable health and environmental risks be registered, with special consideration given to vulnerable populations and cumulative exposures.
