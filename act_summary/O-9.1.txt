The Olympic (1976) Act authorizes the issuance of commemorative silver and gold coins and special stamps to fund and promote the 1976 Summer Olympic Games in Canada, establishes a dedicated Olympic Account to manage proceeds, and allows a regulated lottery to raise funds for the Games and amateur sport, while protecting the Olympic Corporation’s intellectual property and ensuring financial accountability. It also prohibits unauthorized use of Olympic marks and mandates reporting on costs and sales.
