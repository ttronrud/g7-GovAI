The Financial Institutions Depositors Compensation Act provides for the compensation of depositors in certain financial institutions (Canadian Commercial Bank, CCB Mortgage Investment Corporation, or Northland Bank) for deposits held prior to September 2, 1985, up to the amount not insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, with payments made in two installments and subject to specific conditions, including set-offs and security interests. The Act also establishes a framework for dispute resolution, assigns rights to Her Majesty in right of Canada upon payment, and authorizes the Minister and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation to manage the administration of payments through regulations and agreements.
