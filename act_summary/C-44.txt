The Canada Business Corporations Act establishes the legal framework for the incorporation, operation, and governance of business corporations in Canada, promoting uniformity and reforming corporate law to facilitate the orderly transfer of federal companies. It defines key terms such as affiliates, directors, shareholders, and securities, outlines requirements for incorporation, and sets out rules on voting, share issuance, and corporate conduct.
