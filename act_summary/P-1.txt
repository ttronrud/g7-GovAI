The *Parliament of Canada Act* ensures the continuity of Parliament after the demise of the Crown, preserves the privileges and immunities of the Senate and House of Commons as they existed under the UK Parliament, and provides comprehensive protections for parliamentary proceedings, including immunity from civil or criminal liability for reports, votes, and proceedings published by or under the authority of either House. It also establishes the Senate Ethics Officer to oversee member conduct, grants the Senate Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration broad powers over Senate finances and operations, and ensures judicial immunity and procedural safeguards for parliamentary activities.
