The Prohibition of International Air Services Act allows the Canadian government to prohibit certain air services between Canada and a state that is deemed in default—defined as failing to extradite, prosecute, or return individuals or aircraft involved in unlawful acts on board an aircraft in flight—by restricting operations, flights, and landings involving those states. Violations of such prohibitions are punishable by a fine of up to $25,000.
