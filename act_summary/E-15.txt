The Excise Tax Act establishes definitions and rules related to excise taxes, including provisions on manufacturers, importers, and taxable goods such as cosmetics, motor vehicles, and tobacco products, and includes specific rules on when goods are deemed produced in Canada. It also imposes a tax on individuals or entities entering into insurance contracts with foreign insurers or through foreign agents, and includes provisions on related persons, arm's length dealings, and retroactive application of municipal determinations.
