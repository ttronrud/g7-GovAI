The Customs Tariff Act establishes the framework for Canada's customs duties and tariff treatments, defining key international trade agreements, countries, and classification rules, and outlines procedures for amending tariff provisions and rates in response to trade agreements, international obligations, or policy changes. It ensures consistent application of tariff rules, including the use of the Harmonized System, and provides mechanisms for adjusting duties based on trade commitments or compensatory measures.
