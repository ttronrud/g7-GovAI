The Government Employees Compensation Act provides compensation to federal employees and their dependants for personal injuries resulting from work-related accidents or industrial diseases, ensuring they receive the same benefits as private-sector workers in their province of usual employment. It also establishes procedures for claims against third parties, recovery of differences in compensation, and funding mechanisms, while extending coverage to employees working outside Canada and defining dependants to include common-law partners and certain parents of children.
