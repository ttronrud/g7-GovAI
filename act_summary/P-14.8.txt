The Plant Protection Act establishes a framework to protect Canada’s plant life and agricultural sectors by preventing the introduction, spread, and establishment of pests through strict controls on imports, exports, movement, and inspection of plants and related materials. It empowers inspectors to enforce these measures, including seizing, quarantining, or destroying infested items, declaring infested areas, and requiring compliance with reporting and documentation requirements.
