The Bretton Woods and Related Agreements Act enables Canada to become a member of key international financial institutions—such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and others—and establishes the legal framework for Canada to accept their agreements, fulfill its obligations, and receive financial support from them. It grants the Minister of Finance broad powers to provide financial assistance, manage Canada’s participation in these institutions, and ensure the stability of the Canadian dollar within the global monetary system.
