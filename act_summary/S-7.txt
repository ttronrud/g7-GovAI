The Security Offences Act grants the Attorney General of Canada exclusive authority to conduct proceedings for offences that threaten Canada's security or involve internationally protected persons, allowing the federal government to step in even when such offences occur in a province. It also establishes procedures for issuing a fiat to assert this authority, ensures the fiat is admissible in court, and assigns primary responsibility to RCMP peace officers for enforcing these offences, with provisions for inter-provincial cooperation and a mandatory review by a parliamentary committee.
