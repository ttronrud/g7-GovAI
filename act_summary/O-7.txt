The Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act establishes a regulatory framework for the safe, environmentally responsible, and economically efficient exploration, drilling, production, and transportation of oil and gas in designated onshore and offshore areas of Canada, emphasizing safety, environmental protection, accountability, and navigation safety. It requires operators to hold operating licences or authorizations, imposes conditions on pipeline operations and abandonment, and grants the Canadian Energy Regulator broad powers to ensure compliance, conduct impact assessments, and manage resource development.
