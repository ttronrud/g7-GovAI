The Railway Belt and Peace River Block Act of 1930 re-transfers certain Crown lands previously granted by British Columbia to Canada in exchange for railway construction funding back to the Province, with provisions for provincial administration, retention of key federal interests (such as wharves, national parks, and Indian reserves), and continued annual payments to the Province. It also establishes Canada’s exclusive legislative authority over national parks within the area and ensures the preservation of historic sites and bird sanctuaries.
