The Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act establishes a framework for federal payments to provinces to support provincial revenues and stabilize fiscal conditions, including equalization payments, revenue stabilization payments, and adjustments for post-secondary education expenses, all calculated based on provincial population, revenue rates, and specific fiscal criteria. These payments are made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and are designed to ensure equitable distribution of financial resources among provinces.
