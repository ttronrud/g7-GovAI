The Interest Act establishes maximum limits on interest rates, particularly in mortgage and hypothec agreements on immovable property, and requires clear disclosure of annual interest rates when interest is calculated on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. It prohibits excessive interest, fines, or penalties on arrears, and provides mechanisms for recovery of improperly charged amounts, with specific provisions for corporate and prescribed mortgages that may be exempt or regulated by government.
