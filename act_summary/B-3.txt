The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act establishes the legal framework for bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings in Canada, defining key terms such as bankrupt, debtor, creditor, and property, and outlining the rights and responsibilities of individuals, corporations, and creditors during insolvency. It also sets out procedures for bankruptcy orders, assignments, proposals, and the appointment of trustees, while ensuring that all parties act in good faith throughout the process.
