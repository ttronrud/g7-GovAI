This act ratifies and confirms an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of New Brunswick concerning the transfer of rights and interests in Indian reserve lands, confirming all land grants except those involving minerals—now deemed the property of New Brunswick—and establishing a framework for resolving disputes over land surrenders, including mechanisms for purchase, arbitration, and the handling of mineral rights. The agreement ensures that in the event of a band's extinction, rights are restored to New Brunswick, and all mineral revenues are paid to the relevant Indigenous band.
