The Quarantine Act establishes comprehensive measures to protect public health by preventing the introduction and spread of communicable diseases into Canada. It authorizes screening, health assessments, medical examinations, and detention of travellers and conveyances when there is a risk of disease transmission, with provisions for oversight, review, and coordination with public health authorities.
