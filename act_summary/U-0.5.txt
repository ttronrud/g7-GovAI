The Underused Housing Tax Act imposes a tax on owners of residential property in Canada who are not excluded owners, calculated as 1% of either the fair market value or taxable value of the property, multiplied by the owner’s ownership percentage, if the property is not suitable for year-round use. The tax applies to owners who do not meet specific exclusions, such as those in trusts, partnerships, or certain public or charitable entities, and must be paid by April 30 of the following calendar year.
