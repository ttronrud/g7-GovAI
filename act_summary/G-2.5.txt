The Genetic Non-Discrimination Act prohibits individuals and organizations from requiring or refusing services, contracts, or activities based on a person’s refusal to undergo a genetic test or disclose genetic test results. It also bans the collection, use, or disclosure of genetic test results without written consent, with exceptions for health care practitioners and research activities.
