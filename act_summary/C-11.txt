The Canada Water Act establishes a comprehensive framework for the management of water quality and resources across Canada, emphasizing cooperation between the federal government and provincial governments to address growing demands and pollution threats. It authorizes the creation of water quality management agencies to develop and implement programs aimed at restoring, maintaining, and improving water quality through research, planning, data collection, and regulation.
