The Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act establishes a not-for-profit foundation to provide funding to eligible Canadian entities for projects that develop and demonstrate sustainable technologies, including those addressing climate change and environmental quality. The foundation is governed by a board of directors and members, who are selected to reflect diversity in expertise, region, and sector, and it operates independently of federal government administration.
