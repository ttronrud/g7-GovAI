The Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Act enables the Governor in Council to amend the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order to reflect the enrolment outcomes agreed upon in the 2008 and 2013 agreements, including adding or removing individuals from the band’s schedule based on eligibility criteria, without granting any compensation for omissions or removals. The Act upholds the original agreement between the Government of Canada and the Federation of Newfoundland Indians to recognize and formally establish the Qalipu Mi’kmaq Band under the Indian Act.
