The College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act establishes a regulatory body to oversee immigration and citizenship consultants, ensuring public protection through qualification standards, professional conduct, continuing education, and disciplinary measures. It grants the College the authority to issue licences, investigate misconduct, and enforce compliance, while providing immunity from liability for actions taken in good faith during its regulatory functions.
