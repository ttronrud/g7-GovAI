The Reduction of Recidivism Framework Act establishes a federal framework to reduce recidivism by requiring the Minister of Public Safety to develop and implement evidence-based programs, promote reintegration through employment and resources, support community and faith-based initiatives, and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. It mandates the publication of a comprehensive report within one year and annual assessments thereafter to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.
