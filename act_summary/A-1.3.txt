The Addition of Lands to Reserves and Reserve Creation Act allows the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, at a First Nation’s request, to set apart lands in Canada as reserves, subject to certain interests or rights, and provides mechanisms for designating, granting, or permitting those rights, including continuity from prior agreements. It also ensures continuity of rights and processes from previous settlement acts, such as those related to Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, when reserves were not established by the time of the Act’s coming into force.
