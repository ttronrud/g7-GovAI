The National Security Act, 2017 establishes a new framework for Canada’s national security and intelligence activities by creating the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA) and the Intelligence Commissioner, replacing previous oversight bodies while ensuring accountability, transparency, and respect for Canadian rights and freedoms. The Act ensures a smooth transition of responsibilities, personnel, and assets from the former agencies, with continuity of functions, legal rights, and ongoing oversight to maintain public trust.
