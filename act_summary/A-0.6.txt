The Accessible Canada Act establishes a comprehensive framework to eliminate barriers to accessibility across key areas of Canadian life, aiming to create a barrier-free society by January 1, 2040, with a focus on employment, transportation, technology, and public services. It creates the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization to develop and promote accessibility standards, while empowering the Accessibility Commissioner to enforce compliance and ensure equitable participation for persons with disabilities.
