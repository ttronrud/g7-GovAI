The Fisheries Act establishes a framework for the sustainable management and conservation of Canada's fisheries, including the protection of fish habitats and the prevention of pollution, while recognizing the rights of Indigenous peoples and promoting cooperation between federal, provincial, and Indigenous governments. It empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to regulate fishing activities, issue licences and leases, and implement measures to maintain fish stocks at sustainable levels, with provisions for public consultation, Indigenous knowledge, and environmental and cultural considerations.
