The National Ribbon Skirt Day Act designates January 4 each year as National Ribbon Skirt Day to honor Indigenous women, recognize the cultural and spiritual significance of the ribbon skirt, and promote awareness of Indigenous cultures, traditions, and rights. This day celebrates Indigenous identity, connection to Mother Earth, and the importance of decolonization and cultural preservation.
