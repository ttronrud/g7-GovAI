The Seized Property Management Act authorizes the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to manage, dispose of, and share proceeds from forfeited or seized property related to designated offences, proceeds of crime, or offence-related property, and establishes a framework for sharing those proceeds with participating law enforcement agencies and provincial governments. It also grants the Minister powers to provide services to law enforcement, manage property, and enter into agreements for the reciprocal sharing of proceeds with foreign governments.
