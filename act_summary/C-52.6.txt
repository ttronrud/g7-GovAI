The Customs Act establishes the legal framework for Canada's customs administration, defining key terms and responsibilities related to imports, exports, duties, and international trade agreements, primarily administered by the Canada Border Services Agency. It outlines definitions for goods, tariff treatment, free trade agreements, and procedures for customs enforcement, release, and compliance.
