This act allows the Governor in Council to grant Mr. Justice Donald Raymond Morand an immediate annuity equivalent to what he would have received under the Judges Act at age 65, if he resigns as a judge to become Ombudsman of Ontario, provided the Government of Ontario agrees to reimburse Canada for the annuity and related benefits during the period he serves as Ombudsman. The annuity is deemed to have been granted under section 23 of the Judges Act, and the reimbursement agreement is a prerequisite for the grant.
