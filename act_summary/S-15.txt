The Special Import Measures Act establishes the framework for investigating and addressing dumping and subsidizing of imported goods, allowing Canada to impose countervailing or anti-dumping duties when such practices cause or threaten material injury to domestic industries. It defines key terms such as dumping, subsidies, injury, and domestic industry, and outlines procedures for complaints, investigations, and remedies through the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.
