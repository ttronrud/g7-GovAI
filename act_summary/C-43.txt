The Corporations Returns Act requires certain corporations in Canada to file annual returns with the Chief Statistician of Canada, detailing information about their ownership, financial statements, directors, officers, and transactions involving technology transfers from non-residents. The Act applies to corporations meeting specific revenue, asset, or foreign ownership thresholds and includes provisions for confidentiality, penalties for non-compliance, and the publication of anonymized statistical summaries.
