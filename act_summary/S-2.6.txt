This Act establishes that the St. Regis Band of Indians can retain and manage certain islands in the St. Lawrence River—such as Lewis, Snyder, Thompson/Macmaster, Thomas/Hamilton, and the Easterbrook farm—without requiring individual member consent, allowing the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to grant leases or concessions for tourism or agriculture in the best interest of the band. It also prohibits unauthorized use or removal of trees or vegetation from these islands, with penalties for violations.
