The Gender Equality Week Act designates the fourth week of September each year as Gender Equality Week in Canada, aiming to increase awareness of Canadian women's contributions, address gender-based challenges, and promote inclusiveness and equality for all, including women of minority gender identity and expression. The Act encourages all levels of society to engage in events and initiatives during the week to celebrate women's achievements and advance gender equality.
