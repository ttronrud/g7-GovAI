The Secure Air Travel Act establishes a framework for enhancing aviation security in Canada by allowing the Minister of Public Safety to create a list of individuals suspected of threatening transportation security, enabling air carriers to collect and share passenger information, and granting authorities the power to deny travel or require screening of listed persons. It includes strict rules on data retention, disclosure, and privacy, with provisions for appeals and oversight to ensure accountability.
