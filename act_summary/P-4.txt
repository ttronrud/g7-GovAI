The Patent Act establishes the framework for granting and administering patents in Canada, defining key terms such as invention, filing date, claim date, and patentee, and outlining the responsibilities of the Commissioner of Patents. It also provides for public inspection of patent applications and documents after a 18-month confidentiality period, allows for the use of electronic submissions, and grants the Governor in Council broad powers to make regulations governing patent procedures, fees, and administrative matters.
