The Canada Infrastructure Bank Act establishes a federal corporation, the Canada Infrastructure Bank, to invest in and attract private investment for infrastructure projects in Canada that serve the public interest, such as supporting economic growth and sustainability. The Bank is governed by a board of directors, has specific powers to invest, provide loan guarantees, and conduct research and data collection, while operating with certain exemptions from standard government accountability rules and enjoying financial support from the federal government.
