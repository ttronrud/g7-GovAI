The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, 2002, c. 28, s. 89]

This indicates that the specific act or provision in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **section 89 of chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada in 2002**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Act**: The act or section referenced is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date**: The repeal took effect in **2002**.
- **Legal Authority for Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through **Section 89 of Chapter 28** of the Statutes of Canada for the year 2002. This means that a legislative amendment or act (Chapter 28, 2002) specifically removed or canceled the provisions of the original act.
- **Number of Repeals**: The repeated entries suggest that **multiple provisions or sections** from the original act were repealed, or that the same repeal notice was applied repeatedly — possibly due to a list or compilation error, or because the original act contained numerous provisions that were all repealed by the same section.
- **Implication**: Any legal reference to this act or its provisions is now **invalid or obsolete**. It cannot be cited in current legal practice, judicial decisions, or regulatory frameworks.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or current act** being described here — the entire entry reflects the **repeal of a prior legislative provision**. The detailed content of the original act (such as its purpose, scope, rights, obligations, or definitions) is **not available** because the act itself has been formally removed from the law.

> 🔍 **Note**: In legal databases or legislative registers, such repeated "repealed" entries often appear in lists or indexes when multiple sections of an old statute were removed at once. Without the original act’s name or subject matter, it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of its content — only that it has been repealed.

If you can provide the **name of the original act** or the **subject matter** (e.g., employment, health, land use), I can help identify what it may have been and summarize its historical content before repeal.
