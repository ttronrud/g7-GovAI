**Detailed Summary of the *Addition of Lands to Reserves and Reserve Creation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Addition of Lands to Reserves and Reserve Creation Act* (ALRRA) is a federal legislative instrument designed to provide a clear, modern, and legally robust framework for the **addition of new lands to existing First Nation reserves** or the **creation of new reserves** in Canada. It strengthens the authority of First Nations to request and establish reserves, while ensuring that existing rights, interests, and agreements are properly recognized and preserved in the process.

This Act operates primarily in conjunction with the *Indian Act* and addresses gaps or inconsistencies left by previous legislation—particularly those related to land claims settlements in Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan—by providing a unified legal pathway for reserve creation and land designation.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Definitions**

The Act establishes key legal terms with specific meanings:

- **Band**: Same as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*. Refers to a recognized Indigenous community with a distinct identity and governance structure.

- **First Nation**: Broadened to include not only bands but also Indigenous groups that have entered into **self-government agreements** implemented by an Act of Parliament. This reflects the evolving nature of Indigenous governance and self-determination.

- **Governing Body**: 
  - For a band: the band council (as defined in the *Indian Act*).
  - For a self-governing First Nation: the entity (council, government, or other body) designated in the self-government agreement as having authority to act on behalf of the group.

- **Interest (outside Quebec)**: Any estate, right, or interest in or to land—including easements, servitudes, leases, and licences—defined under the *Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act* (FRPFA).

- **Right (in Quebec)**: A broader term than “interest,” including licences and lessee rights, reflecting provincial legal distinctions.

- **Minister**: The Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations (MCI), the federal official responsible for overseeing relations with Indigenous peoples.

- **Reserve**: Defined as per subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*, meaning a designated area of land set aside for a First Nation under federal jurisdiction.

> *Note*: A section previously cited as being repealed in 2019 (s. 377, c. 29) has been removed, indicating legislative streamlining.

### **2. Power to Set Apart Lands as Reserves**

#### **Section 4 – Minister’s Authority to Create Reserves**
- The **Minister may, by order**, set apart any lands as a reserve **at the request of a First Nation’s governing body**.
- The lands must have:
  - Title vested in **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, or
  - Be under the **administration and control** of the Crown.

> This provision gives First Nations the formal legal mechanism to request reserve land additions or new reserves, with the Minister acting as the administrative gatekeeper.

---

### **3. Continuity of Interests and Rights in Reserves**

#### **Section 4(2) – Continuation of Interests or Rights**
An interest or right in the land (e.g., lease, easement, licence) **survives the creation of a reserve** if one of the following conditions is met:

1. **Agreement with the Crown**:
   - The First Nation and the Crown have entered into an agreement (including claims settlement agreements) that **contemplates the continuation** of the interest/right.
   - The requirement under the agreement has been satisfied.

2. **Granted or Conceded under FRPFA**:
   - The interest/right was formally granted or conceded under the *Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act*.

3. **Granted under Sections 5 or 6**:
   - The interest/right is granted in accordance with provisions in this Act (specifically sections 5 and 6).

> **Effect**: As of the time the lands are set apart as a reserve, such interests or rights are **deemed to exist** in the reserve.

> **Financial Implication**: Any payments made to the Crown as a result of these interests are **deemed to be collected, received, or held for the benefit of the First Nation**—a significant shift in financial accountability that aligns with Indigenous self-governance.

> **Statutory Instruments Act Exemption**: The *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to orders made under this section, meaning these reserve orders are not subject to standard review or publication requirements—ensuring faster and more flexible action.

### **4. Designation of Interests or Rights by First Nations**

#### **Section 5 – First Nation’s Power to Designate Rights**
- If a First Nation requests reserve land, it may **designate** (i.e., formally identify or specify) any interest or right in or to the land—**before or after** the transfer of title or control to the Crown.
- Designations can be:
  - **Conditional** (subject to future conditions)
  - **Unconditional**

> This allows First Nations to **proactively define what rights they wish to retain** in the reserve, including replacing existing interests.

> **Applicability of Indian Act Provisions**: Sections 39.1, 40.1, and 41 of the *Indian Act* apply to such designations, with references to "Minister" being read as referring to the Minister under this Act.

> **Effect upon Acceptance**:
  - When the Minister **accepts** the designation:
    - The Minister may **grant** the designated interest or right to a person or entity.
    - The designation **takes effect** when the lands are set apart as a reserve (under Section 4).
    - If the grant was made **before** the reserve creation, it also takes effect at that time.

> **Deemed Effect under Indian Act**: As of the time the lands are set apart, the designation and any resulting grant are **deemed to have been made under the Indian Act**—ensuring legal continuity and consistency with long-standing Indigenous land laws.

### **5. Permits for Occupancy or Use of Lands**

#### **Section 6 – Minister’s Authority to Issue Permits**
- The Minister may issue a **permit** to a person or entity to:
  - Occupy, use, reside on, or exercise any other right on the land.
- The permit may be for:
  - Up to **one year** (default), or
  - A **longer period** with the **consent of the First Nation’s governing body**.

> Permits can be issued **before** the title or control is transferred to the Crown or **before** the land is formally set apart as a reserve.

> **Effect upon Reserve Creation**:
  - Permits and consents **take effect** when the lands are set apart as a reserve.

> **Deemed Effect under Indian Act**:
  - As of the time of reserve creation, the permit and consent are **deemed to have been issued or given under the Indian Act**—ensuring legal validity and consistency.

> This provision supports transitional arrangements, such as allowing a business or community member to continue operations during the reserve creation process.

### **6. Transfer of Lands to Provincial or Municipal Authorities**

#### **Section 7 – Authorization for Transfer to Provinces or Entities**
- If an **Act of Parliament or provincial legislation** allows a province, municipal authority, or corporation to take or use land **without the consent of the owner**, the Minister may:
  - Authorize the **transfer or grant** of land (or interest) to such entity.
  - Subject to terms prescribed by the Minister.

> This is a significant provision that enables **intergovernmental cooperation** and land use planning, especially in cases where provinces need access to land for infrastructure or development.

> The authorization may be made:
  - Before title/control is transferred to the Crown, or
  - Before the land is set apart as a reserve.

> **Deemed Consent under Indian Act**:
  - Upon reserve creation, the **Governor in Council is deemed to have consented** to the taking or use of the land under **section 35(1) of the Indian Act**.
  - The Minister’s prescribed terms are deemed to have been prescribed under **section 35(3)** of the *Indian Act*.

> This ensures that even though the transfer is made under provincial law, it is **legally valid under the Indian Act framework**, preserving Indigenous rights and governance.

### **7. Special Provisions for Land Exchange Agreements**

#### **Section 8 – Exchange of Lands in Reserve Agreements**
- If a First Nation proposes to **exchange lands within its current reserve** for lands to be set apart as a new reserve:
  - References to the **Governor in Council** in **paragraph 39(1)(c)** and **section 40 of the Indian Act** are to be read as references to the **Minister**, **if**:
    1. The Minister has **approved the terms of the exchange**; and
    2. The **surrender of the exchanged lands** has been assented to by a **majority of electors** of the First Nation (as per subsection 39(1)(b)(iii) of the *Indian Act*).

> This provision ensures that land exchange agreements are **governed by the Minister**, not the Governor in Council, promoting **First Nation autonomy** and **direct participation** in land decisions.

### **8. Retroactive Application to Pre-existing Claims Settlements**

#### **Section 9 – Retroactive Application to
