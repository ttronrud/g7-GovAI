### **Detailed Summary of the *Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act***

The *Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act* is a Canadian federal statute designed to impose a tax on the production revenue derived from petroleum and natural gas in Canada. It establishes a comprehensive framework for calculating, assessing, and taxing the income generated from the production and processing of oil and gas, with specific provisions addressing historical transitions, exemptions, royalty structures, and anti-avoidance rules. Below is a detailed and structured summary of the key components of the Act.

---

## **1. General Overview**

- **Citation**: The Act is known as the *Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act*.
- **Purpose**: To impose a tax on the net production revenue of individuals and corporations engaged in the production of petroleum and natural gas in Canada.
- **Scope**: Applies to production and processing of petroleum and gas *before October 1986*, and to certain royalty payments made in respect of production *before October 1986*.
- **Exclusions**: Does **not apply** to:
  - Production of petroleum or gas after **September 1986**;
  - Processing of petroleum in Canada after **September 1986** beyond the crude oil stage;
  - Royalty payments computed based on production after **September 1986**.

This Act effectively phases out taxation on new production and processing activities after 1986, reflecting a policy shift toward a more modern, market-based approach to energy taxation.

## **2. Key Definitions**

### **(a) Petroleum and Gas**
- **Petroleum**: Includes crude oil and heavy oil from natural reservoirs, as well as liquid or solid hydrocarbons from bituminous sands, oil sands, or oil shale deposits.
- **Gas**: Natural gas or any fluid hydrocarbon (not naturally liquid) recovered from natural reservoirs in Canada.

> *Note: The Act distinguishes between crude oil and heavy oil; heavy oil is included in the definition of petroleum.*

### **(b) Production Revenue**
- Defined as the net amount by which:
  - Total income from eligible sources (pre-1986 production, processing, or royalty payments)  
  exceeds
  - Total allowable deductions and losses from those same sources — under a hypothetical scenario where no other income or deductions are allowed.

This is the **taxable base** for the revenue tax.

### **(c) Taxation Year**
- Determined under the *Income Tax Act*.
- If no defined taxation year exists, it defaults to the period used for accounting purposes.
- **Maximum length**: No taxation year may exceed **53 weeks**.

> *No changes to a taxpayer’s taxation year can be made without written consent from the Minister of National Revenue.*

### **(d) Crown Royalty**
- The amount by which the **aggregate of certain income-related amounts** (e.g., income included in income tax computation, adjustments under sections 69(6) and (7)) exceeds **reimbursements received under section 80.2** of the Income Tax Act.
- This concept is critical in determining the net revenue subject to taxation, as it reflects the **net economic benefit** to the Crown from production.

> *Crown royalty is a key element in calculating the taxable production revenue, especially in cases involving royalty deductions or adjustments.*

### **(e) Approved Recovery Project**
A project qualifying for special treatment under the Act, including:
1. A **water-flood or major expansion** of a water-flood project certified by the **Minister of Natural Resources** after **March 31, 1985**.
2. A **prescribed project** certified by both the **Minister of Finance and the Minister of Natural Resources** as a major energy project, commencing operations after **March 31, 1985**.
3. A **project certified after 1982** (by the Minister of Natural Resources).

> *Each such project may be entitled to an **exempt percentage** (approved in writing) for a specific period.*

### **(f) Deepened Well**
- An oil or gas well that:
  - Was previously capable of producing from an accumulation or was abandoned after being drilled for production,
  - Is then **deepened after March 31, 1985**, for production from a **different accumulation**.

### **(g) New Deep Production**
- The portion of production from a deepened well that is **directly attributable** to the deepening.

> *This allows for a more accurate allocation of revenue and avoids double-counting production from original wells.*

### **(h) Synthetic Production**
- Production of petroleum from a **mine in a bituminous sands deposit** (e.g., oil sands mining).

> *Synthetic production revenue is a distinct category of production revenue and is treated separately.*

## **3. Production Royalty vs. Resource Royalty**

| Feature | **Production Royalty** | **Resource Royalty** |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Timing Basis** | After **December 31, 1981** | After **December 31, 1980 and before January 1, 1982**, or after **December 31, 1981** |
| **Exclusions** | Does **not** include resource royalties or amounts under paragraph 7(e) | Does **not** include amounts where the recipient would have a Crown royalty (based on production or ownership) |
| **Purpose** | Reflects revenue from production post-1981 | Reflects revenue from earlier production periods |

> **Key Exception**: A royalty is **not** considered a resource royalty if the recipient would have a Crown royalty on the same production or ownership — this avoids double taxation.

---

## **4. Taxable Incremental Oil Revenue (Repealed)**

> **Note**: This section was **repealed** in 1985 (R.S., 1985, c. 2 (2nd Supp.), s. 1). It was likely intended to address incremental gains from new production or deepening, but it no longer applies.

---

## **5. Association of Corporations (Anti-Avoidance Rules)**

To prevent tax avoidance through corporate structures, the Act defines when two or more corporations are **treated as associated** for tax purposes:

### **(a) Automatic Association**
- If the corporations are associated under **section 247(2)** of the Income Tax Act.
- If they would be associated under **section 256** of the Income Tax Act, **except** that references to "capital stock" are interpreted as including **equity ownership of at least 10%** in each corporation.

### **(b) Ministerial Deemed Association**
Where the Minister is satisfied that:
- The separate existence of the corporations is **not solely for business efficiency**, and
- A **primary reason** is to **reduce tax liability** under this Act, or
- The corporations have entered into an agreement or transaction with **no substantial business purpose** other than to increase deductions under subsection 10(1) of the Income Tax Act,

→ The corporations are **deemed associated**.

### **(c) Exception for Pension Funds**
If all shares of a corporation are owned by one or more **registered pension plans**, and the corporations would otherwise be associated due to common trusteeship, they are **deemed not associated** — **unless** the separate existence is primarily to reduce tax.

> This encourages investment in pension-owned entities without triggering tax avoidance rules.

### **(d) Appeal Rights**
On appeal to the **Tax Court of Canada**:
- The Court may:
  - **Confirm** the Minister’s direction;
  - **Vacate** the direction if:
    - In case of subsection (7)(a): No main reason to reduce tax;
    - In case of subsection (7)(b): The agreement had a **substantial business purpose** beyond tax reduction;
  - **Vary** the direction and refer it back to the Minister for reassessment.

> This provides judicial oversight to ensure that corporate groupings are not used solely to evade taxation.

## **6. Certification Requirements**

- A project must be **certified by the Minister of Natural Resources** to qualify for special treatment (e.g., exempt percentage or approved recovery project status).
- Certification must be filed **within 180 days** of the project commencing operations.
- **Exception**: If the Minister determines it is **just and equitable**, a request may be filed **after** the deadline — and such a request is deemed filed on the original deadline.

> This ensures timely compliance and prevents retroactive benefits.

## **7. Calculation of Taxable Production Revenue**

This is the **core of the Act** — how the tax base is determined.

> **Taxable production revenue** =  
> (Aggregate of income from pre-1986 production, processing, or royalty payments)  
> −  
> (Aggregate of losses and deductions, under a hypothetical scenario where the taxpayer has no other income or deductions)

### **Sources of Income (Numerator)**
- Production of petroleum or gas **before October 1986**
- Processing of petroleum in Canada **before October 1986** to any stage **not beyond crude oil or equivalent**
- Royalty payments (production or resource) computed based on production **after 1985 and before October 1986**

### **Deductions and Exclusions (Denominator)**

The following are **excluded** from deductions or income computation:
- Any deduction under sections 20, 37, 37.1, 104(6
