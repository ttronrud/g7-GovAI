### **Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act***

---

#### **Overview**

The *Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act* is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation enacted to ensure that Canada’s transition to a **net-zero-emissions economy by 2050** is not only environmentally sound but also **inclusive, equitable, and worker-centered**. It establishes a formal, transparent, and participatory framework for the federal government to create, promote, and support **sustainable jobs**—defined as decent, high-quality, and secure employment compatible with climate action.

The Act builds upon Canada’s commitment under the **Paris Agreement**, its **net-zero emissions goals**, and international labor standards—particularly those of the **International Labour Organization (ILO)**—to ensure that climate policy does not come at the expense of workers, communities, or vulnerable populations.

---

## **Key Context and Background**

1. **Paris Agreement Commitment**  
   Canada ratified the Paris Agreement in 2015, committing to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve **net-zero emissions by 2050**. This Act operationalizes that commitment through a jobs-focused lens.

2. **Recognition of Climate Justice**  
   The Act acknowledges that climate change disproportionately affects marginalized and vulnerable groups—including Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, racialized communities, women, and 2SLGBTQI+ individuals—and that climate mitigation policies must be **inclusive, equitable, and just**.

3. **Economic Opportunity**  
   The Act asserts that a net-zero economy presents significant opportunities for **economic growth**, **good-paying jobs**, and **greater participation of equity-seeking groups** in the labor market.

4. **International Alignment**  
   Canada aligns its approach with the ILO’s **Resolution on Sustainable Development, Decent Work and Green Jobs (2013)** and its associated guidelines, emphasizing that green transitions must uphold **decent work principles**—including fair wages, job security, social protection, and collective bargaining.

5. **Legal Foundations**  
   The Act is grounded in:
   - The **Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act** (which sets the emissions reduction pathway),
   - The **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** (ratified in 2021),
   - The **UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)** (ratified in 2010).
