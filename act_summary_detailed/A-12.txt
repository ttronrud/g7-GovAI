**Detailed Summary of the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act* (AWPPA) is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation enacted to protect the fragile Arctic environment from pollution while enabling the sustainable development and exploitation of natural resources in the Canadian Arctic. It balances economic interests—particularly in resource extraction and shipping—with environmental protection, Indigenous rights, and the long-term ecological integrity of the Arctic region.

The Act applies specifically to the **arctic waters** of Canada, defined as the internal waters, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) within the area bounded by the **60th parallel north**, the **141st meridian west**, and the outer limit of the EEZ—subject to adjustments if the Canada–Greenland border is less than 200 nautical miles from Canada’s baseline.

## **Key Objectives of the Act**

1. **Prevent Pollution in Arctic Waters**  
   The primary goal is to prevent the deposition of waste into arctic waters or onto land in the Canadian Arctic where such waste could enter the water.

2. **Protect the Environment and Inuit Communities**  
   The Act recognizes Canada’s responsibility to protect the ecological balance of the Arctic and to uphold the welfare of Inuit and other Indigenous peoples who live in or near the region.

3. **Ensure Safe and Responsible Shipping**  
   It establishes strict safety and environmental standards for ships navigating the Arctic, including requirements for vessel design, crewing, equipment, and navigation procedures.

4. **Hold Responsible Parties Accountable**  
   The Act imposes strict liability on individuals and entities involved in activities that could lead to pollution, regardless of fault or negligence.

5. **Promote Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement**  
   It provides mechanisms for government oversight, including financial responsibility requirements, reporting obligations, and enforcement powers.

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Arctic Waters** | Internal waters, territorial sea, and EEZ within 60°N to 141°W, adjusted if Canada–Greenland boundary is <200 nautical miles. Does not include inland waters. |
| **Waste** | Any substance that degrades or alters water quality in a way harmful to humans, animals, fish, or plants. Includes substances that, when added to water, would cause such harm. Also includes water altered by heat or processing. |
| **Ship** | Any vessel or boat used or designed for navigation, regardless of propulsion. |
| **Owner** | Includes any person with legal or contractual rights to possession or use of a ship. |
| **Pilot / Ice-breaker** | A licensed pilot under the Pilotage Act or a ship specially designed to navigate through ice. |
| **Pollution Prevention Officer** | A designated official responsible for receiving reports of pollution incidents. |

> **Note**: The Act supersedes any conflict with the *Marine Liability Act*, meaning that if there is a contradiction, the Marine Liability Act takes precedence.

## **Core Provisions and Their Significance**

---

### **1. Prohibition on Waste Deposition (Section 4)**  
> *No person or ship may deposit or permit the deposit of waste in arctic waters or on land in the Canadian Arctic if that waste or resulting waste could enter the arctic waters.*

- **General Rule**: A strict ban on waste disposal in arctic waters or in adjacent land areas where waste could enter the water.
- **Exception**: Waste may be deposited in **water quality management areas** under the *Canada Water Act* if authorized by regulations and meets specific criteria regarding type, quantity, and conditions.
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: The Governor in Council can issue regulations specifying:
  - Types and quantities of waste permitted.
  - Conditions under which waste may be deposited.

> **Purpose**: Prevents contamination of sensitive Arctic ecosystems, which are particularly vulnerable due to low temperatures, slow ecological recovery, and unique species.

---

### **2. Mandatory Reporting Requirements (Section 5)**  
Any person or ship that:
- Deploys waste in violation of Section 4, or  
- Is in distress and at risk of causing such a deposit  

**must immediately report** the incident to a **pollution prevention officer**, using a method and location prescribed by the Governor in Council.

- **Includes**: Ship masters and operators of undertakings (e.g., resource exploration, development).
- **Purpose**: Ensures rapid response to pollution events and enables timely intervention.

---

### **3. Strict Liability for Pollution (Section 6)**  
Persons engaged in activities in or near the Arctic—specifically:

- Exploring, developing, or exploiting natural resources  
- Operating undertakings (e.g., mining, construction)  
- Owners of ships navigating in arctic waters or their cargo owners  

—are **jointly and severally liable** for all **costs, expenses, and actual loss or damage** resulting from a waste deposit caused by their activity.

#### Key Features:
- **Absolute liability**: No need to prove negligence or fault. Liability arises automatically upon a pollution event.
- **Scope of liability**:
  - Covers costs of government action to repair damage (e.g., cleanup).
  - Covers actual loss or damage to individuals or property.
- **Priority of claims**:
  1. **First**: Claims by victims of actual loss/damage (rank equally among themselves).
  2. **Second**: Costs and expenses of government remediation (up to a limit set by regulation).
- **Liability cap**: The maximum amount payable is determined by **regulations under Section 9**, based on the nature of the activity or ship.
- **Exemption for cargo**: A shipowner or cargo owner is **not liable** if the cargo is so inherently safe (in nature and quantity) that its deposition would not constitute a violation of Section 4(1).
- **No liability for contributory conduct**: A person is not liable for losses caused by another party whose conduct contributed to the pollution.

> **Purpose**: Creates a strong financial incentive for responsible behavior and ensures that polluters bear the full cost of harm.

### **4. Financial Responsibility Requirements (Section 7)**  
The Governor in Council may require individuals or entities involved in Arctic activities to provide **evidence of financial responsibility**, such as:

- Insurance policies  
- Indemnity bonds  
- Other forms acceptable to the government  

These must be sufficient to cover potential liabilities under Section 6.

#### Conditions:
- The insurance or bond must allow **direct recovery** of funds from the proceeds to those entitled to claim under Section 6.
- The **limit of liability** is determined by regulations under Section 9 and may vary based on:
  - Size of the ship
  - Nature and quantity of cargo
- For construction or alteration projects, the Governor in Council may require:
  - Copies of plans and specifications
  - Review to determine whether waste deposition would violate Section 4(1)
- If the Governor determines that waste deposition would violate the Act, they may:
  - Require modifications to plans
  - Prohibit the project entirely

> **Purpose**: Ensures that high-risk activities are backed by financial safeguards to protect the environment and public interest.

### **5. Shipping Safety Control Zones (Section 8)**  
The Governor in Council may designate **shipping safety control zones** within the arctic waters.

- These zones are areas where special navigation rules apply.
- Zones can be created, modified, or removed by order.
- A proposed order must be **published in the Canada Gazette** and remain open for **60 days** before being finalized.

> **Purpose**: To manage risks associated with ship traffic in sensitive or hazardous areas.
