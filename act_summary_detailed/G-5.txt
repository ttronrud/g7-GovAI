### **Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Compensation Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Citation**
The **Government Employees Compensation Act** (GEC Act) establishes a comprehensive framework for providing **compensation to federal government employees and their dependants** in cases of workplace injury, occupational disease, or death resulting from such events. The Act ensures that federal employees receive **equivalent benefits** to those available to private-sector workers under provincial workers’ compensation laws, regardless of the nature or type of employment.

It may be cited as the *Government Employees Compensation Act*.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **3. Who Is Entitled to Compensation?**

Employees and their dependants are entitled to compensation if:

- The employee suffers **personal injury** from an accident arising **out of and in the course of employment**, or  
- The employee is **disabled due to an industrial disease** resulting from the nature of their employment.

Similarly, **dependants** of an employee who dies as a result of such an accident or industrial disease are entitled to compensation.

> **Key Principle**: Regardless of the employee’s job type or classification, they are entitled to **the same rate and conditions** as private-sector workers in the province where they are **usually employed**, provided they suffer injuries or die from work-related causes.

---

#### **4. Determination of Compensation**

Compensation is determined by:

- The **same board, officers, or authority** established under provincial workers’ compensation laws, or  
- Such other board, officer, authority, or court as the **Governor in Council** may direct.

> *Note*: A provision (repealed in 1996) previously allowed for appeals to provincial courts — this is no longer in force.

---

#### **5. Payment of Compensation and Costs**

Compensation and related costs are paid from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**. The fund may also provide:

- Direct payments of compensation and costs awarded under the Act;
- **Accountable advances** to compensation boards/officers/authorities to cover anticipated claims;
- Portions of employer contributions (where applicable), in provinces where such contributions are used to fund compensation;
- Funds for rehabilitation efforts (e.g., helping injured workers return to work);
- Advances for administrative expenses deemed fair and reasonable by the Treasury Board.

> This ensures financial stability and operational capacity for compensation bodies.

---

#### **6. Jurisdictional Rules for "Usually Employed" Status**

To determine which provincial workers’ compensation law applies, the Act establishes rules for where an employee is deemed "usually employed":

| Situation | Deemed Employed In |
|---------|--------------------|
| Yukon or Northwest Territories | **Province of Alberta** |
| Nunavut | **Province of Alberta** |
| Outside Canada (non-local employee) | **Province of Ontario** |
| Locally engaged outside Canada | In a place where compensation is paid from a **dedicated fund** (e.g., under local laws); payments may be made to that fund with **Treasury Board approval**. |

> These rules ensure consistency in applying provincial compensation laws across jurisdictions.

---

#### **7. Special Provisions for Employees Working Outside Canada**

The **Minister**, with **Treasury Board approval**, may award compensation to:

- Employees **locally engaged outside Canada** who suffer:
  - Personal injury from an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, or  
  - Disability due to a disease peculiar to or characteristic of their specific trade or occupation.

- And to the **dependants** of such employees, **if they are not otherwise entitled** to compensation under provincial laws.

> This provision fills a gap for workers in international assignments who may not be covered under local laws.

---

#### **8. Regulations on Non-Industrial Diseases and Environmental Diseases**

The **Governor in Council** may make regulations covering:

- Employees disabled or killed by diseases **not classified as industrial diseases**, but still caused by the nature of their work (e.g., specific occupational hazards in a trade or process).
- Employees disabled or killed due to **environmental conditions** in a place outside Canada where they were assigned.

> Compensation is awarded in accordance with these regulations.

---

#### **9. Third-Party Claims and Recovery**

When an employee’s injury or death is caused by a **third party**, the employee or dependants have two options:

1. **Claim compensation under this Act**, or  
2. **Make a claim against the third party**.

> The **election** (choice) between the two is **final and binding**.

##### **If less is recovered from the third party than the compensation owed under the Act:**
- The **difference** is paid directly to the employee or dependants as **additional compensation**.

##### **If the employee or dependants choose to claim under the Act:**

- **Employer subrogation applies**:
  - For employees employed by a **corporation or body prescribed under section 13(1)(b)**: The employer may maintain a claim against the third party in its own name or on behalf of the employee.
  - For employees employed by **other bodies**: **Her Majesty (the Crown)** is subrogated to the rights of the employee or dependants.

> This means the employer or the Crown can pursue recovery from the third party and receive reimbursement.

##### **If more is recovered than the compensation owed:**
- The employer (or Crown) may **retain the excess** after paying its own costs.
- However, **if the employee later becomes entitled to additional compensation** for the same accident, the amount paid earlier may be **deducted** from that additional compensation.

> This prevents double recovery and ensures fair allocation of funds.

---

#### **10. Election and Notice Requirements**

- A parent or guardian may make an election on behalf of a **child** under section 9.
- **Notice of election** must be given:
  - Within **three months** of the accident (or death, in case of fatality), or
  - Within a **longer period** approved by the compensation board, officer, or court.

> This ensures timely processing and prevents delays in claims.

---

#### **11. No Claims Against Her Majesty**

- Employees or dependants **have no claim against Her Majesty or any of her officers, servants, or agents**, except for compensation under this Act.
- No legal action lies against Her Majesty for anything done or omitted under this Act by a corporation or body covered by the Act.

> This protects the Crown from liability and limits exposure.

---

#### **12. Regulatory Authority**

The **Minister of Labour** may make regulations to:

- Define where an employee is “usually employed”;
- Prescribe which corporations or bodies are subject to the Act (e.g., under section 9.1);
- Implement administrative and procedural rules.

> These regulations are subject to **Governor in Council approval**.

> **Transition rules** apply:
- If a corporation stops being prescribed, section 9.1 (third-party recovery) continues to apply for claims filed **before** the regulation takes effect.
- If a body is prescribed, section 9.1 applies even if the regulation comes into force after the election is made.

---

#### **13. Employer Obligations and Financial Responsibility**

The Minister may require employers (corporations or bodies) to:

- Pay a **percentage of payroll** or a specific sum to cover compensation for current injuries;
- Pay a **proportion of administrative expenses**;
- Maintain a **reserve fund** to cover future claims.

> This ensures financial sustainability and prevents claims from overwhelming the government system.

---

#### **14. Additional Expenses for Death Occurring Outside Place of Employment**

If an employee dies in an accident at a location **other than where they are usually employed**, and the **reasonable additional expenses** (e.g., transport, funeral, lodging) exceed the amount of compensation provided under the Act, the Minister (with Treasury Board approval) may pay **any excess** from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

> This protects dependants from financial hardship due to out-of-area deaths.

---

#### **15. Promotion of Safety and Prevention**

The Minister is empowered
