The **Budget Implementation Act, 1995** is a Canadian federal statute enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It serves as a legislative instrument to implement key fiscal and policy changes introduced in the 1995 federal budget, particularly those related to transportation, federal-provincial financial arrangements, and the transition of certain government programs.

Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the Act:

---

### **1. Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is formally titled: **Budget Implementation Act, 1995**.
- It is designed to implement budgetary measures and policy adjustments from the 1995 federal budget, particularly in areas such as transportation, fiscal relations between federal and provincial governments, and the transition of programs.

---

### **2. Commencement of Provisions**
- **Sections 11 to 22** come into force (or are deemed to have come into force) on **August 1, 1995**.
- This means these specific sections are effective from that date, establishing new rules or modifying existing ones in relation to transportation and financial assistance programs.

---

### **3. Repeal of Payments for Certain Freight Assistance Claims**
- **No payments** may be made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** for movements of goods that were eligible for assistance under:
  - The **Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act**, or
  - The **Maritime Freight Rates Act**,
  **if**:
  - The movement **originates after June 30, 1995**, **or**
  - The claim for payment is **made after September 1, 1995**.
- This provision effectively **discontinues or terminates** eligibility for financial assistance for freight-related claims after these dates, signaling a shift in policy or funding priorities in regional transportation.

---

### **4. Transition Payments to Railway Companies (Under Western Grain Transportation Act)**
- The **Minister of Transport** is required to make payments to railway companies for the **crop year beginning August 1, 1994 and ending July 31, 1995**, under the following circumstances:
  - Payments that would have been due under **subsection 56(1) or 57(1)** of the **Western Grain Transportation Act** after **July 31, 1995**, **if the Act had not been repealed**.
  - Payments under **agreements entered into under section 60** of the Western Grain Transportation Act for the same crop year.
- These payments are **not retroactive** but are made to compensate for obligations that would have existed had the Western Grain Transportation Act remained in force.
- **Deadline for payment**: All such payments must be made **no later than October 29, 1995**.
- This provision ensures that railway companies receive compensation for obligations that were lost due to the **repeal of the Western Grain Transportation Act**, providing financial stability during the transition.

---

### **5. Enactment of the Western Grain Transition Payments Act**
- **Schedule II** of the Act contains the **Western Grain Transition Payments Act**, which is formally enacted.
- This new legislation establishes a framework for managing the financial transition of grain transportation responsibilities following the repeal of the Western Grain Transportation Act.
- It likely provides specific rules for:
  - Eligibility of payments,
  - Amounts payable,
  - Recipients (e.g., railway companies, grain producers),
  - Conditions and timelines for claims.

---

### **6. Repeal of a Prior Act (1996)**
- The provision **"Repealed, 1996, c. 11, s. 46.1"** indicates that a prior provision of this Act (or a related section) was **repealed in 1996** by **Bill 11, Chapter 11** of the Statutes of Canada.
- This suggests that some transitional or temporary provisions were no longer needed or were superseded by subsequent legislation.

---

### **7. Amendment of References to the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act**
- Any reference in any **Act, regulation, agreement, or other instrument** to the **Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act** is, **except where the context otherwise requires**, **deemed to be a reference to the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act**.
- This is a **clarification and simplification** of legal references, ensuring consistency in legal language and avoiding confusion between two related but distinct fiscal legislation.
- It streamlines legal documents by aligning references to a single, more comprehensive act.

---

### **8. Expiration of Certain Payments**
- **No payment may be made under the Act after March 31, 1999**.
- This provision sets a **final deadline** for certain financial obligations or claims under the Act.
- It likely applies to transitional payments or ongoing financial mechanisms established under the Act, ensuring that all obligations are settled by the end of 1999.

---

### **9. General Observations and Context**
- The Act reflects a **fiscal restructuring** in the mid-1990s, particularly in transportation and intergovernmental financial relations.
- The repeal of the **Western Grain Transportation Act** and the introduction of a **transition payment mechanism** indicate a shift in federal policy toward more market-based or flexible transportation arrangements, especially in grain handling and transport.
- The timing (August 1995) aligns with the federal government's fiscal and policy reforms during the early 1990s, including efforts to reduce federal spending and restructure transportation subsidies.
- The **repeal of certain freight assistance programs** after June 30, 1995, signals a policy shift toward reducing government support for regional freight, possibly due to economic or administrative efficiency concerns.
