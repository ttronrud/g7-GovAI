## **1. Purpose and Objectives of the Act**

The central purpose of this Act is to **implement the CPTPP** and ensure that Canada fulfills its legal and policy obligations under the Agreement. The objectives of the CPTPP — as reflected in this Act — are comprehensive and multi-dimensional, aiming not only to expand trade but also to promote sustainable and inclusive economic development. These include:

- **Establishing a Free Trade Area**: Creating a region-wide framework for reduced trade barriers among member countries, including Canada.
  
- **Expanding Reciprocal Trade**: Promoting mutual economic growth through expanded trade in goods and services, thereby creating new opportunities for Canadian businesses and consumers.

- **Ensuring Fair Competition**: Establishing transparent, non-discriminatory conditions in trade to prevent unfair practices such as dumping or subsidies that distort markets.

- **Increasing Investment Opportunities**: Facilitating cross-border investment by reducing regulatory barriers and enhancing investor confidence, while preserving each party’s right to regulate for legitimate public policy goals (e.g., environmental, health, or safety concerns).

- **Eliminating Trade Barriers**: Removing or reducing tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services, contributing to broader regional and global trade integration.

- **Supporting SMEs**: Enhancing access for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to international markets by improving their ability to participate in and benefit from trade opportunities.

- **Strengthening Environmental Standards**: Enforcing and enhancing Canada’s environmental laws and regulations, and promoting cooperation on environmental protection, climate change, and sustainable resource management.

- **Protecting Workers’ Rights**: Upholding and advancing core labor standards such as fair wages, safe working conditions, freedom of association, and the right to collective bargaining. The Act emphasizes cooperation on labor issues and builds on existing international commitments.

- **Promoting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Encouraging businesses to act responsibly in areas such as human rights, gender equality, cultural identity, diversity, Indigenous rights, inclusive trade, and sustainable development.
