**Detailed Summary of the Act: "The Children’s Special Allowances Act" (as enacted in 1993)**

This legislative instrument, enacted by Her Majesty in Canada with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, represents a significant reform in the Canadian government’s approach to child-related financial support. It formally **repeals the Family Allowances Act** and **introduces the Children’s Special Allowances Act** as its successor, with a clear transition mechanism to ensure continuity and fairness in payments to eligible families.

### **1. Enactment and Effective Date**

- The **Children’s Special Allowances Act** is enacted as set out in the attached schedule.
- **Section 1** (the core provisions of the new Act) comes into force on **January 1, 1993**.
- **Sections 24 to 26** (specific provisions related to administrative or transitional matters) also come into force on **January 1, 1993**.

This date marks the official start of the new legal framework governing special allowances for children.

### **2. Transition from the Family Allowances Act**

To ensure that no family is disadvantaged during the transition, the Act establishes a **clear and equitable continuity of benefits**:

#### **(a) Deemed Application Under the New Act**
- Any **department, agency, or institution** that had previously applied under the *Family Allowances Act* for a special allowance in respect of a child is **deemed to have applied under the new Children’s Special Allowances Act** from and after January 1, 1993.
- This ensures that existing applications are not invalidated or lost due to the change in legislation.

#### **(b) Continuity of Payment Amounts**
- If a special allowance was payable **during a period when the Family Allowances Act was still in force**, the amount of the allowance for that period **shall be the same as it would have been under the old Act**.
- This provision **overrides Section 8 of the Children’s Special Allowances Act**, which might otherwise impose different payment rules. This is a critical safeguard to prevent a reduction in benefits for families during the transition period.

> In essence: **No family loses out financially** because of the change in law — past payments are preserved as they were under the previous system.

#### **(c) Deemed Approval of Payments**
- Any department, agency, or institution that **received a special allowance under the Family Allowances Act on the day it was repealed** (i.e., January 1, 1993) is **deemed to have had that payment approved under the new Children’s Special Allowances Act** on the same day.
- This ensures that existing entitlements are recognized under the new law, maintaining legal validity and administrative consistency.

### **3. Repeal of the Family Allowances Act**

- The **Family Allowances Act is formally repealed** as of January 1, 1993.
- This marks the **end of a long-standing piece of legislation** that had governed child benefit programs in Canada since the 1940s.

> The repeal is not merely symbolic — it reflects a structural shift in how the government administers child allowances, with the new Children’s Special Allowances Act providing a more modern, streamlined, and potentially more equitable system.

### **4. Prohibition on Post-1993 Payments Under the Old Act**

- **No payment** under subsection 3(1) of the *Family Allowances Act* (which would have covered claims for special allowances) shall be made **after 1993**.
- This means that the old Act **cannot be used to justify or process any new claims after January 1, 1993**.
- This provision ensures that the transition is **final and irreversible**, preventing retroactive or continued use of outdated rules.

---

### **5. Effective Provisions of the New Act**

- Subsections (1) and (2) of the new Act (likely referring to key transitional or administrative provisions) come into force on **January 1, 1993**.
- These provisions likely govern the **application process, eligibility criteria, payment procedures, and administrative responsibilities** under the new law.
