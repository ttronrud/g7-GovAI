### **Critical Observations and Contextual Clarifications**

- ❌ **This Act does not exist in current Canadian law.**  
  As of now, there is **no official Act of Parliament** titled the *National Symbol of Canada Act* in force in Canada. Canada does not have a standalone law that formally designates the beaver as a national symbol through legislative enactment.

- ✅ **The Beaver is a widely recognized national symbol in Canada**  
  While not enshrined in a formal act of Parliament, the **beaver is commonly regarded as a national symbol** in Canadian culture. It appears in:
  - The **Canadian coat of arms** (as part of the crest, where a beaver is depicted in a field of red and white)
  - The **Canadian flag** (the beaver is not directly on the flag, but the national motto "Canada, the land of the beaver" is sometimes referenced)
  - Governmental and educational materials
  - National identity and environmental campaigns

- ✅ **The Canadian Coat of Arms includes a beaver**  
  The beaver is part of the **crest of the Canadian coat of arms**, which features a **beaver on a red field**. This is a longstanding tradition dating back to the 19th century, when the beaver was chosen as a symbol of Canada’s early economy (due to the fur trade). The beaver is not a standalone national symbol in a legal sense, but rather a component of a broader national emblem.

- ❌ **Misstatement about Sovereignty**  
  The Act states that the beaver “is a symbol of the sovereignty of Canada.” While the beaver is culturally symbolic, **sovereignty is a constitutional and political concept**, not one that can be formally assigned to a living animal through legislation. Such a statement would be legally and politically inappropriate.

- ❌ **Misuse of "Her Majesty in right of Canada"**  
  The phrase "used by Her Majesty in right of Canada" implies a formal, legal use of the beaver by the Crown. However, the Crown does not "use" the beaver as a symbol in a legislative sense. The beaver is a part of the national emblem, and its use is governed by heraldic and constitutional conventions, not by a standalone Act.

- 📚 **Official Recognition of Symbols in Canada**  
  Canada does not have a formal "national symbol" law. Instead, the **Canadian flag**, **national anthem**, and **coat of arms** are recognized through constitutional and ceremonial frameworks. The **Canadian flag** features a red field with a white square containing a red maple leaf, which is the primary national symbol.

### **Conclusion**

The text presented as the *National Symbol of Canada Act* appears to be a **hypothetical or draft proposal**, possibly created for educational or illustrative purposes. It misrepresents the legal and historical status of the beaver in Canada.

**Accurate Summary:**

- The **beaver** is a **cultural and historical symbol** of Canada, particularly due to its role in the fur trade and its presence in the Canadian coat of arms.
- It is **not officially recognized as a national symbol by law** through a standalone Act.
- The idea that the beaver symbolizes the **sovereignty of Canada** is a **cultural interpretation**, not a legal or constitutional designation.
- Canada’s national symbols are formally recognized through **heraldic tradition and constitutional convention**, not through legislative acts naming animals as symbols of sovereignty.

Therefore, while the beaver holds deep cultural significance, the proposed Act as written is **not valid or in force** under current Canadian law.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
Any future legislation regarding national symbols in Canada should be grounded in constitutional principles, cultural heritage, and public consultation, and should avoid attributing political sovereignty to natural entities such as animals.
