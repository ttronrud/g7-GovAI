**Detailed Summary of the Holidays Act**

The *Holidays Act* is a legislative framework that establishes and defines specific legal holidays observed throughout Canada. This Act provides clear, uniform rules for the observance of national holidays, ensuring consistency across all provinces and territories. The key provisions of the Act are as follows:

---

- **Date**: July 1 is designated as a legal holiday.  
- **Observance**: If July 1 falls on a day that is not a Sunday, it is observed as **Canada Day** nationwide.  
- **Exception for Sunday**: If July 1 coincides with a Sunday, the holiday is **not observed on July 1**. Instead, the following day — **July 2** — is declared a legal holiday and observed as **Canada Day**.  
- **Purpose**: This provision ensures that Canada Day is always observed on a weekday, allowing for public celebrations, events, and participation without disruption to regular work schedules.  
- **National Significance**: Canada Day commemorates the anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1867 and is a major national holiday celebrating Canadian identity, culture, and unity.

- **Observance**: This day is observed nationwide under the name **"Remembrance Day"**.

- **Date**: The holiday is observed on the **first Monday in May** that occurs **before May 25**.  
- **Observance**: This day is known as **Victoria Day** and is a legal holiday across Canada.

- **Purpose**: It is a day of celebration, with public events, parades, fireworks, and outdoor festivities. It is often associated with summer activities and family gatherings.  
- **Note**: The holiday is observed on the **first Monday of May**, meaning the date varies each year (e.g., May 15, 22, or 29). It is not fixed on May 25, but rather on the nearest Monday before that date.  
- **National Significance**: Victoria Day serves as a unifying celebration of Canadian heritage, outdoor recreation, and national pride.

**Key Features of the Act:**

- **Uniformity**: The Act ensures that all Canadians, regardless of province or territory, observe these holidays on the same dates and under the same names, promoting national cohesion.  
- **Flexibility**: The rules for Canada Day and Victoria Day include adjustments based on the day of the week (e.g., moving to July 2 if July 1 is a Sunday), ensuring the holiday is always observed on a weekday.  
- **Historical and Cultural Significance**: Each holiday reflects a pivotal moment in Canadian history — Confederation, the end of a major war, and the legacy of a national monarch — reinforcing national identity and shared values.  
- **Legal Enforcement**: The Act makes these holidays legally binding, meaning employers are required to grant time off, and public institutions must recognize the day as a day of rest.
