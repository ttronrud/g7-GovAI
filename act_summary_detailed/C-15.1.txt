### **Overview**

The *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* establishes the **Canadian Energy Regulator (Regulator)** — an independent, national regulatory body responsible for overseeing the construction, operation, and abandonment of key energy infrastructure in Canada. The Act is designed to ensure safety, environmental protection, transparency, equity, and economic efficiency in energy projects involving pipelines, power lines, and offshore renewable energy developments.

It reflects a modern, inclusive, and forward-looking approach to energy regulation, grounded in **reconciliation with Indigenous peoples**, **environmental responsibility**, **economic competitiveness**, and **democratic participation**.
