**Detailed Summary of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2000***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Budget Implementation Act, 2000* is a federal statute enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It serves as a legislative vehicle to implement specific fiscal and tax policy measures from the 2000 federal budget. The Act grants certain Indigenous bands (First Nations) the authority to impose **direct taxes** on **alcoholic beverages, fuel, and tobacco products** sold on their reserves — a significant shift in federal-Indigenous fiscal relations.

It is particularly notable for **redefining the tax authority of First Nations councils**, allowing them to collect taxes on taxable supplies (such as alcohol, fuel, and tobacco) under conditions that mirror federal excise tax rules, while ensuring compliance with constitutional and administrative frameworks.

### **3. Core Provision: First Nations Authority to Impose Direct Taxes (Section 24)**

This is the **central and most significant provision** of the Act.

#### **Key Elements:**

- **Despite Section 87 of the Indian Act**, a **band council** listed in the schedule may make a **by-law** imposing a **direct tax** on taxable supplies of:
  - Alcoholic beverages
  - Fuel
  - Tobacco products  
  → **On reserves** of the band.

- The **rates of tax** under the by-law must be the **same** as those imposed under **sections 165(1) and (3)** of the *Excise Tax Act* for those supplies.

#### **Conditions for Validity and Enforcement:**

1. **Approval Requirement**  
   - A by-law must be approved by a **majority of councillors present** at a **duly convened meeting** of the council.

2. **Timing of Effectiveness**  
   - The by-law **does not come into force** until:
     - It is **received by the Minister of Finance**, and
     - An **administration agreement** is entered into under subsection 26(1) of the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*.

3. **Scope of Authority**  
   - The by-law may cover any matter arising from or ancillary to the exercise of powers under this section.
   - It is **not subject to the Statutory Instruments Act**, meaning it does not require prior parliamentary approval or public notice under that Act.

4. **Evidence of Validity**  
   - A copy of the by-law, certified by the Minister or an authorized person, is **evidence of its validity**, even without proof of signature or authorization.
   - The council must **publish** the by-law in a newspaper of general circulation and in the *First Nations Gazette*.  
     → **Failure to publish does not invalidate** the by-law.

5. **Administration Agreement**  
   - The council may enter into an **administration agreement** under the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act* to manage the collection and enforcement of the tax.

### **4. Legal and Regulatory Alignment with Federal Excise Tax Rules**

To ensure consistency and legal enforceability, the Act provides that:

- **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** (which governs excise taxes on alcohol, fuel, and tobacco) applies **as if** the tax were imposed under **section 165** of that Act — even though it is imposed via a First Nation by-law.

Specifically:
- The by-law **shall be treated as if it were part of Part IX** of the Excise Tax Act.
- Any requirement in Part IX (e.g., registration, reporting, compliance) is **deemed satisfied** if the same action satisfies the corresponding federal requirement.
- Any authority granted under Part IX is **deemed validly exercised** under the by-law.
- A person who is a **registrant under Part IX** is also a **registrant under the by-law**.
- Any legal proceeding (e.g., prosecution, penalties) that could be taken under Part IX **may be taken** in respect of the by-law.

This ensures **uniformity in compliance, enforcement, and administrative procedures** between federal and band-level taxes.

---

### **5. Tax Exemption and Non-Overlap with Federal Tax**

- **No double taxation**: If a tax is payable under a by-law (i.e., imposed by the band), then **no federal excise tax under section 165(1)** is payable on the same supply.
- This prevents overlap and ensures that the band tax is the **only tax** applicable to supplies made on reserve.

> **Exception**: This rule does **not** apply to taxes imposed by the band under other provisions — only to taxes under section 24(1).

---

### **6. Collection and Use of Tax Proceeds**

- **Collection**: Taxes are collected through an **administration agreement** with the Minister of Finance.
- **Use of Proceeds**:
  - Moneys raised are **not considered "Indian moneys"** under subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*.
  - Expenditures must be made **only with a resolution approved by a majority of councillors** at a duly convened council meeting.

> This ensures that the funds are used democratically and transparently by the band council.

---

### **7. Enforcement and Offences**

- If a person commits an act or omission in relation to a by-law that would constitute an **offence under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, the person is guilty of an offence:
  - **Punishable on summary conviction** (i.e., by a magistrate without a jury).
  - **The Attorney General may elect to prosecute by indictment** if the offence could be prosecuted that way under federal law.
  - The **punishment is the same** as under the corresponding provision in Part IX.

> This ensures that enforcement is consistent with federal standards and that compliance is strictly monitored.

---

### **8. Amendments and Schedule Updates**

- The **Governor in Council** (federal Cabinet) may, by order, **amend the schedule** to:
  - Add or delete the names of bands eligible to impose taxes.
- The original schedule lists **18 First Nations** (including Cowichan, Westbank, Kamloops, Sliammon, Osoyoos, Adams Lake, Tsawout, Chemainus, Dakota Tipi, Waywayseecappo, Opaskwayak Cree, Buffalo Point, Tobique, Tzeachten, Nisichawayasihk Cree, Shuswap, Skidegate, Spallumcheen, Whitecap Dakota, Bonaparte, and Little Shuswap Lake).

> These are the **only bands** with the authority to impose direct taxes under this Act.
