**Act Title:**  
*National Strategy for Safe and Environmentally Sound Disposal of Lamps Containing Mercury Act*

**Purpose:**  
This Act establishes a framework for the development and implementation of a national strategy aimed at ensuring that lamps containing mercury are disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The primary objective is to protect public health and the environment by minimizing the risks associated with mercury contamination from improperly discarded lamps.

### Key Provisions and Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Citation of the Act**  
The Act is formally cited as the *National Strategy for Safe and Environmentally Sound Disposal of Lamps Containing Mercury Act*. This provides a clear and official name for the legislation, facilitating reference and legal interpretation.

---

#### 2. **Development of the National Strategy**  
The **Minister of the Environment** is responsible for developing a comprehensive national strategy in collaboration with several key stakeholders:

- **Provincial and territorial governments**: To ensure regional input and alignment with local conditions and regulatory frameworks.
- **Other Canadian governments responsible for the environment**: Including federal, provincial, and territorial bodies with environmental oversight.
- **Interested persons or organizations**: The Minister may consult any groups or entities deemed relevant—such as environmental NGOs, industry representatives, scientific bodies, or community organizations—depending on the nature of the issue.

**Scope of the Strategy (May Include):**
- **Identification of safe disposal practices**: Establishing best practices for handling, transporting, and disposing of mercury-containing lamps (e.g., fluorescent, CFLs, and other types).
- **Guidelines for disposal facilities**: Setting out standards and requirements for facilities that engage in the safe disposal of these lamps, including operational, safety, and environmental compliance measures.
- **Public awareness campaigns**: Developing initiatives to inform the public about the environmental and health risks of improper disposal and the importance of safe handling and disposal methods.

This collaborative approach ensures that the strategy reflects both national policy goals and regional practicalities.

#### 3. **Timeline for Reporting and Public Access**

- **Initial Strategy Report**:
  - The Minister must prepare a report outlining the national strategy.
  - The report must be **laid before each House of Parliament** (the House of Commons and the Senate) on **any of the first 15 days** when that House is sitting after:
    - The **later of**:
      - December 31, 2018, and  
      - Two years after the date the Act receives royal assent.
  - The report must be **posted on the Minister’s departmental website within 10 days** of being tabled in Parliament.

> *Note*: This timeline ensures transparency and timely public access. The two-year delay from royal assent allows for legislative processing, while the December 31, 2018, date may reflect an initial target for implementation.

#### 4. **Periodic Evaluation and Monitoring of the Strategy**

- **Effectiveness Reports**:
  - The Minister must prepare a report **within five years** of the initial strategy report being tabled in Parliament.
  - **Every five years thereafter**, a new effectiveness report must be issued.
- These reports must:
  - Assess the **effectiveness** of the national strategy.
  - Include the Minister’s **conclusions and recommendations**—such as whether the strategy is achieving its goals, what improvements are needed, and whether policy adjustments are warranted.

- These reports must also be **laid before each House of Parliament** on any of the first 15 days when a House is sitting after the report is completed.

> *Purpose*: This mechanism ensures ongoing accountability, adaptive management, and responsiveness to emerging environmental or public health concerns.

### Key Features and Implications:

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Intergovernmental Collaboration** | Ensures that federal, provincial, and territorial perspectives are integrated, promoting consistency and coherence across jurisdictions. |
| **Public Participation** | Encourages input from stakeholders, enhancing legitimacy and effectiveness of the strategy. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Mandatory publication in Parliament and on government websites ensures public access and oversight. |
| **Long-Term Monitoring** | The five-year review cycle enables adaptive policy development, allowing for adjustments based on real-world outcomes. |
| **Focus on Mercury Safety** | Addresses a significant environmental hazard—mercury is toxic and can bioaccumulate, posing risks to ecosystems and human health if not managed properly. |

### Environmental and Public Health Rationale:

Lamps containing mercury (such as fluorescent and compact fluorescent lamps) are common household and commercial items. When disposed of improperly—such as in regular landfills—they can leach mercury into soil and water, leading to contamination of air, water, and food chains. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin, especially harmful to children and developing organisms.

This Act responds to growing environmental concerns and aligns with broader Canadian environmental policies, including those related to chemical management and sustainable waste practices.

---

### Conclusion:

The *National Strategy for Safe and Environmentally Sound Disposal of Lamps Containing Mercury Act* establishes a structured, transparent, and accountable process for managing the environmental risks associated with mercury-containing lamps. By mandating the development of a national strategy, regular public reporting, and periodic evaluation, the Act promotes sustainable waste management, protects public health, and ensures that environmental policies evolve in response to real-world outcomes. It represents a proactive, science-based, and participatory approach to addressing a persistent environmental challenge.
