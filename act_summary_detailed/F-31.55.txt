**Detailed Summary of the *Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act* is a comprehensive legislative initiative introduced by the Government of Canada to **remove federal barriers** to the **interprovincial movement of goods, services, and workers**, thereby promoting **free trade and labour mobility** across Canada. The Act supports the broader goal of creating a **national system of mutual recognition**—where a good, service, or worker that meets the standards of one Canadian jurisdiction is recognized as meeting those standards in all other jurisdictions.

This legislation aligns with Canada’s commitment to a **cooperative, integrated economy**, while maintaining safeguards for **public health, safety, security, environmental protection**, and **social and economic well-being**.

## **Key Provisions and Explanations**

---

### **1. Purpose of the Act**

The primary objectives of the Act are:

- To **remove federal regulatory barriers** to the movement of:
  - Goods and services between provinces and territories.
  - Workers across Canada.
- To **enhance labour mobility** by enabling workers to move and work in any province or territory without unnecessary restrictions.
- To **improve access to Canadian goods and services** for businesses and consumers by streamlining interprovincial trade.
- To **strengthen the Canadian economy** through greater efficiency, competition, and consumer choice—while upholding essential public protections.

> *This Act is not about eliminating all regulation; rather, it promotes consistency and mutual recognition of standards among jurisdictions.*

### **2. Definitions (Key Terms)**

The Act establishes clear definitions to guide interpretation:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Federal Regulatory Body** | A body empowered by federal law to regulate a good/service or issue authorizations for an occupation. May include designated bodies under regulations. |
| **Federal Requirement** | Any requirement established under federal legislation or by a federal regulatory body. |
| **Provincial or Territorial Regulatory Body** | A body empowered by provincial/territorial legislation or designated by regulation to regulate goods/services or issue occupational authorizations. |
| **Provincial or Territorial Requirement** | A requirement established under provincial/territorial law or by a provincial/territorial regulatory body. |

These definitions clarify the scope of federal vs. provincial jurisdiction and form the foundation for mutual recognition.

---

### **3. Supremacy of the Act**

- The provisions of this Act and any regulations made under it **take precedence over any conflicting provisions** in other federal or provincial laws.
- This ensures that the Act’s goals—particularly mutual recognition—can be implemented without being undermined by overlapping or inconsistent rules.

---

### **4. Mutual Recognition Principle**

#### **Section 8 – Goods and Services**

> *Subject to regulations, a good or service produced, used, or distributed in accordance with a provincial or territorial requirement is considered to meet any comparable federal requirement.*

##### Conditions for "Comparability":
A provincial or territorial requirement is deemed **comparable** to a federal requirement if:
1. It applies to the **same aspect or element** of the good or service.
2. It is intended to achieve a **similar objective** (e.g., safety, quality, environmental protection).
3. Any conditions set out in regulations are met.

##### Process:
- The **federal regulatory body** responsible for enforcing the federal requirement has the authority to **determine whether a provincial/territorial requirement is comparable**.
- If comparable, the good/service is treated as meeting the federal standard.

> ✅ *Example:* A food product certified as safe and nutritious under a provincial health standard may be recognized as meeting federal food safety requirements, even if the federal standard is more stringent or less detailed.

#### **Section 9 – Services**

> *A service provided in accordance with a provincial or territorial requirement is considered to meet any comparable federal requirement, provided the provincial/territorial requirement continues to apply to the service provider.*

##### Conditions for Comparability:
Same as for goods:
- Same aspect/element of the service.
- Similar objective.
- Compliance with regulatory conditions.

> ✅ *Example:* A licensed accountant in Ontario providing services in Quebec under Ontario’s licensing rules may be recognized as meeting federal standards, as long as the Ontario requirement remains in force.

---

### **5. Labour Mobility – Section 10**

> *The federal regulatory body must recognize an authorization to practise an occupation issued by a provincial or territorial body as comparable to a federal authorization, and must issue a federal authorization upon application.*

##### Key Points:
- A person who holds a valid **provincial or territorial license** to practice a profession (e.g., doctor, teacher, engineer) is **automatically recognized** as meeting the federal standard.
- The federal body **must issue a federal authorization** upon request.
- This promotes **freedom of movement** for skilled workers across Canada.

> ✅ *Example:* A nurse licensed in British Columbia can apply to the federal body (e.g., College of Nurses of Canada) and receive a federal license to work in Alberta or Saskatchewan without needing a separate examination or process.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This does not eliminate all federal oversight. It only ensures that provincial credentials are recognized and that federal authorizations are issued upon request.

### **6. Regulatory Authority – Power to Make Rules**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **regulations** under this Act to:

- Designate exceptions to sections 8, 9, or 10 (e.g., where mutual recognition would not be practical).
- Impose **obligations, prohibitions, conditions, or restrictions** (e.g., for safety or environmental reasons).
- Define key terms like:
  - "Same aspect or element"
  - "Achieve a similar objective"
  - "Authorization"
- Address **transition periods** after the Act comes into force.
- Cover any other matter required by the Act.

> 📌 **Consultation Requirement**: Before recommending a regulation related to a federal requirement or authorization, the **Minister** must **consult** the relevant federal regulatory body.

> This ensures that regulatory decisions are informed by the experts responsible for enforcement and compliance.

---

### **7. Immunity from Legal Action**

> Despite any other law, **no civil action** can be brought against:
- The Crown (His Majesty),
- A Crown servant or agent,
- A federal regulatory body

**For actions taken in good faith** under:
- Section 8 (goods/services),
- Section 9 (services),
- Section 10 (occupational authorizations),
- Or any regulations made under those sections.

> 🔍 This provision protects federal bodies and officials from lawsuits related to decisions on mutual recognition or credential evaluation—provided they act in good faith.

> ⚖️ *Exception:* This immunity **does not apply** to:
- Judicial review applications.
- Proceedings under **Chapter Ten of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement** (which governs dispute resolution mechanisms).

> This ensures that legal accountability remains intact in formal dispute resolution processes.

---

### **8. Review and Accountability**

> Within **five years** of the Act coming into force, the **Minister** must:
- Conduct a **comprehensive review** of the Act’s implementation and effectiveness.
- Prepare a **report** on the review.
- Lay the report **before both Houses of Parliament**.

> This ensures ongoing evaluation and adaptation of the Act to real-world conditions and emerging challenges.

---

### **9. Appointment of the Minister**

- The **Governor in Council** may designate a member of the King’s Privy Council as the **Minister** responsible for administering the Act.
- This allows flexibility in assigning leadership to oversee implementation and policy development.
