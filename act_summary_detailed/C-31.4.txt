**Detailed Summary of the *Civil Lunar Gateway Agreement Implementation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Civil Lunar Gateway Agreement Implementation Act* is a Canadian legislative instrument designed to enable Canada to fulfill its legal and operational obligations under the **Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America concerning cooperation on the **Civil Lunar Gateway (CLG)**. This act provides the legal framework, administrative powers, and enforcement mechanisms necessary to support Canada’s participation in the international effort to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon through the CLG project.

The Act was enacted to give legal effect to the 2020 MoU, which was amended over time under Article 22, and ensures that Canada’s commitments—particularly in areas of scientific research, technological development, international cooperation, and data sharing—are properly implemented and enforced.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Agreement**  
   Refers to the *Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America concerning Cooperation on the Civil Lunar Gateway*, entered into on **December 15, 2020**, and amended from time to time under **Article 22** of the Agreement.  
   → This defines the foundational bilateral cooperation framework.

2. **Minister**  
   Means the member or members of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** designated as the Minister or Ministers for the purpose of any provision of this Act.  
   → Establishes the responsible federal authority for administering the Act.

3. **Purpose of the Act**  
   To **fulfil Canada’s obligations under the Agreement**.  
   → The central objective is not to create new policy but to operationalize Canada’s commitments under the MoU.

---

### **Applicability and Jurisdiction**

- The Act is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province**.  
  → This means it applies directly to federal and provincial governments, ensuring that both levels of government are bound by its provisions when relevant.

---

### **Designation of the Minister**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by order, designate one or more members of the Queen’s Privy Council as the Minister or Ministers responsible for specific provisions of the Act.  
  → Provides flexibility in assigning responsibility, allowing for delegation based on evolving needs or policy priorities.

---

### **Delegation of Powers**

- The Minister may delegate any powers, duties, or functions conferred by or under this Act to individuals or entities, **subject to any terms and conditions** the Minister specifies.  
  → Enables efficient administration by allowing experts or agencies (e.g., space agencies, research institutions) to carry out specific responsibilities.

---

### **Information and Document Access Requirements**

- The Minister may issue an order requiring any person who has information or documents relevant to the **administration or enforcement** of the Act to provide that information or documents.  
- The recipient of such an order must provide the information or documents **in the time and manner specified** in the order.  
- **Exception**: The *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to these orders.  
  → Ensures that these enforcement orders are not subject to the usual procedural requirements of statutory instruments, allowing for swift and flexible action.

---

### **Confidentiality Provisions**

#### **General Rule: Confidentiality Protection**
- It is **prohibited** for any person who receives information or documents under this Act or the Agreement (that are subject to a claim of confidentiality) to:
  - Communicate them;
  - Allow their recommunication;
  - Permit any third party to access them —  
  **without the written consent** of the person who provided the information.

> This protects sensitive data related to space missions, technical designs, and strategic planning.

#### **Exceptions to Confidentiality**

Despite the general rule, a person may communicate or allow access to confidential information **if one of the following conditions applies**:

1. **Public Interest Exception**  
   The **public interest in matters of public health or public safety** outweighs any potential harm, including:
   - Financial loss or competitive disadvantage;
   - Privacy, reputation, or human dignity concerns.

   → Example: If a health emergency arises due to a failure in a lunar module design, disclosure may be justified to protect public safety.

2. **Administrative or Enforcement Need**  
   The communication or access is **necessary for**:
   - The administration or enforcement of this Act;
   - The enforcement of another Act of Parliament; or
   - Giving effect to the Agreement itself.

   → Ensures transparency and compliance within the regulatory and operational framework.

---

### **Prohibition on Compelling Evidence**

- Despite any other law, **no person may be compelled** to give or produce evidence related to confidential information obtained under this Act or the Agreement — **unless** the proceeding involves:
  - Enforcement of this Act;
  - Enforcement of another Act of Parliament.

> This protects the integrity of sensitive data from being used in legal proceedings outside the scope of enforcement.

---

### **Return or Destruction of Goods/Data (Article 19.4 Compliance)**

- Any person who receives **goods or data** under **Article 19.4 of the Agreement** (which typically relates to the transfer of space-related materials or data between partners) must:
  - Upon completion of the related activities,
  - **Destroy or return** such goods or data **in accordance with the instructions** of the providing party.

> This ensures compliance with international data and property transfer protocols under the Agreement.

---

### **Enforcement of Non-Compliance**

- If the Minister believes, on **reasonable grounds**, that a person has **violated or is likely to violate**:
  - Section 8 (confidentiality);
  - Section 9 (prohibition on unauthorized disclosure),  
  the Minister may issue an order requiring the person to:
  - Return the information or documents to the original provider; or
  - Dispose of them in a manner deemed appropriate by the Minister.

- The person receiving the order must comply with the **time and manner** specified in the order.

> This serves as a strong enforcement mechanism to prevent breaches of confidentiality or misuse of shared data.

> Again, the *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to such orders — ensuring rapid and effective enforcement.

---

### **Broad Interpretation of "Information and Documents"**

- For the purposes of Sections 7, 8, and 10 (confidentiality, access, and return), **information and documents include goods or data referred to in Article 19.4 of the Agreement**.  
  → Expands the scope of what is protected and subject to the confidentiality and return rules.

---

### **Regulatory Authority**

- The **Governor in Council** may make **regulations** to:
  - Carry out the purposes of the Act;
  - Give effect to the Agreement;
  - Include implementing arrangements such as:
    - A **code of conduct**;
    - **Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs)**;
    - Other procedural or operational guidelines.

> This allows for the development of detailed, practical rules to govern day-to-day operations, accountability, and ethical standards in Canada’s involvement with the CLG project.

### **Conclusion**

The *Civil Lunar Gateway Agreement Implementation Act* is a targeted, legally robust instrument that enables Canada to responsibly and effectively participate in the international Civil Lunar Gateway initiative. It balances the need for **strict confidentiality** in space-related data with **flexibility and accountability** in public interest and enforcement contexts. By establishing clear roles, powers, and obligations, the Act ensures that Canada fulfills its commitments under the Canada–U.S. MoU while safeguarding national interests, scientific integrity, and international cooperation.

This Act is not a standalone policy initiative but rather a **critical enabling law** that supports Canada’s broader strategic goals in space exploration, scientific advancement, and global partnerships in the space sector.
