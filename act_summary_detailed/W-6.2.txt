### **Detailed Summary of the *Westbank First Nation Self-Government Act***

The *Westbank First Nation Self-Government Act* is a federal legislation enacted by Parliament of Canada to give legal effect to the **Westbank First Nation Self-Government Agreement**, a landmark agreement between the Government of Canada and the Westbank First Nation. This Act establishes a framework for self-governance, affirming the Westbank First Nation’s authority over its own affairs, including land, governance, legal systems, and financial management — while ensuring that federal oversight and accountability remain in place.

---

## **1. Purpose and Background**
- The Act was passed in response to a formal agreement signed on **October 3, 2003**, between the Westbank First Nation and Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- The Government of Canada committed to recommending legislation to Parliament to implement the Agreement, which was laid before both the Senate and House of Commons on **November 5, 2003**.
- The Act enables the Westbank First Nation to exercise **self-government** under its own laws and institutions, consistent with Canadian law and constitutional principles of Indigenous rights.

---

## **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**
- **"Agreement"**: Refers to the original Westbank First Nation Self-Government Agreement signed on October 3, 2003, and any amendments made in accordance with its terms. These amendments are binding and part of the legal framework.
- **"Council," "Member," "Westbank First Nation," "Westbank lands," and "Westbank law"** are defined consistently with the Agreement, ensuring clarity and continuity in interpretation.

---

## **3. Legal Force and Binding Nature of the Agreement**
- The Agreement is **approved and has the force of law**.
- It is **binding on all persons**, including individuals, organizations, and courts, who may rely on its provisions.
- The Agreement **prevails over conflicting federal laws** to the extent of any inconsistency — a critical provision ensuring the Westbank First Nation’s autonomy in matters governed by the Agreement.

---

## **4. Exclusion of Federal Laws**
To protect the Westbank First Nation’s self-governance, the following federal statutes are **excluded** from applying to the Westbank First Nation, its council, members, or Westbank lands:
- **The Indian Act**: Does not apply *except* to the extent explicitly permitted or provided for in the Agreement.
- **The Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act**: Not applicable.
- **The Indian Oil and Gas Act**: Not applicable.
- **The Statutory Instruments Act**: Does not apply to Westbank law, allowing the Westbank First Nation to create and implement its own legal instruments without needing prior federal approval.

> ⚠️ This exclusion is significant — it removes key federal regulatory controls over land use, resource management, and governance, empowering the Westbank First Nation to make independent decisions.

---

## **5. Special Provisions for Fiscal Management**
- Despite the general exclusion of federal laws, the **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations) may make **regulations** to allow the Westbank First Nation to:
  - Benefit from the **First Nations Fiscal Management Act** (FNFMA).
  - Access services provided by federal bodies established under that Act.
- These regulations may:
  - Adapt provisions of the FNFMA or its regulations.
  - Restrict the application of certain provisions if needed to align with Westbank interests.

> ✅ This provision balances self-governance with access to federal financial tools, ensuring the Westbank First Nation can manage its finances effectively while maintaining flexibility.

---

## **6. Judicial Notice and Legal Procedures**
- The **Agreement and Westbank law** are taken as **judicial notice** — meaning courts and tribunals are presumed to be familiar with their content and must recognize them as valid and binding.
- **Judicial review** under the Agreement can only occur **after exhausting all internal appeal or review procedures** under Westbank law.
- This ensures that internal governance processes are respected and provides a fair, culturally appropriate pathway for dispute resolution.

---

## **7. Status of Westbank Institutions**
- The **Westbank First Nation Council** and any body appointed by it that exercises jurisdiction under Westbank law are **not considered federal boards, commissions, or tribunals** under the *Federal Courts Act*.
- This means they are **not subject to federal jurisdiction** or the jurisdictional requirements of federal courts, preserving their autonomy.

---

## **8. Notice Requirements in Legal Proceedings**
- Any party in a court or tribunal proceeding must **serve written notice** on:
  - The **Attorney General of Canada**
  - The **Westbank First Nation**
- The notice must include:
  - Identification of the proceeding
  - Whether the issue relates to:
    - (a) Interpretation or validity of the Agreement
    - (b) Validity or applicability of this Act or Westbank law
  - Particulars of the legal point being argued
  - Date of argument (if fixed)
- The notice must be served **within seven days** of the issue arising (in pleadings or otherwise), and **cannot be argued before 14 days** unless the court or tribunal allows an earlier date.
- The notice must be accompanied by copies of all relevant documents in the court’s possession.

> 📌 This requirement ensures transparency and provides the Westbank First Nation and the federal government with timely opportunities to respond to legal challenges involving the Agreement or Westbank law.

---

## **9. Participation Rights**
- In any proceeding where a notice is served under Section 8, **both the Attorney General of Canada and the Westbank First Nation may appear and participate** in the proceeding with the **same rights as any other party**.
- This ensures that the Westbank First Nation has equal standing in legal matters involving its laws or governance.

---

## **10. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**
- The **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations) may make **regulations or orders** to carry out the provisions of the Agreement.
- These can include:
  - Clarifying implementation
  - Addressing practical issues
  - Ensuring compliance with the Agreement
- The power is exercised with discretion, based on consultation with the Westbank First Nation and consideration of community input.

---

## **11. Interpretation of References to Canada**
- In the Agreement, references to **"Canada"** (other than geographical references) are interpreted as referring to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This aligns the Agreement with the constitutional framework of the Crown, emphasizing the role of the Crown as a legal entity in Indigenous self-government agreements.

---

## **12. Survey and Boundary Matters**
- Under **Section 29(3) of the Canada Lands Surveys Act**, surveys and plans related to Westbank lands must be **satisfactory to the Westbank Council**, not to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations.
- This reinforces the Westbank First Nation’s authority in land management and survey decisions.
- **Exception**: This rule does **not apply** to boundary disputes between Westbank lands and other lands — federal oversight remains in such cases.

---

## **13. Record Keeping and Access**
- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (now Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs) is required to:
  - Deposit certified copies of the Agreement and any amendments into:
    - The **Library and Archives of Canada**
    - The **Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs** (in the National Capital Region)
    - The **nearest office of the Department to Westbank lands**

> ✅ This ensures transparency, historical preservation, and access for Indigenous communities, researchers, and government officials.

---

## **14. Coming Into Force**
- Most provisions of the Act (except Sections 20 and 21) come into force on a day **to be fixed by the Governor in Council**.
- **Specific dates**:
  - **Sections 20 and 21** came into force on **May 6, 2004**.
  - The **remainder of the Act** came into force on **April 1, 2005** (as per Statutory Instrument SI/2005-18).

---

## **15. Updating References to Departmental Names**
- Due to government reorganizations, the Act includes updates to reflect current departmental names:
  - **"Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development"** is read as **"Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs"** in the English version of paragraph 15(b).
  - All references to the **"Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development"** are to be read as **"Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations"** in the portion of Section 15 before paragraph (a).

> 🔁 This ensures consistency with current federal departmental structures and avoids outdated references.
