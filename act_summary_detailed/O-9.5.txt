Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided act, which is a legislative declaration concerning the navigation and control of the Ottawa River in Canada.

### **Detailed Summary of the Act: Declaration of Exclusive Legislative Authority over the Navigation and Works of the Ottawa River**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Constitutional Foundation**
The act is grounded in two key provisions of the **British North America Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867)**:

- **Section 91**: Grants the **Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority** over certain subjects, including:
  - "Navigation and shipping"
  - All matters not specifically assigned to the provinces in the Act’s enumeration of provincial powers.

- **Section 92**: Provides that certain works—**even if located entirely within a province**—are **exempt from provincial jurisdiction** if they:
  - Are declared by the federal Parliament to be for the **general advantage of Canada**, or
  - Benefit **two or more provinces**.

These constitutional provisions form the legal foundation for the federal government's authority over the Ottawa River.

---

#### **2. Key Subject Matter: The Ottawa River**
The Ottawa River is explicitly recognized as:
- A **navigable river**.
- Navigated **throughout its entire course** by vessels, boats, rafts, and timber cribs or logs.

This fact establishes that the river is not only a natural waterway but also a vital transportation and economic resource, warranting federal oversight.

---

#### **3. Primary Purpose of the Act**
The primary objective of this enactment is to:
- **Declare the navigation of the Ottawa River as exclusively under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada**.
- **Establish federal control over all works (structures, dams, canals, etc.)** located on or affecting the Ottawa River, regardless of where they are physically situated.

This ensures that federal oversight prevails over provincial jurisdiction in matters directly impacting navigation and public utility on the river.

---

#### **4. Scope of Federal Authority – Navigation**
The act explicitly states that:
> "The navigation of the River Ottawa, as well by vessels and boats as by rafts and cribs of timber or logs, is hereby declared to be subject to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada."

This means:
- All forms of navigation—whether commercial, recreational, or traditional (e.g., log rafts)—are federally regulated.
- Provincial legislatures have **no authority** to pass laws governing navigation on the Ottawa River.

---

#### **5. Scope of Federal Authority – Works on or Affecting the River**
The act extends federal jurisdiction to **all structures and works** related to navigation or public utility on the Ottawa River, including:

- **Canals and cuttings** designed to facilitate navigation.
- **Dams, slides, piers, booms, embankments**, and other structures.
- Any other works of whatever kind or nature used in the river’s channel or waters.

These works are subject to federal control **regardless of location**—even if built in a single province.

---

#### **6. Jurisdiction Over Works, Regardless of Origin**
Crucially, the act applies to works constructed by:
- The **Government of Canada**
- The **Government of the late Province of Canada** (i.e., pre-Confederation Upper or Lower Canada)
- Any **private party**, provided that such construction:
  - Was authorized by a provincial government (Upper or Lower Canada)
  - And has been **recognized by the Governor in Council** (the federal executive authority)

**Recognition Process**:
- The **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** submits a report.
- The **Governor in Council** (the federal Cabinet) reviews and formally recognizes such works as being for **public utility**.

Once recognized, such works are deemed to be **"works for the general advantage of Canada"** and fall under federal jurisdiction.

---

#### **7. Automatic Federal Jurisdiction for All Similar Works**
Even works **not formally recognized** as being for public utility are included in federal jurisdiction if:
- They are situated **in or on the waters of the Ottawa River**
- They are of a **like character** (i.e., related to navigation or public utility)

This creates a **broad, comprehensive federal control** over any structure affecting the river’s navigation or flow.

---

#### **8. Management and Oversight**
All such works are:
- Subject to the **exclusive legislative authority** of the **Parliament of Canada**.
- Under the **control and management** of the **Department of Public Works and Government Services** (now known as the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, and Communities or a similar modern department).

This ensures centralized planning, regulation, and maintenance of river infrastructure.

---

#### **9. Legal Framework and Compliance**
The federal authority over these works is **governed by** the:
> **"Department of Public Works and Government Services Act"**

This means that all decisions regarding construction, maintenance, operation, and modification of river works must comply with the provisions of this federal statute.

---

### **Key Implications and Significance**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Federal Supremacy** | Reinforces federal authority over navigation and major infrastructure, even in provincial waters. |
| **Constitutional Compliance** | Aligns with Section 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, ensuring legal validity. |
| **Prevents Provincial Interference** | Prevents provinces from imposing conflicting regulations on river navigation or infrastructure. |
| **National Unity and Coordination** | Ensures consistent, coordinated management of a major national waterway that benefits multiple provinces. |
| **Historical Continuity** | Covers works from pre-Confederation times, recognizing past infrastructure while asserting current federal control. |

---

### **Conclusion**

This act is a foundational piece of federal legislation that:
- Legally establishes the **exclusive federal control** over the **navigation and infrastructure** of the Ottawa River.
- Applies to **all forms of navigation**, including traditional log rafts.
- Covers **all types of works**—public or private—on or affecting the river, regardless of location or origin.
- Ensures that such works are **managed by the federal government** through the Department of Public Works and Government Services, under the authority of the **Department of Public Works and Government Services Act**.

By doing so, it protects the integrity of Canada’s navigable waterways, promotes national coordination in infrastructure development, and upholds constitutional principles of federal supremacy in matters of navigation and public utility.

> **Note**: This act is a historical document, likely from the early 20th century (possibly 1910s or 1920s). Modern equivalents may now be found in statutes such as the *Ottawa River Management Act* or provisions under the *Navigation Act* and *Fisheries and Oceans Canada* policies, but this specific enactment remains a key precedent in Canadian constitutional law regarding federal control over navigable waters.
