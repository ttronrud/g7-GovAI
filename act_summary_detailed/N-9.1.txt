**Detailed Summary of the *National Framework for Diabetes Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Framework for Diabetes Act* is a federal legislative initiative introduced by the Parliament of Canada to address the growing public health crisis of diabetes and prediabetes. With one in four Canadians living with prediabetes or diabetes — a condition that can lead to severe, life-threatening complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and limb amputations — the Act recognizes the urgent need for a coordinated, proactive, and equitable national response.

As the birthplace of insulin — a groundbreaking hormone that revolutionized diabetes treatment — Canada has a unique historical and scientific responsibility to lead in diabetes awareness, prevention, and care. This Act establishes a comprehensive, evidence-based, and inclusive national framework to improve access to diabetes prevention and treatment, reduce health disparities, and ensure better health outcomes across all Canadians.

### **Key Provisions and Objectives**

#### **1. Legislative Purpose and Context**
- The Act is enacted in response to:
  - The high prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in Canada (1 in 4 Canadians).
  - The serious health complications associated with unmanaged diabetes.
  - Canada’s historical role in the development of insulin and its responsibility to lead in diabetes care.
  - The importance of early detection and education in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes.
  - The need for strong coordination between federal, provincial, and Indigenous communities to ensure equitable access to care.

#### **2. Development of a National Framework**
- The **Minister of Health** is tasked with developing a **National Framework for Diabetes**.
- This development must occur through **consultation** with:
  - Representatives of **provincial governments** responsible for health.
  - **Indigenous groups** (acknowledging historical and ongoing disparities in health outcomes).
  - **Other relevant stakeholders**, including healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, researchers, and community organizations.

> *Purpose of consultation*: To ensure the framework is inclusive, culturally appropriate, and responsive to diverse needs across Canada.

#### **3. Core Components of the National Framework**
The framework must include the following essential elements:

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public Education** | Clear, accessible explanations of what diabetes and prediabetes are, including symptoms, risk factors, and how they develop. |
| **Professional Training & Guidelines** | Identify the education, training, and guidance needs of healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, dietitians, etc.) in preventing and managing diabetes. This includes the development or adoption of **clinical practice guidelines**. |
| **Research & Data Collection** | Promote and fund research into diabetes prevention and treatment; improve and standardize data collection to monitor trends, outcomes, and effectiveness of interventions. |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | Foster collaboration and information exchange among health systems, researchers, and practitioners to improve care delivery and innovation. |
| **Integration of Existing Best Practices** | Take into account and build upon existing provincial, regional, and community-based strategies, especially those focused on **addressing health inequities**. |
| **Disability Tax Credit (DTC) Accessibility** | Ensure the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) administers the **Disability Tax Credit fairly** and that it is structured to **benefit as many individuals with diabetes as possible**, recognizing diabetes as a recognized disability under the law. |

> *Note*: The inclusion of the DTC reflects an important policy link between disability rights and diabetes care — ensuring that people with diabetes who may face financial or social barriers can access vital supports.

#### **4. Consultation Process**
- The Minister must **hold at least one formal conference** with the stakeholders listed in Section 2 to gather input, discuss priorities, and build consensus on the framework.

#### **5. Timelines and Reporting Requirements**

| Timeline | Action | Deadline |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Within 1 year of the Act coming into force** | Prepare and table the **National Framework for Diabetes Report** in both Houses of Parliament | On any of the first 15 days after the House is sitting |
| **Within 10 days after tabled in Parliament** | Publish the report on the **Department of Health website** | Publicly accessible for transparency and public engagement |
| **Within 5 years after the report is tabled** | Prepare and table a **report on the effectiveness** of the framework | Evaluate progress, outcomes, equity, and gaps in prevention and treatment |

> The second report must include:
> - An assessment of the framework’s effectiveness.
> - A detailed analysis of the current state of diabetes prevention and treatment across Canada.
> - **Conclusions and recommendations** for future improvements or policy adjustments.

#### **6. Accountability and Transparency**
- The requirement to **table reports in both Houses of Parliament** ensures parliamentary oversight and public accountability.
- The **public publication of reports** ensures transparency, enabling citizens, health professionals, and researchers to access and use the information to inform their decisions.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Proactive Public Health Strategy**  
   The Act shifts the focus from reactive treatment to **prevention and early intervention**, aligning with global public health best practices.

2. **Equity and Inclusion**  
   By mandating consultation with Indigenous groups and emphasizing health equity, the Act acknowledges that marginalized populations (e.g., Indigenous communities, low-income groups, rural populations) face disproportionate risks and barriers to care.

3. **Intergovernmental Collaboration**  
   It establishes a formal mechanism for **federal-provincial coordination**, which is essential given that health services are primarily delivered at the provincial level.

4. **Strengthening Healthcare Workforce Capacity**  
   By identifying training needs and clinical guidelines, the framework will improve the quality of care delivered by frontline health professionals.

5. **Research and Innovation**  
   The emphasis on data collection and research supports evidence-based policy and long-term improvements in diabetes management.

6. **Legal and Financial Inclusion**  
   The inclusion of the Disability Tax Credit ensures that individuals with diabetes — especially those with complications — are not left behind financially, reinforcing social protection.

### **Potential Challenges and Considerations**

- **Implementation Complexity**: Coordinating across provinces, Indigenous nations, and diverse healthcare systems may require significant time and resources.
- **Funding**: The success of the framework depends on adequate federal and provincial funding for research, education, and outreach.
- **Data Privacy and Ethics**: Improved data collection must be balanced with privacy protections and ethical standards.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Frameworks must be adapted to reflect cultural differences, especially in Indigenous communities where traditional health practices and beliefs play a key role.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: The five-year effectiveness review will be critical to determine whether the framework delivers on its promises.

### **Conclusion**

The *National Framework for Diabetes Act* represents a landmark step in Canada’s public health strategy. By establishing a transparent, inclusive, and evidence-based national approach to diabetes prevention and treatment, the Act aims to:

- Reduce the burden of diabetes on individuals and the healthcare system.
- Improve early detection and intervention.
- Promote health equity.
- Position Canada as a global leader in diabetes care and awareness.

Ultimately, this Act is not just about managing a disease — it is about empowering individuals with knowledge, ensuring equitable access to care, and building a healthier, more resilient future for all Canadians.
