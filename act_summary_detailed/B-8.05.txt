**Detailed Summary of the *Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act* (the "Act") is a federal legislative instrument designed to facilitate the construction, operation, and management of a major infrastructure project: a new or expanded bridge across the **Detroit River**, connecting **Windsor, Ontario** and **Detroit, Michigan**. The Act provides a comprehensive legal framework that streamlines regulatory processes, grants exemptions from certain environmental and procedural requirements, and establishes clear responsibilities for planning, mitigation, public consultation, and governance—particularly in light of cross-border cooperation between Canada and the United States.

It is intended to accelerate the development of this critical transportation link, which supports trade, economic growth, and regional connectivity between Canada and the U.S., while minimizing environmental and regulatory barriers.

### **2. Exemptions from Federal Environmental and Regulatory Laws**

This Act grants significant exemptions from key federal environmental and administrative laws to expedite project delivery:

#### **Exemption from Environmental Assessment Laws**
- **Impact Assessment Act (IAA)**: Does *not apply* to the construction, expansion, decommissioning, or abandonment of the bridge, parkway, or related works—**subject to subsection (2)**.
  - *Exception*: The **expansion, decommissioning, or abandonment** of these projects **are considered "projects" under section 81 of the IAA** and are therefore **subject to sections 82 to 91** (i.e., environmental assessment requirements) for such events.
- **Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA)**: The responsible authority (e.g., Minister of Transport) is **exempt from obligations under subsections 20(2) and 38(1)** regarding environmental assessments.
- **Canada Port Authority Environmental Assessment Regulations**: The **Windsor Port Authority** is exempt from its environmental assessment obligations.

#### **Exemption from Other Federal Acts**
- The **Fisheries Act**, **Canadian Navigable Waters Act**, **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, **section 6 of the International Bridges and Tunnels Act (IBTA)**, and **Port Authorities Operations Regulations** do **not apply** to the construction or operation of the bridge, parkway, or related works.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: These exemptions are not absolute. They apply only to the *construction phase* and are subject to specific conditions (e.g., mitigation plans, public consultation).

### **3. Exemption Authority and Flexibility via Governor in Council**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by **order**, exempt any person from requirements under any federal Act (e.g., permits, licenses, approvals) for construction or operation of the bridge or related works—**if the Governor in Council determines it is in the public interest**.
- This power allows flexibility in responding to unforeseen circumstances or economic justifications.

> 🔍 **Statutory Instrument (SI) Exception**: The Statutory Instruments Act does **not apply** to such orders. However, the order **must be published in the Canada Gazette** to be effective.

---

### **4. Deemed Authorization**

- If an exemption under subsection (1) above is granted, then **any authorization that would have been required under a federal Act (but was not obtained due to the exemption) is deemed to have been issued** for the purpose of applying that Act.
- This ensures legal continuity and avoids procedural delays in project execution.
