**Detailed Summary of the *Department of Indigenous Services Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Department of Indigenous Services Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted to establish a dedicated federal department responsible for delivering services to Indigenous peoples — First Nations, Métis, and Inuit — in a manner that reflects their rights, cultures, and self-determination. It aligns with Canada’s commitment to **reconciliation**, grounded in constitutional recognition, international obligations, and meaningful partnership with Indigenous communities.

This Act replaces the former *Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development* (DIAND) and restructures federal engagement with Indigenous peoples under a new, more inclusive, and respectful framework. The core purpose is to ensure that Indigenous individuals and communities have equitable access to essential services while respecting Indigenous governance, knowledge systems, and sovereignty.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Legislative Purpose and Principles**

The Act begins with a strong foundational statement of intent:

- **Reconciliation through nation-to-nation, government-to-government, and Inuit-Crown relationships** based on:
  - Affirmation and implementation of rights under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
  - Respect for Indigenous rights as recognized by international standards, particularly the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**.
- Emphasis on **respect, cooperation, partnership**, and **Indigenous self-determination**.

This reflects a shift from a top-down, administrative model to one of **collaborative governance**, where Indigenous voices are central to policy design and delivery.

### **2. Establishment of the Department of Indigenous Services**

- A new **Department of Indigenous Services (DIS)** is formally established under the authority of the Government of Canada.
- The Department operates under the leadership of the **Minister of Indigenous Services**, who presides over it.
- The Minister is appointed by **commission under the Great Seal** and serves at the pleasure of the Crown.
- A **Deputy Minister** may be appointed by the Governor in Council to serve as deputy head of the Department.

> This structure ensures accountability and provides a clear leadership chain for the Department.

The Minister has broad powers and duties over all matters within the Department’s jurisdiction — **except where otherwise assigned** — including:

#### **Core Service Areas**:
The Minister is responsible for providing services in the following areas to **eligible Indigenous individuals and Indigenous governing bodies**:

### **4. Collaboration with Indigenous Peoples**

A central principle of the Act is **collaboration and partnership**:

- The Minister must **provide Indigenous organizations** with an opportunity to:
  - Collaborate in the **development, provision, assessment, and improvement** of services.
- The Department must **gradually transfer responsibilities** to Indigenous organizations through formal agreements (e.g., self-government, land claims, or self-determination agreements).
- This transfer is not immediate but occurs **over time**, allowing for capacity building and shared ownership of services.

> This reflects a commitment to **Indigenous self-governance** and the principle that Indigenous communities should manage their own affairs.

---

### **5. Flexibility in Service Delivery**

- The Minister may enter into **agreements with Indigenous organizations** or other entities to deliver services or transfer responsibilities.
- The Minister may appoint **special representatives** to:
  - Provide advice on matters related to the Act.
  - Represent the Department in consultations with Indigenous groups.
- The Minister may also establish **advisory and other committees** to offer guidance on key issues.

> These mechanisms allow for **flexible, culturally appropriate engagement** with diverse Indigenous communities.

---

### **6. Data Use and Privacy**

The Minister has the authority to:
- Collect, analyze, and interpret data on service delivery and outcomes.
- Disclose such data to:
  - The **Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs**;
  - Federal departments or agencies (as listed in Schedule I to the Financial Administration Act);
  - Indigenous organizations;
  - Not-for-profit entities controlled by Indigenous individuals.

#### **Privacy Safeguards**:
Disclosures are **restricted** when:
- The information is **personal information** (as defined in the *Privacy Act*).
- Disclosure is **not permitted** unless:
  - The data is **publicly available**;
  - The individual **consents** to disclosure;

  - Disclosure is restricted under another Act (e.g., Access to Information Act);
  - It is a **confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council**.

> This balances transparency with respect for privacy and cultural sensitivity.

---

### **7. Support for Indigenous Research and Statistics**

- The Minister may support Indigenous-led research bodies in collecting, analyzing, and publishing data related to service delivery.
- This promotes **Indigenous ways of knowing** and ensures that data reflects Indigenous perspectives and realities.

> This is a critical step toward **valid, culturally grounded data** that supports evidence-based policy.

---

### **8. Delegation of Powers**

- The Minister may delegate **any powers, duties, or functions** under this Act or other Acts **to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations or the Minister of Northern Affairs**.
- However, **the power to delegate under this section itself cannot be delegated**.

> This allows for coordination between departments while maintaining the Minister’s ultimate responsibility.

---

### **9. Reporting Obligations**

The Minister is required to table **annual reports** in both Houses of Parliament within **three months after the end of each fiscal year**, or on the first 15 days of the next parliamentary session, covering:

1. **Socio-economic gaps** between Indigenous peoples and other Canadians, and the measures taken to reduce them.
2. **Progress toward the transfer of responsibilities** to Indigenous organizations.
