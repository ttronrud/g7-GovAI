**Detailed Summary of the *Dry Docks Subsidies Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Dry Docks Subsidies Act* is a legislative framework designed to encourage and support the construction of dry docks—both fixed and floating—in Canada, with the primary objective of ensuring the nation has adequate facilities for the reception and repair of vessels, particularly naval and commercial ships. The Act establishes a structured, government-supervised subsidy system that balances public interest, fiscal responsibility, and operational feasibility.

It provides for financial assistance (subsidies) to approved private companies to build dry docks, subject to strict conditions regarding necessity, cost, technical specifications, and long-term maintenance. The Act also includes provisions for land acquisition, oversight, financial accountability, and post-construction management.

## **Key Definitions and Parties**

- **"Dry dock and dock"**: Includes both fixed dry docks and floating dry docks (i.e., floating facilities capable of lifting and supporting vessels).
- **"Minister"**: Refers to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, responsible for technical evaluation and recommendations.
- **"Governor in Council"**: The Cabinet of Canada (executive authority), responsible for final approval of subsidies, expropriation, and major decisions related to construction and operations.

---

## **Core Provisions and Structure**

---

### **1. Authorization of Subsidies**
- The Governor in Council may authorize payments from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** to an incorporated company to construct a dry dock, provided:
  - The company is approved by the Governor in Council as having the ability to perform the work.
  - The company enters into an agreement with Her Majesty (the Crown) to build the dry dock.
- **Subsidy eligibility requires**:
  - A determination by the Governor in Council that:
    - The dry dock is **needed in the public interest**.
    - It has **sufficient capacity** to meet public needs at its location.

> This ensures subsidies are not given for speculative or redundant projects.

---

### **2. Utilization of Existing Dry Dock Infrastructure**
- Companies may **utilize or acquire** the works and property of existing dry dock companies (from prior acts such as 1882, 1899, 1906, and 1908).
- The **value of such existing works and property** is considered part of the cost of the new dry dock for subsidy calculation.
- **Deduction Rule**:
  - The total amount of subsidies previously paid under earlier dry dock acts (before this Act’s agreement) is **deducted from the current subsidy**.
  - This deduction is made in **equal annual installments** over the subsidy period.
  - Any remaining subsidy obligations under prior acts are **not payable** after the new agreement.

> This prevents double subsidy and promotes efficiency in capital use.

- **Valuation Process**:
  - The Minister estimates the value of existing works.
  - The Governor in Council, based on that estimate, determines the value before the agreement is finalized.

---

### **3. Application Requirements for New Projects**
- Any company seeking to build a dry dock must submit:
  - **Detailed working plans and specifications**.
  - **Cost estimates** covering:
    - Equipment, machinery, plant.
    - Site acquisition costs (if paid in cash).
    - Site not obtained via bonus or gift.
- These estimates must be **detailed enough** to allow the Minister to verify them and make a recommendation under Section 8.

---

### **4. Expropriation of Land**
- If a company cannot reach agreement with a landowner for a site, it may **expropriate** the land with:
  - **Governor in Council’s approval**.
  - Compliance with the **Expropriation Act**.
- Once approved:
  - The expropriated land is deemed an **interest in land for public purposes**.
  - A reference to the **Crown** in the Expropriation Act is interpreted as referring to the **company**.
- The appropriate minister (under Part I of the Expropriation Act) may:
  - Enact **regulations** on fees and charges for expropriation.
  - Set **interest rates** on these fees.
- These fees are:
  - A **debt owed to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
  - Accruing interest from the date of payment.
- The company may be required to provide **security** (determined by the Minister) to cover potential fees.

### **5. Classification of Dry Docks**
Dry docks are categorized into **three classes** based on size, capacity, and cost limits. Each class has distinct subsidy rates and construction requirements.

| Class | Cost Limit (Subsidy Base) | Minimum Dimensions / Capacity | Key Features |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| **First Class** | ≤ $5.5M (non-floating), ≤ $4M (floating) | - Length: ≥1150 ft<br>- Width: ≥125 ft<br>- Depth: ≥38 ft (tidal)<br>- Floating: ≥25,000-ton lifting capacity | Must accommodate the **largest ships of the British Navy** at the time of contract entry. Highest subsidy rate and most stringent requirements. |
| **Second Class** | ≤ $2.5M | - Length: ≥650 ft<br>- Width: ≥85 ft<br>- Depth: 30 ft (tidal), 25 ft (non-tidal)<br>- Floating: ≥15,000-ton lifting capacity | Intermediate size and cost. |
| **Third Class** | ≤ $1.5M | - Length: ≥400 ft<br>- Width: ≥65 ft<br>- Depth: 22 ft (tidal), 18 ft (non-tidal)<br>- Floating: ≥3,500-ton lifting capacity | Smallest class; lowest cost and subsidy. |

> All dimensions and capacities are specified to ensure functional adequacy for vessel repair.

### **6. Subsidy Calculation and Structure**

- The **total cost** of the dry dock (for subsidy purposes) includes:
  - Equipment, machinery, plant.
  - Good-faith expenditures for site purchase (if paid in cash).
  - **Excludes** value of sites received via gift or bonus.
- The cost is **fixed and determined by the Governor in Council**, based on the Minister’s recommendation, **before** the subsidy agreement is signed.

---

### **7. Subsidy Rates and Payment Terms**

#### **First-Class Dry Docks**
- Subsidy rate: **4.5% per annum**, payable **half-yearly**.
- Duration: **Up to 35 years** from completion date.
- Payments during construction:
  - Can begin once **$1 million** has been spent.
  - Only after the Minister determines work is done to satisfaction.
- **No subsidy** unless the Governor in Council confirms completion.
- **Maximum total subsidy** cannot exceed the authorized amount.

#### **Second-Class Dry Docks**
- Subsidy rate: **4.5% per annum**, payable **half-yearly**.
- Duration: **Up to 35 years**.
- Site spending threshold: **$500,000**.
- Payments during construction:
  - Start after **$500,000** is spent.
  - After 75% of total cost is spent and work is certified by the Minister, payments may increase to **90% of cost**.
- Same restrictions on timing and approval.

#### **Third-Class Dry Docks**
- Subsidy rate: **3% per annum**, payable **annually**.
- Duration: **Up to 20 years**.
- Lower subsidy rate reflects lower cost and scale.
- No mention of construction payments; likely follows similar principles but at reduced scale.

> All subsidy payments are subject to:
> - Ministerial certification of work completion.
> - Governor in Council’s final determination of completion.
> - Total subsidy cap (no overpayment).

    - At least **$1 million** (first class) or **$500,000** (second/third class) has been spent.
    - There are **no outstanding liens, encumbrances, or claims**.
- After certification, the Minister may permit:
  - Issuance of bonds/debentures.
  - Assignment of subsidy to a **trustee** (e.g., bondholder).
