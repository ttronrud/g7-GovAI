### **Detailed Summary of the *Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act***  

The *Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act* (STLEA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted on **March 30, 1993**, to fulfill long-standing treaty land entitlement obligations between the Government of Canada and various Indigenous bands in Saskatchewan. It establishes a formal legal and financial framework to address historical treaty land claims, particularly those arising from the 1870s and 1880s treaties with First Nations in Saskatchewan. The Act is rooted in two key agreements: the **Framework Agreement** and the **Nekaneet Treaty Land Entitlement Settlement Agreement**, and it incorporates a unique mechanism for land and revenue entitlements, including the creation of a dedicated fund and specific rights for Indigenous bands.

## **1. Purpose and Context**

The primary purpose of the Act is to:

- Fulfill Canada’s **outstanding treaty land entitlement obligations** to specific Indigenous bands in Saskatchewan.
- Provide a **legal and financial mechanism** through which these obligations are settled, ensuring that Indigenous communities receive land and revenue benefits in accordance with historical treaties.
- Establish a **special fund** to manage contributions from the provincial and federal governments.
- Ensure **co-management rights** and **autonomy** for bands in land-use decisions related to their entitlement reserves.

This Act emerged from the broader reconciliation efforts following decades of unresolved treaty land claims, particularly those stemming from the **1870 Treaty No. 4**, **Treaty No. 6**, and other treaties with First Nations in the Prairie provinces. The 1992 Framework Agreement and the Nekaneet Settlement Agreement were pivotal in structuring these entitlements.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The Act defines several critical terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Band** | Refers to 22 specific First Nations bands in Saskatchewan: Keeseekoose, Muskowekwan, Ochapowace, Okanese, Piapot, Star Blanket, Yellowquill, Beardy’s & Okemasis, Flying Dust, Little Pine, Moosomin, Mosquito Grizzly Bear’s Head, Muskeg Lake, One Arrow, Pelican Lake, Red Pheasant, Saulteaux, Sweetgrass, Thunderchild, Witchekan Lake, Canoe Lake, and English River. These bands are either parties to the Framework Agreement or have entered into a similar agreement under subsection 11(2). |
| **Framework Agreement** | A 1992 agreement between Canada, Saskatchewan, and the Entitlement Bands that outlines how Canada will fulfill its treaty land entitlement obligations. It includes provisions on land acquisition, mineral rights, revenue sharing, and co-management. |
| **Nekaneet Agreement** | A separate 1992 settlement agreement between Canada, Saskatchewan, and the Nekaneet Band, which resolves Canada’s treaty land entitlement obligations for that specific band. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of Indigenous Services** of Canada. |
| **NRTA Amendment Agreement** | The agreement that modifies the original **Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA)** of 1930. This is the core legal instrument through which the financial and land obligations are structured. |

> *Note:* Words and expressions not defined in the Act have the same meaning as in the NRTA Amendment Agreement.

## **3. Establishment of the Treaty Land Entitlement (Saskatchewan) Fund**

A **special account** is created within Canada’s federal accounts, known as the **Treaty Land Entitlement (Saskatchewan) Fund**.

### **Funding Mechanism:**
- **Existing balances**: All amounts previously paid into the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** by Her Majesty in right of Saskatchewan under **Section 3.07 of the Framework Agreement** (prior to the Act’s coming into force) are transferred to the Fund, along with any interest accrued under subsection 3.07(c).
- **Future contributions**: Any future contributions by Her Majesty in right of Saskatchewan under Section 3.07 are credited to the Fund.
- **Canada’s contributions**: Amounts contributed by Her Majesty in right of Canada under **Section 3.08** of the Framework Agreement are also credited to the Fund.

> This ensures continuity and transparency in financial obligations.

### **Interest on the Fund**
- The Minister of Finance may fix interest rates and terms for the Fund, based on advice from the Minister, to ensure the Fund grows over time.

---

## **4. Payment and Financial Obligations**

- The **Minister** may, on recommendation, **draw from the Consolidated Revenue Fund** and charge the Fund to pay amounts required under the Framework Agreement or Nekaneet Agreement.
- This ensures that the financial obligations are met without depleting general revenue.

---

## **5. Clarification on "Indian Money" (Under the Indian Act)**

To prevent misclassification, the Act explicitly states that **certain amounts are not "Indian moneys"** under the *Indian Act*:

- Payments made into or out of the **Treaty Land Entitlement (Saskatchewan) Fund** under the Framework or Nekaneet Agreements.
- Payments made to or for the benefit of a band under the Framework or Nekaneet Agreement (subject to Section 6).

> This distinction is crucial because it prevents the misapplication of the Indian Act’s rules on how revenues are distributed or controlled.

---

## **6. Revenue from Mineral Rights**

A significant innovation in the Act is the **management of mineral revenues**:

- When mineral rights are transferred by Her Majesty in right of Saskatchewan (as per Section 5.08 of the Framework or Nekaneet Agreement), **Her Majesty in right of Canada is authorized to receive mineral revenues**.
- These revenues are then **paid to Her Majesty in right of Saskatchewan** upon a direction from the **band council** (or Nekaneet Band council).
- This creates a **direct revenue flow** from mineral development to the band, ensuring that Indigenous communities benefit from resource extraction on their lands.

---

## **7. Application to Specific Bands**

### **Joseph Bighead, Onion Lake, Peter Ballantyne, and Poundmaker Bands**
- These bands are **not automatically covered** by the Act.
- The Act applies to them **only on the later of**:
  - The day they **adhere to the Framework Agreement**, or
  - The day the Act comes into force (March 30, 1993).

> This allows for phased implementation and ensures that only bands that formally commit to the agreement are included.

---

## **8. Confirmation of Agreements**

The Act confirms and gives legal force to:

- **Sections 6.04, 6.05, and 6.11** of both the Framework and Nekaneet Agreements — these relate to **co-management**, **land use**, and **decision-making authority**.
- Any new agreement entered into with a band on **the same or substantially the same basis** as the Framework Agreement is also confirmed and becomes effective if:
  - Canada and Saskatchewan enter into a similar **NRTA Amendment Agreement**.

> This ensures consistency and legal certainty in future settlements.

---

## **9. Co-Management and Governance Rights**

The Act grants bands the **capacity to enter into agreements** on key issues:

- **Co-management agreements** (subject to Section 6.10 of the Framework or Nekaneet Agreement) on matters such as:
  - Land use planning (Section 6.07)
  - Environmental management (Section 6.08)
  - Resource development (Section 6.09)

- **Agreements on matters** related to:
  - Section 9.01 (management of land and resources)
  - Section 11.10 (financial and administrative responsibilities)

> These agreements are **binding** on the band and, where applicable, on its **members**.

---

## **10. Release of Saskatchewan’s Obligations (Key Legal Provision)**

A landmark provision in the Act is that **Canada forever releases Saskatchewan from its obligations under the original Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA)** in respect of:

- Any Entitlement Band that has signed a **Band Specific Agreement** (or its equivalent), **on the earlier of**:
  - The **Shortfall Acres Acquisition Date** (when the band acquires land equal to its shortfall acreage), **or**
  - The date when **all required payments** from Saskatchewan to Canada and the Fund have been made.

- For the **Nekaneet Band**, the release occurs on the earlier of:
  - The **Shortfall Acres Acquisition Date**, **or**
  - The **fifth anniversary** of the date the Nekaneet Settlement Agreement was formally executed.

> This is a major step in **reducing provincial financial liability** and **transferring responsibility** to the bands themselves.

## **11. Historical Background: The NRTA and Its Amendments**

The Act is built upon the **Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA)** of **March 20, 1930**, which originally transferred unoccupied Crown lands to Saskatchewan for administrative purposes, with the understanding that Canada would fulfill treaty obligations by setting aside land for Indigenous reserves.

- The **NRTA Amendment Agreement** (entered into in 1992) modifies this by:
  - Replacing Saskatchewan’s obligation to set aside land under paragraph 10 of the NRTA with a **financial and land-based entitlement model**.
  - Establishing that **Saskatchewan will no longer be required to set aside land** if it is fulfilling its financial obligations under the Framework
