### **Detailed Summary of the Rouge National Urban Park Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**

The **Rouge National Urban Park Act** establishes **Rouge National Urban Park**, a unique protected area in southern Ontario, designed to preserve and present the region’s **natural, cultural, and agricultural heritage**. The park is located within the Rouge Valley — a region recognized as one of the last remnants of the **Carolinian forest ecosystem** in Canada. It also features significant geological formations and serves as a vital ecological corridor connecting **Lake Ontario** to the **Oak Ridges Moraine**, one of Canada’s most important watersheds.

The Act is grounded in several key principles:
- Recognition of the **historical and cultural significance** of the area, including its Aboriginal heritage.
- A commitment to **urban-rural integration**, enabling city dwellers to experience nature in a meaningful way.
- A vision of **sustainable development**, balancing conservation with community engagement and economic activity (particularly agriculture).
- The goal of making the park a **gateway to Canada’s broader national protected heritage areas**.
