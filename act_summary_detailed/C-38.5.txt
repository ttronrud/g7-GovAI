## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Act: Incorporation of the Continental Bank of Canada**

### **1. Purpose and Background**
This Act is enacted to incorporate a new financial institution — the **Continental Bank of Canada** (in English), known as *Banque Continentale du Canada* in French — under Canadian corporate and banking law. The incorporation is based on a petition by **IAC Limited**, a Canadian corporation, seeking to transform it into a chartered bank. The Act is considered expedient due to the strategic and financial significance of the transition.

The core objective is to **establish a chartered bank** that will eventually be fully integrated with IAC Limited through a statutory amalgamation, ensuring regulatory compliance while preserving existing rights, structures, and financial obligations.

### **2. Incorporation of the Bank**
- **Name**:  
  - English: *Continental Bank of Canada*  
  - French: *Banque Continentale du Canada*  
  - Referred to throughout as the “Bank”

- **Structure**:  
  The Bank is incorporated as a corporation with shareholders who are individuals or entities who own shares in the Bank at any given time.

  Located in **Metropolitan Toronto, Ontario**.

- **Authorized Capital Stock**:

### **3. Provisional Directors**
- The **directors of IAC Limited** on the day the Act comes into force become the **provisional directors** of the Bank.

- **Eligibility for Provisional Directorship**:
  - A director of IAC Limited must own **at least 100 common shares** of IAC Limited in their **individual capacity** (not as trustee or on behalf of another).
  - This requirement **exempts** the Bank from the standard Bank Act rule that provisional directors must be subscribers to the bank’s stock (subsection 10(2) of the Bank Act).

> ✅ *This allows for a smoother transition without requiring immediate shareholder subscriptions.*

---

### **4. Corporate Control and Subsidiary Definitions**
- A corporation is considered a **subsidiary** of another only if it is **controlled** by that parent corporation or by a chain of corporations ultimately controlled by the parent.

- This definition applies to all corporate relationships relevant to the Bank and IAC Limited.

---

### **5. Powers, Privileges, and Liabilities**
- The Bank is granted **all powers, privileges, immunities, and liabilities** under the **Bank Act**, **except** where specifically excluded by this Act or the Bank Act itself.
- This ensures the Bank operates under the full regulatory framework of the Bank Act as a chartered bank.

### **6. Exemptions and Special Provisions for the Transitional Period**
The Act includes a **ten-year transitional period** (or until amalgamation, whichever occurs first) during which certain provisions of the Bank Act are **modified or suspended** to facilitate the transition from IAC Limited to the new Bank.

#### Key Exemptions:
| Provision | Explanation |

### **9. Mandatory Amalgamation**

- **Shareholders of IAC Limited** who were entitled to hold shares before amalgamation may **continue to hold shares in the new Bank** after amalgamation.

> ✅ This protects existing shareholders from sudden loss of rights due to regulatory changes.

---

### **11. Amalgamation Without Shareholder Approval**

- If the amalgamation occurs **before July 15, 1984**, and there are **debentures with conversion rights into IAC Limited shares** issued before October 28, 1975:
  - These **conversion rights remain valid** until July 15, 1984.
  - Shares of the Bank may be issued upon conversion.
  - **Exception**: Shares may not be issued to someone from whom a subscription could not be accepted under **paragraphs 53(4)(a) or (b)** or **subsection 56(2)** of the Bank Act.
