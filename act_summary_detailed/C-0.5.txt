### **Detailed Summary of the *Canada and Taiwan Territories Tax Arrangement Act, 2016***

---

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose**
The *Canada and Taiwan Territories Tax Arrangement Act, 2016* establishes a formal tax treaty-like framework between Canada and Taiwan (referred to as the "territories") to:
- Avoid **double taxation** of income;
- Prevent **fiscal evasion**;
- Provide clarity and fairness in the taxation of individuals and enterprises operating across both jurisdictions.

This Act is not a bilateral tax treaty in the traditional sense but functions as a **legal instrument** that gives legal force to an agreement between two Canadian government offices and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

##### **(a) The "Arrangement"**
- The Arrangement is defined in **Schedule 1** and amended by a **Protocol in Schedule 2**.
- It is an agreement between:
  - The **Canadian Trade Office in Taipei**;
  - The **Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada**.
- The Arrangement is **approved by Canada** and has **full legal force** during the period it is in effect.

##### **(b) Legal Precedence**
- In case of **inconsistency** between:
  - This Act or the Arrangement and any other Canadian law,
  → The provisions of this Act and the Arrangement **prevail**.
- If there is an inconsistency with the **Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act (ITCIA)**:
  → The ITCIA provisions **prevail**.

##### **(c) Interpretation of Terms**
For the purposes of applying Canadian tax laws (Income Tax Act, Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act, etc.), references to:
- “Country” or “state” → are interpreted as “country or jurisdiction” or “state or jurisdiction”;
- “Treaty”, “convention”, or “agreement” → include the Arrangement;
- The Arrangement is treated as an agreement between **Canada and the jurisdiction of Taiwan**.

> This ensures that the Arrangement is recognized as a binding tax agreement under Canadian tax law.

#### **3. Regulatory Authority**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** may make regulations necessary to implement the Arrangement.
- The **Minister of Finance** is required to:
  - Publish in the *Canada Gazette* within **60 days** of:
    - The **later of two notifications** under Section 27 of the Arrangement (as of December 19, 2016);
    - The **end of a calendar year** when the Arrangement ceases to apply.

> This ensures transparency and public notice of key dates related to the Arrangement’s operation.
