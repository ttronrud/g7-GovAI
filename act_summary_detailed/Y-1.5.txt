**Detailed Summary of the *Youth Criminal Justice Act* (YCJA)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Youth Criminal Justice Act* (YCJA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted to establish a distinct, rights-based, and rehabilitative youth criminal justice system. It reflects Canada’s commitment to the principles of the **United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)** and the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, emphasizing the unique developmental, emotional, and social needs of young persons aged 12 to 17 (and sometimes including those aged 18 under specific circumstances).

The Act balances **public safety**, **accountability**, and **rehabilitation**, with a clear mandate to reduce the overuse of incarceration among youth, especially for non-violent offences. It promotes early intervention, community-based solutions, and meaningful participation by victims, families, and youth themselves.

## **Key Provisions and Principles**

### **1. Foundational Principles of the Youth Criminal Justice System**

The YCJA is built on several core principles that guide all aspects of the system:

#### **(a) Protection of the Public**
- The system must protect the public through **proportionate accountability**.
- Measures must be **appropriate to the seriousness of the offence** and the **level of responsibility** of the young person.

#### **(b) Rehabilitation and Reintegration**
- The primary goal is not punishment, but **rehabilitation and reintegration** into society.
- The system emphasizes **correcting underlying causes** of offending behaviour (e.g., poverty, trauma, lack of education, family issues).

#### **(c) Separation from Adult Justice**
- The youth justice system is **distinct from adult criminal justice**.
- It recognizes that young persons have **diminished moral blameworthiness** due to their **immaturity, lack of experience, and ongoing development**.

#### **(d) Fair and Proportionate Accountability**
- Accountability must be fair and proportionate, considering:
  - The young person’s age and level of maturity.
  - The nature and severity of the offence.
  - The individual’s background and circumstances.

#### **(e) Enhanced Procedural Protections**
- Young persons have **special rights and protections**, including:
  - Right to be heard.
  - Right to privacy.
  - Right to legal counsel.
  - Right to participate in processes affecting them (except the decision to prosecute).

#### **(f) Timely Intervention**
- The system must act **promptly** to reinforce the link between offending behaviour and its consequences.
- Delays are seen as harmful, especially given how youth perceive time.

#### **(g) Inclusivity and Cultural Sensitivity**
- The system must:
  - Respect **gender, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences**.
  - Respond to the **special needs of Indigenous youth** and youth with disabilities or other special requirements.

## **Core Mechanisms and Processes**

### **3. Preference for Extrajudicial Measures (Non-Judicial Interventions)**

The Act strongly **prioritizes extrajudicial measures** as the first response to youth offending, especially for **non-violent offences**.

#### **When Extrajudicial Measures Are Appropriate**
- The young person has **committed a non-violent offence**.
- The young person has **no prior record** of offending.
- The offence is **not serious or violent**.

#### **Types of Extrajudicial Measures**
- **Warning**: A formal statement that the young person has done something wrong.
- **Caution**: A more formal warning, often with a requirement to avoid future offending.
- **Referral to a community program**: To address underlying issues (e.g., mental health, substance use, family conflict).

#### **Police Duty to Consider Alternatives**
- Before initiating judicial proceedings, a **police officer must consider**:
  - Whether **no action** is sufficient.
  - Whether a **warning or caution** is appropriate.
  - Whether a **community referral** would help.
- Failure to consider these options **does not invalidate charges**.

#### **Establishing Cautions Programs**
- The **Attorney General** may establish programs allowing:
  - Police to administer cautions.
  - Prosecutors to administer cautions.
- These programs are designed to **avoid unnecessary court involvement**.

### **4. Use of Extrajudicial Sanctions**

An **extrajudicial sanction** is a formal measure (e.g., community service, restitution, education program) used when a warning or referral is **insufficient** due to:
- The **seriousness of the offence**.
- The **nature or number of prior offences**.
- Other **aggravating circumstances**.

#### **Conditions for Use**
To use an extrajudicial sanction, the following must be met:
1. It must be part of a **program authorized by the Attorney General or a provincial body**.
2. The decision-maker must be **satisfied it is appropriate** given the young person’s needs and societal interests.
3. The young person must **freely and fully consent** to the sanction.
4. The young person must be **advised of their right to legal counsel** and have a **reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel**.
5. The young person must **accept responsibility** for the offence.
6. There must be **sufficient evidence** to proceed with prosecution.
7. The prosecution is **not barred by law**.

#### **Prohibitions on Use**
Extrajudicial sanctions **cannot be used if**:
- The young person **denies involvement** in the offence.
- The young person **wishes to be tried in a youth justice court**.

#### **Inadmissibility of Admission in Evidence**
- Any **confession, admission, or statement** made as a condition of extrajudicial measures is **inadmissible in civil or criminal proceedings** against the young person.

---

### **5. Judicial Proceedings (When Necessary)**

If extrajudicial measures are not sufficient or if the young person refuses them, the case proceeds to a **youth justice court**.

#### **Dismissal of Charges Based on Compliance**
- If the young person **fully complies** with the extrajudicial sanction, the youth justice court **must dismiss the charge**.
- If the young person **partially complies**, the court **may dismiss the charge** if it determines that prosecution would be **unfair**, considering:
  - The young person’s performance.
  - The circumstances of the case.

> This encourages **rehabilitation over punishment** and reduces the number of youth going to court.

---

### **6. Victim and Family Involvement**

The Act places strong emphasis on **victim rights and family engagement**:

#### **Victim Rights**
- Victims must be treated with **courtesy, compassion, and respect**.
- They have the **right to be informed** about proceedings.
- They are given the **opportunity to participate** in decisions about the response to the offence.
- They may be informed of how the offence was dealt with (e.g., through a sanction or court process).

#### **Parental Notification**
- Parents must be **informed** when their child is dealt with through an extrajudicial sanction.
- Parents are encouraged to **support** their child in addressing offending behaviour.

---

### **7. Recordkeeping and Disclosure**

- **Records** include any physical or digital information created or kept for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting youth offences.
- **Disclosure** (non-public communication) is allowed for specific purposes (e.g., legal advice, program implementation).
- **Publication** (making information publicly available) is **restricted** and only allowed under specific circumstances (e.g., public interest, safety concerns).
- Evidence of **warnings, cautions, or referrals** is **inadmissible** in future proceedings as **prior offending behaviour**.
