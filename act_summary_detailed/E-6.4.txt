**Detailed Summary of the *Energy Efficiency Act* of Canada**

---

### **Overview**

The *Energy Efficiency Act* is a federal law enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. Its primary objective is to promote energy efficiency in Canada by establishing standards, labeling requirements, and enforcement mechanisms for energy-using products. The Act aims to reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and support the transition to a more sustainable and energy-efficient economy.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

The Act is structured into several key sections, each addressing different aspects of energy efficiency regulation, compliance, enforcement, and reporting. Below is a comprehensive, point-by-point summary of its core components.

---

### **1. Definitions and Scope**

The Act begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Energy-using product**: Any product prescribed by regulation that consumes energy (e.g., appliances, vehicles, heating systems).
- **Dealer**: A person involved in the supply chain of energy-using products, including:
  - Manufacturing them in Canada,
  - Importing them into Canada, or
  - Selling or leasing them (directly or indirectly) from a manufacturer or agent.
- **Energy efficiency standard**: A performance benchmark set by regulation for a product or class of products (e.g., minimum energy consumption levels).
- **Inspector**: A person designated by the Minister to enforce compliance with the Act.
- **Manufacture**: Includes assembly or modification of products for sale or lease.
- **Minister**: The Minister of Natural Resources, responsible for administering the Act.

> **Note**: A reference to a "class" of energy-using products includes those based on shared energy-use characteristics, intended use, or typical usage conditions.

### **2. Compliance Requirements for Dealers**

#### **Section 4 – Shipping, Importing, and Labeling**
- **Prohibition on Non-Compliant Products**:
  - No dealer may ship an energy-using product from one province to another or import it into Canada **unless**:
    1. The product complies with the applicable energy efficiency standard; and  
    2. The product or its packaging is labeled in accordance with the regulations.

- **Prohibition on Tampering with Labels**:
  - No person may remove, deface, obscure, or alter any label applied to a product or its packaging **before** it is sold or leased to the first retail purchaser or lessee.

- **Exception**:
  - If the requirements of Section 4(1)(b) are met **before** the product leaves the dealer’s possession or that of a consignee, the dealer does not contravene the rule.

#### **Section 5 – Reporting Requirements**
- Every dealer required to ship or import energy-using products must provide the Minister with **prescribed information** in a specific form, manner, and time.
- This information includes:
  - Energy efficiency of the products,
  - Details of shipment or importation.

- **Exemption from Reporting**:
  - The dealer is not required to report on specific products if:
    1. The information was previously provided under this section; or  
    2. Information on comparable products (differing only in non-energy-efficiency aspects) has already been provided.

#### **Section 6 – Product Availability for Testing**
- The Minister may require any dealer to make available at a specified location a **number of products** deemed reasonably necessary for examination and testing.
- The dealer must comply immediately.

#### **Section 7 – Testing and Recordkeeping**
- The Minister may **dismantle and test** any product made available for inspection to determine its actual energy efficiency.
- The Minister may not retain a product longer than reasonably necessary for testing, **unless** the dealer consents to extended retention.

> **Exception**: An inspector may **seize and detain** a product if:
> - There is reasonable belief that the Act or regulations have been violated, and
> - The violation occurred through or in relation to the product, or
> - The product will provide evidence of the violation.

> **Application of Section 11**: Sections 11(2), (3), and 13–18 apply to seized products **as if** they were things seized under Section 11(1) of the Act.

#### **Section 8 – Inspector Powers**
- Inspectors may enter and inspect any place where:
  - An energy-using product is present,
  - The product is owned by or on the premises of a dealer or consignee,
  - Or where required records are kept.

- During inspections, inspectors may:
  - Examine products or related items,
  - Open and inspect packages,
  - Review documents or records and make copies,
  - Conduct tests or take measurements.

- **Use of Technology**:
  - Inspectors may use computer systems to access relevant data,
  - Reproduce records as printouts or outputs,
  - Take copies for examination.

- **Private Property Access**:
  - Entry into private dwellings is **prohibited without consent**.
  - However, a **warrant** can be issued by a justice of the peace upon ex parte application if:
    - There are reasonable grounds to believe a product is present,
    - Entry is necessary for enforcement purposes,
    - Entry has been refused or is likely to be refused.
  - The warrant may include specific conditions.
  - **Force may only be used if** the inspector is accompanied by a peace officer and force is specifically authorized in the warrant.

### **3. Seizure, Detention, and Forfeiture of Products**

#### **Section 11 – Seizure and Detention**
- An inspector may seize a product or related item if:
  - There is reasonable belief that a violation has occurred, and
  - The product or item is connected to the violation or will provide evidence.

- **Storage**:
  - A seized item may be stored at the original location or moved elsewhere.
  - If moved at the owner’s request, **the owner pays storage and removal costs**.

- **Prohibition on Unauthorized Interference**:
  - No person may remove, alter, or interfere with a seized item **without inspector authorization**.
  - The owner or person in possession may request an inspection.

#### **Section 12 – Time Limits and Return of Seized Items**
- A seized item **cannot be detained beyond 120 days** after seizure unless:
  - It has been forfeited under Section 15, or
  - Legal proceedings have been initiated regarding the violation.

- If proceedings are ongoing:
  - The item may remain detained until the proceedings are concluded or a return order is issued.

- **Court Application for Return**:
  - The owner may apply to the court to have the item returned if:
    - The court finds sufficient evidence exists or can reasonably be obtained without detention.
    - The return is subject to conditions to preserve the item for future use.

#### **Section 13 – Forfeiture**
- **Voluntary Forfeiture**:
  - If the owner consents in writing to the forfeiture of a seized item, it is **forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

    - The item is forfeited to Her Majesty **in addition to any punishment**; or
    - It is returned to the original owner or entitled person **after appeal or final proceedings**, subject to conditions to prevent future violations.

- **Costs of Forfeiture**:
  - The **offender pays** the costs of disposal or destruction of forfeited items.

#### **Section 14 – Forfeiture of Non-Compliant Imports**
- If an energy-using product is **not removed from Canada** within:

  - **90 days** after notice delivery (if no period is specified),
  - The product is **automatically forfeited** to Her Majesty.

- **Disposal Costs**:
  - The **importer pays** the costs of disposal or destruction.

> **Note**: Sections 74–76 of the *Fisheries Act* apply to forfeited items, treating them as "things forfeited" under that Act.

---

### **4. Disclosure and Warranty Provisions**

- **No Implied Warranty**:
  - Any disclosure of energy efficiency data made by a dealer under this Act **does not create an express or implied warranty** that the product will perform as tested under real-world conditions.

> This protects manufacturers and dealers from liability for performance variations in actual use.
