**Detailed Summary of the Dominion Water Power Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Dominion Water Power Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted to establish federal control over the development, management, and utilization of **water-power resources** on **public lands**. It grants the federal government exclusive authority to manage and develop hydroelectric and other water-based power systems for the **general advantage of Canada**, ensuring that such resources are used in a way that serves national economic and public interest goals.

The Act was introduced in the early 20th century (with a key date of June 6, 1919, marking a critical threshold in land rights and development) and remains relevant in shaping Canada’s approach to water resource management, particularly in relation to hydroelectric projects.

## **Key Definitions**

The Act begins by defining key terms essential to its operation:

1. **Dominion water-powers**  
   - Refers to any water-power on **public lands** or any water-power owned by Canada that is administered or may be administered by the Minister.  
   - **Excludes** water-powers on lands under the administration of the **Commissioner of Yukon or the Northwest Territories**, recognizing regional jurisdictional differences.

2. **Minister**  
   - Initially refers to the **Minister of Indigenous Services**.  
   - In **Nunavut**, the Minister of Northern Affairs has jurisdiction over public lands.

3. **Public lands**  
   - Lands belonging to Her Majesty in right of Canada.  
   - Includes lands where the Government of Canada has power to dispose.  
   - **Excludes** lands under the control of the Commissioners of Yukon or the Northwest Territories.

4. **Stream or water**  
   - Broadly defined to include rivers, brooks, lakes, ponds, creeks, and any flowing or standing water.

5. **Undertaking**  
   - A comprehensive term covering all activities related to the development, transmission, and use of water-power. This includes:
     - Storage, regulation, diversion, and use of water.
     - Generation of auxiliary energy (e.g., at power plants).
     - Surveying, construction, maintenance, and operation of infrastructure (dams, flumes, power stations, transmission lines).
     - Acquisition of land or property.
     - Administration and management of associated operations.
     - Incidental matters.

6. **Water-power**  
   - Any force or energy derived from flowing or falling water that has **commercial value**—regardless of form (hydroelectric, mechanical, etc.).

---

## **Scope of Application**

The Act applies broadly to:

- All **Dominion water-powers**.
- All **public lands** required for:
  - Development or operation of water-power.
  - Protection of water-power.
  - Incidental purposes.
- Any **lands or properties acquired** under the Act or for such purposes.
- The **power and energy** produced from these waters—even if not distributed on public lands.
- All **undertakings** established or operated under the Act.
- All **incidental matters** related to the above.

---

## **Ownership and Property Rights**

- The **property in and right to use** all Dominion water-powers are **vested in and remain with the Crown** (i.e., the Government of Canada).
- **Exception**: Any rights previously granted by the Crown **before June 6, 1919**, are preserved and not extinguished by this Act.

> This establishes a **federal monopoly** over water-power resources, with only historical pre-1919 rights being exceptions.

---

## **Restrictions on Land Use and Entry**

- Public lands on which water-power exists or is required for protection or development:
  - Are **not open to entry** by private individuals.
  - **No lease, grant, or conveyance** of interest in such lands can occur **after June 6, 1919**, unless authorized under this Act or its regulations.
- Any such grant after that date **does not confer exclusive or proprietary rights** in the land.

> This prevents private exploitation of water-power lands and ensures federal control.

---

## **Expropriation Powers**

The Act provides robust mechanisms for acquiring land for undertakings:

1. **Governor in Council Authority**  
   - May direct the **Minister** to expropriate land required for an undertaking or for protecting/developing water-power.  
   - The **Expropriation Act** applies fully in such cases.

2. **Private Expropriation (with Minister’s Permission)**  
   - Any person authorized under the Act may **expropriate private land** (not public land) if the Minister determines it is necessary for the undertaking.  
   - The Minister must grant **written permission**.

3. **Status of Expropriated Land**  
   - Land so expropriated is deemed an **interest in land or real right** for public purposes under the Expropriation Act.  
   - A reference to "the Crown" in the Expropriation Act is interpreted as referring to the **person authorized** by the Minister.

4. **Fees and Charges**  
   - The Minister may regulate **fees and charges** for expropriation, including **interest** on unpaid amounts.  
   - These fees are **debt due to Her Majesty** and accrue from the date of payment.

5. **Security Requirements**  
   - The person granted permission may be required to provide **security** (determined by the Minister) to cover potential fees or charges.

6. **Exclusion Clause**  
   - The Act **does not apply** to land owned by railway companies used for railway purposes.

## **Cancellation of Unauthorized Land Use**

- If a **lease, permit, entry, or agreement** interferes with an undertaking:
  - The **Governor in Council** may cancel the agreement **in whole or in part** or modify its terms to preserve Crown rights.
- **Compensation** must be paid to affected parties:
  - In **complete cancellation**: Includes:
    - Actual payments made to the Crown (with **6% interest**).
    - Estimated actual loss or damage.
  - In **partial cancellation**: Includes the **reasonable market value** of the land or interest taken.

> Compensation is determined by the **Minister**, subject to **appeal to the Federal Court**.

---

## **Joint Development of Water-Powers**

Where multiple water-powers are located in a way that makes **joint development more economical**, the Governor in Council may:

1. **If not yet granted**: Order their **joint development and single control** under federal oversight.

2. **If already granted to a private party**: Reserve the remaining water-powers for a period deemed necessary to achieve joint development and single control.

   - The Minister may then enter into an **agreement** with the holder of the rights.
   - The agreement may include **specific terms, conditions, and covenants**.

> This ensures that **public interest** prevails over fragmented private ownership, promoting efficiency and national coordination.

## **Survey, Measurement, and Monitoring**

The Minister has broad authority to:

- Conduct **surveys** and investigations to:
  - Identify lands needed for undertakings.
  - Determine total available water-power and potential from storage or regulation.
  - Measure water flow and energy output.
  - Install **gauges, weirs, meters**, and other measurement devices.

- **Records** of these surveys and investigations must be kept in the **Department of Indigenous Services** and may be published at the Minister’s discretion.

- The **Director of Water-Power** (a duly qualified officer) is responsible for overseeing all investigations and undertakings.

- The Minister has **free access** to all records, plans, and works related to undertakings to:
  - Monitor water storage, diversion, and usage.
  - Assess power generation capacity.
  - Evaluate compliance with operational conditions.
  - Ensure proper administration of the Act.

> Findings of the Minister on water volume and power output are **conclusive** and binding.

---

## **Cooperative Agreements with Provinces**

- The Minister may enter into **cooperative agreements** with provincial authorities to:
  - Conduct stream measurements.
  - Carry out investigations.
  - Collect, analyze, and publish data on water and power resources.
