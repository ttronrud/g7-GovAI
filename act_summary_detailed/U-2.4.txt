### **Detailed Summary of the *United Nations Foreign Arbitral Awards Convention Act***  
*(Cited as: United Nations Foreign Arbitral Awards Convention Act)*

This Act is the Canadian implementation of the **United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958)**, commonly known as the **New York Convention**. The Act establishes the legal framework under which Canadian courts will recognize and enforce foreign arbitral awards in accordance with international standards, ensuring consistency, fairness, and predictability in international commercial dispute resolution.

## **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The primary purpose of the Act is to **enable the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards** in Canada, in line with the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, adopted on June 10, 1958. It ensures that arbitral awards made in other countries are treated as binding and enforceable in Canada, provided they meet certain criteria.

- **"Convention"**: Refers to the 1958 UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, as set out in the Schedule to the Act.
- **"Commercial Legal Relationships"**: The Convention applies only to disputes arising from **commercial relationships**, whether contractual or not. This excludes purely personal, domestic, or non-commercial disputes.
- **"Arbitral Awards"**: Includes:
  - Awards made by individual arbitrators appointed for each case.
  - Awards made by **permanent arbitral bodies** (e.g., ICC, SIAC) to which the parties have submitted.

  - Arbitration clauses embedded in contracts.
  - Separate arbitration agreements signed by parties or contained in letters, telegrams, or other formal communications.

## **3. Application of the Convention**

### **Scope of Application**
- Applies to **arbitral awards made in a foreign country** (not in Canada) and sought to be enforced in Canada.
- Applies to **differences between individuals or legal entities**, regardless of nationality.

---

## **4. Priority Over Other Laws**

- In the event of **conflict between this Act, the Convention, and any other Canadian law**, the provisions of this Act and the Convention **prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.
- This ensures that international standards take precedence over conflicting domestic laws when it comes to enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.

---

## **5. Jurisdiction for Recognition and Enforcement**

- Any **superior, district, or county court** in Canada may hear applications for recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award.
- This provides flexibility and accessibility for parties seeking enforcement.

---

## **6. Publication and Judicial Notice**

- The **Minister of Justice** must publish in the *Canada Gazette*:
  - The date the Convention comes into force.
  - The date it ceases to be in force.
- Such notices are **judicially noticed**, meaning courts must treat them as true and binding without requiring further proof.

---

## **7. Regulatory Powers**

- The Minister of Justice may make **regulations** necessary to:
  - Implement the Convention.
  - Give effect to its provisions.
- These regulations may include procedural rules, translation requirements, or court practices.

---

## **8. Enforcement Process and Requirements**

1. **The original award or a certified copy** (duly authenticated).
2. **The original arbitration agreement or a certified copy** (as defined in Article II).
3. **Translation** (if the award or agreement is not in an official language of the country where enforcement is sought):
   - Must be certified by:
     - An official or sworn translator, or
     - A diplomatic or consular agent.

> *Note:* The translation must be accurate and legally valid.

---

## **9. Grounds for Refusal of Recognition or Enforcement**

An award may be refused enforcement **only if** one or more of the following conditions are met:

### **(a) Invalidity of the Agreement**
- The parties were under **incapacity** (e.g., minors, mentally incapacitated).
- The agreement is **invalid under applicable law** (e.g., void due to fraud, illegality, or public policy).
- The agreement was not valid under the law of the country where the award was made.

### **(b) Lack of Proper Notice**
- The party against whom the award is invoked was **not properly notified** of:
  - The appointment of arbitrators.
  - The commencement of arbitration proceedings.
- Or was otherwise **unable to present their case**.

### **(c) Scope of the Award**
- The award deals with a **difference not contemplated** by the arbitration agreement.
- Or contains decisions on matters **outside the scope** of the submission to arbitration.
- **Exception**: If the award can be separated into:
  - Part dealing with matters within the scope of arbitration.
  - Part dealing with matters outside the scope.
  → Only the **valid part** may be recognized and enforced.

### **(d) Improper Composition or Procedure**
- The composition of the arbitral body (e.g., number of arbitrators) or the procedure (e.g., rules of conduct) was:
  - Not in accordance with the **parties’ agreement**, or
  - Not in accordance with the **law of the country where arbitration occurred** (in the absence of an agreement).

### **(e) Award Not Yet Binding or Set Aside**
- The award has **not yet become binding** on the parties.
- It has been **set aside or suspended** by a competent authority in the country where it was made.

### **(f) Public Policy Objections**
- The subject matter of the dispute is **not capable of settlement by arbitration** under the law of the country where enforcement is sought.
- The enforcement of the award would be **contrary to public policy** (e.g., fraud, illegality, or violation of fundamental rights).

> *Note:* These grounds are strict and require clear, legally supported evidence.

---

## **10. Special Provisions on Adjournment and Security**

- If an application for **setting aside or suspension** of the award has been filed in the country where the award was made:
  - The court where enforcement is sought may **adjourn** its decision.
  - It may also, at the request of the party seeking enforcement, **order the other party to provide suitable security** (e.g., bond or guarantee) to protect against potential damages.

---

## **11. Non-Conflict with Other Agreements**

- The Convention **does not invalidate**:
  - Multilateral or bilateral agreements on arbitration enforcement between Contracting States.
  - Any rights of parties to use arbitral awards in accordance with domestic law or existing treaties.

> This ensures that parties retain flexibility and that the Convention does not undermine existing national or international frameworks.

---

## **12. Supersession of Older Treaties**

- The **Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses (1923)** and the **Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1927)** are **replaced** by this Convention between Contracting States.
- This ensures that the 1958 Convention supersedes outdated international instruments in matters of foreign arbitral awards.

- The Convention is open for **signature** by:
  - Any UN Member State.
  - Any state that is a member of a UN specialized agency.

---

## **14. Extension to Territories**

- A state may, at the time of signing, ratifying, or acceding, declare that the Convention applies to **one or more of its territories** (e.g., provinces, overseas territories).
- Such extension takes effect when the Convention enters into force for the state.
- Any future extension must be notified to the UN Secretary-General and takes effect:
  - 90 days after notification, or
  - On the date the Convention enters into force for the state — whichever is later.

> *Note:* For federal or non-unitary states, constitutional considerations may require consent from local governments.

---

## **15. Federal and Provincial Responsibilities (Federal States)**

For **federal states** (like Canada):

- **Federal jurisdiction**: The federal government has the same obligations as a non-federal state under the Convention.
- **Provincial/constituent jurisdiction**: If provinces or constituent units are not constitutionally required to act, the federal government must **inform them** of the Convention’s provisions and encourage legislative action.
- **Information sharing**: At the request of any other Contracting State, a federal state must provide a **statement of its domestic law and practice** regarding specific provisions of the Convention, showing how it has been implemented.
