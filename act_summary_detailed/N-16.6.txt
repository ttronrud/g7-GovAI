### **Detailed Summary of the *National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act***  

This Act establishes the **National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICP)**, a parliamentary oversight body designed to provide independent, non-partisan review of Canada’s national security and intelligence activities.
