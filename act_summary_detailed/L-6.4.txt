### **Background and Purpose**

The Act begins with a series of "whereas" clauses that establish the rationale and significance of the legislation:

1. **Recognition of Contributions**:  
   The Parliament acknowledges that members of the Latin American community have made substantial and lasting contributions to Canada’s social, economic, and political development. These contributions include advancements in education, business, public service, arts, science, and civic leadership, reflecting the integral role Latin Americans play in Canadian society.

2. **Educational and Cultural Significance of a Heritage Month**:  
   The designation of a specific month—Latin American Heritage Month—serves as a formal and sustained mechanism to remember, celebrate, and educate the broader Canadian public about the history, traditions, languages, and achievements of Latin American communities. This helps foster greater understanding, inclusion, and respect among all Canadians.

3. **Community Mobilization and Cultural Exchange**:  
   The Act emphasizes that a dedicated month provides a platform for Latin American communities across Canada to come together, share their cultural expressions (such as music, dance, cuisine, festivals, language, and art), and promote intercultural dialogue. This collective celebration strengthens community cohesion and encourages cross-cultural appreciation.

4. **Global Context**:  
   October is highlighted as a month of significance for Latin American communities worldwide—particularly due to historical events such as the October 1968 celebration of the founding of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the broader cultural and political milestones in Latin America. By aligning Canada’s observance with this global context, the Act reinforces international solidarity and cultural continuity.
