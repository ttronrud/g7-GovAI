The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of various sections of a statute, specifically:

> **[Repealed, 2011, c. 25, s. 39]**  
> **[Repealed, 2011, c. 25, s. 6]**  
> **[Repealed, 1998, c. 17, s. 9]**

However, **no actual act or legislation is presented** — only a list of repealed sections. Therefore, **there is no detailed summary of an act** to provide, because the content does not describe a substantive law, its provisions, objectives, or structure.

### Detailed Interpretation of the Text:

1. **"Repealed" Meaning**:
   - "Repealed" means that a specific section (or provision) of a statute has been formally **cancelled or abolished** by a subsequent law.
   - These references indicate that certain legal provisions were removed from the statute book.

2. **Citation Format**:
   - **c. 25**: Refers to a specific **chapter** of an act (e.g., "Chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada").
   - **s. 39 or s. 6**: Refers to **Section 39 or Section 6** within that chapter.
   - **1998, c. 17, s. 9**: Indicates a section (s. 9) of a law from 1998, Chapter 17.

3. **Repeal Dates**:
   - Sections were repealed in **2011** (via Chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada) and one in **1998** (via Chapter 17).

4. **Frequency of Repeals**:
   - The list contains **over 50 repeated entries**, all pointing to the same repealed sections. This suggests a **duplicate or automated listing**, possibly from a database or legal reference system where multiple instances of the same repeal are rendered.

### Conclusion:

❌ **There is no detailed summary of an act** because:

- The content provided is **not a law or act** itself.
- It is a **list of repealed sections**, not a description of a legislative act.
- No substantive provisions, purposes, or legal framework are described.

✅ **Correct Summary (of the provided text):**

> The provided text is a list of repeated references indicating that certain sections of a statute have been repealed. Specifically, sections 39 and 6 of Chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada (repealed in 2011), and section 9 of Chapter 17 of the Statutes of Canada (repealed in 1998), have been formally removed from the law. The repeated nature of the entries suggests a technical or database listing rather than a substantive legislative text. As such, no detailed summary of an act can be provided, since no actual act is presented.

If you intended to provide a specific act (e.g., the *Canada Elections Act*, *Criminal Code*, or another statute) and only included the repeal notices by mistake, please share the full name or content of the act, and I will gladly provide a detailed summary.
