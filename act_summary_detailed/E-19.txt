**Detailed Summary of the *Export and Import Permits Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA) is a key piece of Canadian legislation that governs the regulation of the **export and import of certain goods and technologies**. It provides the legal framework for the Canadian government to control trade flows in order to protect national security, ensure domestic supply, support domestic industries, and comply with international obligations.

The Act empowers the federal government—specifically the Governor in Council (acting on the advice of the Minister)—to establish **lists of controlled goods, technologies, and countries**, and to regulate their movement in and out of Canada. These controls are applied through **permits, allocations, and restrictions**, with specific provisions for sensitive items like weapons, strategic materials, and goods that threaten domestic producers.

---

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

### 1. **Core Lists**
- **Export Control List (ECL)**  
  A list of goods and technologies that the Governor in Council may regulate for national security or economic reasons.  
  *Purpose:* Prevents the proliferation of weapons, protects strategic resources, ensures domestic supply, and supports intergovernmental commitments.

- **Import Control List (ICL)**  
  A list of goods whose importation may be restricted to protect domestic industries or ensure supply.  
  *Purpose:* Prevents serious injury to Canadian producers by limiting imports that could undercut domestic prices or market share.

- **Area Control List (ACL)**  
  A list of countries to which the export or transfer of certain goods or technologies is restricted.  
  *Purpose:* To prevent the flow of sensitive items to countries deemed a risk to Canadian security or interests.

- **Automatic Firearms Country Control List (AFCCL)**  
  A list of countries to which the export of certain firearms (prohibited under the Criminal Code) may be permitted, *if* those items are included in the Export Control List.  
  *Purpose:* To allow controlled exports of specific firearms to certain countries while maintaining strict security oversight.

- **Brokering Control List (BCL)**  
  A list of goods and technologies whose *brokering* (arranging or negotiating transactions involving movement across foreign borders) is regulated.  
  *Purpose:* To prevent third-party intermediaries from facilitating illicit or unauthorized trade in controlled items.

> **Note:** Brokering includes not only physical transactions but also the acquisition, disposition, or disclosure of technology content.

## **Purposes for Export Controls (Section 3)**

The Governor in Council may establish an **Export Control List** for any of the following reasons:

1. **National Security**  
   Prevent the availability of arms, ammunition, war materials, or strategic goods to destinations where their use could threaten Canada’s security.

2. **Protection of Domestic Resources**  
   Ensure that natural resources produced in Canada are not exported in unrestricted quantities, which could undermine efforts to process them locally.

3. **Surplus Management**  
   Limit or monitor exports of raw or processed materials in surplus, especially non-agricultural goods, to avoid market distortions.

4. **Intergovernmental Agreements**  
   Implement commitments or arrangements between Canadian governments or with international partners.

5. **Defence and Domestic Supply Needs**  
   Ensure adequate supply and distribution of critical goods for defence or national needs.

6. **Export Marketing & Trade Compliance**  
   Facilitate orderly export marketing in response to import limitations imposed by other countries.

> **Conditions** on the list may include approvals, classifications, or determinations by specified government bodies (including foreign entities).

---

## **Purposes for Import Controls (Section 5)**

The Governor in Council may establish an **Import Control List** to:

1. **Ensure Supply & Distribution**  
   Protect scarce goods in world or Canadian markets, especially when supply is limited or subject to foreign government controls.

2. **Support Domestic Production**  
   Restrict imports of like or directly competitive goods to support Canadian producers under the *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act*, *Agricultural Marketing Programs Act*, or *Canadian Dairy Commission Act*.

3. **Prevent Importation of Weapons**  
   Restrict imports of arms, ammunition, or munitions capable of being used in warfare.

4. **Support Price Stability**  
   Prevent dumping or price suppression that could harm domestic producers.

5. **Implement Intergovernmental Agreements**  
   Enforce commitments made between Canadian authorities.

6. **Comply with WTO Textile and Clothing Agreement**  
   Prevent circumvention of the WTO’s rules on textile and clothing imports.

## **Import Control List – Injury and Injury Thresholds**

To justify import restrictions, the Act defines two key concepts:

- **Serious Injury**  
  A significant overall impairment in the position of domestic producers of like or directly competitive goods.

- **Threat of Serious Injury**  
  A clear, factual, and imminent risk of serious injury—not based on speculation or remote possibility.

> These definitions are used in determining whether to restrict imports.

### **Key Provisions:**
- **Inquiry Requirement**  
  The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) must conduct an inquiry before an import restriction can be imposed.
- **Report to Minister**  
  The Minister must report findings to the Governor in Council.
- **Orders May Be Made**  
  If serious injury or threat is found, the Governor in Council may impose an import restriction.

> **Exception:** No restriction can be imposed on goods already subject to a prior restriction unless **at least two years** have passed since the prior order ended, and the total duration of all related restrictions does not exceed a certain threshold.

---

## **Extension Orders (Section 5.4)**

- An **extension order** may be issued if:
  - The injury remains serious.
  - Domestic producers are adjusting (as determined by CITT inquiry).
- The total duration of all extension orders (including previous ones) **cannot exceed eight years**.

> This ensures that import restrictions are temporary and not indefinite.

---

## **Exclusions from Import Restrictions**

- Goods imported from a country listed in **Schedule 1** may be excluded from an import restriction **if**:
  - The quantity of those goods is **not a principal cause** of serious injury or threat of serious injury.

> A *principal cause* means a cause that is no less important than any other.  
> A *serious injury* is a significant overall harm to domestic producers.

---

## **Application to Free Trade Partners**

Import restrictions **may only apply to goods from free trade partners** if:

1. The goods represent a **substantial share** of total imports from that country.
2. For **CUSMA countries**, the quantity of goods from that one country **contributes importantly** to injury or threat of injury.
3. For **other free trade partners**, the quantity contributes importantly to injury.

> This ensures that restrictions are not applied arbitrarily or disproportionately to trade partners under free trade agreements.

---

## **Additional Provisions**

- **Legal Authority**  
  The Governor in Council may act based on recommendations from the Minister, with consultation to the Minister of National Defence where relevant (especially for firearms).

- **Transparency Requirements**  
  Where an import restriction is made under Section 5(3), a **statement of the arrangement or commitment** must be laid before Parliament within 15 days of publication in the *Canada Gazette*, or on the first day Parliament is sitting after that.

- **Repealed Provisions**  
  Several outdated references (e.g., NAFTA, Free Trade Agreement, goods from NAFTA countries) have been **repealed** as part of trade evolution and new agreements (e.g., CUSMA, CPTPP, CETA).

  - Obtain permits or allocations before moving goods across borders.
  - Comply with brokering rules if intermediaries are involved.
- **Government Agencies**:
  - The Minister and Minister of National Defence play advisory roles.
