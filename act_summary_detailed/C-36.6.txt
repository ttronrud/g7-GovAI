**Detailed Summary of the Condominium Ordinance Validation Act**

---

**Act Title:**  
*Condominium Ordinance Validation Act*

**Enactment Date:**  
October 29, 1985 (Date of assent)

**Purpose of the Act:**  
The primary purpose of the *Condominium Ordinance Validation Act* is to **validate and uphold the legal standing** of existing condominium legislation in two Canadian territories — the **Yukon Territory** and the **Northwest Territories** — despite potential conflicts with the *Land Titles Act* of those jurisdictions.

This Act does not create new condominium rules or rights. Instead, it serves as a **legal validation mechanism** to ensure that condominium regulations remain enforceable and legally sound even in the face of inconsistencies with broader land title and property law frameworks.

### Key Provisions:

#### 1. **Validation of the Yukon Condominium Ordinance (Chapter C-12, Revised Ordinances of the Yukon Territory, 1971)**

- The *Condominium Ordinance of the Yukon Territory*, as originally enacted in 1971 and as amended prior to the coming into force of this Act, is declared **valid and lawful** under the *Yukon Act*.
- Crucially, the Act **deems the Ordinance to have been validly made** even if it appears to conflict with the *Land Titles Act* of the Yukon Territory.
- This means that:
  - The Ordinance is treated as if it were **not in conflict** with the *Land Titles Act*.
  - All actions (transactions, decisions, registrations, etc.) taken **before or after** the coming into force of this Act under the Ordinance are given **full legal effect** as if the Ordinance had never been in conflict with the *Land Titles Act*.

> **Effect:** This provision provides legal certainty and continuity for condominium owners, developers, and property administrators in the Yukon. It prevents invalidation of past or future condominium arrangements due to perceived statutory conflicts.

#### 2. **Validation of the Northwest Territories Condominium Ordinance (Chapter C-10, Revised Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1974)**

- Similarly, the *Condominium Ordinance of the Northwest Territories*, as enacted in 1974 and as amended prior to the coming into force of this Act, is declared **valid and lawful** under the *Northwest Territories Act*.
- The Act **deems the Ordinance to have been validly made** even if it conflicts with the *Land Titles Act* of the Northwest Territories.
- All actions taken **before or after** the Act’s coming into force under this Ordinance are given **full legal effect** as if there were no conflict with the *Land Titles Act*.

> **Effect:** This provision ensures that condominium governance and property rights in the Northwest Territories remain stable and enforceable, regardless of statutory tensions with land title legislation.

### Legal Principle Underlying the Act:

The Act applies a **principle of legal continuity and non-repeal** — specifically, that **a statute (the Condominium Ordinance) should not be invalidated merely because it appears to conflict with another statute (the Land Titles Act)**, especially when the conflict arises from differing legislative objectives or interpretations.

By declaring the Ordinances as valid *as if* they were not in conflict, the Act effectively **"strips away" the conflict** for legal purposes. This is a form of **statutory interpretation** or **constructive validity**, allowing condominium laws to operate without being nullified due to technical inconsistencies.

---

### Scope and Application:

- The Act applies to:
  - All **existing condominium developments** governed by the Yukon and Northwest Territories Condominium Ordinances.
  - All **transactions, agreements, registrations, and decisions** made under those ordinances.
- The validation applies **retroactively**, meaning that actions taken before the Act came into force are treated as if they were always lawful.
- The Act does **not**:
  - Amend the content of the Condominium Ordinances.
  - Change property rights or ownership structures.
  - Address future conflicts or proposed amendments to the Land Titles Acts.
  - Apply to other provinces or territories.

### Significance and Implications:

1. **Legal Certainty for Property Owners:**  
   Provides stability for condominium owners and managers by confirming that their rights, shared ownership, and governance arrangements are legally protected.

2. **Avoidance of Litigation:**  
   Prevents potential disputes or legal challenges based on perceived conflicts between condominium laws and land title laws.

3. **Administrative Efficiency:**  
   Enables real estate transactions, title transfers, and dispute resolution to proceed without needing to re-evaluate or re-register condominium interests due to statutory conflicts.

4. **Territorial Autonomy:**  
   Recognizes the unique property governance needs of the Yukon and Northwest Territories, allowing them to maintain their own condominium frameworks while operating within the broader land title system.

### Note on Enactment:

- The Act came into force on **October 29, 1985**, the date of its assent by Her Majesty (the Governor General of Canada), with the advice and consent of the **Senate and House of Commons**.
- It is a **validation and clarification** measure, not a new piece of property law.

### Conclusion:

The *Condominium Ordinance Validation Act* is a targeted piece of legislation designed to **legally affirm the validity and enforceability** of condominium laws in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, even in the presence of apparent conflicts with the *Land Titles Acts*. By declaring these ordinances valid under the territorial Acts and giving full effect to all actions taken under them, the Act ensures **continuity, stability, and legal confidence** in condominium property regimes in these territories. It reflects a balance between territorial legislative autonomy and the need for harmonization with broader land title systems.
