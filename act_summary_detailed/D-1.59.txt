- These sectors foster inclusive, sustainable, and economically vibrant communities.
- Success requires **collaboration among all levels of government** (federal, provincial, territorial) and **active participation from local communities**.
- Effective infrastructure investment directly improves housing outcomes.

  - Every reference to the "Minister of Housing" in any Act, regulation, or government instrument is **read as a reference to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities**, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
