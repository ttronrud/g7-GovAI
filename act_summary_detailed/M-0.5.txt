**Detailed Summary of the *Manganese-based Fuel Additives Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Manganese-based Fuel Additives Act* is a Canadian federal statute designed to regulate the **interprovincial trade and importation of manganese-based substances** used as fuel additives. The Act establishes a legal framework to prevent the **misuse of such substances—particularly their addition to unleaded gasoline**—which could pose environmental, health, or safety risks. It grants authority to the federal government to control these substances through licensing, record-keeping, inspections, and enforcement mechanisms.

The Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada and each province, and it applies to commercial activities involving the movement of controlled substances across provincial boundaries.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Controlled Substance**  
   - A manganese-based substance listed in a schedule to the Act.  
   - Includes any substance that contains such a manganese-based substance.  
   - The definition is broad and ensures that even derivatives or compounds containing manganese are covered.

2. **Minister**  
   - A designated member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada (e.g., Minister of Environment or Minister of Natural Resources).  
   - Responsible for administering the Act, issuing authorizations, and enforcing compliance.

3. **Unleaded Gasoline**  
   - Gasoline that has not been treated with lead during production.  
   - A critical safeguard in the Act to prevent contamination or adulteration of environmentally safer fuels.

### **Core Provisions and Key Functions**

#### **1. Prohibition on Unauthorized Trade and Importation**
- **Section 4**:  
  No person may engage in **interprovincial trade** or **import for commercial purposes** a controlled substance **without prior authorization** from the Minister.  
  → This restricts unregulated movement of manganese-based substances across provinces.

#### **2. Authorization Process**
- **Section 5**:  
  The Minister may grant authorization to individuals or entities to trade or import controlled substances **if two conditions are met**:
  1. The substance is **not unleaded gasoline**.
  2. The substance will **not be added to unleaded gasoline**.
- The Minister may impose **conditions** on the authorization, such as:
  - Restrictions on use
  - Duration and renewal terms
  - Geographic or operational limitations
- The Minister may require the applicant to **post a bond or provide security** to ensure:
  - The substance remains free from lead
  - The substance is not mixed with unleaded gasoline
  - Compliance with all conditions

#### **3. Revocation of Authorizations**
- The Minister may revoke an authorization if:
  - They are no longer satisfied that the substance is not unleaded gasoline.
  - They are no longer satisfied that it will not be added to unleaded gasoline.
  - The holder fails to comply with the conditions of the authorization.
- If revoked under these grounds, the Minister may **realize on the security** (e.g., bond) provided by the applicant.

#### **4. Regulatory Flexibility via Orders and Regulations**
- **Section 6**:  
  The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **regulations** to implement the Act, including:
  - Procedures for applying for authorizations
  - Requirements for documentation
  - Standards for review and decision-making

#### **5. Record-Keeping Requirements**
- **Section 9**:  
  Every person authorized to trade or import a controlled substance must maintain **detailed transaction records** for each transaction, including:
  - Name of the controlled substance
  - Place and person from whom it was acquired
  - Quantity
  - Intended or actual use
  - Place and person to whom it is disposed of
  - Date it crossed a provincial boundary or was released under the Customs Act
- Records must be **entered within 30 days** of the transaction and **signed by the responsible party**.
- Records must be **retained in Canada for five years**:
  - For individuals: after the end of the calendar year in which the transaction occurred.
  - For corporations: after the end of their financial year.
- A **report must be filed with the Minister within 60 days** of each transaction, in a form prescribed by the Minister.

#### **6. Public Information Requests (Notice and Sampling)**
- **Section 10**:  
  The Minister may issue a **public notice** in the *Canada Gazette* or other media, requiring persons who possess or have access to a manganese-based substance to:
  - Provide information (e.g., quantities, uses)
  - Submit samples of the substance
- The notice may request details on:
  - Composition
  - Quantity
  - Intended or actual use
- **Compliance is mandatory** within a specified timeframe.
- The Minister may **extend deadlines** upon written request from the affected party.

#### **7. Designation of Inspectors and Analysts**
- **Section 11**:  
  The Minister may designate individuals (or entities) as **inspectors or analysts** if they are qualified in technical or scientific capacity.
- Designated inspectors must carry a **certificate of designation** and must produce it upon request when entering a premises.

#### **8. Applicability of Related Environmental Laws**
- **Section 12**:  
  Key provisions of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999) apply to this Act, including:
  - **Sections 218(1)(a), (j)** and subsections 218(2) to (6), (10) to (14)
  - Sections 219, 220, 223, 224, 226 to 230, and 272
- These provisions provide:
  - Environmental assessment standards
  - Pollution prevention measures
  - Reporting and compliance obligations
- The application is **modified as necessary** based on the specific context of manganese-based substances.

- **Section 13**:  
  Specific provisions of CEPA 1999 (Sections 39–42, 275, 276, 280, 285, 288–290, 292–294, 311) apply **as if references to Section 291 of CEPA were references to Section 18 of this Act**.  
  → This ensures that environmental protection mechanisms (e.g., risk assessments, pollution control) are directly linked to the regulation of manganese-based additives.

#### **9. Amendments to the Schedule**
- **Section 14**:  
  The Governor in Council may, by order, **add or delete** a manganese-based substance from the schedule (the list of controlled substances) based on scientific, environmental, or safety considerations.
