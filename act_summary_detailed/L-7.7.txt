**Detailed Summary of the *Library and Archives of Canada Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Library and Archives of Canada Act* (the "Act") establishes the **Library and Archives of Canada (LAC)** as a central federal institution responsible for preserving, managing, and providing access to Canada’s **documentary heritage**—a comprehensive collection of publications, records, and other documentary materials of national significance. Enacted to ensure the long-term preservation of Canada’s historical and cultural memory, the Act provides a legal foundation for the LAC to serve as a trusted, accessible, and enduring repository of knowledge for present and future generations.

The Act consolidates and modernizes the former roles of the **National Archives of Canada** and the **National Library of Canada**, creating a unified institution under a single leadership structure. It also strengthens the role of the LAC in supporting government information management, promoting public access to knowledge, and fostering collaboration among libraries, archives, and institutions across Canada.
