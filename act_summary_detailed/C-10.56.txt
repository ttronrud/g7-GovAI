**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act* (the "Act") is a federal legislative instrument enacted by Canada to implement the **Agreement on Trade Continuity between Canada and the United Kingdom**, signed on **December 9, 2020**, in Ottawa. This Act provides the legal framework, definitions, responsibilities, and operational mechanisms necessary to bring the Trade Continuity Agreement into force within Canadian law.

The primary purpose of the Act is to ensure that Canada’s trade relations with the United Kingdom are governed by a stable, predictable, and rules-based framework—particularly in the context of the UK’s departure from the European Union and the need to maintain continuity in trade and investment flows.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

#### **1. Definition of Key Terms**
The Act establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout the legislation:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the *Agreement on Trade Continuity between Canada and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*, signed on December 9, 2020. This agreement is designed to maintain and expand trade and investment between Canada and the UK post-Brexit.

- **Canada–U.K. Joint Committee**: A body established under the Agreement, modeled on mechanisms in the CETA framework (Chapter Twenty-Six of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement). It serves as the primary forum for cooperation, dialogue, and dispute resolution between Canada and the UK on trade and investment matters.

- **CETA**: The *Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement* between Canada and the European Union, signed in 2016. The Agreement on Trade Continuity incorporates certain provisions of CETA (particularly those related to dispute settlement, investment, and labor/environmental standards), and references to CETA in this Act mean those provisions as incorporated into the Trade Continuity Agreement.

- **Federal Law**: Encompasses any Act of Parliament or regulatory instrument issued under the authority of a federal law. This ensures that implementation of the Agreement is carried out through existing or new federal legislation.

- **Minister**: Specifically refers to the **Minister for International Trade**, who is designated as the principal representative of Canada on the Canada–U.K. Joint Committee.

> *Note: The Act emphasizes that all provisions of this Act and any federal laws implementing the Agreement must be interpreted consistently with the Agreement.*

#### **2. Scope and Objectives of the Agreement**
The Act outlines the **core objectives** of the Trade Continuity Agreement, which include:

- Establishing a **free trade area** between Canada and the UK, removing barriers to trade in goods and services.
- Promoting **reciprocal trade** to foster economic development and mutual growth.
- Ensuring **fair competition** in trade between the two countries.
- Increasing **investment opportunities** in both jurisdictions while preserving each country’s right to regulate for legitimate policy goals (e.g., public health, safety, environmental protection).
- Eliminating **barriers to trade** to support broader regional and global trade expansion.
- Providing **adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights**.
- Protecting, enhancing, and enforcing **basic workers’ rights**, strengthening labor cooperation, and upholding international labor commitments.
- Strengthening **environmental laws and regulations**, promoting environmental cooperation, and advancing sustainable development.

> These objectives reflect a balanced approach that supports economic growth while maintaining social and environmental safeguards.

#### **3. Legal and Procedural Safeguards**

##### **(a) No Private Litigation on Agreement-Based Rights**
- **No individual or entity can bring legal proceedings** to enforce or determine rights or obligations arising solely under:
  - Sections 10 to 15 of the Act (which relate to investment, dispute settlement, or enforcement mechanisms), or
  - The Agreement itself.
- This provision prevents private lawsuits from being initiated against the Government of Canada or UK entities based solely on the Agreement.

> **Exception**: Subsection (2) does **not apply** to:
> - Claims arising under **Section F of Chapter Eight of CETA** (which deals with investment arbitration and dispute resolution), or
> - **Article 13.21 of CETA** (which addresses investment protection and dispute settlement).

> This exception ensures that investment-related disputes can still be brought before tribunals or panels, preserving access to dispute resolution mechanisms.

##### **(b) Government Authority Over Enforcement**
- The **Attorney General of Canada** must give **consent** before any legal action can be taken to enforce rights under the Agreement or its implementation.
- This ensures that the Government retains control over how the Agreement is applied and that any legal actions are consistent with national policy and public interest.

#### **8. Special Provisions on Investment Applications**

A significant and notable provision concerns **investment applications under the Investment Canada Act**:

> Any application filed under **Section 17 of the Investment Canada Act** before the date on which **Section 23 of this Act comes into force** (i.e., the effective date of the new rules) and **in respect of which the Minister of Industry has not made a decision by that date** will be **deemed never to have been filed** — **if**:
> - The investment would have been subject to **subsection 14.11(1) or (2)** of the Investment Canada Act (i.e., it would have required a "safety" or "public interest" review), **had the application been filed on the day of the Act’s coming into force**, **and**
> - The **enterprise value** of the assets involved is **less than the amount determined under subsection 14.11(1)**.

> This provision effectively **excludes low-value investments** from being subject to review under the new investment regime, ensuring that only significant investments are subject to scrutiny and preventing administrative burden on minor cases.

> It also provides **clarity and stability** for investors by preventing uncertainty over whether an application will be processed or rejected due to timing.
