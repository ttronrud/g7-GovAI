**Detailed Summary of the *Boucherville Islands Bridge and Tunnel Act***

---

### **1. Act Title and Citation**
The Act is officially titled the **Boucherville Islands Bridge and Tunnel Act** and may be cited accordingly. This legislation authorizes the Province of Quebec to develop and manage two major transportation infrastructure projects across the St. Lawrence River.

---

### **2. Purpose and Scope of the Act**
The primary objective of the Act is to enable the **Province of Quebec** to construct and maintain:
- A **bridge** and associated approaches and ancillary works,
- A **tunnel** and associated approaches and ancillary works,

both of which will facilitate the **safe and efficient movement of persons, vehicles, and goods** across or under the St. Lawrence River.

#### **Bridge Project**
- **Route**: From a point at or near the **City of Jacques Cartier, Quebec**, to a point on **Charron Island**, one of the Boucherville Islands.
- The bridge will span the river and connect the two points directly.

#### **Tunnel Project**
- **Route**: From a point at or near the **City of Montreal, Quebec**, to the same destination—**Charron Island**.
- The tunnel will pass **under** the St. Lawrence River, providing an alternative route to the bridge.

These structures are intended to improve regional connectivity, reduce traffic congestion, and offer a reliable transportation link between key urban centers and the Boucherville Islands.

### **3. Regulatory Oversight and Navigation Safeguards**
The construction and operation of both the bridge and tunnel are subject to strict **navigation safety regulations** established by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on behalf of the Government of Canada).

#### Key Provisions:
- The Province must comply with **regulations designed to safeguard navigation** on the St. Lawrence River.
- Before any construction begins, the Province must submit to the Governor in Council:
  - **Detailed plans and drawings** of the proposed bridge, tunnel, and associated works,
  - A **precise map** showing:
    - The **exact locations** of the proposed structures,
    - **Accurate soundings** (depth measurements) of the riverbed,
    - The **location of all existing bridges** in the area,
  - Any **additional information** deemed necessary for a full understanding of the project’s environmental, navigational, and engineering implications.

#### Approval Requirement:
- Construction **cannot commence** until the Governor in Council **formally approves** these plans and maps.
- Once construction begins, **no material changes** can be made to:
  - The plans or drawings,
  - The location of the bridge, tunnel, or ancillary works,
  —without **prior written approval** from the Governor in Council.

This ensures that the project adheres to federal standards for river navigation and avoids disruptions to maritime traffic.

---

### **4. Authority to Make Regulations**
The Governor in Council has the power to:
- Issue **additional regulations** (beyond those already specified) related to:
  - The bridge,
  - The tunnel,
  - Any ancillary works,
- Specifically for the purpose of **protecting and ensuring safe navigation** of the St. Lawrence River.

These regulations may cover matters such as:
- Speed limits for vessels,
- Depth restrictions,
- Maintenance standards,
- Traffic flow management,
- Environmental impact monitoring,
- Safety protocols for construction and operation.

---

### **5. Compliance Obligations**
All individuals, entities, or organizations **affected by any regulation** issued under this Act are required to:
- **Comply fully** with the regulations,
- Follow all directives and requirements imposed by the Governor in Council or any subordinate regulatory body.

This provision ensures that the project operates within a legal and enforceable framework, protecting both public safety and the interests of river users.

---

### **6. Key Principles and Implications**
- **Federal-Provincial Cooperation**: While the Province of Quebec is responsible for construction and maintenance, **federal oversight** (via the Governor in Council) ensures that navigation safety remains a top priority.
- **Environmental and Navigational Sensitivity**: The Act reflects a balance between infrastructure development and the need to preserve the navigability of one of Canada’s most vital waterways.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement to submit detailed plans and maps for review promotes transparency and allows for public and governmental scrutiny.
- **Stability and Predictability**: The prohibition on material changes after construction begins ensures project stability and reduces the risk of costly delays or disruptions.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Boucherville Islands Bridge and Tunnel Act* is a strategic piece of legislation that authorizes the Province of Quebec to build a bridge and tunnel to connect key areas across the St. Lawrence River. However, it does so under a strong framework of **federal oversight**, emphasizing **navigation safety**, **environmental responsibility**, and **regulatory accountability**. It represents a significant investment in regional transportation infrastructure while ensuring that the river’s vital role in commerce and navigation is preserved and protected.

This Act is a model of **cooperative governance** between provincial and federal authorities in infrastructure development, balancing economic growth with public safety and environmental stewardship.
