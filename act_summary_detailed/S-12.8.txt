**Detailed Summary of the Soldier Settlement Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Soldier Settlement Act* (originally enacted in 1935 and later amended) is a federal law designed to support veterans of World War II by providing them with opportunities to establish sustainable agricultural livelihoods in Canada. It establishes a framework for the acquisition, allocation, and sale of agricultural land, as well as financial and training support for veterans—particularly those who served in military forces abroad during wartime.

The Act was introduced in response to the needs of returning soldiers, especially those who had served overseas and were disabled or otherwise affected by their service. It replaced the earlier *Soldier Settlement Act, 1917* (the "former Act") and incorporated significant reforms, including improved eligibility criteria, more structured land acquisition, and enhanced support mechanisms.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the Act defines several key terms:

- **Agricultural Land**: Land deemed suitable for farming by the Board, where its value for agricultural use is not greater than its value for any other purpose.
- **Block**: A group of land parcels (contiguous or not) owned by one person, where at least one parcel is within three miles of another. This definition helps determine settlement units and land ownership boundaries.
- **Board**: Refers to the *Director of Soldier Settlement*, who assumes all powers previously held by the Soldier Settlement Board.
- **Settlement Area**: A designated region in Canada where the Board may compulsorily purchase land for settlement purposes.
- **Settler**: Defined narrowly and specifically:
  - A male member of a Canadian military force who served **out of Canada** during wartime;
  - Or, a person who, due to disability from service, is receiving a pension;
  - Or, a member of a British Dominion or colony who served in a theatre of war and was not dishonourably discharged or dispensed from service without fault.
  - The widow of a deceased settler (who might have been a settler had he lived) may also qualify.
- **Special Settler**: A settler with proven farming experience in Canada and recognized qualifications or equipment that make them especially suited for farming. These individuals may be required to provide a larger cash down payment or greater security when receiving loans or purchasing land.
- **Standard Date**: 
  - October 1st in Manitoba and western provinces;
  - November 1st in eastern provinces.
  This date marks the official start of the settlement period for land grants and assessments.
- **War**: Refers to the war declared by His Majesty on August 4, 1914, against Germany and later other Axis powers.

## **Structure and Authority of the Director of Soldier Settlement**

- The **Director of Soldier Settlement** is the central authority under this Act.
- The Director is appointed by the Deputy Minister of Veterans Affairs or a designated official.
- The Director holds **all powers previously vested in the Soldier Settlement Board**, including administrative, financial, and land acquisition authority.
- The Director is granted **rights to free or reduced railway travel**, equivalent to a deputy head of a department.
- The Director receives a salary set annually by the Governor in Council.
- In all references to the "Board" or "Commissioner," the Act treats the Director as the equivalent entity, simplifying administrative structure.

---

## **Corporate Sole Status of the Director**

- The Director is treated as a **corporation sole**—a legal entity with a single member (the Director)—for the purposes of acquiring, holding, conveying, and transferring property under the Act.
- This status allows the Director to act as the **agent of the Crown** in the right of the Dominion of Canada for land transactions.
- However, this does **not** restrict the Director’s general powers under the Act nor impose corporate regulations from provincial or federal statutes.

**Seal and Validity of Documents**:
- The Director’s corporate seal bears the inscription: *"The Director of Soldier Settlement of Canada"* and includes the coat of arms of Canada.
- Any document executed with the seal and the Director’s signature in the presence of one witness is **valid and admissible in court** without further proof of registration or sealing.
- Documents previously issued by the Board or its commissioner are also deemed valid and admissible in evidence.

**Tax Recourse**:
- Land held by the Director in corporate capacity from **January 1, 1933**, onwards is declared **subject to tax realization** for the purpose of recovering taxes due.
- This means the land is treated as held by the Director as a corporation sole, not as an agent of the Crown, for tax purposes.

## **Personnel and Staffing**

- The Board may appoint officers, instructors, clerks, stenographers, and other employees to assist in implementing the Act.
- These employees serve at the pleasure of the Board and are paid at rates approved by the Governor in Council.
- Employees hired on or after **July 1, 1935**, whose positions are deemed of **indeterminate duration** and approved by the Treasury Board, are **deemed permanent employees** and become subject to the **Civil Service Act**.

## **Acquisition of Land and Property**

The Board has broad authority to acquire land and related assets through multiple methods:

### 1. **Voluntary Purchase**
- Can buy agricultural land, live stock, farm equipment, and building materials from individuals, firms, or corporations at **reasonable prices**.

### 2. **Compulsory Purchase (Mandatory Acquisition)**
- May compulsorily acquire land through a process outlined in **Part III of the Act**, which includes due process, notice, and compensation.

### 3. **Cooperation with Provincial Governments**
- With **Governor in Council approval**, the Board may:
  - Acquire or utilize Crown or provincial agricultural lands;
  - Establish terms and conditions for land acquisition, holding, and disposal that mirror those applied to settlers receiving land directly from the Board.

### 4. **Acquisition of Indian Lands**
- Can purchase Indian lands that have been legally released or surrendered under the *Indian Act*.

### 5. **Acquisition of School Lands**
- Despite provisions in the *Dominion Lands Act*, the Governor in Council may grant or convey **school lands** to the Board if two arbitrators (one appointed by the Minister, one by the provincial government) certify the price as **fair and reasonable**.
- The purchase price is treated as proceeds from a sale under the Dominion Lands Act for accounting and tax purposes.

---

## **Valuation of Land**

- The valuation of land **must not be inflated** simply because its value increased due to settlement activities nearby.
- If land value increases after settlement operations, the increase is **attributed to the settlement** itself.
- The **purchase price is based on pre-settlement value**, unless proven otherwise.
- This ensures fairness and prevents exploitation of land appreciation due to government activity.

---

## **Tenants and Interests in Land**

- Any tenant (e.g., life tenant, trustee, guardian, executor, administrator) may:
  - Contract with the Board to sell their interest in land;
  - Convey the land to the Board;
  - Agree on compensation and give acquittance (release).
- If no representative exists for a person under disability (e.g., minors, lunatics), the **Federal Court** may appoint a guardian to represent them and manage the transaction.
- Compensation received is subject to court direction on **disposal, application, or investment** to protect the interests of all parties.
- All such contracts and conveyances are **valid and binding** for **six months** from the date of agreement, even if the land is later transferred to a third party.

> **Note**: No registration or enrolment is required to preserve the Board’s rights under these agreements. Registration is optional and may be done if the Board deems it advisable.

## **Support and Training for Settlers**

The Board is authorized to provide comprehensive support to settlers:

- **Farming Instruction**: Place settlers with experienced farmers for hands-on training.
- **Agricultural Training Stations**: Establish stations to offer formal education in farming techniques.
- **Instructors and Inspectors**: Deploy trained personnel to visit settlers and provide guidance.
- **Home Economics Training**: Offer training for the wives and female dependents of settlers in domestic and agricultural management.

  - Settlers who have **already purchased land** from the Board are ineligible.
  - Settlers who have **received advances** from the Board for clearing encumbrances or improving land are ineligible.
  - Settlers who already own or have a vested interest in agricultural land that:
    - Is of an **average farm size** in the district, or
    - Is valued at **$5,000 or more**, are ineligible.
- The Governor in Council may impose **conditions of improvement and occupation** to ensure land is used for farming purposes.
