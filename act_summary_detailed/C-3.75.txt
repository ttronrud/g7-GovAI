**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Emergency Student Benefit Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Emergency Student Benefit Act* (CESBA) was enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, as a temporary measure to support students affected by the economic disruptions caused by the **coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)** during the period from **December 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020**. The Act provides financial assistance to eligible students who were unable to work due to the pandemic, either because they were seeking employment or working at reduced pay.

This legislation is a **targeted, short-term emergency benefit**, designed specifically to address the unique challenges faced by post-secondary students during the early stages of the pandemic, particularly those who lost income due to school closures, job losses, or difficulty finding work.

- **Week**: Defined as a **seven-day period beginning on Sunday** (standard weekly cycle).

---

### **3. Regulatory Authority**

With the **consent of the Minister of Finance**, the Minister may issue regulations to:
- Clarify the meaning of **"post-secondary educational program"** for eligibility purposes;
- **Prescribe classes of persons** (e.g., students with disabilities, international students, etc.) who qualify under paragraph (c) of the student definition.

> This allows flexibility in interpretation and adaptation to evolving needs.

---

### **4. Application Process**

- Students may apply **for any four-week period** falling within the time frame prescribed by regulation.
- Applications must be submitted in the **form and manner established by the Minister**.
- Students applying due to **seeking work** (as employee or self-employed) must **attest in their application** that they are actively seeking employment.
- **No applications are accepted after September 30, 2020**.
- The Minister must **not pay** any benefit to a student who files an application after this deadline.

> This sets a strict end date for eligibility, reflecting the temporary nature of the benefit.

---

### **5. Eligibility Criteria**

A student is eligible for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit **if**:
- They are **unable to work** due to the pandemic (whether as employee or self-employed), **are seeking work but unable to find it**, or are **working but earning less than the amount set by regulation** during the four-week period;
- They do **not** receive any of the following income or benefits during that period:
  - Income from **employment or self-employment**;
  - **Employment Insurance (EI) benefits** (including the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit under s. 153.7 of the EI Act);
  - **Provincial income support** related to:
    - Pregnancy;
    - Care of a newborn child;
    - Care of a child placed for adoption;
  - **Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)** or any other income prescribed by regulation.

> The exclusion of certain benefits ensures the benefit does not overlap with other forms of government assistance.

#### Regulatory Flexibility:
- The Minister may regulate:
  - The **meaning of "unable to work"** and the **threshold amount of income** (e.g., minimum wage or a defined benefit level);
  - Whether certain types of income (e.g., parental benefits) should be excluded from the definition;
  - Any **additional income sources** that are deemed to disqualify a student.

> This allows for adjustments based on economic conditions and administrative needs.

---

### **6. Benefit Administration and Information Access**

- The Minister must make eligible students aware of **employment opportunities** through a **government-managed job posting system**.
- This promotes job placement and helps students transition back into employment after receiving the benefit.

---

### **7. Benefit Amount and Duration**

- The **weekly benefit amount** is set by regulation.
- The **maximum number of weeks** a student can receive the benefit is also determined by regulation.
- Regulations may **differentiate among classes of students** (e.g., students with dependents or disabilities may receive higher amounts).

> Example: A student with a dependant or disability may receive a higher weekly benefit than others, reflecting the greater financial need.

- Regulations may have **retroactive effect**, allowing past eligibility to be applied retroactively if needed.

---

### **8. Data Collection and Compliance**

- The Minister is authorized to collect and use a student’s **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** for administrative and compliance purposes.
- The Minister may issue a **notice** requiring any person to provide information or documents within a reasonable time.
- Notices can be served **personally or via confirmed delivery service**.

> These provisions ensure accountability and verification of student claims.

---

### **9. Legal Protections and Restrictions on the Benefit**

The Canada Emergency Student Benefit is protected from:
- **Bankruptcy or insolvency laws**;
- **Assignment, charging, or attachment** as security;
- **Retention or set-off** under any other federal Act (except this Act);
- **Garnishment** under the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act*.

> This ensures students retain full control over the benefit and cannot lose it due to other financial obligations.

---

### **10. Overpayment and Recovery**

- If the Minister determines a student received a benefit they were **not entitled to**, or **exceeded the amount**, the student must **repay the amount as soon as feasible**.
- The overpayment constitutes a **debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**, which may be recovered.
- The Minister may issue a **certificate of debt**, which, when registered in the **Federal Court**, has the **same legal effect as a court judgment**.

> This establishes a formal, enforceable process for recovery.

---

### **11. Limitation Period for Recovery**

- **No legal action** may be taken to recover money owed under this Act **after six years** from the date the debt became due and payable.
- However, **this six-year period is suspended** during any time when it is **prohibited to commence or continue proceedings** (e.g., during bankruptcy or insolvency).
- If a person **acknowledges liability** (in writing, by promise to pay, partial payment, or in legal proceedings), the **time before acknowledgment does not count** toward the six-year period.
- If liability is acknowledged **after the six-year period has expired**, an action may still be brought **within six years of the acknowledgment**.

> This provides a fair grace period and protects individuals from undue legal pressure.

---

### **12. Interest on Overpayments**

- **No interest** is payable on any overpayment or erroneous payment under this Act.

> This simplifies recovery and avoids additional financial burdens on students.

---

### **13. Special Rules for Certain Benefit Receipts**

- If a student received **EI emergency response benefits** or **provincial benefits** (e.g., for pregnancy or childcare) during a four-week period, and this caused them to be ineligible, the Minister **deems** that the student must repay:
  - **$2,000** if the student has a **dependant or disability**;
  - **$1,250** otherwise.

> This applies **only if the student received benefits during the four-week period** and was otherwise eligible.

- **Exception**: If the **Canada Employment Insurance Commission** informs the Minister that the student should **not be excluded** from eligibility due to receiving an EI emergency response benefit, then the student is **deemed eligible**, and the benefit is not counted as ineligible income.

> This ensures fairness and prevents double-counting or exclusion due to overlapping benefits.

---

### **14. Review and Accountability**

- A **comprehensive review** of the Act and its operation must be completed **no later than September 30, 2021**.
- The review must be conducted by a **committee of the Senate, House of Commons, or both**.
- The committee may be designated or established by either or both Houses for this purpose.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and evaluation of the program’s effectiveness and equity.
