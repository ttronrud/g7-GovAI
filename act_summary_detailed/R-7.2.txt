**Detailed Summary of the *Restoring Mail Delivery for Canadians Act***  

The *Restoring Mail Delivery for Canadians Act* (2011) is a legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of Canada to resolve a labor dispute between the **Canada Post Corporation** (the employer) and the **Canadian Union of Postal Workers** (the union), following a prolonged strike that disrupted postal services. The Act was designed to restore essential postal operations, ensure continuity of employment, and establish a fair and binding process for negotiating a new collective agreement, while protecting workers’ rights and the financial sustainability of Canada Post.

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**
- The Act was introduced in response to a strike that began in 2010 and culminated in a significant disruption of mail delivery services.
- The primary objective is to **restore and maintain postal services** by requiring both the employer and employees to resume work immediately upon the Act’s coming into force.
- It also establishes a structured, neutral arbitration process to resolve outstanding disputes over wages, working conditions, and other terms of employment, ensuring a fair resolution without further industrial action.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Arbitrator**: A neutral third party appointed by the Minister of Labour to resolve disputes between the employer and union.
- **Collective Agreement**: Refers specifically to the agreement that expired on **January 31, 2011**, between Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.
- **Employee**: Any individual employed by Canada Post and bound by the expired collective agreement.
- **Employer**: The Canada Post Corporation.
- **Union**: The Canadian Union of Postal Workers.
- General definitions follow those in **Part I of the Canada Labour Code**, ensuring consistency with existing labour laws.

---

### **3. Immediate Restoration of Services**
Upon coming into force:
- **Canada Post must resume or continue postal services without delay**.
- **All employees must resume or continue their duties** without delay, as required by their employment contracts.

> This provision ensures a swift return to normal operations and prevents further service disruption.

---

### **4. Prohibition of Retaliation and Lockouts/Strikes**
To protect workers’ rights and prevent retaliation:
- **Employer and its officers/representatives** are prohibited from:
  - Impeding employees from complying with their duty to resume work.
  - Discharging or disciplining employees because they participated in a strike before the Act came into force.
- **Union and its officers/representatives** are prohibited from:
  - Encouraging employees not to resume work.
  - Declaring or authorizing a strike against the employer.
- **Employees are prohibited from participating in a strike** during the period of the extended collective agreement.

> These provisions aim to create a stable, non-retaliatory environment where employees can return to work without fear of job loss or disciplinary action.

---

### **5. Extension of the Collective Agreement**
- The expired collective agreement is **extended** to cover the period from **February 1, 2011**, to the date a new collective agreement comes into effect.
- This extension is **effective and binding** during the extension period, even though it was not originally in force.
- **Part I of the Canada Labour Code applies to the extended agreement** as if it were the original term of the agreement.

> This ensures continuity of employment terms during the transition period, preventing abrupt changes in working conditions.

---

### **6. Prohibition of Further Industrial Action**
During the extended term of the collective agreement:
- **No lockout** by the employer against the union.
- **No strike** by the union against the employer.
- **No employee participation in a strike**.

> This creates a legally enforceable "cooling-off" period during which all parties are bound to refrain from industrial action, promoting stability and allowing for negotiation.

### **7. Appointment and Powers of the Arbitrator**
- The **Minister of Labour** appoints an arbitrator to resolve disputes through a **final offer selection process**.

### **8. Submission of Final Offers**
