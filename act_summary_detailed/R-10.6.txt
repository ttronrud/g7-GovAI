**Detailed Summary of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act* is a legislative framework that governs the pension and compassionate allowance entitlements for members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), their survivors, and their children. It establishes rules for calculating pensions, eligibility criteria, special provisions for service prior to 1960, and the treatment of disability, retirement, and survivor benefits. The Act also addresses the inclusion of prior service in other government or police forces and includes provisions for gratuities, deductions from pay, and pension diversion in cases of court-ordered financial support.

This Act was designed to ensure continuity of pension benefits for RCMP officers and their dependents, particularly in light of changes in the broader superannuation system of Canada, including the transition from the former *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act* (Chapter 241 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952) after April 1, 1960.
