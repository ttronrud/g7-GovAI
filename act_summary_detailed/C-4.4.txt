The provided text appears to be a **legal citation and status note** for a Canadian statute, but **it does not contain the actual content or provisions of the act itself**. Instead, it includes only metadata about the act’s enactment, enforcement timeline, and eventual repeal.

### 🔍 Detailed Summary of the Provided Information:

#### 1. **Enactment**
- The act was **enacted by Section 121 of Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada, 2008**.
- This means it was passed as part of the *Statutes of Canada, 2008*, which is the official compilation of laws passed in that year.
- The specific section (121) of Chapter 28 likely refers to a particular provision within a broader legislative package.

#### 2. **Effective Dates**
- **Most of the act (except paragraph 4(a)) came into force on June 20, 2008**.
  - This is indicated by the reference to *SI/2008-76* (a Statutory Instrument), which typically provides the implementation or transitional details.
- **Paragraph 4(a)** became effective on **September 23, 2010**, as noted by *SI/2010-74*.
  - This suggests that the act had a phased implementation, with certain provisions (likely more sensitive or impactful) taking effect later.

#### 3. **Repeal History**
- The act was **repealed (officially cancelled or replaced)** multiple times:
  - **In 2012**: Repealed by *Chapter 31, Section 445* of the Statutes of Canada, 2012.
  - **In 2013**: Repealed again by *Chapter 40, Section 137* of the Statutes of Canada, 2013.
- The repeated mentions of "repealed, 2013, c. 40, s. 137" (18 times) and "repealed, 2012, c. 31, s. 445" (twice) suggest that the repeal was either:
  - A typographical or formatting error (repetition of the same repeal),
  - Or that the repeal was applied in multiple legislative contexts or through multiple references in legal databases.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: The act was **fully repealed** in **2013** by *Statutes of Canada, 2013, Chapter 40, Section 137*, and earlier in 2012 by *Chapter 31, Section 445*.

### 🚫 Important Note: No Content of the Act Is Provided

Despite the detailed metadata, **the actual text, provisions, purpose, or scope of the act are missing** from the input. Therefore, **a detailed summary of the act’s content (e.g., what it regulated, who it affected, its objectives, key clauses, etc.) cannot be provided**.

---

### 🔎 What This Might Indicate

The repeated "repealed" entries suggest:
- The act may have been **short-lived or transitional**, perhaps a temporary regulatory measure.
- It may have been **replaced by a newer or more comprehensive law**.
- The repetition in the text may stem from a **database or legal citation system error**, where the same repeal is listed multiple times.

### Bottom Line

> ❌ **This input does not contain the actual content of the act**.  
> ✅ It only provides **enactment, effective dates, and repeal information**.  
> 🚫 Therefore, a **detailed summary of the act’s provisions, purpose, or impact cannot be provided** based on the given text.

If you can provide the **full text or title** of the act (e.g., *The Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, *The Fisheries Act*, etc.), I can offer a detailed summary.
