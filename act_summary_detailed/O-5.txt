**Detailed Summary of the *Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act* (FISIA) is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation designed to protect national security by preventing foreign interference, safeguarding sensitive government information, and ensuring the integrity of critical defense and intelligence operations. The Act establishes clear legal definitions, outlines prohibited acts, and imposes strict obligations on individuals and entities with access to classified or sensitive information—particularly those working in or near defense-related environments.

It was introduced to address growing threats from foreign powers and terrorist groups seeking to undermine Canada’s security, economic stability, and governmental functions through espionage, sabotage, cyber attacks, and other forms of interference.
