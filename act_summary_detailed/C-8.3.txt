### **3. Establishment of the Board**

- A **corporation** is created known as the **Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB)**.
- The Board is **not an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada** — it operates independently.
- **Directors, officers, employees, and agents of the Board are not part of the federal public administration**, meaning they are not subject to the same public service rules or oversight as federal civil servants.
- The **Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act does not apply** to the Board — it is governed by this specific Act and its by-laws.
- **Capital Structure**:  
  - Total capital: **$100**  
  - Divided into **10 shares** of **$10 par value each**  
  - Shares are issued to the **Minister of Finance** and held on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada  
  - Shares are **registered in the name of the Minister**

> This structure ensures the Board is funded by the federal government but remains a separate legal entity with independence in operations.

### **4. Objects and Powers of the Board**

The Board’s primary objectives are:

1. **To assist the Canada Pension Plan in meeting its obligations** to contributors and beneficiaries under the CPP.
2. **To manage any amounts transferred to it** under sections 108.1 and 108.3 of the CPP Act — including rights to designated securities — in the best interests of contributors and beneficiaries.
3. **To invest its assets** with a view to achieving:
   - A **maximum rate of return**
   - Without **undue risk of loss**
   - Taking into account factors affecting the **funding of the CPP** and its ability to meet financial obligations on any given day.

> This objective emphasizes **long-term sustainability** and **risk-adjusted returns**.

---

### **5. Legal Capacity and Powers**

- The Board has the **capacity and rights of a natural person**, meaning it can enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued, and perform legal acts.
- The Board and its subsidiaries **cannot engage in activities inconsistent** with its objects or prohibited by this Act.
- **No act of the Board is invalid solely because it lacked capacity or power** — this provides legal protection against challenges based on lack of authority.

---

### **6. Management of Designated Securities (Provincial Debt)**

This section governs the Board’s role in managing **designated securities** issued by provinces — particularly those that were previously held by the CPP Investment Fund.

#### **(a) Replacement of Maturities (Before January 1, 1998)**  
When a designated security of a province matures:
- The Board **must purchase a replacement security** if requested in writing by the **appropriate provincial Minister**, at least **30 days before maturity**.
- The **principal amount** of the new security must not exceed the outstanding principal of the maturing one.
- The **replacement security has a 20-year term**.
- Interest rate must be **substantially equivalent** to what the province would pay if it borrowed the same amount on the public capital market.
- The security is **non-negotiable, non-transferable, and non-assignable**.
- It is issued **to or payable to the Board**.

> This ensures continuity of funding and avoids disruption in provincial debt obligations.

#### **(b) Redemption of Designated Securities (Before Maturity)**  
The Board may redeem a designated security **in whole or in part** if:
1. The **provincial Minister requests it in writing**, at least **30 days before the proposed redemption date**.
2. The Minister agrees to pay:
   - All principal and interest due **up to the redemption date** (not yet paid),
   - Interest accrued on the redeemed amount up to the redemption date,
   - The **present value** of the remaining principal and interest.

> **Present value calculation**:
- Discounted using an interest rate set by the Board.
- If the security was issued **before January 1, 1998**, the rate should be **substantially equivalent** to what the Government of Canada would pay to borrow the amount.
- If issued **on or after January 1, 1998**, the rate should match what the **province** would pay on a public market borrowing.

> This ensures fair and market-aligned valuation, protecting both the province and the Board.

#### **(c) Acceptance of New Securities in Place of Series (for Provincial Debt)**  
At the request of a provincial treasurer or similar officer:
- The Board may accept **one new security** in place of a **series of designated securities** acquired within **12 consecutive months**.
- The new security must:
  - Equal the **aggregate outstanding amount** of the replaced series.
  - Bear interest at a rate **determined by the Board**.
- The new security must be an obligation of a provincial government or an agent of Her Majesty in right of a province, **guaranteed for principal and interest**.

> This allows for consolidation and simplification of debt holdings.
