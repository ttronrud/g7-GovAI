### **Detailed Summary of the *North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act***  
*(Act No. 1994-1, as amended; effective January 1, 1994)*

---

## **1. Introduction and Purpose**

The *North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act* (NAFTA Implementation Act) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted to give legal effect to the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** — signed on December 17, 1992, between the **Government of Canada**, the **Government of the United Mexican States**, and the **Government of the United States of America**.

This Act serves as the **domestic legal framework** through which Canada implements the provisions of NAFTA, ensuring that Canada’s laws, institutions, and administrative structures align with the agreement’s goals and obligations.

## **2. Key Objectives of the Agreement (as reflected in the Act)**

The Act explicitly outlines the core objectives of NAFTA, which include:

- **Eliminating trade barriers** and facilitating the free movement of goods and services across the three NAFTA countries.
- **Promoting fair competition** within the free-trade area.
- **Encouraging investment** by creating a stable, predictable, and secure environment for cross-border business.
- **Providing effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights** (IPR) in all three countries.
- **Establishing clear dispute resolution mechanisms** and joint administrative procedures.
- **Supporting sustainable development**, environmental protection, and the preservation of workers’ rights.
- **Enhancing regional cooperation** to expand and deepen economic integration among the three nations.

These objectives are grounded in international trade principles such as:
- **National treatment** (no discrimination against foreign goods/services),
- **Most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment** (all countries receive equal treatment),
- **Transparency** (clear rules and open processes).

### **3.2 Legal Authority and Binding Effect**

- The Act is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada** — meaning it has full legal force and effect within Canadian law.
