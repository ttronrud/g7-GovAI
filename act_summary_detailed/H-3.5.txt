### **Overview**

The *Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act* is a Canadian statute designed to protect historically significant railway stations and their key features from unauthorized alteration, destruction, or disposal. The Act establishes a formal process for designating heritage railway stations and heritage features, and it imposes strict legal safeguards to ensure that these important cultural assets are preserved for future generations. It operates under the authority of the Minister of Parks Canada, with oversight and advisory input from the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (the "Board").
