**Detailed Summary of the *Business Development Bank of Canada Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Business Development Bank of Canada Act* (the "Act") establishes and governs the **Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC)** as a body corporate, continuing the legacy of the former *Federal Business Development Bank*. The Act defines the Bank’s structure, purpose, governance, financial powers, operational activities, eligibility criteria, and compliance obligations. It is designed to support Canadian entrepreneurship—particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—by providing financial services, capital, and management support.

This Act was enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, and serves as the foundational legislation for the BDC’s operations.
