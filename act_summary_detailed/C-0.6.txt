## **6. Determination of Residency**

Residency is crucial for determining where income is taxable. The rules are structured to determine residency based on **personal and economic ties**.

### **For Individuals:**
1. **Permanent home** → Resident of the State where they have a permanent home.
   - If available in both, resident of the State with **closer personal and economic relations** (center of vital interests).
2. If center of vital interests cannot be determined or no permanent home:
   - Resident of the State where they have an **habitual abode**.
3. If habitual abode in both or neither:
   - Resident of the State of which they are a **national**.
4. If national of both or neither:
   - The **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

### **For Companies:**
1. Resident of the State of which it is a **national**.
2. If no national affiliation:
   - Resident of the State where its **place of effective management** is located.

### **For Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships):**
- The competent authorities shall resolve residency by **mutual agreement**.

> This ensures fair treatment of individuals and entities with dual residency.

## **7. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

### **Included Examples:**
- Place of management,
- Branch,
- Office,
- Factory,
- Workshop,
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or natural resource exploration/exploitation site.

### **Includes (with conditions):**
- **Building sites, construction, assembly, installation projects**, and supervisory activities — **only if they last more than 6 months**.
- **Furnishing of services** (e.g., consultancy) — **only if activities continue for more than 6 months within any 12-month period**.

### **Excluded (does NOT constitute a PE):**
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of stock for storage, display, or delivery.
- Stock for **processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place for **purchasing goods or collecting information**.
- Fixed place for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**.
- Any combination of the above — **only if the overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**.

> This prevents abuse of the PE concept for tax avoidance.

### **Exception: Authorized Agents**
- If a person (not an independent agent) acts on behalf of a Canadian or Argentine enterprise and:
  - Has and **habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts** in the other country,
  - Then the enterprise is deemed to have a **permanent establishment** in that country — **unless** the activities are limited to those excluded above.

> This ensures that **contractual authority** is treated as a business presence.

### **Agents of Independent Status**
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE merely because it uses a **broker, general commission agent**, or other independent agent.
- However, if the agent’s activities are **wholly or almost wholly on behalf of the enterprise**, they are **not considered independent** and may trigger a PE.

> This protects legitimate commercial agents from being treated as permanent establishments.

### **Control or Ownership Does Not Create a PE**
- If a Canadian company controls an Argentine company or vice versa, **this does not create a PE** in either country.
