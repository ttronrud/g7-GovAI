The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> **[Repealed, 1998, c. 10, s. 201]**

This indicates that the specific legislative provision or section in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **an Act of Parliament passed in 1998**, specifically **Chapter 10 of that year**, under **Section 201**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
Each line "[Repealed, 1998, c. 10, s. 201]" signifies that a particular law, regulation, or statutory provision — previously in force — has been formally **repealed** (removed from the legal framework). This is a standard annotation in legal and legislative documents to indicate that a section of an act is no longer valid.

#### 2. **Repeal Details**
- **Year**: 1998  
- **Act**: *Chapter 10* of the Statutes of 1998 (commonly referred to as *An Act respecting...*, depending on the jurisdiction)  
- **Section**: Section 201 of that act  
- **Action**: The section was repealed — meaning it was officially canceled and is no longer part of the current legal code.

#### 3. **Implications of Repeal**
- Any legal obligations, rights, duties, or procedural rules previously established by the repealed section are **no longer enforceable**.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Modernize or simplify legislation
  - Resolve inconsistencies or outdated provisions
  - Replace the section with a new, more effective law
  - Reflect changes in policy or administrative structure
- The repeal does not imply that the matter was "unimportant" or "unenforceable" — rather, it reflects a deliberate legislative decision to remove a provision from the statute book.

#### 4. **Frequency of Repeal Annotations**
The repetition of the same entry 30 times suggests that this may be a **list or compilation** of multiple sections, subsections, or provisions that were all repealed by the same act (Chapter 10, Section 201). However, in standard legislative formatting, a single section (s. 201) typically does not repeal multiple provisions unless it is a broad repeal clause. Therefore, this repetition may indicate:
- A formatting or data-entry error
- A list of different provisions all affected by the same repeal
- A misrepresentation where multiple entries are incorrectly labeled as being repealed by the same section

#### 5. **Jurisdictional Context**
The reference to "c. 10" (Chapter 10) and "s. 201" (Section 201) is typical of **Canadian legislation**, where statutes are organized by chapter and section. Therefore, this repeal is likely from a **Canadian provincial or federal statute**.

Without additional context (such as the name of the act or province), the exact nature of the repealed provisions cannot be determined. However, the fact that the repeal was enacted in 1998 suggests it relates to administrative, regulatory, or procedural matters that were deemed obsolete or redundant.

### Conclusion:

> The provided text is a list of repeated annotations indicating that various provisions (likely within a single or related set of laws) were **repealed in 1998 under Section 201 of Chapter 10 of a legislative act**.  
>  
> These provisions are no longer legally valid. The repeal likely aimed to streamline or modernize the legal framework, remove outdated rules, or align with new policy directions.  
>  
> Due to the repetition, the list may reflect a data formatting issue or a compilation of multiple items affected by the same repeal. Without the original act’s title or jurisdictional context, a precise summary of the repealed content cannot be provided.  
>  
> **In short**: This is a record of legislative repeal — not a standalone law — and serves as a notice that certain legal provisions are no longer in force.

🔍 **Recommendation for Further Research**:
To understand the actual content of the repealed provisions, one should:
- Identify the full title of the 1998 Act (Chapter 10)
- Consult the official text of that act (e.g., through the Canadian Statutes at Large, or a provincial legislature website)
- Search for Section 201 and examine its original wording and scope

If you can provide the name of the act or the jurisdiction (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, federal), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
