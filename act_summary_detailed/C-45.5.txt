**Detailed Summary of the *Courts Administration Service Act* (Canada)**

---

### **1. Overview and Citation**
The *Courts Administration Service Act* (CAS Act) is a federal law enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. It is formally cited as the **Courts Administration Service Act**.

This Act establishes a new administrative body — the **Courts Administration Service (Service)** — to provide efficient, coordinated, and independent administrative support to four key federal courts in Canada:  
- The Federal Court of Appeal  
- The Federal Court  
- The Court Martial Appeal Court  
- The Tax Court of Canada  

The primary objective is to **separate administrative functions from judicial decision-making**, thereby enhancing judicial independence while ensuring accountability and efficiency in the use of public funds.

### **2. Key Purposes of the Act**

The Act is guided by three central purposes:

#### **(a) Facilitation of Coordination and Cooperation**
- To streamline administrative services across the four federal courts.
- To ensure that shared services (such as court facilities, staffing, logistics, and records management) are provided effectively and efficiently.
- To eliminate duplication and improve inter-court coordination.

#### **(b) Enhancement of Judicial Independence**
- To place administrative services **at arm’s length** from the Government of Canada.
- To affirm that **judges and chief justices retain full control over judicial functions**, including scheduling, case assignment, and courtroom operations.
- To prevent government interference in judicial processes by ensuring that administrative decisions are made independently.

#### **(c) Accountability for Public Funds**
- To ensure that public money used to support court administration is used responsibly and transparently.
- To maintain financial accountability without compromising judicial independence.

#### **Ministerial Consultation**
- The **Minister of Justice** must consult with the **Chief Justices** of the four courts before:

  - The acting person may serve for **up to 90 days**.
  - If the position remains vacant beyond 90 days, the Governor in Council may confirm the continuation of the acting appointment **only if**:
