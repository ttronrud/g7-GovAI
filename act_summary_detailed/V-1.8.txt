The *Vimy Ridge Day Act* is a legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of Canada to formally recognize and commemorate the historical significance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, which took place on April 9, 1917, during World War I.

### **Background and Context (Whereas Clauses)**

1. **First Unified Canadian Combat Engagement**  
   The Act begins with a "whereas" clause highlighting that the Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first time Canadian soldiers—drawn from all regions of the country—fought together as a unified force against a common enemy. Prior to this, Canadian troops had been deployed in fragmented units under British command, with no cohesive national command structure. Vimy marked the first time that Canadian forces were fully organized and led by Canadian officers, representing a significant step toward the formation of a distinct Canadian military identity.

2. **Turning Point in Canadian Nationhood**  
   The Act emphasizes that the Battle of Vimy Ridge is widely regarded by many Canadians as a pivotal moment in the nation’s history. It is seen not only as a military victory but as a foundational event in the journey toward full Canadian nationhood. The successful capture of the strategically important Vimy Ridge position demonstrated Canadian capability, resilience, and unity, and it helped solidify national pride and a sense of shared purpose.

### **Main Provisions of the Act**

1. **Establishment of Vimy Ridge Day**  
   The Act formally designates **April 9 each year** as **"Vimy Ridge Day"**. This day is established as a national day of remembrance and reflection, honoring the courage, sacrifice, and achievements of Canadian soldiers who participated in the battle.

2. **Lowering of the Canadian Flag at Half-Mast**  
   On April 9, in each year, the **Canadian flag on the Peace Tower in Ottawa** shall be **lowered to half-mast**. This gesture is a solemn and symbolic act of respect and remembrance for the soldiers who gave their lives during the battle. The Peace Tower, as a national monument, serves as a central symbol of Canadian identity, and this provision ensures that the nation’s official flag reflects the gravity of the event.

3. **Clarification of Legal Status**  
   The Act explicitly states that **Vimy Ridge Day is not a legal holiday** or a **non-juridical day** (i.e., a day off work or school). This means that:
   - Businesses, government offices, and schools are **not required to close**.
   - There is **no legal obligation** for individuals to take time off work or school.
   - The day is not recognized for purposes of leave, pay, or public observance under labor or education laws.
