### **Detailed Summary of the *Lake of the Woods Control Board Act, 1921***

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose**
This Act establishes the **Lake of the Woods Control Board (LWCB)** as a joint administrative body responsible for managing and regulating the flow of water in key watersheds of the Great Lakes region — specifically the **Winnipeg River**, **English River**, and **Lake of the Woods** — with the primary goal of ensuring **stable water levels**, **efficient water use**, and **protection against flooding or drought**.

The Act was enacted in response to growing concerns over water management in the shared watershed between **Canada and the United States**, particularly due to the importance of these rivers for navigation, agriculture, hydroelectric power, and ecological balance. It reflects a collaborative approach between federal and provincial governments, as well as a recognition of shared international responsibilities.

#### **2. Formation and Composition of the Board**

- **Name of the Board**: *The Lake of the Woods Control Board*.
- **Number of Members**: Four members.
- **Appointment Process**:
  - **One member** appointed by the **Governor General in Council** (federal government).
  - **Two members** appointed by the **Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in Council** (provincial government of Ontario).
  - **One member** appointed by the **Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba in Council** (provincial government of Manitoba).

> This structure reflects a balance of federal oversight and provincial representation, with Manitoba included due to its geographical and hydrological connection to the Lake of the Woods watershed.

- **Eligibility Requirement**:
  - All members must be **duly qualified engineers**. This ensures technical competence and expertise in water management and hydraulics.

- **Alternate Members**:
  - Each appointing authority may appoint an **alternate member** for every member.
  - Alternates serve to fill in if the original member is absent, unable to act, or if the office becomes vacant.
  - When an alternate acts as a member, they have **full powers and responsibilities** equivalent to a regular member.

- **Term of Office**:
  - Members serve at the **pleasure of the appointing authority** — meaning their tenure is not fixed and can be terminated at any time by the appointing body.
  - In case of a vacancy, the **same authority** that previously appointed the member shall appoint a replacement.

#### **3. Core Responsibilities and Powers of the Board**

The Board is empowered to regulate and control water flows to achieve several key objectives:

##### **(a) Regulation of Lake of the Woods Water Levels**
- Maintain the **level of Lake of the Woods** between elevations recommended by the **International Joint Commission (IJC)** in its final report dated **June 12, 1917**, or between **agreed-upon elevations** with U.S.-Canada cooperation.
- This ensures stability in water levels critical for navigation, ecosystem health, and flood prevention.

##### **(b) Regulation of Lac Seul Water Levels**
- Control outflows from **Lac Seul** to maintain water levels within a range **approved jointly** by:
  - Governor General in Council,
  - Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in Council,
  - Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba in Council.

##### **(c) Flow Management Through Lake St. Joseph Diversion Works**
- Regulate water flow into Lac Seul via the **Lake St. Joseph diversion works** when the lake level exceeds specific thresholds:
  - **1168 feet** from **February 1 to May 31**,
  - **1170 feet** from **July 1 to December 31**,
  - **1169 feet** during **January and June**.

> These seasonal limits are designed to prevent flooding during high-risk periods while allowing natural water cycles.

##### **(d) Regulation of Winnipeg and English Rivers**
- Control the flow of:
  - Water from the **Winnipeg River** between its confluence with the English River and the Lake of the Woods.
  - Water in the **English River** from its junction with the Winnipeg River to Lac Seul.

##### **(e) Jurisdiction Over Other Waters**
- The Board may regulate other waters within the **Winnipeg River watershed** if agreed upon by:
  - Governor General in Council,
  - Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in Council,
  - Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba in Council.

> **Exclusions**:
> - The Board **does not have authority** over:
>   - Dams and regulating works **across international boundaries**.
>   - The **dam and regulating works at Kettle Falls** (a key international structure on the Canadian channel).

> This exclusion underscores the principle of **international cooperation** and limits federal/provincial control over transboundary infrastructure.

#### **4. Enforcement Powers and Penalties**

- **Violation of Board Orders**:
  - Any person who:
    - Violates or refuses to obey a Board order,
