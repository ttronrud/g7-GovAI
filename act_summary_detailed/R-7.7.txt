The **Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 Act** is a comprehensive legislative instrument that formally enacts and consolidates Canada’s public general statutes into a single, modernized, and authoritative legal framework. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the Act, broken down by key provisions and their legal significance.

---

## **Overview**

The *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 Act* serves as the formal legislative enactment that gives legal force and effect to the **Statute Roll of 1985**, a comprehensive revision of Canada’s public general laws. This Act was enacted to streamline, clarify, and modernize the statute book following a major statutory review process.

It is not a new law in the traditional sense but rather a **consolidation and formalization** of existing laws, replacing outdated or redundant statutes with a more coherent and accessible version. The Act ensures that the revised statutes take effect in a timely and orderly manner, with provisions for repeal of obsolete laws, transitional arrangements, and future supplementation.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

### **1. Purpose and Background (Whereas Clauses)**

- The Act is rooted in the **Statute Revision Act**, which mandates a systematic review of Canada’s public general statutes.
- The **Statute Revision Commission**, under the direction of the Minister of Justice, prepared a revision of the statutes.
- The revision was reviewed and approved by two key parliamentary committees:
  - Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs
  - Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General
- A **printed Statute Roll** was prepared in eight volumes, attested by the Governor General, countersigned by the Minister of Justice, and certified by the Chairman of the Commission.
- The Statute Roll was deposited in the office of the Clerk of the Parliaments on **November 27, 1987**.

> This establishes the legitimacy and authority of the revision through parliamentary oversight and formal attestation.

---

### **2. Legal Effect of the Statute Roll**

> **Section 1**:  
> The Act declares that the Statute Roll (containing statutes from chapter A-1 to Y-4) shall be **declared law** by being designated as the **"Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985"**.

- This means the statutes in the Statute Roll are **not merely published** — they are **legally enacted** as if they were passed directly by Parliament.
- The designation gives them **full legal force and effect**, equivalent to Acts of Parliament.

> **Section 2**:  
> The Revised Statutes come into force on a day to be **fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.

- The actual date of coming into force is **not specified in the Act**; it is left to the Governor in Council (the executive arm of government) to determine.
- This allows flexibility based on administrative, legal, or practical considerations (e.g., avoiding conflict with other legislation or ensuring proper transition).

---

### **3. Transitional Rules for Coming into Force**

> **Section 3 (a)**:  
> If an Act or portion of an Act in the Revised Statutes specifies a **specified day** or a day **to be fixed by proclamation**, then:
> - Subsection (2) applies **only if** that day is **on or before** the day set by subsection (2).
> - If the specified day or proclamation date is **after** the day in subsection (2), then the Act comes into force on the **specified or proclaimed date**.

> **Purpose**:  
> This provision ensures **consistency and predictability** in the operation of laws. It prevents a law from coming into force earlier than intended due to a misalignment between the original schedule and the effective date of the Revised Statutes.

---

### **4. Repeal of Obsolete Statutes**

> **Section 4**:  
> Immediately before the coming into force of the Revised Statutes, **all Acts and portions of Acts listed in the schedule to the Statute Roll are repealed** to the extent specified in that schedule.

- This is a **core function** of the revision process: to remove outdated, redundant, or conflicting laws.
- The repeal is **not retroactive** — it only occurs **before** the Revised Statutes take effect.
- The repeal is **limited to the extent specified**, meaning not all provisions of a law may be repealed — only those explicitly listed.

> **Section 5**:  
> The Revised Statutes **shall not be considered new law**.  
> Instead, they are to be **construed as a consolidation** of the law contained in the Acts and portions of Acts that are repealed.

- This prevents the Revised Statutes from being interpreted as creating new legal rights or obligations.
- The new version is a **compilation and reorganization** of existing law — not a new creation.

---

### **5. Reference to Repealed Acts**

> **Section 6**:  
> After the Revised Statutes take effect, any reference in an Act, regulation, or document to a repealed Act or expression used in it shall be **deemed to refer to the corresponding provision in the Revised Statutes**.

- This ensures **legal continuity** and **predictability** in legal instruments.
- For example, if a contract refers to "the Criminal Code, 1952, section 250", and that section is repealed and replaced by the Revised Statutes, the reference is now interpreted as referring to the equivalent provision in the *Criminal Code, 1985*.

> **Section 7**:  
> Forms, stationery, and documents used under or in connection with a repealed Act may **continue to be used for a reasonable period** after the Revised Statutes take effect.

- This provides **practical flexibility** for government agencies, courts, and individuals who are still using outdated forms.
- It avoids disruption in administrative or procedural processes.

---

### **6. Limitations on Interpretation of Repeal**

> **Section 8**:  
> The inclusion of an Act in the schedule to the Statute Roll **does not imply** that the Act was in force immediately before the coming into force of the Revised Statutes.

- This prevents a misinterpretation that all listed statutes were active at the time of repeal.
- The repeal is **not a declaration of prior validity** — it is a procedural step to make way for the new consolidation.

---

### **7. Exemption from the Publication of Statutes Act**

> **Section 9**:  
> The **Publication of Statutes Act** does **not apply** to the Revised Statutes.

- This is significant because the *Publication of Statutes Act* governs how Acts are published and when they are deemed to be in force.
- By excluding the Revised Statutes, the Act ensures that the consolidation process is **independent** and not subject to the standard publication rules, allowing for a more streamlined and authoritative publication.

---

### **8. Format, Distribution, and Citation**

> **Section 10**:  
> The Revised Statutes shall be printed and bound in a style and form deemed suitable by the **Statute Revision Commission**.

> **Section 11**:  
> Copies of the Revised Statutes shall be distributed **free of charge** to persons or classes directed by the **Governor in Council**.

- Ensures **accessibility** to the public, legal professionals, and institutions.
- Supports transparency and legal accountability.

> **Section 12**:  
> A chapter of the Revised Statutes may be cited in any Act, regulation, or document in several ways:
> - By its **short or long title**
> - As “Revised Statutes, 1985, chapter XXX”
> - As “chapter XXX of the Revised Statutes”
> - Using the abbreviations: **R.S.C., 1985, c. XXX** or **R.S., c. XXX**

> This standardization ensures **consistency and clarity** in legal references across all documents.

> **Section 13**:  
> A copy of this Act (the *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 Act*) may be included in one of the volumes of the Statute Roll.

- This ensures that the **enactment of the consolidation itself** is accessible alongside the statutes.

### **9. Appendices and Supplementary Materials**

> **Section 14**:  
> The Statute Revision Commission may include in the volumes of the Revised Statutes:
> - **Appendices** containing:
>   - Statutes of the **Parliament of the United Kingdom**
>   - Statutes of the **Parliament of Canada**
>   - Other constitutional documents (e.g., provincial or territorial constitutions)
> - **Schedules** similar to those in the 1970 Revised Statutes, with any necessary updates
> - An **index** to the Revised Statutes

> **Section 15**:  
> A **constitutional or quasi-constitutional statute** may be printed in the appendices and **omitted from the main volumes** of the Revised Statutes.

- This reflects the principle that certain foundational laws (e.g., the *Constitution Act, 1867*) are **not to be consolidated** into a general statute book due to their constitutional status.
- It preserves the integrity and distinct legal character of constitutional instruments.

> **Section 16**:  
> The appendices and schedules may be prepared in the form of **consolidations** for convenience.

- Improves usability and reference.

### **10. Supplements to the Revised Statutes**

> **Section 17**:  
> The Statute Revision Commission may prepare **supplements** to the Revised Statutes that include:
>
