### **5. Reorganization and Divestiture of Ridley Terminals Inc. (Key Policy Initiative)**

This is the **most significant and complex section** of the Act, outlining a government-led reorganization of **Ridley Terminals Inc.**, a major Canadian port and terminal operator.

#### **Purpose**:
To allow the Government of Canada to:
- Obtain **best value** for the business,
- Ensure long-term, **sustainable operations**,
- Promote **open access** to terminal services,
- Improve efficiency and competitiveness.

#### **Key Powers Granted to the Minister** (with Governor in Council approval):

1. **Sell or dispose of securities** of Ridley Terminals Inc.
2. **Modify the company’s objects, purposes, or business restrictions** (e.g., change its charter or activities).
3. **Procure amalgamation** (merger) of the company.
4. **Procure dissolution** (liquidation or closure).

#### **Expanded Powers for New Entities**:
The Minister may also:
- Create a **new corporation or entity** whose securities will be held by Her Majesty in right of Canada (on trust), then sell or dispose of them.
- Acquire securities of such a new entity and then dispose of them.

> This mechanism allows the government to **separate the business from its current ownership**, potentially privatize or restructure it under more favorable terms.

#### **Powers for the New Entity (or Subsidiary)**:
After the creation of a new corporation or entity (whether through incorporation, formation, or acquisition), the entity may:
- Sell or dispose of its **assets or liabilities**,
- Issue and sell securities,
- Reorganize its capital structure,
- Acquire assets from other corporations or entities,
- Amend its charter or business restrictions,
- Merge or dissolve itself,
- Take any action necessary to implement a reorganization.

> These powers are **extensive** and designed to allow full operational flexibility during transition.

#### **Governor in Council Directives**:
- The Governor in Council may **direct** Ridley Terminals or its successor entity to take specific actions (e.g., sell assets, merge).
- However, **no directive can be issued after**:
  - Any of the entity’s securities have been sold or disposed of, or
  - Any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries have had their securities sold or disposed of.
- **Compliance is mandatory** for directors or officers of the entity.

#### **Notification and Transparency**:
- After implementing a directive, the entity must **notify the Minister** within a reasonable timeframe.
- The Minister must **lay a copy of the directive before each House of Parliament** within the first 15 days of sitting.
- **Exception**: If the Minister determines that publishing the directive would harm Canada’s commercial interests, publication may be withheld — but only **after consulting the board of directors**.

> 🔐 This ensures accountability and transparency while protecting sensitive commercial information.

#### **Immunity from Legal Action**:
- No legal action (including claims for damages or restitution) may be brought against:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada,
  - Any minister or employee,
  - Any advisor or agent involved in the reorganization,
  - For any action
