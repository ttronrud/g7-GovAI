### **Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Arsenals Limited Divestiture Authorization Act***

---

#### **1. Overview and Purpose**
The *Canadian Arsenals Limited Divestiture Authorization Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by Her Majesty in Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. Its primary purpose is to **authorize the divestiture (sale or disposal) of shares and assets** of **Canadian Arsenals Limited (the "Corporation")**, a public corporation historically involved in the production and maintenance of military equipment and weapons.

This Act provides a legal framework for the **Government of Canada to transfer ownership of the Corporation’s shares and assets**, including real and personal property, to private entities or other government bodies, while ensuring transparency, control, and safeguards—particularly regarding foreign ownership and corporate governance.

It also addresses **post-divestiture governance**, **employee benefits**, and **regulatory exemptions** to facilitate a smooth transition without disrupting public service obligations or financial accountability.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Amalgamated Corporation**: A new corporation formed through the merger or amalgamation of Canadian Arsenals Limited with another corporation.
- **Corporation**: Refers specifically to *Canadian Arsenals Limited*, a corporation continuing under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA).
- **Minister**: The Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who holds authority over key decisions related to divestiture.
- **Words and expressions**: Generally have the same meaning as under the CBCA, unless otherwise defined.

---

#### **3. Authority to Sell Shares Held by the Minister**
- The **Minister is authorized to sell, on terms approved by the Governor in Council**, any or all of the shares of the Corporation that are currently held by the Minister in trust for Her Majesty.
- This provision allows for a **direct and legally sanctioned divestiture** of state-held equity in Canadian Arsenals Limited.

---

#### **4. Transfer of Property and Rights**
- For the purpose of enabling a sale, **all property, rights, and interests of Her Majesty** used in the Corporation’s operations **immediately prior to the coming into force of the Act are automatically transferred to the Corporation**.
- This ensures continuity of operations and avoids gaps in asset ownership during the transition.

---

#### **5. Exemptions and Transfer of Control**
- The **Governor in Council may issue an order** to **exempt specific property, rights, or interests** from the automatic transfer described above.
- If exempted, control, management, and administration of such assets may be **transferred to any Minister, government department, or third party**.
- This gives the federal government flexibility to retain certain strategic assets or functions even after share divestiture.

---

#### **6. Authority to Dispose of Assets Prior to Share Sale**
- The **Minister may direct the Corporation** at any time before a share sale to **sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of its assets**, including shares in other corporations.
- Upon receiving such a direction, the Corporation is **authorized and required to comply** with it.
- This enables proactive asset restructuring and disposal, not just limited to share sales.

---

#### **7. Exemptions from Relevant Corporate and Financial Laws**
- **Subsections 183(2) to (8)** of the *Canada Business Corporations Act* and **subsections 108(2) to (5)** of the *Financial Administration Act* **do not apply** to any sale or disposal of assets authorized under this Act.
- This exemption removes procedural and reporting requirements that might otherwise complicate or delay asset transactions, streamlining the divestiture process.

---

#### **8. Amendment of Articles of Incorporation**
- The **directors of the Corporation or any amalgamated corporation** must prepare and submit to the Minister for approval **proposed amendments to the Corporation’s articles of incorporation** within **four months** of the Act coming into force.
- These amendments are required to include **specific restrictions on foreign ownership** of securities.

---

#### **9. Deemed Approval Under CBCA**
- Once the Minister approves the proposed articles of amendment, they are **deemed to have been sent under section 171 of the CBCA**, which governs the formal process of amending corporate bylaws.
- This speeds up the legal recognition of changes without requiring full procedural steps under the CBCA.

---

#### **10. Restrictions on Foreign Ownership of Securities**
> **Core Provision: Preventing non-residents from holding more than 25% of voting power**

- The approved articles of amendment must contain provisions that:
  - **Prohibit non-residents** from **beneficially owning or holding** (except as security) **more than 25% of the voting securities** of the Corporation or any amalgamated corporation.
  - Provide mechanisms for **enforcing these restrictions**, such as:
    - Filing declarations of ownership
    - Suspension of voting rights
    - Forfeiture of dividends
    - Refusal to register new securities

> **Definition of "Non-Resident"**:
A non-resident includes:
- An individual who is not a Canadian citizen and not ordinarily resident in Canada
- A corporation incorporated outside Canada
- A foreign government or its political subdivisions or agents
- A corporation controlled directly or indirectly by non-residents
- A trust established by a non-resident (excluding pension trusts for residents)
- A trust in which non-residents hold >50% of beneficial interest
- A corporation controlled by such a trust

> **Joint Ownership Rule**:
If a security is held jointly and **one or more joint holders are non-residents**, the security is **deemed to be held by a non-resident**.

> **Definition of "Resident"**:
Any individual, corporation, government, or trust that is **not a non-resident**.

---

#### **11. Post-Amendment Flexibility**
- Despite the restrictions, **nothing in this Act prevents** the Corporation or its shareholders/directors from amending its articles **under the CBCA** after the amendments under this Act are implemented.
- This ensures ongoing flexibility in corporate governance.

---

#### **12. Prohibitions on Certain Corporate Actions Without Ministerial Approval**
Without prior approval from the Minister, the Corporation or any amalgamated corporation **shall not**:
- Amend any provisions included in the articles of amendment approved under section 6
- Make any articles or by-laws inconsistent with the foreign ownership restrictions
- Apply for continuance of the Corporation in another jurisdiction
- Amalgamate with another corporation
- Sell, lease, or exchange **all or substantially all** of its property
- Voluntarily dissolve or liquidate and dissolve itself

> This ensures **government oversight** over critical corporate actions, preventing unilateral changes that could undermine national interest or foreign ownership controls.

---

#### **13. Financial Adjustments to Government Accounts**
- The **Minister, after consulting with the President of the Treasury Board**, shall make necessary adjustments to the **federal government’s accounts** resulting from:
  - A share sale
  - A sale or disposal of assets
- This ensures proper financial accounting and transparency in the transition.

---

#### **14. Termination of Government Companies Operation Act**
- The **Government Companies Operation Act ceases to apply** to the Corporation.

- This marks a formal step toward **privatization or reorganization**, removing the Corporation from direct government agency status.
