## **Core Provisions and Key Features**

### **1. Eligibility and Certificate of Eligibility (Section 14)**  
- An appropriate authority can issue a **certificate of eligibility** to a qualifying student if:
  - The student has achieved a satisfactory scholastic standard.
  - The student is in need of a loan for that period of studies.
- The certificate must state the **loan amount** (not exceeding the applicable limit under Section 3).
- The authority **cannot issue certificates** in a loan year if the total amount would exceed:
  - The **provincial allocation** for that year.
  - The **supplementary allocation** (if any), determined by the Minister.

- **Part-time student**: The total outstanding principal of all part-time loans to that borrower must not exceed **$2,500**.

> The Minister may adjust both amounts using **multipliers** based on annual changes in the average cost of post-secondary education in Canada.  
> These adjustments are published in the *Canada Gazette* before each loan year begins.

> **Example**: If education costs rise, the weekly limit for full-time students increases proportionally.

### **3. Interest Policy (Section 4)**  
- **No interest is payable after April 1, 2023**, for guaranteed student loans.

  - **April 1, 2021 – March 31, 2023**: No interest payable.

---

### **5. Government Guarantee and Loss Compensation (Section 7)**

5. The loan agreement is in prescribed form and includes repayment terms.

> **Exception for Inadvertent Errors**:  
> If a lender made an error in interest rate or repayment amount (e.g., miscalculation), and the Minister determines it was **inadvertent**, the Minister may compensate the lender.

> **Lender Collection Fees**:  
> If a lender collects money from a borrower **after** the Minister has paid the lender, the Minister may reimburse the lender for the amount collected.

---

### **6. Loan Forgiveness (Section 17)**  
- The Minister may **forgive** a portion of a guaranteed student loan if the borrower:
  - Begins working as a **family physician, nurse, or nurse practitioner** in an **under-served rural or remote community**.
- Forgiveness takes effect on a **prescribed day** (e.g., after 5 years of service).
- This is intended to encourage healthcare professionals to serve in underserved areas.

- **Death of Borrower**:
  - All obligations terminate upon death.
  - The Minister pays the **principal and interest** due on the day of death.
  - If the lender does not receive notice within **30 days**, the Minister fixes a payment date under regulations.
- **Disappearance with Presumption of Death**:
  - If the Minister believes the borrower is dead (based on circumstances), obligations terminate on that day.
- **Severe Permanent Disability**:
  - If the Minister is satisfied (based on prescribed information) that the borrower has a **severe permanent disability** and will never be able to repay the loan:
    - All rights of lenders against the borrower terminate.
    - The Minister pays the principal and interest due at the time the information was provided.
  - The Governor in Council may define "severe permanent disability" via regulation.

### **8. Provincial Allocation and Funding Mechanism (Sections 16–18)**  
- The **provincial allocation** is calculated as follows:
  - **95% of basic loan provision** × (proportion of young people aged 18–24 in the province vs. Canada).
  - **5% of basic loan provision** × (proportion of part-time students in the province vs. Canada).
- The **basic loan provision** is:
  - $530 million × (estimated full-time enrollment in the current year / full-time enrollment in 1983) × (multiplier for inflation/education cost changes).

> **Supplementary Allocation**:
> - The Minister may provide up to **30% of the basic provision** to a province.
> - Total supplementary allocations across provinces are capped so no province receives more than its share.

> **Alternative Payment to Provinces**:
> - If a province has no appropriate authority and operates a provincial student loan plan, the Minister pays an **alternative amount** after the loan year ends.
> - This amount is calculated based on:
>   - Total loans paid to lenders minus collections.
>   - Proportion of eligible youth in the province.
>   - Adjustment for past loan authorizations (to prevent overfunding).

> *Purpose*: Ensures equitable distribution of funding and supports provinces without designated authorities.
