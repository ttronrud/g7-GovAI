**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (COGOA) is a comprehensive federal law that establishes the regulatory framework for the exploration, drilling, production, processing, and transportation of oil and gas in designated areas across Canada. The Act aims to balance economic development with environmental protection, safety, accountability, and the rights of Indigenous communities—particularly in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and northern territories.

It applies to onshore and offshore operations in areas under federal jurisdiction, including Nunavut, Sable Island, parts of the Northwest Territories, and the continental shelf, excluding certain zones like the "adjoining area" in Yukon.
