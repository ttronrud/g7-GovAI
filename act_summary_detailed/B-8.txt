**Detailed Summary of the Bridges Act**

---

### **General Overview**

The *Bridges Act* is a legislative framework designed to ensure the **safety, structural integrity, and proper management of bridges** in Canada (specifically in a province, likely Ontario, given the reference to the Department of Public Works and Government Services). It establishes a regulatory system under which private companies operating bridges must comply with strict safety requirements before opening them to the public, and it empowers the government to intervene when bridges are found to be unsafe.

The Act applies to all bridges—whether built by private companies or public entities—and to their approaches, associated structures, and appurtenances. It sets out detailed procedures for inspection, approval of openings, safety enforcement, reporting of incidents, and penalties for non-compliance.

---

## **Key Definitions**

- **Bridge**: Any structure that constitutes a bridge, including its approaches and related works (e.g., abutments, foundations, supports).
- **Company**: A corporation incorporated under federal or provincial authority, **excluding railway companies** or those under direct government control.
- **Minister**: The Minister of Public Works and Government Services, the primary regulatory authority responsible for overseeing bridge safety.

---

## **1. Conditions for Opening a Bridge to the Public**

A bridge **cannot be opened for public use** until one of the following conditions is met:

- **Option 1 (1-month notice)**: The company gives **written notice to the Minister at least one month before opening** of its intention to open the bridge.
- **Option 2 (10-day notice)**: The company gives **written notice to the Minister at least ten days before opening**, stating that, in its opinion, the bridge is **sufficiently completed and safe for inspection and public use**.

> This dual requirement ensures that the government has time to assess the bridge’s safety before public access is granted.

---

## **2. Government Inspection and Safety Assessment**

Upon receiving a notice under Section 4, the **Minister must appoint an engineer** from the Department of Public Works and Government Services to:

- Examine the bridge.
- Report in writing on whether it is **complete and sufficient** for public use.
- State the **grounds** for their opinion.

### **Postponement of Opening (Section 5)**

If the engineer determines the bridge is **dangerous due to incompleteness or insufficiency**, the Minister (with **Governor in Council approval**) may:

- Order the company to **postpone the opening** for up to **one month**.

This can be extended **if further inspection** reveals ongoing deficiencies.

> The postponement order is **only binding** if the company receives a **copy of the engineer’s report** that supports the order.

---

## **3. Mandatory Inspections by the Minister (Section 7)**

The Minister may **direct an inspection** of any bridge at any time if:

- There is evidence of **defects, poor repair, faulty construction**, or other hazards.
- Circumstances arise that, in the Minister’s judgment, make inspection **expedient**.

Upon receiving an engineer’s report, the Minister may:

- **Condemn** the bridge or any part of it.
- With **Governor in Council approval**, require:
  - Replacement of the bridge or part of it.
  - Use of new materials.
  - Alterations or changes to the structure.

> This gives the government the power to enforce structural remediation when safety risks are identified.

---

## **4. Obligations of the Company (Section 8)**

The company (or its operator) must:

- **Immediately respond** to any notice from the Minister about:
  - Defects or insufficiencies.
  - Required changes or repairs.
- Make necessary **remedial actions** (e.g., repairs, substitutions, material changes).

> This ensures that companies are not only accountable for safety but must actively respond to government directives.

---

## **5. Authority of Inspecting Engineers (Section 10–12)**

Any engineer authorized to inspect a bridge may:

- Enter and examine the bridge at **all reasonable times**, upon showing proper authority.
- Require access to **all relevant records**, including:
  - Contracts.
  - Plans, specifications, drawings.
  - Maintenance and repair logs.

> The **Minister’s written instruction** is sufficient proof of an engineer’s authority.

### **Power to Prohibit Use (Section 12)**

If an engineer determines a bridge is **dangerous**, they may issue a written notice to the company’s leadership (e.g., president, managing director) forbidding:

1. **Railway or tramway trains or cars** from crossing the bridge (if dangerous to trains).
2. **Vehicles** from crossing (if dangerous to vehicles).
3. **Passengers** from using the bridge (if dangerous to passengers).

> The notice must clearly state:
> - The reason for the danger.
> - The specific defects or risks.

### **Minister’s Review and Authority (Section 13)**

The Minister must **review** the engineer’s decision and may:
- **Confirm**, **modify**, or **disallow** the restriction.
- Issue a formal notice to the affected company.

> This provides a **check-and-balance mechanism**, ensuring government oversight and preventing arbitrary decisions.

---

## **6. Legal Liability and Safety Responsibility (Section 14)**

> **Crucially**, nothing in the Act:
- Relieves any company from **liability under law** to Her Majesty or to individuals for:
  - Wrongful acts.
  - Neglect.
  - Misfeasance.
  - Malfeasance.
  - Non-feasance (failure to act).
- Weakens or diminishes the company’s **existing legal responsibilities** under provincial laws.

> This means that even if the bridge is deemed safe under this Act, the company remains fully liable for any harm caused by negligence, accidents, or poor maintenance.

---

## **7. Notification of Orders (Section 15)**

A company is deemed to have **received sufficient notice** of:

- A Ministerial order **if** a signed notice is delivered to:
  - President, vice-president, managing director, secretary, or superintendent.
  - Or to the company’s office.

- An inspecting engineer’s order **if** a signed notice is delivered to the company.

> This ensures clear and enforceable communication of safety directives.

---

## **8. Reporting Requirements (Section 16–18)**

### **Accident Reporting (Section 16)**

Every company must report **within 48 hours** of any accident involving:

- Serious personal injury.
- Structural damage rendering the bridge impassable or unsafe.

> This ensures rapid government response to major incidents.

---

### **Periodic Accident Returns (Section 17)**

Every company must submit a **true and detailed return** to the Minister **within one month** of January 1 and July 1 each year, under oath by its president, secretary, or superintendent. The return must include:

- **Cause and nature** of accidents or casualties.
- Whether they occurred **by day or night**.
- Full details of the incident.

Additionally, the company must **transmit a copy** of:
- Its **by-laws**.
- **Rules and regulations** governing bridge operations.

---

### **Additional Reporting (Section 18)**

The Minister may require companies to submit **additional reports** on **serious accidents** (even without personal injury) in public traffic, in a format and manner deemed necessary for public safety.

> This allows the Minister to monitor safety trends beyond just injury-based data.

---

## **9. Privilege of Returns (Section 19)**

All returns submitted under Sections 17 and 18 are **privileged communications** and **cannot be used as evidence in any court**.

> This protects the confidentiality of internal safety data and prevents companies from being sued for reporting issues related to bridge safety.

---

## **10. Penalties for Non-Compliance (Section 20–24)**

The Act prescribes **fines** for various breaches:

| Violation | Fine |
|--------|------|
| Opening bridge **without required notice** to Minister | **$200 per day** the bridge remains open |
| Opening bridge **contrary to a Minister’s postponement order** | **$200 per day** the bridge remains open |
| **Wilfully omitting** to report an accident to the Minister | **$200 per day** the omission continues |
| **Failing to deliver** required returns (periodic or otherwise) | **$100 per day** the delay continues |

> Fines are **daily penalties**, emphasizing ongoing accountability.

---

## **Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public Safety First** | The Act prioritizes the safety of the public over convenience or speed of use. |
| **Government Oversight** | The Minister and appointed engineers have broad powers to inspect, assess, and intervene. |
| **Corporate Accountability** | Companies are legally responsible for safety and must comply with reporting and repair obligations. |
