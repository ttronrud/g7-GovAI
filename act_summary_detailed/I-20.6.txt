**Detailed Summary of the *International Transfer of Offenders Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *International Transfer of Offenders Act* (the "Act") establishes a legal framework for the **transfer of Canadian and foreign offenders between Canada and other countries**, with the primary goals of:

- Enhancing **public safety**  
- Supporting the **administration of justice**  
- Promoting the **rehabilitation and reintegration** of offenders into society  

This Act enables offenders to serve their sentences in the country of their citizenship or nationality, provided that certain conditions are met. It applies to both **Canadian offenders** serving sentences abroad and **foreign offenders** serving sentences in Canada.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Canadian offender** | A Canadian citizen found guilty of a criminal offence, currently detained or under supervision (e.g., probation) in a foreign country, and whose verdict and sentence cannot be appealed. |
| **Criminal offence** | An offence against an Act of Parliament. |
| **Foreign entity** | A foreign state or its political subdivisions (e.g., provinces, states), colonies, dependencies, or international tribunals — with which Canada has a treaty or administrative arrangement on offender transfer. |
| **Foreign offender** | A citizen or national of a foreign entity found guilty of a criminal offence and currently detained or under supervision in Canada, whose verdict and sentence cannot be appealed. |

## **Core Purpose**

> *To enhance public safety and contribute to the administration of justice and rehabilitation of offenders by allowing them to serve their sentences in the country of their citizenship or nationality.*

This reflects a balance between **international cooperation** and **domestic justice concerns**, ensuring that offenders are not returned to Canada if doing so would pose a threat to public safety or undermine rehabilitation efforts.

## **Conditions for Transfer**

### 1. **Substantive Requirement (Section 4)**
- A transfer is **not available** unless the Canadian offender’s conduct would have **constituted a criminal offence in Canada** at the time the Minister receives the transfer request.
- **Important**: The definition of the offence in the foreign country is not required to match Canada’s. The key is whether it would have been a criminal offence under Canadian law.

> *Example:* If a foreign jurisdiction labels a conduct as "a minor breach of public order," but Canadian law would have classified it as a criminal offence (e.g., assault), the transfer may still proceed.

---

### 2. **Special Provision for Children (Section 5)**
- A **child** (as defined in the *Youth Criminal Justice Act*) may be transferred **even if their conduct would not have been a criminal offence in Canada at the time** of the offence.
- However, **such a child may not be detained in Canada** — they must be released or supervised under youth justice provisions.

---

### 3. **No Increase or Invalidating of Sentences**
- Transfers **do not increase** sentences imposed by foreign entities.
- They **do not invalidate** guilty verdicts or sentences in foreign jurisdictions.
- These outcomes are **final and not subject to appeal or review in Canada**.

---

### 4. **Acceptance of Foreign Documents**
- A document from a foreign entity stating a finding of guilt and sentence, **signed by a judicial official or prison director**, is **admissible as proof** of those facts **unless contradicted by evidence**.
- **No need to verify the signature or official status** of the signatory — this simplifies the process of verifying foreign convictions.

---

## **Administrative Framework**

### 1. **Ministerial Responsibility**
- The **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** is responsible for administering the Act.
- The Minister may designate a staff member (within the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act* definition) to act on their behalf in relation to key sections (e.g., 8, 12, 15, 24, 30, 37).

### 2. **Request for Transfer**
- A transfer **requires a written request** from the foreign entity to the Minister.
- **No transfer occurs without a formal written request**.

### 3. **Consent Requirements**
- **Three-party consent** is required:  
  - The offender (Canadian or foreign)  
  - The foreign entity  
  - Canada (via the Minister)

> **Note:** Consent can be **withdrawn at any time before transfer**.

### 4. **Information Disclosure**
- The Minister must:
  - Inform **Canadian offenders** in writing about how their foreign sentence will be served.
  - For those required under the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act*, inform them of their obligations under that Act and relevant sections of the *Criminal Code*.
  - Deliver **Form 1 of the Schedule** to the offender, the provincial Attorney General, the provincial minister of justice, and the person in charge of the detention facility **on the day of transfer**.
  - Deliver to **foreign offenders** the information provided by the foreign entity about how their Canadian sentence will be served.

## **Factors Considered by the Minister in Deciding Consent**

1. Whether return to Canada would threaten **national security**.
2. Whether return would endanger **public safety**, including:
   - Victims of the offence
   - Family members (especially in cases of family violence)
   - Children (especially in sexual offence cases)
3. Whether the offender is likely to **continue criminal activity** after transfer.
4. Whether the offender **intended to abandon Canada** as a permanent residence.

6. Presence of **social or family ties in Canada**.
7. The offender’s **health**.
8. Whether the offender **refused rehabilitation or reintegration programs**.
9. Whether the offender **accepted responsibility** for the crime (e.g., acknowledged harm to victims).
10. The **manner of supervision** after transfer.
11. Whether the offender has **cooperated with law enforcement**.
12. Whether the offender has previously been transferred under this or the *Transfer of Offenders Act (T-15)*.

For **all offenders**, the Minister may also consider:

- Whether the offender will commit a **terrorism offence** or **criminal organization offence** (as defined in section 2 of the *Criminal Code*).
- Whether the offender has been **previously transferred** under this Act or T-15.

## **Special Considerations for Youth and Children**

### For **Young Persons** (under 18, under *Youth Criminal Justice Act*)
- The Minister and provincial authority must consider the **best interests of the young person**.

### For **Children** (under 12, under *Youth Criminal Justice Act*)
- The **primary consideration** is the **best interests of the child**.

> These provisions reflect Canada’s commitment to child protection and rehabilitation, especially in cases involving youth.

---

## **Transfer Process and Legal Effect**

### 1. **Voluntary Consent**
- All consents must be in **writing**.
- The Minister must take **all reasonable steps** to ensure consent is **voluntary**.

### 2. **Enforcement of Sentences in Canada**
- Once transferred, the **enforcement of the sentence continues as if the offender were convicted in Canada**.
- The sentence is enforced under **Canadian law**, including applicable statutes and procedures.

---

## **Sentence Limitations and Equivalency**

### 1. **Maximum Sentence Cap (Section 17)**
- If the foreign sentence exceeds the **maximum Canadian sentence** for the equivalent offence, the offender serves **only the shorter sentence**.
- The Minister must **identify the equivalent offence** under Canadian law at the time of the request.

> *Example:* If a foreign country imposes a 30-year sentence for a crime that Canada would have punished with a maximum of 10 years, the offender serves only 10 years.

---

## **Probation and Supervision**

- A foreign sentence consisting of **supervision (not conditional release)** or **a supervision period under imprisonment of less than two years** is deemed to be a **probation order**:
  - Up to **3 years** under *section 731 of the Criminal Code*
  - Up to **2 years** under *paragraph 42(2)(k) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act*

## **Youth Sentences and "Adult" Status**
