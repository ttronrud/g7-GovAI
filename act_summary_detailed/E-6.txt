### **Detailed Summary of the Energy Administration Act**

---

#### **Overview**
The *Energy Administration Act* is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation in Canada that establishes a regulatory and financial framework for the **export of oil and transportation fuels**, and for **crude oil pricing in interprovincial and international trade**. The Act provides the legislative authority for the Canadian government to ensure **price stability, equitable distribution, and national energy self-sufficiency** by regulating export charges, setting maximum prices for crude oil, and managing the economic interests of producers and consumers across provinces.

It is primarily administered by the **Canadian Energy Regulator (Regulator)**, with key powers granted to the **Minister of Natural Resources** and the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet).

To generate revenue from oil exports and provide a mechanism for managing export-related costs.

#### **Key Elements**
- A **charge is imposed per cubic metre of oil exported** in any month or part of a month.
- The **maximum charge is $350 per cubic metre**, as prescribed in a **tariff of charges**.

#### **Duration of Tariff**
- Once established, the tariff **continues month-to-month** until changed by a new order of the Governor in Council.

#### **Payment and Responsibility**
- The **exporter** (holder of a valid licence) is responsible for paying the charge.
- If no exporter is liable (e.g., due to a transaction without a licensed exporter), **the person who exported the oil is liable**.

#### **Filing and Reporting**
- Exporters must file a **monthly return** with the Regulator within **the first month after the export month**.
- The return must include accurate data on exports and be filed **by the last day of the first month after the export month**.

### **2. Transportation Fuel Compensation Recovery Charge (Part II)**

#### **Purpose**
To recover costs associated with the movement of transportation fuels (e.g., aviation fuel) from Canada, especially when no charge applies under Part I.

#### **Key Elements**
- A **compensation recovery charge** is levied on each cubic metre of **transportation fuel** exported (acquired in Canada and taken outside).
- The **maximum charge is $350 per cubic metre**, set in a tariff approved by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister and Minister of Finance.
