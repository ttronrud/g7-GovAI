The Act begins with a series of **"Whereas" clauses** that establish the **legal, moral, and strategic rationale** for enacting the legislation. These clauses emphasize:

- **Fundamental rights**: Canadians and all people have a right to live in peace, freedom, and security.

- **Impact on Canadian society**: Terrorism undermines:
  - Political institutions
  - Economic stability
  - General welfare of the population
- **Transnational nature of terrorism**: The complexity and cross-border nature of terrorist activities require **international cooperation** and stronger national capabilities to investigate, suppress, and prevent such acts.
- **International obligations**: Canada must work with other nations and fully implement **United Nations and other international instruments** related to counter-terrorism.
- **Balance with Charter rights**: While combating terrorism, the Government must **uphold and protect** the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, ensuring that measures taken do not violate fundamental liberties.
