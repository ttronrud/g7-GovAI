**Detailed Summary of the *Crown Liability and Proceedings Act***  
*(Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, as amended and in force)*

### **Overview**

The *Crown Liability and Proceedings Act* (CLPA) establishes the legal framework governing civil liability and judicial procedures involving claims against the **Crown of Canada**—Her Majesty in right of Canada. It defines when the Crown is liable for damages, outlines the procedural rules for bringing and adjudicating claims, and includes specific provisions addressing **interception of private communications**, **salvage rights**, **exemptions from liability**, and **enforcement mechanisms** for international environmental and labour cooperation agreements.

This Act is foundational in balancing the need for accountability of government institutions with the constitutional and operational immunity inherent in the Crown’s public functions.

## **Core Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Crown Liability for Damages (Sections 3–4)**

#### **General Principle**
The Crown is **personally liable** for damages under civil tort principles, **as if it were a private individual**, in the following circumstances:

- **In Quebec**:  
  - Damage caused by the **fault of a Crown servant**; or  
  - Damage resulting from the **act of a thing** (e.g., vehicle, property) in the Crown’s custody or ownership, or due to the Crown’s fault as custodian/owner.

- **In other provinces**:  
  - A **tort committed by a Crown servant**; or  
  - A **breach of duty** related to ownership, occupation, possession, or control of property.

> This establishes that the Crown is not immune from tort liability in the same way as private parties, especially when a servant acts negligently or unlawfully.

#### **Motor Vehicle Liability (Section 4)**
- The Crown is liable for damages caused by a **Crown-owned motor vehicle on a highway**, **if the Crown would have been liable if it were a private person**.
- This applies to personal injury, property damage, or loss.
- **Exception**: No liability if the **driver or their personal representative** is liable.

> This provision ensures accountability for government vehicles and protects individuals harmed by them.

---

### **2. Civil Salvage Rights (Sections 3–5)**

- **Salvage services** rendered to assist a **Crown ship or aircraft**, or to save life, cargo, or apparel belonging to the Crown, are treated **the same as if the property belonged to a private person**.
- **Section 53 of the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act** applies to such services in the same manner as to private vessels.

> This encourages private actors to provide emergency assistance to government vessels and ensures fair compensation.

---

### **3. Exemptions from Liability (Section 5)**

The Crown is **not liable** for actions taken in the exercise of its **prerogative powers** or statutory authorities, including:

- Defence of Canada;
- Training or maintaining the Canadian Forces (in peacetime or wartime);
- Any action taken in the exercise of powers conferred by law.

> This protects government functions essential to national security and public order from being subject to civil liability.

> **Important**: This exemption applies **only to acts done in the exercise of official powers**, not to negligence or misconduct outside such duties.

---

### **4. No Proceedings Where Compensation Has Been Paid (Section 6)**

- **No civil claim** may be brought against the Crown or its servant if:
  - A **pension or compensation** has already been paid or is payable from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** or any Crown-administered fund, in respect of death, injury, or loss.

> This prevents duplicate claims and ensures that compensation paid under existing welfare or insurance schemes is final.

---

### **5. Limitations on Claims Against Servants (Section 7)**

- Claims under subsection 3(a)(i) or (b)(i) (i.e., tort or breach of duty) **do not lie** unless:
  - The servant’s act or omission would have given rise to a personal liability **in the absence of this Act**.
  - That is, the servant must have been personally liable as a private individual.

> This protects government servants from being sued in cases where their actions were lawful or within scope of duty.

---

### **6. No Liability for Motor Vehicle Damages (Section 8)**

- A claim for damage caused by a Crown motor vehicle on a highway **only proceeds** if the **driver** (or their representative) is liable.

> This shifts responsibility to the individual driver, preserving the Crown’s immunity from liability when the driver is at fault.

---

### **7. Exemption from Liability for Interception of Private Communications (Sections 17–18)**

#### **Section 17 – Interception of Private Communications**

- **Liability**: If a Crown servant **intentionally intercepts** a private communication (e.g., phone call, radio message) during employment, the Crown is liable for:
  - All **loss or damage** caused;
  - **Punitive damages** up to **$5,000 per victim**.

> This applies to electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical, or other interception devices.

#### **Exemptions (Section 17(2))**
The Crown is **not liable** if:
- The interception was **lawful**;
- Made with **consent** (express or implied) of the originator or intended recipient;
- Conducted by a servant engaged in **radio frequency spectrum management** to prevent unauthorized transmissions.

> This protects legitimate government surveillance activities under strict conditions.

#### **Section 18 – Unauthorized Disclosure of Intercepts**

- If a servant **intentionally uses or discloses** intercepted content (or its substance, meaning, or existence), the Crown is liable for:
  - All **loss or damage**;
  - **Punitive damages up to $5,000 per victim**.

#### **Exemptions (Section 18(2))**
Disclosure is **not liable** if:
- With **consent** of originator or intended recipient;
- In **civil or criminal proceedings** (as evidence);
- For **criminal investigations** where the intercept was not unlawful;
- To **peace officers or prosecutors** in Canada or foreign jurisdictions for justice;
- To **identify or prevent unauthorized use of frequencies** (in radio management roles);
- Where disclosure is made in the **public interest** or for administration of justice.

> This balances privacy rights with national security and law enforcement needs.

#### **Special Rule on Multiple Recipients**
- If a communication is intended for **more than one person**, consent from **any one** is sufficient to exempt the Crown.

> This avoids overly strict requirements in multi-party communications.

#### **No Punitive Damages Where Criminal Penalty Exists**
- If a person is **already ordered to pay punitive damages under subsection 194(1) of the Criminal Code**, **no further punitive damages** can be awarded under this Act.

> Prevents double punishment.

#### **Accountability of Servants**
- If the Crown is found liable under Sections 17 or 18, the **servant** is **accountable** to the Crown for the judgment amount.
- The Crown may **recover the amount from the servant**.

> This ensures internal accountability within government agencies.

### **8. Enforcement of International Panel Determinations (Sections 20.1–20.4)**

#### **Background**
Canada is party to several **environmental and labour cooperation treaties** (e.g., North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, Canada–Chile agreements).

Under these treaties, **panels** may make decisions requiring Canada to pay **monetary assessments**.

#### **Key Provisions**

- A **panel determination** (e.g., a financial assessment) may be **made an order of the Federal Court** by:
  - Filing a **certified copy** with the Federal Court Registry.
  - Upon filing, the determination becomes a **binding order** of the Federal Court.

> This enables legal enforcement of international financial obligations.

#### **Enforceability**
- The order is **
