**Detailed Summary of the *Fisheries Improvement Loans Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Fisheries Improvement Loans Act* (FILA) is a Canadian federal statute designed to support the fishing industry by providing financial assistance to fishermen through **guaranteed loans**. The Act establishes conditions under which the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** will compensate lenders (such as banks, credit unions, or trust companies) for losses incurred when they extend loans to fishermen for specific fishing-related purposes. It also includes provisions on loan eligibility, repayment terms, reporting requirements, enforcement, and limits on liability.

This Act was enacted to promote the development and sustainability of primary fishing enterprises—particularly in rural and coastal communities—by improving access to capital for essential infrastructure and equipment.

## **Limitations on Minister’s Liability**

Several **time-based and cap-based limitations** apply to the Minister’s liability:

### 1. **Post-June 28, 1983 – Registration/Reporting Compliance**
- If a lender fails to comply with regulations regarding:
  - Registration of the loan
  - Reporting on the loan
  - Claim procedures
- The Minister is **not liable** for losses related to loans made after June 28, 1983.
- The lender must be **notified in writing** by the Minister if no payment will be made.

### 2. **Termination of Liability by Notice**
- The **Governor in Council** (federal cabinet) may, with approval, **terminate the Minister’s liability** for loans made after a date fixed in writing (at least **14 days after dispatch** of notice).
- This termination applies to all loans made by a particular lender after the fixed date.

### 3. **Local Proclamation Termination**
- The Governor in Council may issue a **proclamation** terminating liability for guaranteed loans in a **specific locality** (e.g., a region or province) for any purpose under the Act.
- The termination must take effect **at least 14 days after publication in the Canada Gazette**.
- This proclamation can be **reversed later** by a further proclamation.

### 4. **Caps on Total Liability (Post-September 12, 1968)**  
The Minister is **not liable** for losses exceeding the following caps:

| Loan Principal Amount | Maximum Liability |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Up to $125,000 | 90% of the amount |
| Over $125,000 but ≤ $250,000 | 50% of the excess |
| Over $250,000 | 10% of the excess |

> *This cap applies only to guaranteed loans made after September 12, 1968.*

### 5. **Aggregate Caps Based on Time Periods**

- **July 1, 1983 – June 30, 1985**:  
  If the **total principal amount** of guaranteed loans issued by all lenders during this period exceeds **$100 million**, the Minister is **not liable** for any further losses.

- **July 1, 1985 – June 30, 1987**:  
  If the total principal amount exceeds **$30 million**, the Minister is **not liable** for losses in that period.

- **After June 30, 1987**:  
  The Minister is **not liable at all** for any guaranteed loans made after this date.

> These caps are designed to prevent excessive government exposure as the program expanded.

   - “Principal occupation”
   - “Hull” and “superstructure”
   - “Repair,” “alteration,” “additions,” and “major” in relation to repairs/overhauls

## **Loan Term Modifications and Default**

- **Term Changes**:  
  If a lender, with the **borrower’s written consent**, alters or revises loan terms (e.g., repayment schedule, security), this **does not discharge** the Minister’s liability for the original loan.

- **Security Rights for Banks**:  
  A bank making a guaranteed loan may take security (e.g., mortgage, hypothec, lien, conditional sale) on real or personal property—**even if the loan proceeds are not used for that property**.  
  The bank retains all rights and powers it would have under the *Bank Act* in relation to such security.
