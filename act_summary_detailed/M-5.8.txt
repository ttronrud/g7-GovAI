1. **Preamble and Rationale:**
   - The Act begins with two "Whereas" clauses that establish the historical and moral foundation for its enactment:
     - **First "Whereas":** Recognizes that Merchant Navy veterans have served honorably and courageously throughout history in the defence of Canada.

**Historical and Social Context:**

The Merchant Navy played a crucial role in Canada’s wartime efforts, particularly during the Second World War. Canadian merchant ships transported food, fuel, raw materials, and troops across the Atlantic and Pacific, often under direct threat from enemy submarines and air attacks. Despite not engaging in direct combat, these sailors faced significant danger and loss, with over 2,000 Canadian Merchant Navy sailors losing their lives during the war. Their contributions were essential to maintaining supply chains and supporting the Allied war effort.

This Act ensures that their service is formally recognized at the national level, correcting a historical gap in public recognition compared to other branches of the military.

**Conclusion:**

The *Merchant Navy Veterans Day Act* is a meaningful and respectful piece of legislation that affirms the importance of the Merchant Navy in Canada’s national identity and history. By designating September 3 as "Merchant Navy Veterans Day," the Act provides a permanent and official channel through which Canadians can honor the courage, resilience, and selflessness of these veterans. It stands as a testament to the value of all forms of service to the nation and reinforces the principle that national defence and freedom are sustained not only by combat forces but by the quiet, steadfast work of those who keep the world moving—on the sea, in the skies, and in the hearts of the people.
