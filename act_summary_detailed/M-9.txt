**Detailed Summary of the *Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act* (MVFCSA) is a Canadian federal statute designed to promote energy efficiency in the motor vehicle sector by establishing fuel consumption standards, ensuring transparency through labeling, and imposing penalties on companies that fail to meet these standards. The Act applies to all motor vehicles designed for road use (excluding rail-based vehicles) and regulates how fuel consumption is measured, reported, and labeled.

It establishes a regulatory framework that balances environmental sustainability with industry flexibility, including provisions for exemptions and appeals, while protecting consumer information and ensuring accountability.

## **Regulatory Framework and Standards**

### **1. Setting Fuel Consumption Standards (Section 3)**
- The **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Natural Resources) may establish fuel consumption standards for specific classes of motor vehicles for each year.
- These standards are based on scientific and technical assessments and aim to reduce overall fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions.

> **Example**: A standard might require that all new sedans consume no more than 8.5 L/100 km.

---

### **2. Public Consultation and Transparency (Section 4)**
- Before implementing a regulation, the Governor in Council must:
  - Publish a **proposed regulation** in the *Canada Gazette* at least **90 days** before its effective date.
  - Provide **reasonable opportunity** for companies and stakeholders to submit written representations.
- **Exemptions**:
  - This requirement does **not apply** if:
    - The regulation has already been published (even if unchanged), or
    - There is no substantive change to an existing regulation.

---

### **3. Validity of Fuel Consumption Standards (Section 5)**
A standard is **only valid** if one of the following conditions is met:
1. Published in the *Canada Gazette* before the end of the **third year prior** to the year in question.
2. **Not more stringent** than the previous year’s standard (to allow for gradual improvement).
3. **No objections** were received from companies during the 90-day public comment period.

> This ensures that standards are not arbitrarily increased and that industry has a fair chance to respond.

---

## **Fuel Consumption Number and Labeling Requirements (Section 7)**

### **Mandatory Requirements for Sale or Import**
A motor vehicle of a prescribed class may **only be sold or imported** if:
1. A **registered fuel consumption number (FCN)** is on file with the Minister.
2. A **label** with prescribed fuel consumption information is **affixed to the vehicle** in the prescribed manner.
3. The vehicle is **substantially similar** to the vehicle(s) used to establish the FCN (based on manufacturer specifications and prescribed rules).

> This ensures that consumers receive accurate, comparable fuel data.

### **Exception for Pre-Departure Compliance**
- A company is **not in violation** if the FCN and label requirements are met **before** the vehicle leaves the company’s possession or that of its consignee.

---

## **Registration of Fuel Consumption Numbers (Section 7)**

- A company can apply to the Minister for registration of an FCN if:
  - The FCN was established using the **prescribed procedure** (e.g., standardized testing).
- Applications must be submitted in **prescribed form** and contain required information.
- The Minister must **register the FCN promptly** upon receipt of a valid application.
- **No registration** is allowed if the FCN was not established per the prescribed procedure.

---

## **Prohibition and Enforcement of Misleading Claims (Section 8)**

The Minister may issue an **order** prohibiting:
- The use of a registered FCN, and
- Fuel consumption information related to it, in advertising or public representations

**Grounds for such an order**:
1. The vehicle is **not substantially similar** to the test vehicle(s) used to establish the FCN.
2. The application for registration contained **false or misleading information**.
3. The FCN was **not established per the prescribed procedure**.

> The order takes effect **60 days after issuance** (or later date as specified).

---

## **Revisions to Registered Fuel Consumption Numbers (Section 8(3))**

- A company that has been issued a prohibited FCN may apply for a **revised FCN**.
- The Minister is **not obligated** to register a revised number if it does not correctly represent the actual fuel consumption.

> This allows for corrections but maintains accountability.

---

## **Reporting Obligations (Section 9)**

Every company must submit an **annual report** to the Minister, containing:
- Number of motor vehicles **manufactured** in Canada for sale **outside** the province of manufacture.
- Number of vehicles **imported** into Canada for sale.
- Number of vehicles **manufactured in Canada** for sale **within Canada**, excluding those with a national fuel consumption mark (as defined in section 17).

> **Reporting Year Flexibility**: A vehicle is deemed manufactured or imported in the **year it was actually produced or imported**, or in the **following year**, at the company’s option.

---

## **Company Average Fuel Consumption (Section 10)**

For each prescribed class of vehicle, the Minister calculates a **company average fuel consumption** (in L/100 km) based on:
- Annual reports submitted by companies.
- **Prescribed equivalence factors** for vehicles using fuels other than reference gasoline (e.g., diesel, ethanol blends).

> This average reflects the overall fuel efficiency of a company’s fleet.

---

## **Penalty System (Section 11)**

### **When a Penalty Applies**
If a company’s **company average fuel consumption exceeds** the fuel consumption standard for a given year, the Minister issues an **assessment** imposing a penalty equal to:

> **(Penalty per 0.01 L/100 km × excess amount) × total number of vehicles reported**

### **Penalty Reductions (Section 11(3))**
The penalty is **reduced** by:
- The amount corresponding to **how much lower** the company’s average was than the standard in **any of the three prior years** or the **next year**.

> This encourages gradual improvement over time and avoids punitive penalties for one-off deviations.

### **Penalty Cap**
- The reduction is **not cumulative**; once used, it cannot be applied to a later penalty.

### **Payment Deadline**
- The penalty becomes payable to the **Receiver General** **one year after** the notice of assessment is served.

---

## **Appeals Process (Section 13)**

### **Step-by-Step Appeal Path**
1. A company may **object** to an assessment within **30 days** of receiving the notice.
2. The Minister must:
   - **Reconsider** the assessment.
   - **Confirm, cancel, or vary** the assessment.
   - Serve a copy of the decision to the company.
3. The decision is based **only** on:
   - Whether the data used was correct.
   - Whether the Act and regulations were applied correctly.
4. The company may **appeal to the Federal Court** within 30 days of receiving the decision.
5. The Federal Court must base its decision **only** on the two criteria above.

> This ensures judicial oversight and protects companies from arbitrary enforcement.

---

## **Exemptions (Section 16)**

The Governor in Council may grant **exemptions** from fuel consumption standards under the following conditions:

### **(a) Small Production Volumes**
- Up to **1,000 vehicles per year** may be exempted if:
  - The manufacturer’s **world production** was less than **10,000 vehicles** in the **second year prior** to the exemption year.
- Reason: It would not be desirable to apply the standard to such small-scale or niche vehicles.

### **(b) Substantial Financial Hardship or Innovation Barriers**
- Any or all vehicles may be exempted if compliance would:
  - Cause **substantial financial hardship**, or
  - **Prevent the development** of new vehicle types (e.g., electric, hydrogen, or experimental designs).

> Exemptions are granted at the discretion of the Governor in Council.
