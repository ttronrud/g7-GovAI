**Detailed Summary of the *Settlement of International Investment Disputes Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Settlement of International Investment Disputes Act* (SI/2013-115) is a Canadian statute enacted to implement and provide domestic legal recognition and enforcement of international investment dispute settlement mechanisms under the **United Nations Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention)**. This Act establishes Canada’s legal framework for recognizing, enforcing, and regulating international investment arbitration and conciliation proceedings between foreign investors and host states — or between states and nationals of other states — in accordance with international law.

The Act came into force on **November 1, 2013**, and is designed to ensure consistency with the ICSID Convention while providing clarity and enforceability within Canadian jurisprudence.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Title and Scope**
- **Title:** The Act is known as the *Settlement of International Investment Disputes Act*.
- It applies to:
  - Awards rendered under the ICSID Convention;
  - Arbitration agreements entered into under the Convention;
  - Conciliation proceedings initiated under the Convention — **both before and after the Act’s coming into force**.

> This means the Act retroactively applies to disputes already under the Convention and provides a modern, enforceable legal basis for future disputes.

---

### **2. Definitions**
- **Award**: Refers to an arbitral award issued by an arbitral tribunal under Article 37 of the ICSID Convention, including any interpretation, revision, or annulment of that award.
- **Convention**: Refers to the full text of the ICSID Convention, as set out in the Schedule to the Act.

> These definitions anchor the Act in the original international treaty framework.

---

### **3. Precedence Over Conflicting Laws**
- Despite Section 5 of the *United Nations Foreign Arbitral Awards Convention Act* and the *Commercial Arbitration Act*, **this Act or the ICSID Convention takes precedence** in case of any inconsistency.
- This ensures that Canada’s domestic law does not override international obligations under the ICSID Convention.

> This provision affirms Canada’s commitment to international investment dispute settlement norms.

---

### **4. Application and Jurisdiction**
- The Act applies to:
  - All awards rendered under the ICSID Convention;
  - All arbitration agreements formed under the Convention;
  - All conciliation proceedings under the Convention — regardless of when they began.

> This creates a **continuous and binding legal regime** for investment disputes involving Canada and foreign nationals or states.

---

### **5. Legal Personality and Privileges of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID Centre)**
- The **International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (Centre)** established under the ICSID Convention is granted **full international legal personality**.
- This includes the capacity to:
  - Contract;
  - Acquire and dispose of property (movable and immovable);
  - Institute legal proceedings.

> This enables the Centre to function independently and operate globally as a neutral dispute resolution body.

#### **Immunities and Privileges of the Centre**
- **Immunity from legal process** (except when waived);
- **Immunity from taxation and customs duties** on Centre operations, income, and assets;
- **Exemption from liability for tax collection or payment**;
- **Exemption from local taxation on salaries, allowances, or fees** paid to officials and arbitrators, provided the tax basis is not the location of the Centre or proceedings.

> These immunities protect the Centre from interference and ensure its neutrality and operational independence.

---

### **6. Privileges and Immunities of Individuals**
The Act grants specific immunities to key personnel involved in the Centre’s operations:

#### **a. Administrative Council Members and Chairman**
- Enjoy immunity from legal process for acts performed in the course of their duties;
- Enjoy the same treatment as representatives of other foreign governments regarding:
  - Immigration restrictions;
  - Alien registration;
  - National service obligations;
  - Exchange controls;
  - Travel facilities.

> Ensures that key decision-makers can operate without fear of local legal or administrative interference.

#### **b. Conciliators and Arbitrators**

> Supports impartiality and neutrality of arbitrators and conciliators.

#### **c. Special Provisions for Non-Canadian Nationals**
- A person who is **neither a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident** under the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* enjoys the full immunities under Article 24(2) of the ICSID Convention.

> This ensures that foreign nationals serving in the Centre are protected from local jurisdictional encroachment.

#### **d. Certificates of Privileges and Immunities**
- A certificate issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** stating that a person has privileges or immunities under this Act is **admissible in evidence** without needing to prove the signature or official capacity of the issuing officer.

> Streamlines administrative processes and reduces procedural hurdles in enforcement.

---

### **7. Enforcement of Awards**
- **Awards are not subject to domestic remedies** (e.g., appeals, review) **except as provided in the ICSID Convention**.
- **Superior courts may recognize and enforce an award**.
- Upon application, the court shall **recognize and enforce the award as if it were a final judgment** of the court.
- If the Convention provides for a stay of enforcement, the court **must stay enforcement** upon such request.

> This ensures that arbitral awards are treated as binding and final in Canadian courts — consistent with international standards.

---

### **8. Restrictions on Interim Measures and Proceedings**
- **Interim measures** (e.g., preservation of assets, injunctions) **may not be ordered** by a court or administrative tribunal:
  - Before the institution of arbitration;
  - During the arbitration process;
  - Unless the parties **explicitly agree otherwise**.

> Prevents courts from interfering with the neutrality and autonomy of arbitration.

- **Courts may not determine matters covered by the arbitration agreement** — unless the parties consent.

> Protects the exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.

---

### **9. Confidentiality and Non-Use of Conciliation Proceedings**
- In **conciliation proceedings**, parties **may not use** the following in any other proceeding (including court or arbitration):
  - Any view, statement, admission, or offer of settlement made by the other party;
  - Any report or recommendations made by the conciliation commission.

> Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the conciliation process.

> This is a critical safeguard against the misuse of sensitive negotiation content.
