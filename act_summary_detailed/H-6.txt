**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Human Rights Act***  

---

### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Canadian Human Rights Act* (CHRA) is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that establishes and enforces the principle of **equality and non-discrimination** in the delivery of goods, services, facilities, and employment opportunities. The Act aims to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to live the lives they desire, free from barriers imposed by discriminatory practices based on specific protected grounds.

The core purpose of the Act is to **extend the legislative authority of Parliament** to uphold the right of every person to enjoy equal treatment and access to opportunities without being hindered by prejudice or bias related to:

- Race  
- National or ethnic origin  
- Colour  
- Religion  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Sexual orientation  
- Gender identity or expression  
- Marital status  
- Family status  
- Genetic characteristics  
- Disability  
- Conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered  

This principle is grounded in the idea that individuals should be able to pursue their lives and meet their needs—within the bounds of societal responsibilities—without facing systemic or individualized discrimination.

### **Prohibited Grounds of Discrimination**

The Act explicitly defines the following as **prohibited grounds of discrimination**:

1. **Race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability**, and  
2. **Conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered**

> **Key Interpretations and Deemed Grounds:**
> - **Pregnancy or childbirth** is deemed to be a form of **discrimination on the ground of sex**.
> - **Refusal to undergo a genetic test or to disclose results** of such a test is deemed to be discrimination on the ground of **genetic characteristics**.

These provisions ensure that even indirect or circumstantial forms of discrimination—such as refusing to allow a woman to take maternity leave or denying access to genetic testing—are covered under the Act.

### **Definition of Discriminatory Practice**

A **discriminatory practice** is broadly defined as any action or policy that:
- Is based on **one or more prohibited grounds of discrimination**, or  
- Has the **effect of a combination** of prohibited grounds  

This includes both **direct and indirect discrimination**, and applies across multiple areas of public life.

#### **Key Areas Where Discriminatory Practices Are Prohibited**

| Area | Prohibited Practices |
|------|------------------------|
| **Goods, Services, Facilities, Accommodation** | Denying access to goods/services/facilities or differentiating adversely on a prohibited ground. Applies to public services (e.g., restaurants, housing, transportation). |
| **Commercial Premises or Residential Accommodation** | Denying occupancy or differentiating adversely on a prohibited ground. |
| **Employment** | Refusing to employ, continuing to employ, or differentiating adversely in employment on a prohibited ground. Includes hiring, promotions, training, apprenticeships, and transfers. |
| **Employment Applications and Advertising** | Using or publishing advertisements, inquiries, or applications that express or imply limitations, specifications, or preferences based on prohibited grounds. |
| **Employee Organizations (e.g., Unions)** | Excluding members, suspending/expelling individuals, or limiting employment opportunities based on protected grounds. |
| **Employer Policies and Agreements** | Establishing or pursuing policies or agreements (e.g., recruitment, promotion) that deprive individuals of employment opportunities based on protected grounds. |
| **Wage Disparities** | Paying male and female employees differently for work of **equal value**. This is strictly prohibited unless justified by a reasonable factor. |

### **Wage Equity and Equal Value of Work**

- **Equal Value of Work**: To assess whether work is of equal value, the **composite of skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions** must be considered.
- **Separate Establishments**: If an employer creates separate facilities solely to maintain wage differences between men and women, these are treated as **one establishment** for the purpose of the Act.
- **Reasonable Justification**: A wage difference may be justified only if it is based on a **factor prescribed by guidelines issued by the Canadian Human Rights Commission** under subsection 27(2).
- **Sex is Not a Justifiable Factor**: Paying men and women differently **solely because of sex is not a reasonable justification**.
- **No Wage Reduction to Eliminate Discrimination**: Employers **cannot reduce wages** to eliminate discriminatory wage practices.
- **Definition of Wages**: Includes all forms of remuneration such as:
  - Salaries, commissions, bonuses  
  - Vacation pay, dismissal pay  
  - Employer contributions to pensions, health insurance, disability plans  
  - Payments in kind (e.g., housing, meals)

### **Harassment and Retaliation**

- **Harassment**: It is a discriminatory practice to **harass** someone on a prohibited ground, including **sexual harassment**, which is deemed harassment under the ground of sex.
- **Retaliation**: It is illegal to **retaliate** or threaten retaliation against:
  - An individual who files a complaint under Part III  
  - The alleged victim of discrimination

These protections ensure that individuals can speak up without fear of reprisal.

### **Exceptions and Bona Fide Occupational Requirements (BFOR)**

Not every practice involving protected grounds is automatically discriminatory. The Act includes **exceptions** where a practice may be justified:

#### **Justified Exceptions (Non-Discriminatory Practices):**

1. **Bona Fide Occupational Requirement (BFOR)**  
   - A practice may be considered non-discriminatory if it is **based on a genuine requirement of the job** and **accommodating the individual would impose undue hardship** (considering health, safety, and cost).  
   - **Undue hardship** must be assessed based on real-world constraints.  
   - The **Governor in Council** may issue regulations to define and assess undue hardship.  
   - These regulations must be published in the *Canada Gazette*, and public consultation must occur before finalization.

2. **Age Limits**  
   - Refusing to employ someone due to age (below or above legal minimums) is not discriminatory if based on law or regulations.

3. **Pension and Insurance Plans**  
   - Compulsory vesting or locking-in of pension contributions at a fixed age under the *Pension Benefits Standards Act* is acceptable.  
   - Variable payments or fund transfers in pooled pension plans at a fixed age are also exempt.

4. **Reasonable Discrimination**  
   - Discrimination may be acceptable if it is **prescribed by guidelines** issued by the Commission and deemed **reasonable**.

5. **Pregnancy and Parental Leave Benefits**  
   - Employers may grant special leave or benefits to female employees during pregnancy or childbirth or to assist with childcare—this is not discriminatory.

6. **Bona Fide Justification for Denial**  
   - A denial of goods, services, or accommodation may be justified if there is a **bona fide reason** for the denial.

> **Note**: For any of these exceptions to apply, it must be **proven** that accommodation would impose **undue hardship**.

### **Special Programs and Arrangements to Eliminate Disadvantage**

The Act encourages **positive action** to reduce disparities:

- Employers or organizations may implement **special programs, plans, or arrangements** designed to:
  - Prevent disadvantages faced by groups due to protected grounds  
  - Improve access to goods, services, employment, or facilities for those groups  

- The **Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission)** may:
  - Make **general recommendations** on desirable objectives for such programs  
  - Provide **advice and assistance** to help implement them  

- **Collecting data** on protected grounds (e.g., for program design) is **permitted** and not considered discriminatory.

> This promotes proactive inclusion and supports equity without requiring blanket equality.

### **Accessibility and Adaptation of Services for People with Disabilities**

The Act provides a clear pathway for ensuring accessibility:

- Any person seeking to adapt services, facilities, premises, equipment, or operations to meet the needs of persons with disabilities may **apply to the Commission** for approval of the plan.
- The Commission may **approve the plan** if it determines it is appropriate and effective in meeting those needs.
- Once approved, **matters related to access under the plan are not grounds for complaint** under Part III.
- If circumstances change and the plan is no longer appropriate, the Commission may **rescind approval**.
- When rescission occurs, **the earlier discriminatory practice is not subject to complaint** if it happened *after* rescission.
- The Commission must provide **opportunity for representation** to all parties involved before making decisions.
- A plan is **not deemed inappropriate** simply because it does not meet standards under section 24.

> This ensures that accessibility efforts are both meaningful and legally protected.

---

### **Exemptions from Complaints (Non-Complaint Bases)**

Certain situations are **exempt from being considered discriminatory**, even if they appear to involve protected grounds:

- **Pension or insurance plans** that preserve benefits accrued **before March 1, 1978**  
- **Separate pension funds** for different employee groups, **if not based on prohibited grounds**  
- Regulations issued by the Governor in Council may further define what constitutes non-discriminatory provisions

> These exemptions reflect historical and financial realities while maintaining the integrity of the Act.
