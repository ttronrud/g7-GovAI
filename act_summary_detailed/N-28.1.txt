# **Detailed Summary of the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act (Canada)**  
**Enacted under Section 120 of Chapter 4 of the Statutes of Canada, 2015**  
**Cited as: The Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act**  
**In force: January 1, 2017 (as amended by SI/2016-23)**

---

## **1. Purpose of the Act**
The primary objective of the *Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act* is to **establish a clear, comprehensive, and internationally aligned legal framework for civil liability and compensation** in the event of a nuclear incident. It ensures that victims of nuclear damage — including individuals, businesses, and communities — receive fair and timely compensation while maintaining a balance between accountability and financial sustainability for nuclear operators.

This Act implements Canada’s obligations under the **Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (Vienna Convention, 1997)**, which provides a global standard for nuclear liability and compensation.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition & Context |
|------|------------------------|
| **Approved Insurer** | An insurer or association of insurers formally designated under Section 29 as being authorized to provide liability coverage for nuclear incidents. |
| **Contracting State** | A country that has ratified, accepted, or acceded to the Vienna Convention on Nuclear Damage. Canada is a Contracting State. |
| **Convention** | The *Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage*, signed by Canada on December 3, 2013, and amended from time to time. It sets international standards for compensation. |
| **Installation State** | A Contracting State where a nuclear installation is located; if not located in a Contracting State, it is the state under whose authority the installation is operated. |
| **Nuclear Fuel** | Material capable of sustaining a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction (e.g., enriched uranium, plutonium). Excludes natural or depleted uranium. |
| **Nuclear Incident** | An occurrence or series of occurrences with the same origin that results in damage for which an operator is liable under this Act. |
| **Nuclear Installation** | Any site or means of transport designated under Section 7 as containing nuclear material or a nuclear reactor. Excludes certain definitions in the context of "Installation State." |
| **Nuclear Material** | Includes:<br>• Nuclear fuel (excluding natural/depleted uranium) that can produce energy outside a reactor;<br>• Radioactive products or waste (excluding final-stage radioisotopes used for medical/scientific purposes). |
| **Nuclear Reactor** | A structure containing nuclear fuel arranged so that a self-sustaining fission chain reaction can occur without external neutron sources. |
| **Operator** | A person designated by regulation under Section 7 as responsible for a nuclear installation or transport. Only operators are liable. |
| **Public Funds** | Amounts contributed by Contracting States under Article VII.1 of the Convention when a global compensation fund is triggered. |
| **Radioactive Products or Waste** | Material produced during nuclear fuel use or made radioactive by exposure to radiation from nuclear processes (excluding final-stage isotopes). |
| **Tribunal** | A nuclear claims tribunal established under subsection 41(1) to adjudicate compensation claims. |

> *Note: Some definitions are modified or excluded in specific contexts (e.g., in relation to "Installation State" or certain transport scenarios).*

## **3. Scope and Application**

### ✅ Applies to:
- Nuclear incidents occurring **within Canada or its exclusive economic zone (EEZ)**.
- Nuclear incidents occurring **within a Contracting State other than Canada or its EEZ**.
- Damage caused by **ionizing radiation** or **toxic/explosive/hazardous properties** of nuclear material.

### ❌ Does NOT Apply to:
1. **Damage from acts of war, civil war, insurrection, or terrorism** (except as defined in subsection 83.01(1) of the *Criminal Code*).
2. **Damage to the operator’s own nuclear installation or property used directly in its operation** (e.g., buildings, equipment, land used for operations).
3. **Damage caused by preventive measures** (e.g., emergency actions taken to prevent harm) — *unless specifically included in liability provisions*.
4. **Damage during transportation** to or from a nuclear installation **if it involves only the means of transport or storage** — such damage is **not compensable**.

> *Exception: Compensation applies if damage arises from a combination of radioactive and hazardous properties (e.g., a radioactive substance that is also toxic or explosive).*

---

## **4. Liability of the Operator**

### 🔹 Absolute Liability
- Operators are **absolutely liable** for damage caused by a nuclear incident — **no need to prove fault, negligence, or breach of duty**.
- This reflects the principle of **strict liability** in nuclear safety, recognizing that the risks associated with nuclear technology are inherently high and unpredictable.

### 🔹 Who is Liable?
- **Only the operator** is liable — no third parties (e.g., contractors, suppliers) can be held responsible under this Act.
- Operators are liable **regardless of whether the incident was caused by human error, design flaws, or natural events**.

### 🔹 When is Liability Triggered?

#### A. **Within Canada or EEZ**
Operator is liable for:
1. Ionizing radiation emitted from:
   - Any source within or released from the operator’s nuclear installation.
   - Nuclear material being transported:
     - From the installation to another installation (until liability is assumed by the receiving operator under a written contract).
     - To a non-Contracting State (until unloaded).
     - From a non-Contracting State to the operator (with written consent, from loading time onward).
     - From a Contracting State (non-Canada) to the operator (before the person takes charge of the material).
2. Ionizing radiation emitted when material is being transported **to** the operator’s installation (after liability is assumed or after the operator takes charge).
3. **Combination of radioactive and hazardous properties** (e.g., toxic, explosive, or chemical hazards) of nuclear material.

#### B. **Outside Canada (in a Contracting State or its EEZ)**
Operator is liable for:
1. Ionizing radiation emitted during transport:
   - Before the receiving party takes charge (in absence of a contract).
   - After the operator takes charge (in absence of a contract).
2. Ionizing radiation from the installation itself.
3. Damage from **preventive measures** taken under subsections 20(1) or 21(1) — these are emergency actions taken to prevent harm.

#### C. **Transport to Non-Contracting States**
Operator is liable for:
- Radiation emitted during transport to a non-Contracting State (until unloading).
- Transport from a non-Contracting State to Canada (with written consent, from loading time onward).
- Damage from **combination of radioactive and hazardous properties**.

> *Note: These provisions mirror the Vienna Convention’s international liability framework.*

## **5. Compensation for Damages**

The Act provides for compensation in the following categories:

| Type of Damage | Compensable? |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Bodily injury or death** | ✅ Yes |
| **Damage to property** | ✅ Yes |
| **Psychological trauma** | ✅ Yes — if it results from bodily injury caused by the incident |
| **Economic loss** | ✅ Yes — including lost wages, income, or business interruption |
| **Loss of use of property** | ✅ Yes — including wage loss of employees |
| **Environmental remediation costs** | ✅ Yes — if ordered by a federal/provincial environmental authority |
| **Emergency measures costs** | ✅ Yes — if recommended by a nuclear emergency scheme (federal/provincial) |
| **Losses in non-Contracting States** | ✅ Yes — if caused by transport or preventive measures |

> ⚠️ **Exclusions**:
- **Failure of a nuclear power plant to generate electricity** is **not compensable**.
- **Damage to the transport vehicle or storage site** during transit or storage is **not compensable** (unless it results from a combination of hazardous properties).

> ✅ **For greater certainty**: Authorities (federal, provincial, municipal) that establish or implement **nuclear emergency schemes** are **not entitled to compensation** under this Act.

## **6. Limitation of Liability**

The Act imposes **caps (liability limits)** on the total compensation an operator must pay:

| Time Period | Maximum Liability |
|-----------|-------------------|
| First year after the Act comes into force | $650 million |
| Second year after the first year | $750 million |
| Third year after the second year | $850 million |
| After the third year | $1 billion |

> These limits are **tiered**, increasing over time to reflect inflation and evolving risk profiles.

### 🔧 Regulatory Flexibility
- The Governor in Council may, by **regulation**,:
  - Increase the liability cap (e.g., due to new risks or international obligations).
  - Reduce the liability for specific types of installations (e.g., smaller reactors, research facilities), based on:
    - Nature of the installation.
    - Type and quantity of nuclear material involved.
    - Risk profile.
