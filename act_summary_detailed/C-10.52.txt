### **4. Determination of Residency (Residence Rules)**

This is a detailed and nuanced rule to resolve **dual residency** situations.

#### For **Individuals**:
1. **Permanent Home**:
   - If the individual has a permanent home in one country → deemed resident only in that country.
   - If permanent homes exist in both → resident only in the country with **closer personal and economic ties** (center of vital interests).
2. **No Permanent Home**:
   - If center of vital interests cannot be determined → resident only in the country where the individual has an **habitual abode**.
3. **No Habitual Abode**:
   - If habitual abode exists in both or neither → resident only in the country of **nationality**.
4. **Dual Nationality**:
   - If the individual is a national of both or neither → the competent authorities must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

#### For **Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, trusts)**:
- Resident only in the country where the entity is **incorporated or registered**.
- If not incorporated in either country → the competent authorities must reach **mutual agreement** to determine residency.
- **In the absence of agreement**, such entities **cannot claim any tax relief or exemption** under the Convention.

> This ensures clarity and prevents tax avoidance through artificial incorporation.
