### **Detailed Summary of the Pay Equity Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose of the Act**

The **Pay Equity Act** is designed to **achieve pay equity** by addressing **systemic gender-based discrimination** in compensation practices and systems across employers. Its core objective is to ensure that **employees in predominantly female job classes receive equal compensation for work of equal value**, regardless of gender.

Key principles include:
- **Proactive action** to identify and correct pay disparities.
- Recognition that **work of equal value** may differ in nature, skill, responsibility, and effort, and that pay must reflect this.
- A commitment to **balance the needs of employees** with the **practical and operational realities of employers**.
- Ongoing maintenance of pay equity through sustained, proactive measures.

This Act does not rely solely on legal enforcement or retroactive correction; instead, it mandates **systemic, forward-looking reforms** in pay structures and practices.

#### **3. Employer Scope and Application**

##### **Who is Subject to the Act?**

Employers become subject to the Act based on **employee headcount thresholds**:

- **Federal Public Sector Employers (par. 3(2)(a)–(d))**:
  - Become subject to the Act if they have **10 to 99 employees** (based on average over a fiscal year) or **100 or more employees**.
  - For employers with 10–99 employees:  
    - Subject to the Act on the **first day of the fiscal year after** the year in which average headcount reaches 10–99.  
  - For employers with 100+ employees:  
    - Subject on the **first day of the fiscal year after** the year in which average headcount reaches 100+.

- **Private Employers Operating Federal Undertakings (par. 3(2)(e)–(i))**:
  - Become subject to the Act if they have **10 to 99 employees** or **100 or more employees**.
  - Thresholds are based on **calendar year averages**:
    - 10–99 employees: Subject on the **first day of the calendar year after** the year in which average headcount is at least 10 but less than 100.
    - 100+ employees: Subject on the **first day of the calendar year after** the year in which average headcount exceeds 100.

> *Note:* The transition is gradual and based on **average employee numbers**, not peak or end-of-year counts.

##### **Group of Employers**

Two or more employers may form a **group** and apply to the **Pay Equity Commissioner** for recognition as a **single employer** under section 106.

**Consequences of Group Recognition**:
- References to "an employer" in relevant sections (e.g., 19–21, 27, 32, 35–41, 43–50, 54, 64, 75, 78, 79, 82, 111, 147–148, 151, 157(1), 181(1)(c)) are **read as referring to the entire group**.
- In sections 118–120, 149(2), 150(3), 158(1)(b), 158(2)–(3), and 168, references to "an employer" may be read as referring to **the group or to any individual employer within it**, depending on context.

> This allows large or complex organizations (e.g., a federal agency with multiple divisions or a multi-site private contractor) to be treated as a single entity for pay equity purposes.

##### **Effective Date of Application**

- The **date** on which a group becomes subject to the Act is **set by the Pay Equity Commissioner**.
- The Commissioner has discretion in determining this date, which may be based on operational realities or administrative feasibility.

---

#### **4. Exemptions**

The Act includes important **exemptions**:

1. **Provincial Governments (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut)**  
   - Exempt from the Act **until the Governor in Council issues an order** specifying otherwise.

2. **Indigenous Governing Bodies**  
   - Exempt until the Governor in Council issues an order.  
   - *Definition*: A council, government, or entity authorized to act on behalf of an Indigenous group recognized under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982** (which affirms Indigenous rights).

> These exemptions recognize unique governance structures and cultural considerations, allowing time for consultation and adaptation.

---

#### **5. Mandatory Pay Equity Plans**

Every employer (and every group of employers) **must establish a pay equity plan** in accordance with the Act.

**Key Requirements**:
- The plan must:
  - Analyze current pay structures by job class and gender.
  - Identify pay disparities between male- and female-dominated job classes.
  - Assess whether work of equal value is being compensated equally.
  - Recommend actions to achieve pay equity (e.g., adjusting pay scales, revising job classifications, implementing pay audits).

> The plan must be **proactive**, not reactive — meaning it must anticipate and address inequities before they become entrenched.

---

#### **6. Establishment of Pay Equity Committees**

Employers and groups are required to make **all reasonable efforts** to establish a **pay equity committee** to oversee the implementation of the pay equity plan.

##### **Who Must Establish a Committee?**

- Employers with **100 or more employees** (regardless of union status).
- Employers with **10 to 99 employees** **if**:
  - Some or all of their employees were **unionized** on the date the employer became subject to the Act.
- Employers with **10 to 99 employees** **may voluntarily** establish a committee if:
  - All employees were **non-unionized** on the date of subjecting to the Act.

> This ensures that even smaller employers with historically unionized workforces are held accountable.

##### **Committee Membership and Representation**

- Employees have the **right to designate committee members**:
  - **Non-unionized employees**: Can choose representatives from among themselves.
  - **Unionized employees**: Their **bargaining agent** selects representatives.
- The committee must be **transparent, inclusive, and representative** of the workforce.

##### **Notification Requirements**

All employers and group employers must **post public notices** outlining:
- Their obligation to establish a pay equity plan.
- The requirements for committee membership.
- The right of employees to designate committee members (if applicable).
- The role of the bargaining agent (for unionized employees).

> These notices ensure **employee awareness, transparency, and participation** in the process.

---

#### **7. Compliance and Enforcement**

- **Failure to establish a pay equity plan** or to make reasonable efforts to form a committee may constitute a breach of the Act.
- The **Pay Equity Commissioner** has the authority to:
  - Issue **guidance and recommendations**.
  - Require **reports and data** from employers.
  - Conduct **audits or investigations**.
  - Take enforcement action if necessary.
- The **Canadian Human Rights Tribunal** may hear complaints and issue orders to enforce compliance.

> The Act emphasizes **voluntary compliance with oversight**, but also provides a legal framework for enforcement when necessary.
