**Detailed Summary of the Canada–Panama Economic Growth and Prosperity Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–Panama Economic Growth and Prosperity Act* (the "Act") is a federal law enacted by the Parliament of Canada to implement and provide legal framework for the **Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Canada and the Republic of Panama**, signed on May 14, 2010, and other related agreements on environment and labour. The Act serves as the legislative instrument that enables Canada to fulfill its obligations under the FTA and its associated agreements, ensuring compliance with international trade rules and mutual economic development goals.

This Act is not a standalone trade policy document but rather a **legislative enabling statute** that translates the provisions of the Free Trade Agreement and its related agreements into enforceable Canadian law.

### **Key Provisions and Structure**

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Citation**: The Act is officially known as the *Canada–Panama Economic Growth and Prosperity Act*.
  
- **Key Definitions**:
  - **Agreement**: Refers to the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Panama, signed on May 14, 2010.
  - **Federal law**: Encompasses any Act of Parliament, regulation, order, or instrument made under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
  - **Joint Commission**: A body established under **Article 21.01** of the Agreement to oversee implementation and resolve disputes related to the Agreement.
  - **Minister**: The Minister for International Trade (primary representative of Canada on the Joint Commission).
  - **Related Agreements**:
    - Agreement on the Environment (May 13, 2010)

#### **2. Interpretation Principles**

- **Consistency with the Agreement**: This Act and any federal law implementing the Agreement or related agreements must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the text of the Agreement or related agreement, as applicable.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Nothing in the Act applies to **natural surface or ground water** in any physical state (liquid, gaseous, or solid). This explicitly excludes environmental regulation of water resources from the scope of the Act.
  - The Act does **not limit Parliament’s power** to pass legislation to implement the Agreement or fulfill Canada’s obligations under it. Parliament retains full legislative authority.

> These clauses ensure that the Act does not overreach in scope and preserves the constitutional power of Parliament to legislate as needed.

#### **3. Purpose of the Act**

The Act aims to achieve the following objectives, as outlined in the Agreement:

1. **Establish a Free Trade Area** between Canada and Panama, based on mutual market access and reduced trade barriers.
2. **Promote reciprocal trade** to foster economic development and growth in both countries.
3. **Ensure fair competition** in trade between the two nations.
4. **Increase investment opportunities** in both Canada and Panama.
5. **Support global and regional trade expansion** through the removal of trade barriers.
6. **Strengthen environmental cooperation** and enforcement of environmental laws.
7. **Protect and enhance workers’ rights**, promote labour standards, and build on international commitments.
8. **Promote sustainable development** through balanced economic and environmental policies.

> These goals reflect a holistic vision of economic integration that includes not only trade but also environmental and social sustainability.

#### **4. Enforcement and Legal Rights**

- **No Private Enforcement**:
  - **No person** (individuals, businesses, or organizations) can bring legal proceedings or enforce rights arising solely from **Part 1** of the Act or from any order made under that part.
  - Similarly, **no proceedings** may be taken to enforce or determine rights or obligations that arise solely under the **Agreement or related agreements**, **unless authorized by the Attorney General of Canada**.

> This provision is critical for managing legal risks and ensuring that disputes are resolved through formal government processes (e.g., via the Joint Commission), rather than through private litigation. It prevents the emergence of a large number of parallel private claims that could undermine the stability of the trade relationship.

- **Exceptions**:
  - The above restriction does **not apply** under **Section C of Chapter 9** of the Agreement and **Part Three and Annex 3 of the Agreement on Labour Cooperation**. These provisions allow for certain private enforcement mechanisms in labour-related matters, reflecting a balance between state control and worker protections.

---

#### **5. Approval of the Agreement and Related Agreements**

- The **Agreement and related agreements are formally approved** by Canadian legislation. This step is essential for Canada to legally enter into and implement the FTA with Panama.

---

#### **6. Role of the Joint Commission**

The Joint Commission is the central body responsible for monitoring, coordinating, and resolving issues related to the implementation of the Agreement.

- **Minister’s Role**:
  - Acts as the **principal representative of Canada** on the Joint Commission.
  - Has authority to:
    - Appoint Canadian representatives to **committees, subcommittees, or working groups** under Article 21.01 of the Agreement.
    - Appoint a **panellist** (expert member) as per Article 22.08.
    - Propose or select the **chair of a panel** under Article 22.08.

- **Minister of the Environment**:
  - Appoints Canadian representatives to the **Environmental Committee** under Article 17 of the Environmental Agreement.
  - Appoints panellists and proposes or selects panel chairs as per **Annex I, paragraph 11**.

- **Minister of Labour**:
  - Appoints Canadian representatives to **labour-related committees, working groups, or expert groups** under Article 7 of the Labour Cooperation Agreement.
  - Appoints panellists and proposes or selects panel chairs as per **Annex 2, paragraph 4**.

> These provisions ensure that Canada has meaningful representation in all key implementation bodies, allowing for coordinated policy development and dispute resolution.

---

#### **7. Administrative and Financial Responsibilities**

- The Government of Canada is responsible for:
  - Paying its **appropriate share** of all costs incurred by or on behalf of the Joint Commission.
  - Covering:
    - Remuneration and expenses of:
      - Panel members, committee members, subcommittees, working groups, expert groups
      - Independent experts
      - Assistants to panel members
    - General operating expenses of these bodies.

> This ensures that the implementation machinery functions efficiently and transparently without placing undue financial burden on the private sector.

---

#### **8. Suspension Powers (Governor in Council)**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the Cabinet, acting on ministerial advice) may, under **Article 22.13 of the Agreement**, issue an order to suspend benefits or modify laws in specific circumstances. The powers include:

- Suspending rights or privileges granted to Panama or its goods under the Agreement or federal law.
- Modifying or suspending the application of any federal law to Panama or its goods.
- Extending the application of federal laws to Panama or its goods.
- Taking any other measure deemed necessary.

> This power is a **safeguard mechanism** to address unforeseen or serious breaches of the Agreement (e.g., non-compliance, public health risks, or national security concerns). It allows Canada to protect its economic interests while maintaining flexibility in response to changing conditions.

- **Duration**: Any order under this power remains in effect only for the period specified in the order, unless extended or revoked.

> This provision ensures that suspensions are temporary and subject to review, preventing long-term or arbitrary restrictions.

---

#### **9. Amendments and Repeals**

- The Act includes several **amendments** and **repeals**, indicating that it has been updated over time.
- Notably, **sections 60 to 64 were repealed in 2012** (via *Statutory Instrument 2012-26, section 62*), suggesting that those provisions were either redundant, inconsistent, or superseded by other legislation.
- The remaining provisions have been amended multiple times, reflecting ongoing adjustments to implementation needs.

> This shows that the Act is dynamic and subject to periodic review and refinement.

---

#### **10. Coming into Force**

- The Act (excluding sections 60 to 64) **comes into force on a day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- It was **first in force on April 1, 2013**, as noted in the statutory instrument *SI/2013-16*.

> This phased implementation allows for preparation and administrative readiness before full enforcement.
