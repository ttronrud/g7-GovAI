### **1. Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is formally titled: **The Loan Act, 1936**.
- It serves as a legal framework enabling the Canadian government to borrow money through the issuance of securities, thereby providing financial relief and flexibility in managing public obligations and economic challenges.

---

### **2. Authority to Borrow**
- The **Governor in Council** (the federal Cabinet) is empowered to raise funds through loans **beyond existing unutilized loan authorizations** established by previous Acts of Parliament.
- This power is exercised under the provisions of the *Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, 1931*, which provides the legal basis for government borrowing and financial management.

### **3. Method of Financing**
- Funds will be raised through the **issuance, sale, or pledge of securities of Canada**.
- These securities can be issued in **various forms** (e.g., bonds, notes) and tailored to meet specific financial needs.
- The **amounts**, **interest rates**, and **terms and conditions** (such as maturity dates, repayment schedules, or covenants) are at the discretion of the Governor in Council.

### **4. Maximum Loan Limit**
- The total amount of money that can be raised under this Act is **limited to $750 million** (seven hundred and fifty million Canadian dollars).
- This cap applies to the **entire sum** of loans authorized under the Act, meaning the government cannot exceed this ceiling for all borrowings under this legislation.

### **5. Authorized Purposes of the Loan**
The funds raised can be used for the following specific purposes:
1. **Paying or redeeming existing loans or obligations of Canada** – This includes retiring or settling outstanding debts, such as bonds or other financial obligations issued by the federal government.
2. **Purchasing and withdrawing from circulation unmatured securities of Canada** – This refers to buying up government securities that have not yet matured and removing them from circulation, which can help manage the supply of money and stabilize the economy.
3. **Public works and general purposes** – Funds may also be used for infrastructure projects (e.g., roads, bridges, public buildings) and other essential government functions.

### **6. Financial Responsibility and Repayment**
- The **principal amount** of the loan and the **interest** accrued thereon are **charged against and payable from the Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- The Consolidated Revenue Fund is Canada’s primary source of government revenue, which includes taxes and other revenues collected by the federal government.
- This ensures that borrowing is fully funded by public revenues and does not rely on future tax increases or deficit financing without proper fiscal accountability.

### **Significance and Context**
- The *Loan Act, 1936* was a critical piece of financial legislation during the Great Depression, when governments worldwide faced severe economic downturns and needed to stabilize their finances.
- It provided the Canadian government with a mechanism to:
  - Manage and reduce public debt,
  - Stabilize the economy through controlled monetary policy (via the withdrawal of securities from circulation),
  - Support public infrastructure development to stimulate employment and economic growth.
- By allowing flexible borrowing under a clear ceiling and revenue-based repayment structure, the Act balanced fiscal responsibility with the need for economic intervention.
