**Detailed Summary of the *Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19)***

---

### **1. General Overview**

The *Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19)* is a temporary legislative measure introduced during the early stages of the global pandemic caused by **coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)**. Its primary purpose is to **provide legal flexibility in the operation of time limits and procedural periods** across various areas of Canadian law—particularly in courts and administrative processes—by suspending or extending them in response to the exceptional circumstances created by the pandemic.

This Act does **not** apply to:
- Investigations of offences or proceedings related to offences.
- Time limits established under the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act*.

It is designed to **preserve access to justice**, prevent unfair outcomes due to delays caused by pandemic-related disruptions (e.g., lockdowns, remote operations, reduced court availability), and ensure that legal processes are not rendered unworkable or unjustly delayed.

### **2. Key Provisions and Scope**

#### **A. Suspension of Time Limits (March 13, 2020 – September 13, 2020)**

The Act **suspends specific time limits** for all Acts of Parliament (including their regulations) that are relevant to judicial proceedings, **for the period from March 13, 2020, to September 13, 2020**, or earlier if formally terminated by order of the Governor in Council.

**Specific time limits suspended include:**
- Limitations or prescription periods for **commencing a legal proceeding before a court**.
- Time limits for **actions or steps within a court proceeding** (e.g., filing motions, submissions).
- Time limits for **applications for leave to commence a proceeding or to do something in relation to a proceeding**.

> *Note:* "Period" includes time during which a licence, permit, or authorization is valid.

#### **B. Flexibility and Judicial Authority**

- **Courts may vary the suspension** through an order, provided:
  - The **start date of the suspension remains unchanged** (March 13, 2020).
  - The **duration does not exceed six months**.

- Courts may also issue orders addressing the **consequences of failing to meet a suspended time limit**, such as:
  - Canceling or modifying penalties.
  - Allowing a proceeding to proceed despite missed deadlines.

#### **C. Governor in Council Power to Lift Suspension**

- The **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Minister of Justice) may **lift a suspension** at any time, provided the circumstances specified in the order are met.

#### **D. Ministerial Authority (for Specific Acts and Regulations)**

The Minister responsible for certain Acts or regulations may issue orders to:
- **Suspend or extend** time limits established under specific provisions listed in a **Schedule**.
- **Extend other periods** established under those provisions.
- If a regulation is involved, the Minister may:
  - Suspend or extend time limits under that regulation.
  - Extend other periods under that regulation.
  - Extend a prior suspension or extension.

> *Example:* A minister may extend the deadline for submitting a tax return under a particular tax law due to pandemic-related disruptions.

#### **E. Restrictions on Duration and End Date**

- The **total duration of any suspension or extension cannot exceed six months**.
- A **suspension must not allow a time limit to extend beyond December 31, 2020**.
- An **extended time limit or period must end on or before December 31, 2020**.

> This ensures that the temporary relief is not used to create long-term delays.

#### **F. Retroactive Effect and Variability**

- Orders under this Act **may have retroactive effect**, but **only from March 13, 2020 onward**.
- Orders may include provisions about:
  - **Failure to meet a time limit** (e.g., canceling penalties).
  - **Effects of expiry** before the order was issued (e.g., waiving consequences).

#### **G. Conditions and Exceptions**

Orders may specify:
- **Exclusions** where a suspension or extension **does not apply** without the consent of a person, court, or body named in the order.
- **Applicability** where a suspension applies **unless** a specified person, court, or body decides otherwise.
- **Variability** where a specified body may **vary the effects** of the order in relation to specific circumstances.

> This allows for targeted, context-sensitive adjustments.

#### **H. Regulatory Oversight and Limitations**

- The **Governor in Council** may make **regulations** that:
  - Restrict or impose conditions on the power to issue orders under this Act.
  - Prevent misuse or overreach of the suspension/extension powers.

#### **I. Expiry of Powers**

- **No power under this Act may be exercised after September 30, 2020**.
- This ensures the Act is a **temporary measure**, not a permanent change to the legal framework.
