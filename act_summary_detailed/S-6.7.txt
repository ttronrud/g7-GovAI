**Detailed Summary of the *Secure Air Travel Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Secure Air Travel Act* is a Canadian statute designed to enhance the security of air travel by establishing a framework for identifying and monitoring individuals who may pose a threat to transportation security. It grants the federal government, specifically the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (the "Minister"), broad powers to maintain a list of individuals suspected of engaging in acts that threaten aviation security, to collect and share personal information related to air travel, and to enforce screening and denial of travel measures when necessary.

The Act operates within the broader context of Canada’s aviation security regime, primarily drawing upon existing legislation such as the *Aeronautics Act* and the *Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012*. It also establishes strict limits on data retention, disclosure, and privacy to ensure that security measures do not infringe on civil liberties without proper justification.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Applicability and Jurisdiction**
- **Scope**: The Act applies to all persons—both inside and outside Canada—regardless of location.
- **Binding Authority**: The Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or any province.
- **Extraterritorial Application**: Any act or omission committed outside Canada that would constitute a contravention of this Act *if committed in Canada* is deemed to have been committed in Canada. This allows for prosecution and punishment in Canada, even if the offence occurred abroad.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that Canada can enforce its aviation security laws globally and hold individuals accountable regardless of where the act occurred.

---

### **2. Definitions**
The Act defines key terms consistent with existing legislation:
- **Air Carrier**: As defined in subsection 3(1) of the *Aeronautics Act* — includes airlines operating flights in Canada.
- **Aviation Reservation System**: As defined in the same section — systems used to book flights (e.g., websites, apps).
- **Listed Person**: An individual whose name appears on the Minister’s list.
- **Screening**: As defined in section 4.7 of the *Aeronautics Act* — refers to security checks of individuals or baggage.
- **Sterile Area**: As defined in section 3 of the *Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012* — areas within airports where unauthorized access is prohibited (e.g., aircraft boarding zones).
- **Transportation Security**: As defined in subsection 4.81(0.1) of the *Aeronautics Act* — the protection of people, property, and infrastructure during air travel.

### **3. Information Collection Requirements (Section 6)**

#### **(a) Mandatory Information Submission by Air Carriers**
All air carriers (including domestic and international carriers holding Canadian aviation documents) must provide to the Minister:
- Surname, first name, and middle name
- Date of birth
- Gender  
- Any other information prescribed by regulation

This information must be submitted **within any time and in any manner** specified by regulation.

#### **(b) Deemed Submission via Aviation Reservation Systems**
If an operator of an aviation reservation system provides the same information to the Minister (e.g., via a booking platform), the air carrier is **deemed to have provided** it — no separate submission is required.

> *Rationale*: Streamlines data collection by leveraging existing booking systems and reduces administrative burden on carriers.

#### **(c) Requested Information from Carriers or Reservation Operators**
The Minister or Minister of Transport may request information about individuals on board or expected to board aircraft, **only if**:
- The information is in the carrier’s or operator’s control
- The request is limited to data set out in the *schedule to the Aeronautics Act* or prescribed by regulation
- The individual is a **listed person** or one the Minister has **reasonable grounds to believe** is a listed person

> *Limitation*: Prevents arbitrary or overbroad data requests.

### **4. Creation and Management of the List (Section 8)**

#### **(a) Criteria for Listing**
The Minister may place a person on the list if there are **reasonable grounds to suspect** that:
1. The person will **engage or attempt to engage in an act that threatens transportation security**, or  
2. The person will **travel by air to commit**:
   - An offence under sections 83.18, 83.19, or 83.2 of the *Criminal Code* (e.g., terrorism, serious violence), or  
   - An offence referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of “terrorism offence” in section 2 of the *Criminal Code*  
   *(or if committed in Canada, would constitute such an offence)*

> *Note*: The list is not based on criminal convictions but on **reasonable suspicion** of future threats.

#### **(b) Review and Amendments**
- The Minister must **review the list every 90 days** to assess whether the grounds for listing still exist.
- The review **does not invalidate** the list.
- The Minister may:
  - **Delete** a name if the grounds for listing no longer exist
  - **Amend** information about a listed person (e.g., update alias or date of birth)

> *Purpose*: Ensures the list remains relevant and up-to-date, preventing indefinite or unjustified inclusion.

---

### **5. Directions to Air Carriers (Section 9)**

The Minister may issue **specific, reasonable, and necessary directions** to air carriers to prevent listed persons from engaging in prohibited acts, including:
- **Denying transportation** (e.g., refusing boarding)
- **Screening** individuals before they enter a sterile area or board an aircraft

> *Examples*: A direction could require a person to undergo a security screening or be denied boarding.

#### **Exemption from Statutory Instruments Act**
Any direction issued under this section is **exempt from the Statutory Instruments Act**, meaning it does not require parliamentary approval or public notice.

> *Implication*: Enables rapid, flexible enforcement without lengthy legislative processes.

---

### **6. Partnerships in Enforcement (Section 10)**

The Minister may collaborate with the following entities to administer and enforce the Act:
- Minister of Transport  
- Minister of Citizenship and Immigration  
- RCMP officers or civilian employees  
- CSIS Director or employees  
- Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers  
- Any other entity prescribed by regulation  

These bodies can:

#### **(a) Collection of Identity Information**
The Minister may collect personal information (e.g., name, date of birth) for:
- Issuing a **unique identifier** to verify identity before boarding
- Identifying listed persons on board or expected to board aircraft

#### **(b) Disclosure of Information**
The Minister may disclose information collected under Section 6 or 6(3) for:
1. **Identifying listed persons** on aircraft (if the Minister has reason to believe the person is listed)
2. **Complying with court subpoenas or legal orders** requiring disclosure

#### **(c) Disclosure for Security Purposes (Section 12)**
Subject to certain conditions, the Minister may disclose information about a listed person for:
- Ensuring transportation security  
- Preventing travel that threatens security  

> *Limitation*: Disclosure is only permitted for listed persons or those suspected of being listed.

#### **(d) Disclosure to Foreign Governments (Section 10.3)**
The Minister may enter into a **written arrangement** with a foreign government, institution, or international organization to share information (including the list) — **only under such an arrangement**.

### **8. Rights of Listed Persons (Section 15)**

A listed person who is denied transportation due to a Ministerial direction has the right to:
- **Apply in writing** to have their name removed from the list within **60 days** of being denied travel
- If the Minister finds **exceptional circumstances**, the time limit may be extended

#### **Process for Review**
- The Minister must provide the applicant with a **reasonable opportunity to make representations**

> *Purpose*: Provides a clear, time-bound appeal process and protects against indefinite listing.

#### **Appeal Rights**
- The judge must determine whether the decision is **reasonable**, based on available evidence
- The judge may:
  - Accept **reliable, non-court-admissible evidence** (e.g., internal reports, intelligence)

  - Ensure **confidentiality** of any withdrawn information

> *Note*: Sections 38.2 to 38.45 of the *Canada Evidence Act* apply to these appeals, allowing flexibility in evidence use.
