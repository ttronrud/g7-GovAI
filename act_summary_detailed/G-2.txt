**Detailed Summary of the *Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act***  
*(Cited as: The Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act* (GA-PDA) is a federal statute that establishes a legal framework allowing for the **garnishment of salaries and remuneration** — including pensions and honoraria — of **Her Majesty in Right of Canada**, **parliamentary entities**, and certain **government departments and Crown corporations**. It enables enforcement of maintenance, alimony, or support orders against public-sector payers, even though such entities are traditionally protected from garnishment.

This Act is structured into **three main Divisions**:
- **Division I**: Applies to **Her Majesty in Right of Canada** (the federal government).
- **Division II**: Applies to **parliamentary entities** (e.g., Senate, House of Commons, Library of Parliament, etc.).
- **Division III**: Addresses **pension diversion** (a separate but related provision).

Key principles include:
- **Federal entities (including Crown corporations and parliamentary bodies)** can be subject to garnishment under specific conditions.
- Garnishment is **limited to specific types of income** (salaries, fees, honoraria).
- **Provincial garnishment laws are generally overridden** by federal rules when there is inconsistency.
- **Her Majesty and parliamentary entities have defined timeframes and procedural safeguards** to respond to garnishment claims.
- **Excess payments** made due to error are recoverable.
- **Public access to procedures** is ensured.
- **No execution** (i.e., court enforcement like seizure) may issue against these entities.

## **II. Division I: Garnishment of Her Majesty (Federal Government)**

### **1. Binding Effect of Garnishee Summons**
- A garnishee summons (or similar document — e.g., court order, maintenance order from a provincial enforcement service) **binds Her Majesty** 15 days after service.
- Service must occur **within the first 45 days** of the earliest possible valid service date.
- If not served within that window, the summons is **void**.

### **2. What Is Garnishable?**
#### **(a) Salary**
- The salary to be paid **no later than the last day of the second pay period** after the period in which the summons becomes binding.
- If the garnishment continues under provincial law, **all subsequent salaries** are also subject to garnishment.

#### **(b) Remuneration (fees, honoraria, etc.)**
- Remuneration payable to a department or Crown corporation must be garnished on the **15th day after binding**.
- Garnishment applies to:
  - Any remuneration **owing on the 15th day**,
  - Or becoming due in the **next 30 days**, including any that becomes due within **14 days after the 15th day**,
  - And, if continuing under provincial law, **all future remuneration**.

> *Note: This applies only to payments made by Her Majesty on behalf of a department or a Crown corporation prescribed under paragraph 12(c).*

### **3. Response Period**
- **15 days** (or fewer, as prescribed by regulation) after:
  - The second pay period (for salary),
  - The date of remuneration garnishment (for fees/honoraria).

### **4. Methods of Service and Response**
- In addition to provincial methods, **any prescribed method** can be used.
- **Registered mail** is accepted as valid proof of response (receipt under Canada Post regulations is admissible in court).

### **5. Discharge of Liability**
- A **payment into court** is sufficient to discharge liability.
- If provincial law allows payment to a provincial enforcement service, such a payment is also sufficient.

### **6. Recovery of Excess Payments**
- If Her Majesty pays **more than required**, the **excess becomes a debt due from the debtor**.
- The excess may be recovered via **deduction from future payments**, **set-off**, or **compensation**.

### **7. Recovery of Overpayments to Third Parties**
- If a payment is made to a party who initiated the garnishment **in excess of what should have been paid**, the excess becomes a debt due to the entity.
- Recovery is possible through future payments or compensation.

### **8. Regulatory Powers**
The Governor in Council (on Minister’s recommendation) may make regulations to:
- Specify **service locations**,
- Define **methods of service** and **deemed service dates**,
- Deem certain amounts as **excluded from salary**,
- Specify **periods and circumstances** for termination of garnishment,
- Prescribe **Crown corporations** subject to this Division,
- Prescribe any other matter required.

### **9. Public Access to Information**
- The Minister must ensure the public can **reasonably access** information on how to initiate garnishment proceedings.

### **10. Exceptions and Limitations**
- **Crown corporations not prescribed under 12(c)** are **not bound** by provincial garnishment law — they are governed by federal rules.
- For **Crown corporations prescribed under subsection (3)**, **pension benefits** are **exempt** from garnishment (as defined in Part II).
- **Canadian Forces pay** is subject to garnishment **only to the extent, manner, and conditions** set by regulations under the *National Defence Act*.
