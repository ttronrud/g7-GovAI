**Detailed Summary of the *Safe Containers Convention Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Safe Containers Convention Act* is a Canadian statute that implements the **International Convention for Safe Containers (the "Convention")**, an international treaty designed to ensure the structural safety of containers used in international transport. The Act establishes a legal framework in Canada for enforcing the Convention’s provisions, including container approval, safety inspections, maintenance requirements, and oversight of container use across various modes of transport.

This Act is not a standalone law but rather a domestic implementation mechanism for an international agreement. It provides the legal authority and procedural rules necessary for Canada to comply with the Convention and to protect human life, property, and the environment through safe handling, stacking, and transportation of containers.

## **Core Provisions and Legislative Framework**

### **1. Regulatory Authority (Section 3)**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting on ministerial advice) may make regulations to:
  - Detain and transport containers without a valid Safety Approval Plate.
  - Detain containers where there is **significant evidence** that their condition poses an **obvious risk to safety**.
  - Govern **maintenance and repair** of containers.
  - Specify how detained containers (not repossessed) will be disposed of.
  - Require that Safety Approval Plates be in **both English and French**.
  - Require **concurrence from another Minister** (e.g., Environment or Health) when authorizing an inquiry into a container accident.

> **Limitations on Regulations**:
> - No regulation may allow a person to **prevent removal of container contents**.
> - No regulation may allow **continued detention** of a container after its contents have been removed, **unless an inspector believes there is imminent contravention** of transport regulations.

### **2. Public Participation and Transparency (Section 4)**
- Before finalizing any proposed regulation, a **copy must be published in the Canada Gazette**.
- Interested parties must be given a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** to the Minister.

    - A container poses an **obvious safety risk**.
    - A provision of the Act or regulations has been **violated**.
    - A container lacks a valid Safety Approval Plate.
  - Examine records or documents required under regulations and make copies or extracts.
- Every person found on a vehicle or site entered by an inspector must **assist** the inspector and provide **reasonable information**.
- **Obstruction or false statements** to an inspector are **criminal offences**.

>   - The specific provisions they are authorized to enforce.
> - Must produce the certificate upon request when boarding or entering a site.

### **4. Enforcement and Penalties (Section 6)**
- Any violation of the Act or regulations is an **offence punishable on summary conviction** with a fine of up to **$5,000**.
- Jurisdiction over offences:
  - If committed in a province.
  - If the accused is **found or conducts business** in that province.
- **Jurisdiction extends beyond the province where the offence occurred** if the accused is active in another province.
- Jurisdiction is **in addition to and not in derogation of** powers under the *Criminal Code*.

### **5. Amendments to the Convention (Section 7)**
- The Governor in Council may issue an **order** to amend the **Schedule** (which contains the Convention’s Annexes) to reflect changes to the Convention’s Annexes that Canada has **not objected to**.

- If both Houses pass a resolution to make the order subject to negative resolution, then **Sections 8–11 are repealed**, and the order becomes subject to negative resolution under the *Interpretation Act*.
