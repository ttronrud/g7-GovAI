### **Detailed Summary of the *Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act***  

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
The *Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act* is a Canadian legislative measure designed to **implement and enforce the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS)**, an international framework aimed at preventing the trade of conflict diamonds — also known as "blood diamonds" — which are mined in war zones and used to fund armed conflict.

- The Act aligns Canada’s domestic regulations with the **Kimberley Process**, which was established in 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly (Resolution 55/56) to ensure that rough diamonds are traded only if they are certified as conflict-free.
- Canada is a participating country in the Kimberley Process, and this Act provides the legal framework for enforcing compliance with its standards in Canadian trade in rough diamonds.
