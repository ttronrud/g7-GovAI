**Detailed Summary of the *Surplus Crown Assets Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Surplus Crown Assets Act* establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing the identification, management, disposal, and financial handling of **surplus Crown assets**—property owned by Her Majesty in Canada that is no longer required by federal departments or federal bodies. The Act provides clear procedures for how these assets can be disposed of, who has authority over them, and how any proceeds from their sale are distributed.

This Act is **not applicable** to real property or immovables as defined under the *Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act*, nor to licenses related to such property.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Department**  
   - Has the same meaning as in Section 2 of the *Financial Administration Act*, **excluding paragraph (c)** (which relates to "agencies" or "institutions" not falling under the standard definition).  
   - Refers to government departments such as Health, Finance, etc., operating under the federal government.

2. **Federal Body**  
   - Includes boards, commissions, corporations, or other entities that act on behalf of Her Majesty or are ultimately accountable to Parliament.  
   - Includes **Crown corporations** (as defined in subsection 83(1) of the *Financial Administration Act*), even though they are not departments.  
   - **Excludes departments** from this category.

3. **Surplus Crown Assets**  
   - Property of Her Majesty in **custody or control** that a department or federal body has determined is **surplus to its operational needs**.  
   - These assets are identified through formal notices sent to the relevant department or body.

4. **Accepted Surplus Crown Assets**  
   - Assets formally identified in a notice under Section 4(2) and **not deleted** by the Minister or disposed of under this Act.  
   - Once accepted, the assets are subject to the Minister’s authority for management and disposal.

5. **Minister**  
   - Refers specifically to the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**.  
   - This individual is the central authority responsible for overseeing the disposal and management of surplus Crown assets.

## **Scope and Exclusions**

- **Excluded from the Act**:  
  - Real property or immovable property (as defined in the *Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act*)  
  - Licences related to such real property

> This means the Act does not govern land or real estate holdings directly; those are managed under separate legislation.

---

## **Disposal Authority: Departments and Federal Bodies**

### **1. Request for Disposal**
- A **department or federal body** with surplus assets may:
  - **Request the Minister** to dispose of or deal with the assets under this Act.
  - Or, **subject to Treasury Board-prescribed terms and conditions**, dispose of the assets themselves via:
    - Sale (for or without consideration)
    - Exchange
    - Transfer to another department
    - Lease or lend
    - Other forms of disposal (gratuitous or commercial)

> The Treasury Board may set conditions for disposal (e.g., environmental standards, public interest considerations, etc.)

### **2. Terms and Conditions**
- These conditions can apply to:
  - Specific departments
  - Specific classes of assets
  - All departments or assets generally

> Ensures consistency and accountability in how surplus assets are managed.

### **3. Prohibition on Unauthorized Disposal**
- **No department may dispose of surplus Crown assets outside the provisions of this Act.**  
> Unauthorized sales or transfers are strictly prohibited.

### **4. Minister’s Discretion to Refuse Requests**
- The Minister may **refuse a request** to dispose of surplus assets if they deem it appropriate—based on public interest, strategic needs, or other policy considerations.

---

## **Acceptance of Assets by the Minister**

### **Process**
- When the Minister accepts surplus assets for disposal:
  - Must **notify** the department or federal body of the assets accepted.

### **Responsibility Continues**
- The **department or federal body remains responsible** for the accepted assets until:
  - They **surrender custody or control** to the Minister via a formal direction.

> This ensures accountability and continuity of responsibility during the transition period.

## **Minister’s Powers Over Accepted Surplus Assets**

With **specific or general authority from the Governor in Council**, the Minister may perform a wide range of actions regarding accepted surplus assets, including:

| Power | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Sell, exchange, lease, lend, or otherwise dispose of** | Can do so either for or without consideration, and on terms deemed desirable. |
| **Hold, manage, operate, maintain, store, transport, repair, or service** | Full operational control over the assets. |
| **Restore original condition** | If property is returned to Her Majesty, the Minister may restore it and settle any claims. |
| **Convert to basic materials** | Assets can be broken down into raw materials (e.g., scrap metal). |
| **Transfer between departments** | Move assets from one department to another. |
| **Issue orders and directions** | To ensure safety, preservation, and proper handling of assets. |
| **Require information** | Can direct individuals to provide information about the assets within specified timeframes. |
| **Engage service providers** | Can hire contractors or experts to carry out tasks related to asset management. |
| **Delete assets from notices** | Can remove specific assets from the official list of surplus assets if no longer surplus. |
| **Other incidental actions** | Any activity deemed necessary or expedient to fulfill the Act’s objectives. |

> These powers give the Minister broad discretion in managing surplus assets efficiently and safely.

## **Financial Provisions – Proceeds from Sales**

### **1. Sales of Assets of a Federal Body**
- When the Minister sells surplus assets of a **federal body**, the **net proceeds must be remitted to that body** within **30 days of the month following the sale**.

> Ensures the federal body receives a share of the proceeds, reflecting its original stewardship.

### **2. Sales of Assets of a Department**
- Net proceeds may be paid **out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund** for the **department’s purposes**, subject to:
  - Treasury Board-prescribed terms and conditions.
- **Exception**: Property forfeited under an Act of Parliament is excluded from this rule.

> This allows departments to use proceeds for operational purposes, promoting reinvestment.

### **3. Retention of Proceeds for Administrative Costs**
- The Minister may **retain a percentage** of net proceeds (as set by the Treasury Board) to cover:
  - Administrative costs
  - Disposal-related expenses

> This ensures that the process of selling assets is financially sustainable.

### **4. Duration of Payment Authority**
- The authority to receive proceeds from asset sales **does not lapse at the end of a fiscal year**.  
- It remains valid **throughout the fiscal year in which the sale occurs** and beyond, as long as the conditions are met.

> Prevents loss of funds due to fiscal year resets.

## **Legal Validity of Disposition Documents**

- The **Minister** or **authorized persons** (e.g., those through whom a department reports to Parliament) may:
  - Execute **bills of sale, contracts, or other documents** related to the disposal of surplus assets.
- Such documents are **valid and binding on Her Majesty**, even though they are executed by a minister or agent.

> Provides legal certainty and enforceability in transactions involving Crown property.

---

## **Regulatory and Legislative Authority**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may:

1. **Confer additional powers or duties** on the Minister regarding surplus asset disposal.  
   - Allows for future expansion or adaptation of the Act based on changing needs.

2. **Issue orders, rules, and regulations** to:
   - Assist the Minister in carrying out duties
   - Provide operational guidance
   - Set standards for asset evaluation, valuation, or environmental compliance

> This ensures flexibility and adaptability in implementation.

## **Repealed Provisions (Important Notes)**

Several provisions have been **repealed** over time:

- **"Board", "Corporation"**: Repealed in 1985 (R.S., 1985, c. 22 (1st Supp.), s. 1)  
  → Suggests the definition of "federal body" was restructured.

- **"Government Department"**: Repealed in 1992 (c. 54, s. 82)  
  → Confirms the use of "department" as defined in the *Financial Administration Act*.

- **Certain sections** (e.g., s. 5, s. 7, s. 84, s. 88): Repealed in 1985 or 1992  
  → These were likely outdated or redundant.

> The current version of the Act reflects a streamlined, modernized approach to surplus asset management.
