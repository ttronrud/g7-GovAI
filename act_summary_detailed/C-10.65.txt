### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose**
The *Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act* (CUSMA Implementation Act) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. This Act formally implements the **Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**, which replaced the earlier **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**.

**Key Objectives of the Agreement (as reflected in this Act):**
- **Replace NAFTA**: CUSMA supersedes the 1992 NAFTA, modernizing trade rules to reflect current economic, technological, and social realities.
- **Establish a Free Trade Area**: Create a more integrated, transparent, and predictable trade and investment environment across Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
- **Promote Mutual Economic Growth**: Encourage trade, investment, and regional production by incentivizing sourcing and manufacturing within the region.
- **Support SMEs**: Enhance opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate in cross-border trade.
- **Protect Labour and Environmental Standards**: Uphold and improve labour rights, working conditions, and environmental protection through enforceable standards.
- **Ensure Transparency and Good Governance**: Promote fair competition, eliminate corruption, and strengthen the rule of law in trade and investment.
- **Recognize Indigenous and Gender Equity**: Include meaningful engagement of Indigenous peoples and promote equal access for women in trade and investment opportunities.

#### **9. Transition and Continuity of Proceedings**
To ensure legal continuity during the transition from NAFTA to CUSMA:

- **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**:
  - Proceedings pending immediately before the **commencement day** (the day CUSMA comes into force) involving goods from a **NAFTA country** are **continued** under the updated Act.
  - Such proceedings are **deemed to relate to goods from a CUSMA country**, based on the updated definition in the Act.
  - If new proceedings are initiated after the commencement day involving goods imported before that day and classified as NAFTA goods at the time of import, they are **automatically deemed to relate to CUSMA goods**.

- **Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act (CITTA)**:
  - Similar provisions apply: pending proceedings involving goods from a NAFTA country are continued and **deemed to relate to CUSMA goods**.
  - **Exception**: This rule does **not apply** to inquiries under **Section 19.01** or certain subparagraphs of **Section 26(1)(a)(i.1), (i.2), or (i.3)** — these remain unaffected.

> These transitional provisions ensure **legal stability** and avoid disruption in ongoing trade disputes or investigations.
