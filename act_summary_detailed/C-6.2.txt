**Detailed Summary of the *Canadair Limited Divestiture Authorization Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Canadair Limited Divestiture Authorization Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada that authorizes the sale and disposal of shares in **Canadair Limited** and its related entities, with the ultimate goal of transitioning ownership of the aerospace company to **Bombardier-Canadair Inc.** The Act also includes provisions for government accountability, trust management, and financial adjustments resulting from these transactions.

This Act was passed by the Senate and House of Commons with the advice and consent of Her Majesty, and it serves as a legal framework to facilitate the privatization of a significant portion of the Canadian government’s stake in Canadair — a key aerospace manufacturer historically tied to Canada’s defense and aviation industries.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Authorization to Sell Canadair Shares to Bombardier-Canadair Inc.**
- **Who is authorized:**  
  The **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)** and its wholly-owned subsidiary, **Cartierville Financial Corporation Inc.**, are authorized to sell any or all of their shares in **Canadair Limited** to **Bombardier-Canadair Inc.**.
  
- **Terms and Conditions:**  
  The sale must occur on terms and conditions approved by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet). This ensures that the transaction is subject to high-level governmental oversight and policy alignment.

- **Consideration:**  
  The sale is for **monetary consideration**, meaning it involves cash payment rather than a non-monetary exchange.

- **Shares involved:**  
  The shares being sold are **Class A and Class B shares** of Canadair Limited.

> *Purpose:* This provision enables the transfer of government ownership in Canadair to Bombardier-Canadair, which was formed as a strategic entity to consolidate and modernize Canada’s aerospace capabilities.

---

#### **2. Authorization to Sell or Dispose of Acquired Shares in Bombardier-Canadair Inc.**
- Following the initial sale of Canadair shares, CDIC and Cartierville are authorized to **sell or otherwise dispose of** any or all of the **Class A and Class B shares** of **Bombardier-Canadair Inc.** that they acquire in the transaction.

- Again, such dispositions must be approved by the **Governor in Council**.

> *Purpose:* This allows for a phased or flexible exit strategy by the government, enabling it to gradually reduce its stake in the new entity over time, possibly to support broader privatization goals or to reallocate capital.

---

#### **3. Government Acquisition of Shares (Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion)**
- The **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** is authorized to purchase **500,000 Class B shares** of Bombardier-Canadair Inc. directly from CDIC and Cartierville.

- The purchase must be on terms and conditions approved by the **Governor in Council**.

> *Purpose:* This provision ensures that a portion of the ownership in the new entity remains within the federal government, specifically under the purview of regional industrial policy. It reflects a balance between privatization and maintaining strategic government influence in key industrial sectors.

---

#### **4. Trust Holding of Acquired Shares**
- All shares acquired by the Minister under subsection (3) shall be held **in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

- This means that although the Minister holds the shares on behalf of the Crown, they are not personally owned and are legally subject to the Crown’s interests and future policy decisions.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that government control over strategic assets is preserved, even after the transaction. It prevents private or political misuse of the shares and maintains accountability to the public interest.

---

#### **5. Exemption from Certain Corporate and Financial Regulations**
- The following provisions **do not apply** to any sale or disposal authorized under sections 2 or 3:
  - **Subsections 183(2) to (8)** of the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA) — which normally regulate the transfer of shares and the rights of shareholders.
  - **Subsections 108(2) to (5)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA) — which typically govern the financial reporting and disclosure requirements for government entities.

> *Purpose:* These exemptions are critical because they allow the government to conduct the divestiture without being bound by standard corporate disclosure or reporting obligations. This streamlines the process and avoids unnecessary administrative burdens, especially in a strategic government-to-private entity transfer.

> *Note:* This exemption is significant because it removes typical transparency and accountability requirements that would otherwise apply to government share transactions.

---

#### **6. Financial Adjustment and Accounting Responsibilities**
- The **Minister of State (Privatization)**, after consulting with the **President of the Treasury Board**, is responsible for making **necessary adjustments to the federal government’s accounts** resulting from any sale or disposal authorized under sections 2 or 3.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that the financial records of the federal government accurately reflect the changes in ownership and value associated with the divestiture. This maintains fiscal integrity and transparency in government finances.

---

#### **7. Joint and Several Liability for Obligations**
- The **Minister of State (Privatization)** and the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** may, on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada, enter into an agreement to become **jointly and severally liable** with CDIC and Cartierville Financial Corporation Inc. for any obligations assumed as a result of the share sales under section 2.

> *Purpose:* This creates a shared financial responsibility mechanism. If, for example, a new entity (like Bombardier-Canadair) assumes liabilities (e.g., debts, guarantees, or contractual obligations) as a result of the transaction, both ministers can be held collectively responsible. This protects the government from unforeseen financial exposure and ensures that obligations are managed in a coordinated, accountable manner.

> *Note:* This is a risk-mitigation tool, particularly important in complex corporate transactions involving state-owned assets.

---

#### **8. Coming Into Force**
- **Section 8** (which governs the effective date of the Act) comes into force on a day to be **fixed by proclamation**.

- **Historical Note:**  
  The provision came into force on **January 1, 1987**, as noted in the official notice (SI/87-27).

> *Purpose:* Provides flexibility in implementation, allowing the government to schedule the Act’s activation based on operational readiness, political timing, or financial planning.

### **Strategic Context and Implications**

This Act is part of a broader **industrial policy initiative** during the 1980s to modernize and privatize key Canadian industrial assets. Canadair, once a cornerstone of Canada’s aerospace industry, had become financially strained due to rising costs, competition, and technological obsolescence.

By transferring ownership to **Bombardier-Canadair Inc.**, the Canadian government aimed to:
- Improve operational efficiency and innovation.
- Strengthen Canada’s position in the global aerospace market.
- Reduce direct government involvement in a capital-intensive sector.
- Promote private sector investment and long-term sustainability.

The Act reflects a **pragmatic blend of privatization and strategic retention**, where the government retains a limited but meaningful stake (via the 500,000 Class B shares) to ensure continued alignment with national industrial policy goals.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadair Limited Divestiture Authorization Act* is a targeted and legally robust piece of legislation that enables the Canadian government to:
- Privatize its stake in Canadair Limited,
- Transfer ownership to Bombardier-Canadair Inc. for strategic and economic reasons,
- Maintain some level of government oversight through retained shares and trust arrangements,
- Ensure financial accountability and risk management through specific exemptions and liability provisions.

It exemplifies how Canada balanced economic reform with public interest in the 1980s, using legal tools to facilitate industrial transformation while preserving national control over critical sectors.
