### **Detailed Summary of the Contraventions Act**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Citation**
- The **Contraventions Act** is an Act of Parliament of Canada that establishes a distinct, simplified legal procedure for the prosecution of certain regulatory offences known as *contraventions*.
- It may be cited as the **Contraventions Act**.
- This Act operates **in addition to** the procedures set out in the *Criminal Code* for the prosecution of offences, recognizing a key distinction between **criminal offences** and **regulatory (administrative) offences**.

| **Attorney General** | Refers to the Attorney General of Canada or a province, or their counsel/agents acting under their authority. |

| **Contraventions Court** | A court designated by the Governor in Council for handling contraventions within a province. |
| **Enactment** | Any law passed by Parliament or any regulation, rule, order, by-law, or ordinance made under an Act of Parliament. |

#### **3. Purpose of the Act**

The primary purposes are:
1. To establish a **separate, streamlined procedure** for prosecuting contraventions, distinguishing them from criminal offences.
2. To **alter or abolish the legal consequences** of being convicted of a contravention, recognizing that such offences are generally less serious than criminal offences and are primarily regulatory in nature.

This ensures that the penalties and processes for contraventions do not mirror those of serious criminal offences.

---

#### **4. Applicability of Other Laws**

- The **provisions of the Criminal Code** relating to **summary conviction offences** and the **Youth Criminal Justice Act** apply to proceedings under this Act **unless otherwise provided** by this Act, regulations, or court rules.
- This ensures consistency in procedural rights (e.g., language, representation, right to counsel) while allowing flexibility for contraventions.

---

#### **5. Power of Arrest**

- A power of arrest granted by an enactment **can still be exercised** even if the offence is designated as a contravention.
- However, **this Act does not confer or expand** any power of arrest — it is limited to administrative enforcement.

---

#### **6. Regulatory Powers of the Governor in Council**

The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make regulations to:
- **Designate specific offences** as contraventions (excluding those only prosecutable by indictment).
- Establish **short-form descriptions** of contraventions (to simplify public understanding).
- Set **fines** for contraventions (in proceedings via ticket).
- Prescribe the **form and content of tickets**.
- Determine **fees, penalties, and costs** applicable at any stage of proceedings.
- Create **classes of contraventions** (e.g., by type or severity).

> **Important Limitations:**
> - The fine for a contravention **cannot exceed** the maximum fine established by the original enactment.
> - For contraventions involving **young persons**, the fine **cannot exceed $100** (unless otherwise specified).
> - Fines may differ for **corporations vs. individuals** if the original law differentiates between them.
> - Fees must not be less than any **minimum penalty** set by the original enactment.

> **Flexibility:** Different provinces may have different fee structures.

> **Revocation:** The Governor in Council can **revoke** a designation of an offence as a contravention.

An enforcement authority may issue a ticket **within 30 days** of believing a contravention occurred.

  - For non-parking: "reasonable grounds to believe" a contravention occurred.
  - For parking: "personal knowledge" of the violation.
- Contain the **short-form description** of the contravention.

---

#### **9. Commencement of Proceedings**

A proceeding may begin by:
- Filing the ticket in the **contraventions court**, or
- If the contravention involves a **young person**, and the **lieutenant governor in council has not ordered** that such cases go to ordinary court, then in the **youth court**.

> **Exception**: If the lieutenant governor in council has ordered that all contraventions involving young persons be dealt with in **ordinary court**, then the **contraventions court or justice of the peace** has jurisdiction — **excluding youth justice court**.

> *Note:* Paragraph 3(2)(d) of the *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to such orders.

---

#### **10. Filing of the Ticket**

An enforcement authority must file the ticket in the relevant court **within 30 days** of service, or sooner if:
- The office specified in the ticket is where the person is to plead guilty or make representations; or
- The person requests a trial or a plea with representations.

> This ensures timely processing and prevents undue delay.

> For **parking contraventions**, the ticket must be accompanied by **evidence of vehicle ownership**.

---

#### **11. Options for the Person Served**

Within **30 days** of receiving the ticket, the person may:
1. **Plead guilty and pay** the full amount.
2. **Plead guilty but make representations** (e.g., about the appropriate fine, or payment schedule).
3. **Request a trial**.

> These options are designed to provide **flexibility and fairness** for low-level violations.

---

#### **12. Plea of Guilty and Payment**

- **Payment of the full amount**:
  - Constitutes a **plea of guilty**.
  - The **endorsement of payment** constitutes a **conviction** and the **imposition of the fine**.
- **Payment less than the total amount**:
  - Is considered a **payment on account** of the fine and fees.
- **Payment more than 30 days after service**:
  - Also constitutes a **payment on account**.

> This allows for partial or delayed payments without automatic conviction.

---
