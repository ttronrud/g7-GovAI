### **Detailed Summary of the *Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act* (Canada)**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose**
The *Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act* (the "Act") was enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, on **March 16, 2015** (as set out in the statutory instrument SI/2015-22). It formally implements Canada’s obligations under the **Convention on Cluster Munitions**, adopted in Dublin on May 30, 2008.

The **primary purpose** of the Act is to:
- Prohibit the use, development, production, acquisition, possession, import, export, or transfer of cluster munitions and their components (explosive submunitions and explosive bomblets).
- Align Canada with international norms and humanitarian standards that seek to eliminate the long-term dangers posed by cluster munitions to civilians.
- Protect civilian populations from the indiscriminate and persistent harm caused by unexploded submunitions, which often remain in conflict zones and pose a threat for decades.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The Act provides precise definitions to clarify what constitutes a prohibited item:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Cluster Munition** | A conventional munition designed to disperse or release explosive submunitions. <br> **Exclusions**: Munitions that release flares, smoke, chaff, or electronic effects; those designed exclusively for air defence; those with fewer than 10 submunitions each weighing over 4 kg, designed to detect single targets, and equipped with self-destruct/self-deactivation mechanisms; and anti-personnel mines as defined elsewhere. |
| **Explosive Submunition** | A conventional munition under 20 kg, not self-propelled, released from a container attached to an aircraft, designed to detonate before, on, or after impact. <br> **Exclusions** similar to those for cluster munitions. |
| **Explosive Bomblet** | A type of explosive submunition that is dispersed or released from a container and detonates upon impact or before. <br> **Exclusions** include those releasing smoke, flares, or electronic effects. |
| **Person** | An individual or organization as defined in the *Criminal Code*. |
| **Use** | Includes firing, dropping, launching, projecting, dispersing, releasing, or otherwise delivering a munition for detonation. |

These definitions ensure that the Act applies only to weapons that meet specific criteria of indiscriminate harm and long-term civilian risk—excluding legitimate military uses such as air defence or electronic warfare.

#### **3. Prohibitions Under Section 6**

The core of the Act is a **broad prohibition** on any person from engaging in the following activities involving cluster munitions, explosive submunitions, or explosive bomblets:

- **Use** (firing, dropping, launching, etc.)
- **Development, manufacture, acquisition, or possession**
- **Movement** of such munitions from one foreign state/territory to another with the intent to transfer ownership or control
- **Import or export**
- **Attempt** to commit any of the above
- **Aiding, abetting, counselling, or conspiring** to commit any of the above
- **Receiving, comforting, or assisting** someone who has committed or aided in such acts to escape

This prohibition applies universally to all individuals and organizations in Canada, regardless of nationality or location.

#### **4. Exemptions (Section 7, 8, and 9)**

Despite the broad prohibitions, several **exemptions** are provided under specific conditions, ensuring that essential military, humanitarian, and safety-related activities are not rendered illegal.

##### **Exemption by Minister (Section 7)**
- The Governor in Council (federal Cabinet) may, by order, exempt a person or class of persons from Section 6 **if**:
  - The exemption is necessary for:
    - Training or research in **detection, clearance, destruction**, or **countermeasures** related to cluster munitions.
  - The exemption is granted only if the Minister considers it essential for public safety and humanitarian efforts.

##### **Exemption by Minister of National Defence (Section 8)**

#### **5. Exceptions for Deactivation and Military Cooperation (Section 10)**

Certain activities are **not prohibited** under specific circumstances:

##### **(a) Deactivated Munitions**
- A person may acquire, possess, move, or import a cluster munition, submunition, or bomblet **if it has been fully deactivated** by:
  - Removing all explosive substances;
  - Removing or destroying priming, detonating, dispersal, or release mechanisms;
  - Rendering them inoperable in a way that cannot be easily restored.

> This allows safe handling and disposal of old or abandoned munitions without violating the Act.

##### **(b) Military Cooperation with Non-Party States**
- Personnel in the **Canadian Armed Forces** or public service may:
  - Authorize or request the use of cluster munitions by allied armed forces in **combined military operations** with a country that is **not a party to the Convention**.
  - Acquire or possess such munitions while on **attachment, exchange, or secondment** with foreign armed forces.
- These actions are permitted **only if**:
  - The use is within the scope of joint military operations.
  - The choice of munitions is not under Canada’s exclusive control.
  - The operation involves cooperation with a non-signatory state.

> This reflects Canada’s commitment to international military alliances while respecting its humanitarian obligations.

##### **(c) Transport and Activities Related to Transport**
- A person may transport or engage in activities related to the transport of cluster munitions **owned, possessed, or controlled by a non-Convention state** during military cooperation.

##### **(d) Aiding or Consenting to Non-Offensive Acts**
- A person may:
  - Aid, abet, counsel, or conspire to commit an act prohibited under Section 6 **only if** such an act would **not be an offence** in the jurisdiction of the other party.
  - Receive or assist someone in escaping **only if** such conduct would not be illegal in their jurisdiction.

> These exceptions prevent Canada from being held criminally liable for actions that are lawful in the other country.

##### **(e) Duty-Based Exceptions**
- Officers, non-commissioned members (as defined in the *National Defence Act*), peace officers, or employees of Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province may:
  - Acquire, possess, import, export, or move cluster munitions **for the purpose of destroying or deactivating them**, or for investigations under parliamentary authority.
- These individuals may also **seize** such munitions and **detain them in a safe place**.

> This empowers law enforcement and military personnel to manage dangerous materials safely.

---

#### **6. Detention and Seizure Powers**

- **Judicial Detention**: A justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge under the *Criminal Code*, or military judge may **order the detention of a cluster munition** in a safe place **if it is required for proceedings under an Act of Parliament**.
- **Seizure by Officers or Peace Officers**: Officers or peace officers who seize such munitions may **remove and detain them** in a safe location.

> These provisions ensure that dangerous materials are not left unsecured and are available for investigation or destruction.

#### **7. Forfeiture and Disposal of Illegally Acquired Items**

- A court may order **forfeiture** of any item used in a violation of the Act.
- Forfeiture may be ordered by:
  - A provincial court judge or provincial court judge (ex parte) on application by the Attorney General of Canada.
  - A military judge on application by the Director of Military Prosecutions.
- **Forfeited items** must be disposed of as directed by the **Attorney General of Canada**, **except**:
  - If the item is a cluster munition, explosive submunition, or explosive bomblet; or
  - If the order was made by a **military judge**, in which case the Minister of National Defence must direct the disposal.

> This ensures that dangerous materials are not merely confiscated but are properly handled and destroyed.

---

#### **8. Regulatory Authority and Enforcement**

- The **Governor in Council** may make regulations to implement the Act, including:
  - Defining specific procedures for handling, reporting, or monitoring cluster munitions.
  - Making it an offence to contravene those regulations.
- Regulations may be made to ensure compliance with the Convention and to support national implementation.
