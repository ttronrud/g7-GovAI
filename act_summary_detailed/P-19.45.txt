**Detailed Summary of the *Prevention of Terrorist Travel Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Prevention of Terrorist Travel Act* is a legislative instrument designed to strengthen Canada’s ability to prevent individuals from engaging in terrorist activities by restricting their ability to travel abroad through the cancellation of passports. It establishes a legal framework for the cancellation of passports on grounds related to terrorism or national security, and provides a formal, judicial review process to ensure that such cancellations are reasonable and not arbitrary.

Although the Act is titled "Prevention of Terrorist Travel," it does not create new criminal offences or impose direct penalties. Instead, it operates within existing security and immigration frameworks—particularly the *Canadian Passport Order*—to allow government authorities to act swiftly in cases where travel could pose a threat to national security or enable terrorist acts.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Citation**: The Act may be cited as the *Prevention of Terrorist Travel Act*.
- **Definition of "Judge"**:  
  A "judge" in this Act refers to either:
  - The **Chief Justice of the Federal Court**, or  
  - A judge of the Federal Court **designated by the Chief Justice**.  
  This ensures that decisions on appeals are made by independent, senior judicial officers with authority over federal matters.

#### **2. Designation of the Minister**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by order, designate a specific **minister of the Crown** to act as the "Minister" responsible for making decisions under this Act.
- This provision allows flexibility in administrative implementation, ensuring that the responsibility for passport cancellations is assigned to a designated official (e.g., the Minister of Foreign Affairs or Minister of Public Safety), depending on policy priorities.

#### **3. Appeal Rights After Passport Cancellation**

- **Grounds for Cancellation**:  
  A passport may be cancelled if the Minister determines that:
  - Cancellation is necessary to **prevent the commission of a terrorism offence**, as defined in **section 2 of the Criminal Code** (e.g., acts of terrorism, sabotage, or threats to public safety), or  
  - Cancellation is required for the **national security of Canada or a foreign country or state**.

- **Right to Appeal**:  
  The person whose passport has been cancelled has the right to appeal the Minister’s decision **within 30 days** of receiving notice of the decision.

- **Extended Timeframes**:  
  Despite the 30-day deadline, the judge **may extend the appeal period** before or after the 30 days if deemed appropriate. This provides flexibility in cases where additional evidence or legal preparation is needed.

- **Judicial Review Process**:  
  The judge must:
  - Determine **without delay** whether the cancellation of the passport is **reasonable** based on the information available.
  - If the judge finds that the cancellation is **unreasonable**, they may **quash (set aside)** the Minister’s decision.

> This judicial review ensures that cancellations are not made arbitrarily and that individuals have a meaningful opportunity to challenge decisions that significantly affect their personal rights (e.g., travel freedom).

#### **4. Rules Governing Appeals (Repealed in 2024)**

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Several key rules under this section were **repealed effective 2024** (as per *c. 16, s. 96*). These included:
> - The requirement that the judge must allow the Minister to present evidence.
> - Provisions regarding the admissibility of evidence (even if inadmissible in court).
> - Rules about the return of withdrawn evidence and confidentiality.

> ✅ As of 2024, **only the following rules remain in force**:
> - The judge must provide the **appellant (the person appealing)** and the **Minister** with an opportunity to be heard.
> - If the Minister withdraws or the judge determines that evidence is **not relevant**, the judge **must not base the decision on that evidence** and must **return it to the Minister**.
> - The judge must **ensure the confidentiality** of any evidence or information withdrawn by the Minister.

> These remaining rules preserve procedural fairness and protect sensitive national security information.

#### **5. Application of Evidence Act Rules**

- For greater certainty, **sections 38.2 to 38.45 of the Canada Evidence Act** apply to all appeals under this Act.
- This means that, while the judge may consider non-traditional or non-admissible evidence (in theory), the final decision must still comply with the principles of evidence law—such as relevance, reliability, and probative value—especially in light of the 2024 repeal of broader evidentiary rules.

#### **6. Scope of Judicial Review – Broader Decisions**

The Act extends its judicial review provisions to cover **other decisions** made under the *Canadian Passport Order*, including:

##### **(a) Refusal to Issue or Revocation of a Passport**
- If the Minister decides that a passport should **not be issued** or should be **revoked** on the grounds of:
  - Preventing a terrorism offence (as defined in the Criminal Code), or  
  - National security (of Canada or a foreign state),  
  then the affected individual may appeal.

##### **(b) Denial of Passport Services**
- A decision to **refuse delivery of passport services** (e.g., issuing a passport, renewing, or delivering it) may also be subject to appeal **if**:
  1. The Minister made the decision **after** deciding (on the same grounds) that the passport should not have been issued or should be revoked, **or**
  2. The passport has expired, but the Minister could have revoked it **based on facts that occurred before expiry**.

> This ensures that even decisions related to service delivery (not just issuance or cancellation) are subject to judicial oversight when grounded in national security or terrorism concerns.

#### **7. Rules for Judicial Review of These Decisions**

- The same core principles apply:
  - The judge must provide **both the applicant and the Minister** with an opportunity to be heard.
  - If evidence is found to be **irrelevant or withdrawn**, the judge must **not base the decision on it** and must **return it to the Minister**.
  - The judge must **maintain confidentiality** of any withdrawn evidence.

- Again, **sections 38.2 to 38.45 of the Canada Evidence Act** apply to these proceedings.

#### **8. Further Appeals and Subsection 6(2)**

- Subsection 6(2) (which governs appeals from judicial decisions) applies to:
  - Any appeal of a decision made by a judge under this Act, and
  - Any **further appeals** (e.g., appeals from a judge’s decision to a higher court), with **necessary modifications**.

> This creates a potential two-tier appeal process, allowing individuals to challenge decisions in a higher judicial body if unsatisfied with the initial judicial review.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Terrorism and National Security Focus** | The Act enables rapid response to threats by allowing passport cancellation on grounds of terrorism or national security. |
| **Judicial Oversight** | Provides a formal, independent review process to prevent arbitrary or unjust cancellations. |
| **Right to Appeal** | Citizens have a clear right to challenge passport cancellations within 30 days (with possible extensions). |
| **Procedural Fairness** | Ensures due process through hearings, opportunity to respond, and handling of evidence. |
| **Confidentiality** | Protects sensitive intelligence or security information by restricting disclosure of withdrawn evidence. |
| **Repealed Provisions** | In 2024, several rules allowing broader evidentiary use were removed, tightening procedural standards and limiting the Minister’s ability to rely on non-admissible evidence. |

### **Limitations and Criticisms (Implied)**

- **Lack of Transparency**: The process is inherently secretive due to confidentiality requirements, which may limit public scrutiny.
- **Potential for Overreach**: Critics argue that the broad definition of "national security" could be used to justify cancellations without sufficient evidence.
- **Limited Remedies**: The only remedy is quashing the decision; there is no automatic reinstatement of the passport or compensation.
- **No Independent Oversight Body**: The review is limited to the Federal Court, and decisions are not subject to parliamentary or public review.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prevention of Terrorist Travel Act* is a **security-focused legislative measure** that enables the Canadian government to act swiftly in preventing individuals from using travel to commit terrorist acts or threaten national security. It strikes a balance between **public safety** and **individual rights** by establishing a clear, time-bound, and procedurally fair judicial review process.

However, the **2024 repeal of several evidentiary provisions** signals a shift toward **greater procedural caution and reduced flexibility** in evidence use, reflecting a broader government effort to ensure accountability and prevent misuse of national security powers.

While the Act strengthens Canada’s counter-terrorism infrastructure, its effectiveness and legitimacy depend on consistent application, transparency, and adherence to judicial independence and fairness.

---

**Final Note**: This Act operates in conjunction with the *Canadian Passport Order* and the *Criminal Code*. It does not replace or amend those instruments but rather provides a specific appeal mechanism for decisions made under them.
