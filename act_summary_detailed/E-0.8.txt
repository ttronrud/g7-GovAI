### 3. **Veterans’ Benefit Adjustments (Key Focus)**

This section addresses **historical injustices** in veterans’ benefit calculations, particularly concerning **overlaps between disability pensions and other benefits**. It provides retroactive or corrective payments for veterans who were improperly excluded from receiving benefits due to the inclusion of disability pensions.

#### ✅ **Benefit Corrections for Veterans Who Served Between May 29, 2012 – September 30, 2012 (Earnings Loss Benefits)**

- A person who received an **earnings loss benefit** under the *Veterans Well-being Act* (subsections 18(1) or 22(1)) during that period — **or who would have been eligible** if the disability pension under the *Pension Act* had not been counted — is entitled to a **corrected amount**.

> **Formula**:
>  
> Corrected Amount =  
> (Amount of earnings loss benefit *without* disability pension)  
> – (Amount of earnings loss benefit *with* disability pension)  
> + (Amount of long-term disability benefits paid under the *Service Income Security Insurance Plan* due to the *Manuge v. Canada* settlement)

> The settlement in *Manuge v. Canada* (approved April 15, 2013) established that veterans should not be penalized for receiving disability pensions when calculating their entitlements to income support.

> **Deemed Benefit**: Any payment under this formula is **deemed to be an income replacement benefit** under the Veterans Well-being Act.

---

#### ✅ **Canadian Forces Income Support Benefits**

- Similar correction applies to veterans receiving **Canadian Forces income support benefits** under sections 27–31 of the *Veterans Well-being Act*.

> **Formula**:
>  
> Corrected Amount =  
> (Amount of benefit *without* disability pension)  
> – (Amount of benefit *with* disability pension)  
> + (Long-term disability benefits from Manuge settlement)

> **Deemed Benefit**: The corrected amount is treated as a Canadian Forces income support benefit under the Act.

---

#### ✅ **War Veterans Allowance Act (Allowance Payments)**

- Veterans who received a **War Veterans Allowance** (section 4(1)) between **May 29, 2012 – September 30, 2013** — or who would have been eligible had the disability pension not been counted — are entitled to a corrected payment.

> **Formula**:
>  
> Corrected Amount =  
> (Allowance *without* disability pension)  
> – (Allowance *with* disability pension)

> **Deemed Benefit**: The corrected amount is treated as a valid allowance under the War Veterans Allowance Act.

---

#### ✅ **Civilian War-related Benefits Act**

- Veterans who received benefits under the *Civilian War-related Benefits Act* during the same period are entitled to a corrected amount if the disability pension was improperly counted.

> **Formula**:
>  
> Corrected Amount =  
> (Benefit *without* disability pension)  
> – (Benefit *with* disability pension)

> **Deemed Benefit**: The corrected amount is treated as a valid benefit under the Civilian War-related Benefits Act.

---

### 4. **Funding and Payment Mechanism**

- The **amounts determined under sections 102 to 105** (which include the corrected benefit calculations above) are to be **paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- Payment is **on the requisition of the Minister of Veterans Affairs**.

> This ensures that the government can efficiently disburse funds without requiring new appropriations.

---

### 5. **Definitions (Key Terms)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Common-law partner** | A person cohabiting in a conjugal relationship for at least one year. |
| **Dependent child** | Defined differently depending on the benefit: <br> - Under sections 102/103: same as in *Veterans Well-being Act* (subsection 2(1)) <br> - Under sections 104/105: same as in *War Veterans Allowance Act* (subsection 2(1)) |
| **Survivor** | Spouse residing with the deceased at death, or the deceased’s common-law partner. <br> **Exception**: A spouse or partner does not lose status if they are living apart due to health care, temporary circumstances, or uncontrollable events. |

---

### 6. **Succession Rules Upon Death of a Beneficiary**

If a person entitled to a benefit under sections 102–105 **dies before receiving payment**, the benefit is distributed as follows:

| Scenario | Distribution |
|--------|--------------|
| There is a **survivor** | Survivor receives **100%** of the amount |
| No survivor, but **dependent children exist** | Each child receives an equal share (total amount divided by number of children) |
| No survivor or dependent children | **No payment** is made |

> This ensures that benefits are passed on only to eligible dependents, preserving fiscal responsibility.
