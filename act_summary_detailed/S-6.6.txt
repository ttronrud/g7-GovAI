### **Detailed Summary of the *shíshálh Nation Self-Government Act***

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**

The *shíshálh Nation Self-Government Act* is a foundational piece of legislation that formalizes and strengthens the **inherent right of self-government** of the **shíshálh Nation**, in alignment with Canada’s commitments to **reconciliation**, **Indigenous rights**, and **the implementation of international standards** such as the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**.

This Act is rooted in:
- The **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action**,
- The **National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) Calls for Justice**,
- The constitutional recognition of Indigenous rights under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, which affirms the **inherent right of self-government**.

It reflects a shift from top-down governance to **nation-to-nation relationships**, emphasizing **recognition, respect, cooperation, and partnership** between the Government of Canada and the shíshálh Nation.

#### **2. Key Principles and Values**

- **Recognition of Inherent Rights**: The Act affirms the shíshálh Nation’s inherent right to self-government, which is protected under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
- **Cultural and Environmental Connection**: The Nation’s deep, spiritual, and cultural connection to its land and resources is recognized as essential to its **culture, health, economy, laws, governance, and future survival**.
- **Reconciliation and Justice**: The Act responds to historical injustices by enabling meaningful self-determination and empowering Indigenous leadership.
- **No Abrogation of Aboriginal Rights**: The Act explicitly states it **does not limit or restrict** any Aboriginal rights — including the inherent right of self-government, Aboriginal title, or the Nation’s identity as an Indigenous people of Canada.
- **Participation in Broader Processes**: The Nation retains the right to participate in regional or national processes related to self-government.

---

#### **3. Legal Identity and Continuity**

- The **Sechelt Indian Band** (established under the Indian Act) is **continued and renamed** as the **shíshálh Nation**.
- This transition is not symbolic — it is **legal and substantive**:
  - The **rights, titles, interests, assets, obligations, and liabilities** of the Sechelt Indian Band are now those of the shíshálh Nation.
  - The **members of the Sechelt Indian Band are now the members of the shíshálh Nation**.

This marks a significant step toward **full legal and political autonomy**.

---

#### **4. Legal Personhood of the shíshálh Nation**

The shíshálh Nation is recognized as a **legal entity** with the **capacity and rights of a natural person**, including the ability to:
- Enter into contracts and agreements,
- Acquire, hold, sell, or dispose of property,
- Borrow and invest money,
- Sue or be sued,
- Conduct business and manage its affairs.

This legal status enables the Nation to govern itself independently and engage in economic, social, and legal activities on its own terms.

#### **5. Governance Structure**

##### **Council (hiwus Ɂiy te hihewhiwus)**
- The **Sechelt Indian Band Council** is continued as the **governing body** of the shíshálh Nation under the name *hiwus Ɂiy te hihewhiwus*.

#### **7. District Government (shíshálh Nation Government District)**

- The **Sechelt Indian Government District** is continued as the **shíshálh Nation Government District**.
- It is a **separate legal entity** with the same rights and powers as the Nation (e.g., to enter contracts, hold property, borrow money, sue or be sued).
- Its governing body is the **shíshálh Nation Government District Council**, composed of members of the main Council.

##### **Power Transfer Between Nation and District**
- The **Governor in Council** (on advice of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations) may **transfer powers, duties, or functions** from the Nation to the District — **but only if**:
  1. The **BC Legislature has passed relevant legislation** for the District,
  2. The transfer has been **approved by a referendum** under the Nation’s constitution.

- Similarly, if BC legislation is amended or repealed, the Governor in Council may **transfer powers back** to the Nation or Council.

- This mechanism allows for **flexible, democratic, and responsive governance**, where functions can be delegated to a regional district for efficiency or local needs — while remaining accountable to the Nation.

> **Important Limitation**: Powers related to **membership** and **disposition of land rights** cannot be transferred.

---

#### **8. Land Rights and Management**

- **shíshálh Lands** are defined as:
  - Lands transferred to the Sechelt Indian Band on **October 9, 1986**, under Section 23 of the former Act, or
  - Lands declared as such by **both**:
    - The Governor in Council by order, **and**
    - The Lieutenant Governor in Council of British Columbia.

- The Nation holds these lands **for the use and benefit of the Nation and its members**.

- **Full Disposal Rights**: The Nation has the **full power to dispose of** shíshálh lands and rights in them — **but only in accordance with procedures set out in its constitution**.

- **Reserve Land Register**: All transactions involving shíshálh lands must be recorded in the **Reserve Land Register** under the Indian Act (subject to subsection 2).

> This ensures transparency and accountability in land dealings, even as the Nation exercises greater control.
