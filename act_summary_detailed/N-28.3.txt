**Detailed Summary of the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to regulate the **development, production, use, and control** of nuclear energy and nuclear substances in a manner that ensures **public health, environmental protection, national security, and compliance with international obligations**. Enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, the Act establishes a robust regulatory framework through the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)**, which is responsible for overseeing all aspects of nuclear activity in Canada.

### **1. Purpose of the Act**

The primary objectives of the Act are:

- To **limit risks** to:
  - The **health and safety** of individuals,
  - The **environment**, and
