### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Oman Tax Agreement Act, 2004**

The **Canada–Oman Tax Agreement Act, 2004** is a legislative instrument that enables the implementation of the **Canada–Oman Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)** in Canadian law. This Act establishes the legal framework for applying the DTAA between Canada and the Sultanate of Oman, with the primary objective of **preventing double taxation** and **avoiding fiscal evasion** related to income and capital taxes. Below is a comprehensive, structured summary of the key provisions and their implications.

---

## **1. Citation and Scope of the Act**
- The Act is formally titled: **Canada–Oman Tax Agreement Act, 2004**.
- It provides the domestic legal basis for enforcing the **Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Sultanate of Oman**, as detailed in **Schedule 1** and amended by the **Protocol in Schedule 2**.
- The Agreement is **approved and has the force of law in Canada** during the period it is in force under its own terms.

---

## **2. Precedence of the Agreement and Related Laws**
- In case of **inconsistency** between:
  - This Act or the Agreement and any other Canadian law,
  - The Agreement and the **Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act (ITCIA)**,
  
  → The **provisions of this Act and the Agreement prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.  
  → However, **the ITCIA prevails over the Agreement** where there is conflict (i.e., in interpretation of tax convention terms).

> This ensures that the DTAA is given priority in tax matters, while still allowing for harmonization with broader tax convention interpretation rules.

> This ensures transparency and public awareness of the Agreement’s timeline.

## **7. Residency Determination**
Residency is critical to determining where income is taxable. The rules are structured hierarchically:

### **For Individuals:**
1. **Permanent Home**:
   - If an individual has a permanent home in one or both countries, they are deemed a resident **only** in the State where they have a permanent home.
2. **Centre of Vital Interests (CVI)**:
   - If permanent homes are shared, residency is determined by **personal and economic ties** — the State where CVI lies.
3. **Habitual Abode**:
   - If no permanent home, residency is determined by **habitual abode**.
4. **Nationality**:
   - If no permanent home or habitual abode, residency is with the **State of nationality**.
5. **Mutual Agreement**:
   - If none of the above can be determined, the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue through **mutual agreement**.

> This avoids double taxation by ensuring individuals are taxed only in one country.

---

### **For Companies:**
1. Residency is with the **State of nationality**.
2. If not a national of either country, residency is with the **State where the place of effective management** is located.

> This prevents companies from being taxed in both countries based on location alone.

---

### **For Other Persons (e.g., trusts, foundations):**
- If such entities are residents of both countries, the **competent authorities must reach a mutual agreement** to determine residency and tax treatment.

---

## **8. Permanent Establishment (PE)**
A PE is a **fixed place of business** through which an enterprise conducts business.

### **Included in PE:**
- Place of management,
- Branch,
- Office,
- Factory,
- Workshop,
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any site for exploration/exploitation of natural resources.

### **Includes (if conditions met):**
- **Building sites or construction projects** lasting **over 6 months**,
- **Furnishing services** (e.g., consultancy) carried out by employees for more than **6 months in any 12-month period**.

### **Excluded from PE:**
- Use of facilities for **storage or display** of goods,
- Maintenance of stock **solely for storage/display**,
- Stock maintained **for processing by another enterprise**,
- Fixed place used **only for purchasing goods or collecting information**,
- Fixed place used **only for preparatory or auxiliary activities**.

> **Exception**: A person acting on behalf of a foreign enterprise may create a PE if:
> - They have **authority to conclude contracts** in the host country, **unless** their activities fall under the excluded categories (e.g., procurement, information gathering),
> - Or they **maintain a stock** from which they deliver goods on behalf of the enterprise.

> **Note**: A **broker, general agent, or independent agent** does **not** create a PE if acting in the ordinary course of business. However, if the agent’s activities are **wholly or almost wholly on behalf of the enterprise** and **commercial/financial conditions differ from those between independent parties**, the agent is **not** considered independent — and thus, a PE may be deemed to exist.

> **No PE arises** simply because a company controls or is controlled by another company in the other country — **control alone does not create a PE**.
