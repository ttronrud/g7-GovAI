The *British Columbia Treaty Commission Act* (BCTCA) is a foundational piece of legislation in Canada that establishes the **British Columbia Treaty Commission (Commission)** as a formal body to facilitate treaty negotiations between **First Nations**, **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, and **Her Majesty in right of British Columbia**. Enacted on March 1, 1996 (as noted in the statutory instrument SI/96-23), the Act provides the legal framework, powers, responsibilities, governance structure, and operational procedures for the Commission under the broader context of the **British Columbia Treaty Commission Agreement**, signed on September 21, 1992.

## **1. Purpose and Legislative Intent**
- The primary purpose of the Act is to **establish and operationalize the British Columbia Treaty Commission** as outlined in the 1992 Agreement.
- It enables the Commission to act as a neutral, independent facilitator in advancing treaty negotiations among First Nations, the federal government, and the provincial government of British Columbia.
- The Act ensures that the Commission operates independently of any government agency or political influence while being accountable to the principals (Canada, BC, and the Summit).

## **2. Key Definitions**

## **3. Establishment and Legal Status**
