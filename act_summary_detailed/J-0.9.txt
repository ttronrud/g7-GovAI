### **Background and Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Historical Context: The Fall of Saigon and the Vietnamese Exodus**
- The Act begins with a series of *whereas* clauses that outline key historical events:
  - The Canadian Forces participated in supervisory operations in Vietnam in support of the **Paris Peace Accords of 1973**, which aimed to end the war and establish peace.
  - Despite the accords, on **April 30, 1975**, the military forces of the **People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN)** and the **National Liberation Front (NLF)** launched a full-scale invasion of South Vietnam, leading to the **fall of Saigon**.
  - This marked the end of the Vietnam War and the establishment of the **Socialist Republic of Vietnam**.
  
- As a result of political instability, violence, and deteriorating living conditions, an estimated **840,000 Vietnamese people** fled their homeland, becoming known as the **"Vietnamese boat people"**.

#### 2. **Humanitarian Toll**
- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that at least **250,000 Vietnamese refugees lost their lives at sea** during the exodus due to:
  - Drowning
  - Illness
  - Starvation
  - Violence, including kidnapping and piracy
- This underscores the immense human suffering endured during the displacement.

#### 3. **Canada’s Role in Refugee Sponsorship**
- Canada responded with a **humanitarian and moral commitment** to accept Vietnamese refugees.
- Through a combination of:
  - **Government-assisted resettlement programs**
  - **Private sponsorship** by Canadian families, religious groups, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
- Canada accepted **over 60,000 Vietnamese refugees** between the 1970s and 1980s.
  - Approximately **34,000** were privately sponsored.
  - Approximately **26,000** were assisted by the Canadian government.

#### 4. **Recognition by the United Nations**
- In **1986**, the **UNHCR awarded the Nansen Refugee Award to the "People of Canada"** in recognition of their **major and sustained contribution to the global refugee cause**, particularly in the resettlement of Vietnamese refugees.
- This international recognition highlights Canada’s leadership and compassion in refugee sponsorship.

#### 5. **Cultural and Commemorative Significance**
- April 30 is widely recognized by Vietnamese-Canadian communities as:
  - **"Black April Day"** – a somber reminder of the violence, loss, and trauma of the fall of Saigon and the subsequent exodus.
  - **"Journey to Freedom Day"** – a day of hope, resilience, and gratitude for the opportunity to build new lives in Canada.
- The Act acknowledges the **enduring gratitude of Vietnamese refugees and their descendants** toward the Canadian people and government.
- It also honors the **contributions of Vietnamese-Canadians**, whose population now stands at approximately **300,000**, and who have enriched Canadian society in cultural, economic, and social dimensions.
