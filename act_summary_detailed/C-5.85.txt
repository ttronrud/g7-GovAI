## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canada-Germany Tax Agreement Act, 1982**

### 📜 **1. Introduction and Purpose**
The *Canada-Germany Tax Agreement Act, 1982* is a Canadian statute enacted to implement and give legal effect in Canada to the **Canada-Germany Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)**, signed between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. The primary objectives of the Agreement are:

- To **avoid double taxation** of income and capital gains.
- To **prevent fiscal evasion** (tax avoidance through artificial arrangements).
- To **facilitate cooperation** in tax matters between the two countries.

This Act enables the Agreement to be legally binding in Canada, providing a framework for its interpretation, implementation, and modification over time.

### 🏛️ **2. Legislative Framework and Legal Status**

- **Citation**: The Act is known as the *Canada-Germany Tax Agreement Act, 1982*.
- **Applicability**: The Agreement is approved and declared to have the **force of law in Canada** during the period it is in force, as specified in the Agreement itself.
- **Hierarchy of Laws**:
  - In the event of **inconsistency** between this Act, the Agreement, and any other Canadian law, **the Agreement and this Act prevail**.
  - However, **an exception applies**: if there is an inconsistency between the Agreement and the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*, then **that Act prevails** to the extent of the inconsistency. This ensures that Canada's domestic tax interpretation rules take precedence where they conflict with the DTAA.

> ⚖️ This establishes a clear hierarchy: DTAA > Other laws, **except** when it conflicts with the Interpretation Act.

### 📝 **3. Regulatory and Administrative Powers**

- **Minister of National Revenue**:
  - May make **regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement or its provisions.
  - These regulations may cover administrative procedures, reporting requirements, or definitions specific to the Agreement.

- **Minister of Finance**:
  - Must publish in the *Canada Gazette*:
    - The **date the Agreement enters into force**.

  - Such supplementary agreements may:
    - Alter, revoke, replace, or add to the original Agreement.
    - Be effective **only during the period specified in the supplementary agreement**.

> 🔍 Example: If Germany introduces a new tax regime, a supplementary agreement may be made to adjust the tax treatment accordingly.

### 📣 **4. Approval and Parliamentary Oversight of Supplementary Agreements**

To ensure democratic accountability, the process for approving supplementary agreements includes:

#### ✅ **Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **Order Issuance**: The Governor in Council issues an order approving a supplementary agreement.
2. **Laying Before Parliament**:
   - The order must be **laid before Parliament within 15 sitting days** of issuance.
3. **Parliamentary Review**:
   - A **motion to revoke** the order may be filed by:
     - At least **30 Members of the House of Commons** (for Commons motion).
     - At least **15 Members of the Senate** (for Senate motion).
   - The motion must be filed **within 20 sitting days** after the order is laid.
4. **Debate and Decision**:
   - If a motion is filed, the relevant House must **consider it within 6 sitting days** of the filing.
   - Debate on the motion is limited to **3 hours**.
   - After debate, the Speaker puts the motion to a vote **without further amendment or debate**.
5. **Outcome**:
   - If the motion is **adopted**, the order is **revoked**.
   - If the motion is **not adopted**, the order **comes into force immediately** on the **latest of**:
     - The failure of the other House to adopt a similar motion.
     - The expiration of the 20-day filing period.
     - The failure of the other House to adopt a motion (if any).

> 🎯 This mechanism ensures that major tax treaty changes are subject to **parliamentary scrutiny** and **public debate**, protecting democratic oversight.

#### 🔄 Special Rule:
- If either House enacts rules allowing **negative resolution** (i.e., a vote to reject a regulation), then **Section 6 of this Act is repealed**, and future orders under Section 5 become **subject to negative resolution** under the *Interpretation Act* (Section 28.1).

> This provides flexibility in the legislative process while maintaining accountability.

#### 🏠 **Residency Rules (Determining Tax Liability)**

Residency determines where income is taxed. The rules are **multi-layered** and designed to prevent double taxation:

1. **General Rule**:
   - A person is a resident if they are liable to tax in a country due to **domicile, residence, place of management**, or similar criteria.

2. **Residency of Individuals**:
   - If an individual is a resident of **both countries**, status is determined in this order:
     1. **Permanent home available** → resident only in the country where the home is located.
     2. If home is in both → resident in the country with **closer personal and economic ties** (center of vital interests).
     3. If center of vital interests cannot be determined → resident in the country with **habitual abode**.
     4. If habitual abode is in both or neither → resident in the country of **nationality**.
     5. If national of both or neither → **mutual agreement** between authorities.

3. **Residency of Non-Individuals (e.g., companies)**:
   - If a company is a resident of both countries, the competent authorities must **reach mutual agreement**.
   - If no agreement is reached → the company is **not considered a resident** of either country for tax purposes under the Agreement.

> This avoids double taxation by clearly defining residency based on personal and economic ties.
