**Detailed Summary of the Expenditure Restraint Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Expenditure Restraint Act* is a federal Canadian statute enacted to impose strict limits on wage increases and changes to pay structures for certain public sector employees during a defined period known as the **restraint period** (April 1, 2006 – March 31, 2011). Its primary purpose is to control government spending by restricting the ability of public sector employers and employee representatives to increase base pay or introduce new forms of remuneration beyond prescribed percentages.

The Act applies specifically to federal public administration employees and certain public bodies, including members of Parliament and Crown corporations. It establishes a framework of **mandatory pay increases**, **prohibitions on pay restructuring**, and **limitations on additional remuneration**, all designed to ensure fiscal discipline while preserving collective bargaining rights.
