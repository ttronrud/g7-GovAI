### 🔍 Definitions of Core Crimes

#### 1. **Genocide**
- An act or omission committed **with intent to destroy**, in whole or in part, an **identifiable group of persons**.
- The act must constitute genocide under:
  - Customary international law
  - Conventional international law
  - General principles of law recognized by the community of nations
- **Note**: The definition includes intent, and does not require a violation of domestic law at the time.

#### 2. **Crime Against Humanity**
- Any act or omission committed against:
  - A **civilian population** or an **identifiable group**
- That constitutes a crime against humanity under:
  - Customary or conventional international law
  - General principles of law recognized by the community of nations
- Includes specific acts such as:
  - Murder
  - Extermination
  - Enslavement
  - Deportation
  - Imprisonment
  - Torture
  - Sexual violence
  - Persecution
  - Any other inhumane act or omission
- **Note**: The crime is not limited to breaches of domestic law at the time of commission.

#### 3. **War Crime**
- An act or omission committed **during an armed conflict** that constitutes a war crime under:
  - Customary international law
  - Conventional international law applicable to armed conflicts
- Again, the crime is recognized independently of whether domestic law was violated.

> **For greater certainty**: Crimes listed in:
> - Article 6 (genocide)
> - Article 7 (crimes against humanity)
> - Paragraph 2 of Article 8 (war crimes) of the Rome Statute
>  
> Were already crimes under **customary international law as of July 17, 1998**—and may have existed earlier.

> This confirms that these offences are not new or derivative—they are rooted in long-standing international norms.

> **Historical note**: The offence of crime against humanity was already recognized in customary international law **before**:
> - The London Agreement (August 8, 1945)
> - The January 1946 Proclamation by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers
