## **I. Background and Purpose**

The Act begins with a series of **"whereas" clauses** that establish foundational principles:

1. **Historical Relationships**: Acknowledges long-standing historical ties between the Whitecap Dakota Nation and the Crown through treaties, alliances, and peace and friendship agreements.
2. **Indigenous Identity**: Confirms the Whitecap Dakota Nation as an Indigenous people of Canada.

## **III. Constitutional and Legal Status of the Treaty**

- **Constitutional Recognition**: The Treaty is explicitly declared to be a **treaty within the meaning of Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- **Validity and Force of Law**: The Treaty is:
  - Approved,
  - Given effect,
  - Declared valid,
  - And has the **force of law**.
- **Binding Nature**: The Treaty is binding on **all persons and entities**, and must be relied upon in legal proceedings.
- **Hierarchy of Law**:
  - In case of conflict between the Treaty and **federal law**, the **Treaty prevails**.
  - In case of conflict between this Act and **federal law**, **this Act prevails**.

> This establishes the Treaty as a **supreme legal instrument** in matters related to the Whitecap Dakota Nation.

---

## **IV. Legal Entity Status of the Whitecap Dakota Nation**

- The Whitecap Dakota Nation is recognized as a **legal entity** with the **capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person**—subject to the terms of the Treaty.
- This means the Nation can:
  - Enter into contracts,
  - Own property,
  - Sue and be sued,
  - Exercise jurisdiction,
  - Make decisions independently.

> This is a major constitutional shift: the Nation is no longer treated as a "band" under the *Indian Act* but as a **sovereign, self-governing entity**.

---

## **V. Transition from Band to Nation Status**

- Upon coming into effect, **all rights, interests, assets, and obligations** of the **Whitecap Dakota First Nation as a band** (under the *Indian Act*) **vest in the Whitecap Dakota Nation**.
- This marks a formal **transition from band status to self-governing nation status**.

> This is a critical transformation in governance structure and legal identity.

---

## **VI. Authority to Make and Enforce Laws**

- The Whitecap Dakota Nation, through its **Whitecap Dakota Government**, has the **power to make laws** (Whitecap Dakota Laws).
- These laws are:
  - Binding on the Nation, its Government, and its institutions,
  - And may be relied upon by all persons and entities.
- The **Statutory Instruments Act does not apply** to Whitecap Dakota laws—meaning they are not subject to the same procedural or approval requirements as federal or provincial regulations.

> This grants the Nation full legislative autonomy in areas such as education, health, land use, and justice.

---

## **VII. Tax Treatment Agreement**

- The **Tax Treatment Agreement** (a separate but related document) comes into effect upon the application of **Section 11.16 of the Treaty**.
- Once in effect:
  - It is **approved, given effect, and declared valid**.
  - It has **the force of law** during its period of validity.
- However:
  - It **does not form part of the Treaty**,
  - Is **not a treaty or land claims agreement** under Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.

> This distinguishes the tax framework from the core self-government provisions—ensuring clarity and avoiding constitutional overreach.

---

## **VIII. Removal of Indian Act Application**

- The **Indian Act does not apply** to:
  - The Whitecap Dakota Nation,
  - The Whitecap Dakota Government,
  - Whitecap Dakota members,
  - Or Whitecap Dakota reserve lands.

> This removes the historical legal constraints imposed by the Indian Act, allowing the Nation to govern itself without federal oversight or regulation.

---

## **IX. Judicial Notice and Evidence**

- **Judicial notice must be taken** of:
  - The Treaty,
  - The Tax Treatment Agreement,
  - Any registered Whitecap Dakota law.
- A **copy of a Treaty or Agreement published by the King’s Printer** is **evidence of its existence and contents**.
- Similarly, a **registered Whitecap Dakota law** in the public registry is **presumed valid and binding** unless proven otherwise.

> This ensures that courts and legal bodies automatically recognize and respect the Nation’s laws and agreements.

---

## **X. Jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court of King’s Bench**

- The **Saskatchewan Court of King’s Bench** has jurisdiction to:
  - Issue **orders, injunctions, and declaratory relief** against a Whitecap Dakota decision-making body (e.g., an institution or council),
  - Conduct **judicial review** of decisions made by such bodies,
  - **Provided** that all internal review mechanisms under Whitecap Dakota laws have been exhausted.

> This balances **Indigenous self-governance** with **federal judicial oversight**, ensuring accountability without undermining sovereignty.

---

## **XI. Pre-Decision Notice Requirement (Procedural Safeguard)**

- Before any court or tribunal can decide on an issue involving:
  - The Treaty,
  - This Act, or
  - A Whitecap Dakota law,
  
  the party raising the issue **must serve written notice** to:
  - The **Attorney General of Canada** (for Treaty or this Act),
  - The **Whitecap Dakota Government** (for a Whitecap Dakota law).

- The notice must:
  - Be served at least **14 days** before the hearing (unless shortened by court),
  - Identify:
    - The proceeding,
    - The subject matter of the issue,
    - The specific points to be argued,
    - The day the issue will be argued.

- The recipient (e.g., the Government) has the **right to appear and participate** in the proceeding as a full party.

> This ensures **meaningful consultation and participation** by the Nation before legal challenges are decided—central to reconciliation and self-determination.

> **Note**: This does **not require an oral hearing** if not otherwise required.

---

## **XII. Retroactive Effect of Treaty Provisions**

- Despite the treaty being signed in 2023, **Chapter 33 and Schedule B** of the Treaty are **deemed to have effect as of
