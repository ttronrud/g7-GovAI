**Detailed Summary of the *Agricultural Marketing Programs Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Agricultural Marketing Programs Act* (AMP Act) is a Canadian federal law designed to **improve the financial stability and marketing opportunities** for eligible agricultural producers by providing **guaranteed repayment of advances** made to them. These advances help producers manage cash flow, especially during periods when they have no immediate revenue from the sale of their agricultural products. The Act establishes a framework through which the Government of Canada, via the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, can enter into **advance guarantee agreements** with designated administrators (typically producer organizations) and lenders to ensure that producers receive timely access to funds without bearing the full risk of non-repayment.
