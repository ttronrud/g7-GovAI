**Detailed Summary of the *Safe Food for Canadians Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Safe Food for Canadians Act* (SFCA) is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It establishes a robust regulatory framework to ensure the safety, integrity, and authenticity of food commodities throughout their lifecycle — from production and importation to distribution, sale, and labeling. The Act is designed to protect public health by preventing the sale, importation, or advertising of food that is false, misleading, or unsafe, and to ensure that food moves across provinces and borders only under strict regulatory oversight.

The Act builds upon existing food safety laws, particularly the *Food and Drugs Act* and the *Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act*, and introduces specific provisions related to **food safety, traceability, inspection, enforcement, and consumer protection**.

### **1. Definitions and Scope**

The Act begins with a detailed set of definitions that clarify key terms used throughout:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Food commodity** | Includes any food as defined in the *Food and Drugs Act*, animal/plant parts from which food can be derived, or anything prescribed by regulation. |
| **Establishment** | Any place (including conveyances like trucks or ships) where food is manufactured, prepared, stored, packaged, or labeled. |
| **Package** | Any inner or outer container or covering used with food (e.g., wrapping, band). |
| **Label** | Includes any legend, word, or mark applied to or accompanying a food product or package. |
| **Inspection mark / Grade name** | Official marks or designations (e.g., "Canada Organic" or "Inspected by CFIA") indicating compliance with safety or quality standards. |
| **Person** | As defined in the *Criminal Code* (includes individuals, corporations, organizations). |
| **Personal information** | As defined in the *Privacy Act*. |
| **Prescribed** | Means as set out in regulations. |
| **Sell** | Includes offering for sale, agreeing to sell, exposing for sale, or having food in possession for sale. Also includes distribution. |

### **2. Prohibited Activities**

Several core prohibitions are established to ensure food safety and prevent fraud:

#### **A. Prohibited Sales and Marketing**
- A person **cannot sell, advertise, or have in possession** a food commodity that:
  - Is **false, misleading, or deceptive** about its:
    - Character, quality, value, quantity, composition, merit, safety, origin,
    - Method of manufacture or preparation.
- A food commodity **labeled or packaged in violation of regulations** is treated as violating the law **even if the regulation is not explicitly stated**.
- **Advertising** in violation of regulations is treated the same way.

#### **B. Tampering and Threats**
- **Tampering** with food, its label, or package with intent to:
  - Render it injurious to human health; or
  - Cause a reasonable apprehension that it is harmful.
- **Threatening** to render food injurious to health is prohibited.
- **Communicating false or misleading information** with intent to cause fear that food has been tampered with is also prohibited.

#### **C. Interprovincial and International Movement of Food**
- A person **cannot send, convey, import, or export** a *prescribed food commodity* unless:
  1. They are **authorized** by a registration or licence under the Act;  
  2. The food **meets the requirements of the regulations**.

> This ensures that only authorized and compliant food moves between provinces or internationally.

#### **D. Unauthorized Use of Inspection Marks or Grade Names**
- A person **cannot**:
  - Apply or use an **inspection mark** or **grade name** without authorization.
  - Advertise or sell a product that bears such a mark or uses it in connection with the product.
- A product that **resembles** an inspection mark or grade name (and could be mistaken for it) is also prohibited.
- A person found in possession of such a product is **presumed to be acting with intent to advertise or sell** it — unless proven otherwise.

#### **E. Misrepresentation and Obstruction**
- **False or misleading statements** to officials (e.g., inspectors, applicants) or providing false information during licensing or registration applications is prohibited.
- **Obstructing** an inspector or official from performing duties is a violation.
- **Altering, destroying, or falsifying** documents required under the Act is prohibited.
- **Altering or using** a document issued under the Act is also prohibited.
- **Using a document that resembles an official one** (and could be mistaken for it) is illegal.

> These provisions protect the integrity of the regulatory system and ensure transparency.

### **3. Exceptions and Personal Use**

> **Subject to regulations**, provisions of the Act **do not apply** to a person carrying out an activity **solely for personal use** (e.g., a family cooking at home).

This exception helps avoid overregulation of private, non-commercial food use.

### **4. Registration and Licensing**

The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (Minister) has broad authority to issue **registrations and licences** for:

#### **A. Movement of Food**
- To **send or convey food** between provinces or to **import/export** a prescribed food commodity.
- Requires:
  - A **registration** (under para. 20(1)(a)) or
  - A **licence** (under para. 20(1)(a)) or both.
- These are **not transferable** and are subject to **prescribed conditions**.
- The Minister may impose **additional conditions** (e.g., hygiene standards, inspection requirements).

#### **B. Conducting Activities on Imported or Exported Food**
- To conduct activities (e.g., packaging, labeling, testing) on food that has been imported or is to be exported.
- Requires:
  - Registration or licence (or both).
- Again, **not transferable**, and subject to conditions.

#### **C. Establishment Registration**
- The Minister may register an **establishment** (e.g., a factory, warehouse) where:
  - Imported food is to be handled under inspection powers; or
  - A prescribed activity is to be conducted.
- The **holder of the registration** is the applicant.
- The registration is subject to conditions and **not transferable**.

> These mechanisms provide a formal, accountable system for managing food movement and processing across Canada.
