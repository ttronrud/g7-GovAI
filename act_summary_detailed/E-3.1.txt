**Detailed Summary of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994***  

The *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994* (commonly referred to as the "Suspension Act") is a temporary legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of Canada on **June 15, 1994**, and came into force on that date. Its primary purpose was to **suspend key provisions of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA)** during a specific period, effectively halting the process of electoral district boundary adjustments in Canada.

---

### **1. Official Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is formally titled:  
  **"The Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994"**  
  and may be cited as such.
- It serves as a **temporary suspension** of certain provisions of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*, which governs the process of redrawing federal electoral districts (ridings) in Canada to ensure equitable representation based on population changes.

---

### **2. Suspension of Key Provisions of the EBRA**
- **What is suspended**:  
  The Act suspends:
  - **Subsection 20(2)** of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*  
  - **Sections 21 to 28** of the EBRA  

  These provisions are central to the process of electoral boundaries readjustment, including:
  - The power of electoral boundaries commissions to make recommendations (under section 20(2))
  - The legal authority to approve or reject commission reports (sections 21–24)
  - Procedures for reviewing and finalizing boundary changes (sections 25–28)

> This suspension effectively **pauses the formal process of redrawing electoral boundaries**, including the ability of commissions to issue binding recommendations or for Parliament to act on them.

---

### **3. Automatic Termination of Suspension**
- The suspension will **cease automatically** if:
  - Parliament does **not pass new legislation** to address subsection 20(2) and sections 21 to 28 of the EBRA **by June 22, 1995**.

> In that case, the suspended provisions **re-enter into force**, subject to the terms of this Act. This means that the redistricting process would resume as if nothing had happened — with the existing legal framework applying again.

- This built-in mechanism ensures that the suspension is not permanent and provides a clear endpoint: if Parliament fails to act by June 22, 1995, the redistricting process resumes immediately.

---

### **4. Temporary Discharge of Electoral Boundaries Commissions**
- An electoral boundaries commission established under **section 3 of the EBRA** following the **1991 Canadian census** is **temporarily discharged** of its duties.
- The discharge begins on:
  - The **day the commission transmits its completed report** to the Chief Electoral Officer under subsection 20(1) of the EBRA, **or**
  - The **day this Act comes into force** (June 15, 1994), **whichever is later**.

> This means that even if the commission had completed its work, it would **not be required to submit its report or take further action** during the suspension period.

- The commission’s duties are **only restored** when the suspension ends — i.e., when subsection 20(2) and sections 21 to 28 of the EBRA cease to be suspended.

---

### **5. Application of EBRA Sections 21 to 24 Upon Resumption**
- If the suspension ends (by June 22, 1995, or later), then:
  - **Sections 21 to 24 of the EBRA apply** to the reports of the electoral boundaries commissions.
  - These sections govern how commission reports are reviewed, approved, or rejected by Parliament.
  - The application of these sections may be **modified according to the circumstances** (e.g., political context, population data, or public consultation).

> This ensures continuity and legal clarity: once redistricting resumes, the existing legal framework for reviewing commission reports is reinstated — but with flexibility to adapt to current conditions.

---

### **6. Repeal of the Original Suspension Act**
- The *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1992* (chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada, 1992) is **repealed** by this 1994 Act.

> This indicates that the 1992 version of the suspension law was outdated or superseded, and this 1994 Act provides the current, updated legal framework for the temporary suspension.

---

### **Key Implications and Context**
- **Why was this Act passed?**  
  The suspension was introduced during a period of political and constitutional uncertainty regarding the redistricting process. The 1991 electoral boundaries commission had completed its work, but Parliament had not yet acted on its recommendations. There was concern that the process could be delayed or politicized. The suspension provided a pause to allow for debate and potential reform.

- **Political and Constitutional Significance**:  
  This Act reflects a balance between procedural stability and democratic accountability. It respects the role of commissions while allowing Parliament to determine whether and how to proceed with redistricting.

- **Timeline Summary**:
  - **June 15, 1994**: Act comes into force.
  - **June 22, 1995**: Deadline for Parliament to pass new legislation.
    - If no action taken: suspension ends automatically.
    - If new legislation passed: suspension remains in place until such time as Parliament acts.

### **Conclusion**
The *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994* is a **temporary, time-bound legislative measure** designed to:
- Pause the redistricting process in Canada,
- Prevent the immediate implementation of electoral boundary changes after the 1991 census,
- Allow Parliament time to consider whether to continue, modify, or delay the process,
- Ensure that any future action on boundary adjustments is done under a clear and legally sound framework.

It demonstrates a pragmatic approach to electoral reform, balancing administrative efficiency with democratic oversight — and ultimately serving as a critical step in the evolution of Canada’s electoral governance system.

> **Note**: This Act was not a permanent reform. It was a transitional tool. After June 22, 1995, the redistricting process resumed under the standard provisions of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act*, with the 1991 commission’s report being reviewed under sections 21–24, as appropriate.
