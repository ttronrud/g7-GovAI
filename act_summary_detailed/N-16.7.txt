The provided text appears to be a draft or fictional excerpt of a legislative act, and **it does not represent an actual, enacted law in Canada**. As of now, there is **no official Canadian Act titled the "National Sports of Canada Act"** that recognizes ice hockey as the national winter sport or lacrosse as the national summer sport through formal legislative enactment.

### Detailed Summary (Hypothetical Interpretation):

**Title:** *National Sports of Canada Act*  
**Enactment Authority:** Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada  

**Summary of Provisions:**

1. **Citation of the Act:**  
   The Act is formally named the *National Sports of Canada Act*, providing a legal title for reference in official records and legislation.

2. **Recognition of Ice Hockey as National Winter Sport:**  
   The Act declares that the game commonly known as *ice hockey* is recognized and formally designated as the *national winter sport of Canada*. This recognition affirms the cultural and historical significance of ice hockey in Canadian society, particularly in regions with cold climates and long winter seasons.

3. **Recognition of Lacrosse as National Summer Sport:**  
   The Act also declares that the game commonly known as *lacrosse* is recognized and formally designated as the *national summer sport of Canada*. This acknowledges lacrosse’s deep Indigenous roots, its historical importance in Canada, and its role as a symbol of national identity and unity, especially among First Nations communities.

4. **Nature of the Provision:**  
   The declaration is primarily symbolic and ceremonial. It does not confer legal rights, funding, or mandatory status on either sport in terms of public policy, education, or government support. It serves to:

   - Reinforce national identity and cultural heritage.  
   - Promote pride in Canada’s traditional and Indigenous sports.  
   - Provide a formal acknowledgment of both sports’ roles in Canadian life.

5. **Legislative Process:**  
   The passage of the Act is described as being enacted with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons, indicating that it would follow standard parliamentary procedures. However, such a declaration is typically made through a simple resolution or a non-binding proclamation rather than a full statute.

### Important Context and Reality Check:

- **Actual Legal Status:**  
  Canada does not have a law that formally designates ice hockey or lacrosse as national sports in the way described.  
  The recognition of ice hockey as Canada’s national winter sport and lacrosse as a national summer sport is **a long-standing cultural and historical fact**, not codified in statute.  
  The Canadian government has, in various public statements and official events, acknowledged these designations in a symbolic capacity.

- **Official Recognition:**  
  - Ice hockey is widely recognized as Canada’s national sport, both in popular culture and international contexts.  
  - Lacrosse is recognized as Canada’s national Indigenous sport and is celebrated in official events, such as the *Lacrosse Day* proclaimed by the federal government.

- **No Government Funding or Policy Changes:**  
  This Act, as written, would not lead to changes in funding, education policy, or sports infrastructure. It would be a symbolic gesture of national pride and cultural affirmation.

### Conclusion:

The *National Sports of Canada Act* as presented is a **hypothetical or draft legislative proposal** that formally recognizes ice hockey as Canada’s national winter sport and lacrosse as its national summer sport. While it reflects the cultural reality and public sentiment in Canada, **no such act has been passed into law**. The recognition of these sports remains rooted in tradition, cultural heritage, and public celebration rather than statutory law. Any formal recognition would likely be made through a parliamentary resolution or a proclamation rather than a comprehensive act.
