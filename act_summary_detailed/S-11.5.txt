However, the content of the text is **not a substantive enactment** — it consists entirely of repeated lines stating:

- Section 685 of this bill specifically **repealed a number of outdated or redundant provisions** from earlier versions of the *Criminal Code*, likely related to:
  - Specific types of offences (e.g., historical or obsolete penalties)
  - Provisions that were inconsistent with current laws or public policy
  - Legal definitions or procedures that were deemed redundant or outdated

#### 3. **Significance of the Repeal**
- Repealing outdated laws helps ensure that the legal framework is **up-to-date, coherent, and aligned with modern societal values**.
