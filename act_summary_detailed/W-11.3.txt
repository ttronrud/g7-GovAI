**Detailed Summary of the *Department for Women and Gender Equality Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Department for Women and Gender Equality Act* is a foundational piece of legislation introduced by the Government of Canada to formally establish a dedicated federal department focused on advancing gender equality and addressing systemic inequalities faced by women, gender-diverse individuals, and those affected by intersecting identity factors. This Act builds upon Canada’s constitutional, human rights, and international obligations to promote equality without discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.

It replaces and modernizes the former Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women, by creating a new, more comprehensive and inclusive federal department — the **Department for Women and Gender Equality** — under a Minister for Women and Gender Equality.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Legislative Basis and Rationale**

The Act is grounded in several key legal and ethical principles:

- **Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms** guarantees equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination based on sex.
- The **Canadian Human Rights Act** affirms that all individuals have the right to live fulfilling lives and have their needs accommodated without being hindered by discriminatory practices based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.
- The Government recognizes **systemic and historical inequalities** faced by women and girls, as well as gender-diverse people and individuals of diverse sexual orientations.
- Canada’s ratification of the **United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)** commits the state to eliminating all forms of sex-based discrimination.
- Canada has also ratified the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**, which affirms that Indigenous individuals, regardless of sex, are entitled to full rights and freedoms.
- The Government supports **United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 32/2**, which emphasizes protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

These foundational commitments underscore the necessity of a dedicated, robust, and inclusive department to advance gender equality across all sectors of Canadian life.

#### **2. Creation of the Department for Women and Gender Equality**

- A new federal department is established: the **Department for Women and Gender Equality**.
- The department operates under the leadership of the **Minister for Women and Gender Equality**, who is appointed by commission under the Great Seal of Canada.
- The Minister holds office at the pleasure of the Governor in Council (i.e., the Cabinet) and has full responsibility for managing and directing the department’s operations.

> **Note:** This structure ensures that the department is independent in its mandate and accountable to Parliament through the Ministerial and Cabinet processes.

---

#### **3. Deputy Minister Role**

- The Governor in Council may appoint a **Deputy Minister for Women and Gender Equality**.
- The Deputy Minister serves during pleasure and acts as the deputy head of the department, supporting the Minister in day-to-day management and policy implementation.

---

#### **4. Scope of Powers, Duties, and Functions**

The Minister has broad authority over all matters within Parliament’s jurisdiction that relate to women and gender equality — **unless otherwise assigned to another department**.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Advancing **social, economic, and political equality** for individuals based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression.
- Promoting a **deeper understanding of intersectionality**, recognizing how sex and gender interact with other identity factors such as:
  - Race
  - National and ethnic origin
  - Indigenous origin or identity
  - Age
  - Sexual orientation
  - Socio-economic status
  - Place of residence
  - Disability

This intersectional approach is critical in addressing the unique challenges faced by marginalized groups, such as Indigenous women, racialized women, LGBTQ2S+ people, and persons with disabilities.

---

#### **5. Policy Development and Implementation**

The Minister is empowered to:

- **Initiate, recommend, coordinate, implement, and promote** policies and programs aimed at advancing gender equality.
- **Undertake or promote research** to inform evidence-based policy development and assess the effectiveness of current initiatives.
- **Make grants and contributions** to support programs, subject to approval by the Treasury Board (which sets terms and conditions for funding).

This enables the department to provide targeted financial support to community organizations, research institutions, and provincial partners.

---

#### **6. Interprovincial and Inter-agency Collaboration**

- The Minister may enter into **agreements with provincial governments or provincial agencies** to coordinate policies and programs related to women and gender equality.
- These agreements facilitate collaboration, ensure consistency in policy approaches, and help align provincial and federal efforts to address gender-based issues.

---

#### **7. Advisory Committees**

- The Minister may establish **advisory and other committees** to provide expert input, support decision-making, and ensure diverse perspectives are included in policy design.
- The Governor in Council has the authority to determine:
  - The membership of these committees
  - Their duties and functions
  - Their operational procedures

- Members of these committees are entitled to:
  - Be reimbursed for **travel, living, and other expenses** incurred while performing their duties.
  - Reimbursement is governed by **Treasury Board directives**, ensuring transparency and consistency.

---

#### **8. Transition Provisions (Effective Upon Coming Into Force)**

To ensure continuity and avoid disruption in operations:

- Any individual who **held the office of Minister of Status of Women or Co-ordinator, Status of Women** immediately before the Act came into force is **deemed to have been appointed** under this Act as:
  - The **Minister for Women and Gender Equality**, or
  - The **Deputy Minister for Women and Gender Equality**, respectively.

- This provision ensures that existing staff and leadership are seamlessly transitioned into the new department without loss of status or role.

- **Status of employment** is defined broadly to include whether a person holds a managerial or confidential position — ensuring that all staff are protected and recognized in their roles.

---

#### **9. Legal Reference and Contractual Updates**

- All references in contracts, instruments, or documents to:
  - The “Minister of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada designated to co-ordinate policy with respect to the status of women”
  - Or the “Minister of Status of Women”

  are **automatically read as references to the Minister for Women and Gender Equality**, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

> This ensures legal and administrative consistency and avoids confusion in existing agreements.

---

#### **10. Financial Continuity**

- Any **funding previously appropriated** for the Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women in the fiscal year when the Act comes into force, that remains unspent on that day, is **deemed to be appropriated to the Department for Women and Gender Equality**.

> This ensures financial continuity and avoids gaps in program funding during the transition period.

### **Significance and Impact**

The *Department for Women and Gender Equality Act* represents a significant step forward in Canada’s commitment to:

- **Gender equality** as a core national priority.
- **Inclusivity** by explicitly recognizing the rights of gender-diverse individuals and those with intersecting identities.
- **Systemic change** through policy coordination, research, and targeted funding.
- **Accountability and transparency** through clear governance structures and oversight mechanisms.

It reflects a shift from a narrow, gender-based focus on women alone to a broader, intersectional understanding of gender equality that includes sexual orientation, gender identity, and the diverse experiences of all Canadians.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Department for Women and Gender Equality Act* establishes a modern, inclusive, and legally grounded federal institution dedicated to advancing equality for all Canadians — particularly women, gender-diverse individuals, and those facing overlapping forms of discrimination. By embedding human rights, international obligations, and intersectional analysis into its mandate, the Act strengthens Canada’s democratic values and supports the creation of a more equitable, just, and participatory society.

It is not only a structural reform but also a symbolic affirmation of the Government of Canada’s commitment to gender equity as a fundamental principle of justice and inclusion.
