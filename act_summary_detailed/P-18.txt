The provided text consists entirely of repeated citations indicating that a particular statute or provision has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by legislative action.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeated Repeal Notices**: The text lists multiple instances of repeal, all referencing:
  - **"Repealed, 2011, c. 25, s. 37"** — This means the provision was officially repealed by **Bill 25, 2011**, under **Section 37** of that act.
  - **"Repealed, R.S., 1985, c. 2 (3rd Supp.), s. 7"** — This indicates a prior repeal from the **Revised Statutes of 1985**, specifically the third supplementary volume, Chapter 2, Section 7.

- **Frequency of Repeal References**: The phrase "Repealed, 2011, c. 25, s. 37" appears **26 times**, and "Repealed, R.S., 1985, c. 2 (3rd Supp.), s. 7" appears once. This repetition suggests either:
  - A formatting or technical error in the original document (e.g., a list of multiple sections or provisions that were all repealed),
  - Or that the same repealed provision was cited in multiple places within a legal database or index.

- **Legal Significance of Repeal**:
  - A repeal means that the law or section of law previously in force is **no longer valid**.
  - Repealed provisions are **not enforceable**, and any actions or decisions based on them are **legally invalid**.
  - Repeals are typically enacted to modernize legislation, correct errors, or align laws with current policy.

- **Implication for the Original Act**:
  - Since the provided text only contains **repeal notices** and no actual content of the original law (such as definitions, penalties, or obligations), **there is no detailed summary of the original act**.
  - The summary cannot include substantive content (e.g., purpose, scope, rights, duties) because the original text has been removed by law.

### Conclusion:

**There is no detailed summary of an act in the provided text**, because the entire content consists of **repeal notices** — indicating that the law in question has been officially canceled.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> The provided text does not contain the actual provisions or content of a legislative act. Instead, it repeatedly cites that a specific section or law has been **repealed** by the *Statutes of Ontario, 2011, Chapter 25, Section 37*, and previously by *Revised Statutes, 1985, Chapter 2 (3rd Supp.), Section 7*. As such, **the original act or provision is no longer in force** and cannot be summarized in detail due to its legal repeal. Any prior legal effect or content is now obsolete.

If you have the original act or section that was repealed, I can provide a detailed summary of that.
