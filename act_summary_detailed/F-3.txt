### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeated Repeals**: The phrase "[Repealed, 2009, c. 15, s. 14]" appears multiple times. This means that the specific legal provision or section in question was **repealed (cancelled or abolished)** by **Bill 15, 2009**, under **Section 14** of that bill.

  - This repealing action was enacted in 2009.

- **Additional Repeals**:

  - Another refers to *s. 25* of the same 1985 supplement.
