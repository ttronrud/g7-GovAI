**Detailed Summary of the *Preserving Provincial Representation in the House of Commons Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Preserving Provincial Representation in the House of Commons Act* is a constitutional and legislative measure introduced to **preserve the number of seats** that certain provinces had in the House of Commons during the **43rd Parliament (2015–2019)**, even if subsequent electoral boundary adjustments result in a lower number of seats under the current calculation method.

This Act is designed to **prevent a reduction in provincial representation** below what existed in the 43rd Parliament, ensuring that provinces do not lose their historical seat count due to changes in population distribution or recalculations under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act (EBRA)*. It operates by modifying a constitutional rule and establishing a mechanism to restore or maintain provincial seat numbers when a new calculation results in fewer seats.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Replacement of Rule 2 of Section 51(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867**

- **Original Rule 2** (under Section 51(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867) governed how the number of seats in the House of Commons is assigned to provinces based on population.
- The Act **replaces Rule 2** with a new rule that ensures:
  
  > *If the number of members assigned to a province by the application of Rule 1 and Section 51A is less than the total number assigned to that province during the 43rd Parliament, then the number of members shall be increased to match the number of seats assigned during that Parliament.*

- **Purpose**: This prevents any province from having fewer seats than it had in the 43rd Parliament (which was from 2015 to 2019), even if population shifts or new boundary calculations suggest otherwise.

- **Key Impact**:  
  This is a **constitutional safeguard** that protects provincial representation from being reduced below historical levels. It reflects a political and democratic concern about equitable representation across provinces, particularly in regions that may have experienced population changes but still maintain significant historical or cultural significance.

#### **2. Reference to Section 2 of the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982**

- The Act includes a **deeming clause**:  
  > *"A reference to the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 is deemed to include a reference to section 2."*

- **Section 2** of the Constitution Act, 1867 (now part of the *Constitution Act, 1867*) establishes the **principle of equal representation** and sets the framework for how seats are apportioned among provinces.

- **Purpose**: This ensures that the new rule is interpreted within the broader constitutional context, particularly in relation to the principle of fair representation and the rights of provinces to have a fair share of parliamentary representation.

---

#### **3. Definitions**

- **"Act"** = The *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA), which governs the process of redrawing electoral boundaries.
- **"Old calculation"** = The calculation of seat allocation for each province done by the Chief Electoral Officer under subsection 14(1) of the EBRA, as published in the *Canada Gazette* on **October 16, 2021**. This serves as the baseline for comparison.

> This definition is critical because it establishes a **specific, fixed point in time** (the 2021 calculation) against which future seat allocations are measured.

- **General meaning**: Words and expressions used in this section and Section 5 are given the same meaning as in the EBRA, ensuring consistency in interpretation.

---

#### **4. Requirement for a New Seat Calculation**

- **As soon as feasible after the Act comes into force**, the **Chief Electoral Officer (CEO)** must:
  - Recalculate the number of seats for each province under:
    - Section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867,
    - The amended rules (specifically the new Rule 2),
    - And the provisions of the EBRA.
  - Publish a **statement in the Canada Gazette** setting out the results of this new calculation.

> This ensures that the updated seat allocation reflects both constitutional principles and the most recent population data — while still respecting the 43rd Parliament’s seat count as a floor.

---

#### **5. Consequences of a Different Seat Count**

If the new calculation results in a **different number of seats** for a province than the "old calculation" (i.e., the 2021 baseline):

- **Any report** prepared under subsection 14(2) of the EBRA **based on the old calculation** becomes **null and void**.
- **Any actions** taken under Sections 19 to 23 of the EBRA (which govern the commission’s work, boundary reviews, and implementation) **based on the old calculation** are also **invalid**.

> This ensures that all downstream decisions (like boundary commissions, reports, and representation orders) are based on the **updated, constitutionally protected calculation**.

- The **boundary commission** established under Section 3 of the EBRA (for the most recent decennial census) **must prepare a new report** under subsection 14(2) of the EBRA, based on the new calculation.

- The **duties and functions** of the commission under Sections 19 to 23 are to be carried out **based on this new report**.

- The **10-month period** (as specified in subsection 20(1) of the EBRA) for completing the process **begins on the day the new statement is published in the Canada Gazette**.

> This effectively resets the timeline for the redistricting process for affected provinces.

---

#### **6. Handling of Pre-Existing Representation Orders**

##### **Case A: No Representation Order Was Prepared Before the Act Came Into Force**

- If, **before the Act came into effect**, **no representation order** had been prepared and transmitted under subsection 24(1) of the EBRA (based on the old calculation), then:

  → The CEO must **immediately** prepare and transmit a **representation order** for **all provinces except the one affected** (i.e., the province where the seat count dropped below the 43rd Parliament level).

> This ensures that even if no prior order existed, the process of setting seat numbers is not delayed — and that all provinces maintain a stable, constitutionally valid structure.

##### **Case B: A Representation Order Was Already Prepared**

- If a representation order **was already prepared and transmitted** under the old calculation, then:

  → That order and any **proclamation declaring it in force** are **nullified only for the province** where the seat count fell below the 43rd Parliament level.

> This is a **targeted nullification** — the order remains valid for other provinces, preserving stability in most areas while protecting the affected province’s representation.

---

#### **7. Preparation and Publication of New Representation Orders**

- In both cases (where a prior order existed or not), a **new representation order** must be:
  - Prepared under subsection 24(1) of the EBRA,
  - And a **proclamation** must be made under subsection 25(1) of the EBRA,
  - For the **province where seat count fell below the 43rd Parliament level**, based on the new calculation.

> This ensures that the constitutional floor is met and that the process is completed properly.

---

#### **8. Continuity of the 2014 Representation Order**

- The **representation order annexed to the Proclamation Declaring the Representation Order to be in Force Effective on the First Dissolution of Parliament that Occurs after May 1, 2014**, registered as **SI/2013-102**, continues to apply **in respect of the affected province** until the new representation order (prepared under subsection 5) becomes effective.

> This provides **temporal stability** during the transition period — preventing a sudden or disruptive change in representation.

---

#### **9. Administrative Consolidation Requirement**

- When the **new representation order and proclamation** are published in the *Canada Gazette* under Section 26 of the EBRA, the CEO must:

  → Publish an **administrative consolidation** on their official website.

  → This consolidation includes:
    - The **new representation order** for the affected province,
    - And the **portion of the old representation order** (from the 2014 order or the prior one) that applies to **all other provinces**.

  → The consolidation must clearly state:
    - For **each province**, the **day on which the applicable representation order came into force**.

> This ensures **transparency, clarity, and accessibility** for the public, legislators, and electoral bodies.
