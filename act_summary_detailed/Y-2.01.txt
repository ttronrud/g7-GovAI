### **Detailed Summary of the Yukon Act**

The **Yukon Act** is a foundational piece of legislation that establishes the constitutional and operational framework for the self-governance of the Yukon Territory within Canada. It reflects the principle of responsible government and provides a legal basis for the territorial government to exercise legislative, executive, and fiscal powers—subject to the broader constitutional structure of Canada.

This summary provides a comprehensive, organized breakdown of the key provisions, purposes, and implications of the Act.
