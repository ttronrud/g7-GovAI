**Detailed Summary of the *Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act* (commonly referred to as the "Teleglobe Act") was enacted in 1987 as part of a broader government initiative to privatize key telecommunications assets in Canada. The Act governs the structural reorganization of **Teleglobe Canada**, a major federal-owned telecommunications company, into a new, independent corporation — **TH(1987)** — and outlines the legal, financial, regulatory, and administrative mechanisms for this transition. It also provides transitional protections for employees, ensures continuity of operations, and facilitates the eventual divestiture of Teleglobe's assets through public or private sale.

The Act is notable for being a foundational piece of legislation in Canada’s telecommunications privatization history and for setting important precedents in corporate reorganization, asset transfer, and regulatory compliance.

### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Title**: The Act is cited as the *Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act*.
- **Key Definitions**:
  - **Commission**: Refers to the *Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)* — the regulatory body overseeing telecommunications.
  - **Control**: Defined broadly to include direct or indirect ownership, through trusts, agreements, or corporate structures, emphasizing *de facto* control.
  - **New Corporation**: The newly incorporated entity formed under Section 4, which succeeds Teleglobe.
  - **Person**: Includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, governments, trustees, executors, and legal representatives.
  - **Voting Share**: Includes shares with voting rights, convertible securities, and exercisable options or rights to acquire shares.
  - **General Meaning**: Words and expressions have the same meaning as in the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)* unless otherwise specified. If there's a conflict, this Act prevails.

### **2. Incorporation of the New Corporation**

- The **Minister of State (Privatization)** (or a designated member of the Queen’s Privy Council) may submit **articles of incorporation** for the new corporation to the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the Cabinet).
- Within **10 days** of approval, **Teleglobe** must send the approved articles and required supporting documents to the **CRTC Director** to effect incorporation under the CBCA.
- Teleglobe will **subscribe for and be issued authorized shares** of the new corporation in exchange for:
  - Securities of the new corporation
  - Assumption of Teleglobe’s obligations and liabilities

> This establishes a formal transfer of ownership and liabilities from Teleglobe to the new entity.

---

### **3. Transfer of Assets and Liabilities (Section 4(4))**

- All **property, rights, and interests** of Her Majesty in right of Canada that were held by Teleglobe **on the coming into force of the Act** are **vested in Teleglobe**.
- Similarly, all **obligations and liabilities** of Her Majesty incurred by Teleglobe and existing at that time are also **vested in Teleglobe**.

> This is a critical legal mechanism to ensure that the federal government retains a clear and enforceable interest in the transferred assets during the transition.

---

### **4. Tax Treatment (Income Tax Act and Related Rules)**

To prevent tax distortions due to the reorganization:

- For **tax purposes**, the property vested in Teleglobe is **deemed to have been owned by Teleglobe throughout the period** it was owned by Her Majesty.
- The **cost amount** of the property:
  - For **non-depreciable property**: is deemed to be the cost amount to Her Majesty **before** vesting.
  - For **depreciable property**: the **adjusted cost base** and **cost amount** are deemed to be those that would reasonably be attributed to Her Majesty prior to vesting.

> This ensures continuity of capital cost accounting and avoids double taxation or loss of depreciation benefits.

- **Exemptions**:
  - **Section 45 and subsection 108(1) of the Financial Administration Act** do **not apply** to the vested property or liabilities.
  - **Section 134 of the Financial Administration Act** does **not apply** to securities issued to Teleglobe.

> This protects Teleglobe from administrative or financial reporting burdens related to the transfer.

- **Governor in Council may exempt** certain property, rights, obligations, or liabilities from the vesting provisions (subject to policy and oversight).

---

### **5. Public Interest and Corporate Status**

- The **works of the new corporation** are declared to be **"works for the general advantage of Canada"** — a designation that affirms its public service character and may influence regulatory treatment and funding considerations.
- The **head office** of the new corporation is located in the **Montreal Urban Community** — a strategic location reflecting the company’s historical presence in Quebec.

> These provisions reinforce the public utility and national importance of the new entity.

---

### **6. Disposal and Divestiture of Shares**

- The **Minister** may direct Teleglobe to **sell or otherwise dispose** of its securities in the new corporation, subject to **Governor in Council approval**.
- Upon receiving such a direction, Teleglobe is **authorized to sell or dispose** of the shares in accordance with the direction.
- The **Minister is authorized to acquire shares** from Teleglobe, and any such shares will be held **in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> This enables the government to retain a strategic stake in the new corporation during the transition and to eventually divest or restructure ownership.

> **Note**: The reference to "Teleglobe" includes **"TH(1987)"**, a renamed entity that takes over the operations.

---

### **7. Name Change and Dissolution**

- The **name of Teleglobe is changed to TH(1987)**.
- Upon coming into force, all references to "Teleglobe" in **Sections 19 and 26** are interpreted to include references to **TH(1987)**.
- **TH(1987) is dissolved** — meaning it ceases to exist as a legal entity.
- The **Minister** may perform all acts necessary for dissolution, including administrative and legal procedures.
- The **Minister, after consulting the President of the Treasury Board**, must make **adjustments to Canada’s accounts** to reflect any financial transactions resulting from this Act.

> This marks the formal end of the original Teleglobe entity and the beginning of a new, independent corporate structure.
