**Detailed Summary of the *Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act* (the "Act") is a Canadian statute enacted to protect public safety, environmental integrity, and critical infrastructure by regulating maritime hazards arising from wrecks, abandoned vessels, and hazardous conditions. It establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the management, reporting, removal, and liability associated with vessels that pose risks to navigation, ecosystems, or communities. The Act aligns closely with international standards, particularly the **Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks, 2007 (Wreck Removal Convention)**, and strengthens Canada’s regulatory authority over maritime safety and environmental protection.

## **Part 1: Application of the Wreck Removal Convention**

This section applies the **Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks, 2007** to Canadian waters and vessels.

### **Scope of Application**  
The Wreck Removal Convention applies to:
- Vessels in **Canadian waters** or the **exclusive economic zone (EEZ)** of Canada.
- **Canadian vessels**, wherever located.
- **Wrecks** that:
  - Are located in the **Convention area** of a State Party to the Convention.
  - Result from a **maritime casualty** (accident or incident).

> The "Convention area" is interpreted to include **Canada** when Canada is the affected State.

### **Reporting Obligations (Article 5 of the Convention)**  
- If a vessel (other than one registered in a non-Party state in Canada’s EEZ) is involved in a maritime casualty resulting in a wreck:
  - The **master or operator** must immediately report to a designated **marine communications and traffic services officer** (as defined in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*).
  - Alternatively, if designated by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, the report must go to that person.
  - If one party complies, the other is not required to report.

> This ensures timely notification of maritime incidents.

### **Marking of Wrecks (Article 5, Convention)**  
- The **owner** of a vessel involved in a maritime casualty that results in a **hazardous wreck** must:
  - Take **all reasonable steps without delay** to mark the wreck with **internationally recognized buoyage markings** (standardized maritime signals).

> This helps prevent navigational accidents.

### **Ministerial Direction to Mark or Remove Wrecks**  
If the **Minister
