### **Detailed Summary of the Service Fees Act**

The **Service Fees Act** is a comprehensive legislative framework in Canada designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in the setting and administration of **federal service fees**. It establishes clear rules governing how fees are created, reviewed, adjusted, and reported, with a strong emphasis on public participation, performance accountability, and financial oversight.

Below is a detailed and structured summary of the key provisions of the Act:

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**
- The Act applies to **federal entities** (departments, divisions, or corporations) that impose **fees** for services, use of facilities, licenses, products, or regulatory processes.
- It aims to ensure that fees are **fair, transparent, and accountable**, and that they are aligned with public interest and performance standards.
- The Act does **not apply** to certain types of fees:
  - Fees under the **Access to Information Act** or **Privacy Act**.
  - Fees paid **only by or on behalf of a minister or federal entity**.
  - Fees fixed **by contract** (unless specific conditions are met).
  - Fees set via **auctions or market-based mechanisms** where the fee amount is outside the control of the fee-setting body.
  - Fees established through **regulations published in Part I of the Canada Gazette before being made**.
  - Fees requiring **consultation under another Act of Parliament**.

> This exclusion ensures that the Act does not interfere with existing, well-regulated, or market-driven fee structures.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Federal Entity** | A department listed in Schedule I of the Financial Administration Act; a division/branch in Schedule I.1; or a corporation in Schedule II. |
| **Fee** | Any amount charged for: provision of a service, use of a facility, granting of a license/permit, provision of a product, or a regulatory process. |
| **Fiscal Year** | April 1 to March 31 of the following year. |
| **Responsible Authority** | The appropriate Minister (as defined in the Financial Administration Act), or if designated, the chief executive officer or deputy head of the federal entity. |

> The responsible authority has primary responsibility for managing the fee lifecycle — from proposal to review and adjustment.

---

## **3. Performance Standards**
- Every fee **must have a performance standard** established in accordance with **Treasury Board policies or directives**.
- A performance standard defines **what level of service, efficiency, or outcome** the fee is intended to achieve.
- Before **amending** a performance standard, the responsible authority must:
  - Consult interested persons and organizations.
  - Ensure the standard is **accessible to the public**.
- If the performance standard is **not met in a fiscal year**, the responsible authority must **remit** a portion of the fee to affected individuals **before July 1 of the following fiscal year**.
- The remission decision must follow **Treasury Board policies** and is not arbitrary.

> ⚠️ *Note:* A performance standard is **not a statutory instrument** under the Statutory Instruments Act — it is a policy-based benchmark, not a formal regulation.

---

## **4. Fee Proposal and Public Consultation**
The responsible authority must develop a **fee proposal** containing:
- The **amount** of the fee or **method for determining** it (e.g., fixed or indexed).
- **When** and **under what circumstances** the fee will be payable.
- The **rationale** for the fee.
- The **factors considered** in setting the fee.
- Any **performance standard** that will apply.

### Public Consultation Requirements:
- The proposal must be **publicly accessible**.
- The responsible authority must:
  - Invite **interested persons and organizations** to submit written representations.
  - Set a **deadline** for submissions.
  - Provide information on **complaint rights** (within 10 days after the deadline).
  - Reply to all representations within **30 days** of the deadline.

### Complaint Process:
- Within **10 days** of the deadline, any person or organization may submit a **written complaint** against the responsible authority’s reply.
- The responsible authority must establish a **review panel within 30 days** of the deadline.
- The panel consists of:
  - One member selected by the responsible authority.
  - One member selected by all complainants.
  - One member selected jointly by the first two.
- If a selection is not made in time, the responsible authority must **appoint a member as soon as feasible**.
- The panel must issue a **report within 90 days** of establishment.
- Recommendations from the panel are **not binding**, but serve as a formal review mechanism.

> The responsible authority may **extend the 90-day timeline by up to 30 days** at the request of the panel.

---

## **5. Parliamentary Review and Transparency**
- The responsible authority must **table the following materials in both Houses of Parliament**:
  1. The fee proposal.
  2. A summary of public consultations.
  3. If a review panel was formed: the panel’s report and a summary of actions taken.

> These materials are **permanently referred** to the **relevant parliamentary committee** overseeing the federal entity.

- The committee may:
  - Review the materials.
  - Submit a **report with recommendations** on the fee proposal.
- If the committee **fails to submit a report within 20 sitting days**, it is **deemed to have approved** the fee proposal.

> This ensures that fees are subject to **parliamentary scrutiny** and accountability.

---

## **6. Fee Adjustment Mechanism (Section 17)**
Fees are adjusted **annually** based on inflation, unless exempted.

### Adjustment Rule:
- A fee is adjusted each fiscal year by the **percentage change** in the **April All-items Consumer Price Index (CPI)** for Canada (as published by Statistics Canada under the Statistics Act), **for the previous fiscal year**.
- The adjustment applies **on the anniversary date** selected by the responsible authority **before the first adjustment**.

### Exceptions:
- If the fee is **fixed in that fiscal year before the adjustment date**, it is not adjusted.
- If the CPI change is **less than 1%**, no adjustment occurs.
- If the change is less than 1%, it is **carried forward** to the next fiscal year. If the cumulative change remains below 1%, the fee is **not adjusted** in that year either.

> This ensures fees keep pace with inflation while avoiding unnecessary adjustments.

### Flexibility:
- The responsible authority may **round down** the fee after adjustment (in accordance with Treasury Board policies).
- The anniversary date may be **changed** at any time, subject to Treasury Board policy.

> ⚠️ *Note:* Section 17 does **not limit** any power granted by **Acts of Parliament** to fix fees — it only governs annual adjustments.

---

## **7. Annual Reporting Requirements (Section 20)**
Each fiscal year, the responsible authority must table a **detailed annual report** before each House of Parliament, including:
- List of fees payable in the prior fiscal year.
- Authorities under which they were fixed.
- Revenue collected.
- Costs incurred.
- Compliance with performance standards.
- Any remissions made under Section 7.
- Fees scheduled to be adjusted under Section 17 (with adjustment date and new amount).
- Any other information required by Treasury Board policy.

> The report is **permanently referred** to the same parliamentary committee that reviewed the proposal.

---

## **8. President of the Treasury Board’s Annual Report (Section 21)**
No later than **March 31** of each fiscal year, the President of the Treasury Board must make publicly accessible a report that includes:
- A **consolidated summary** of all tabled fee reports.
- A list of **regulatory amendments** made under Section 22.
- A list of **approvals granted** under the Act during the year.

> This ensures **transparency and accountability** at the highest level of federal financial governance.

---

## **9. Low-Materiality Fees (Exemption Clause)**
- Certain fees may be designated as **low-materiality fees**, meaning they are **exempt** from most of the Act’s requirements (Sections 3 to 18).
- The **Treasury Board** may make regulations defining:
  - Which fees are low-materiality.
  - Criteria for determining whether a fee is low-materiality.
  - When such fees cease to be low-materiality.
  - When the Act applies or ceases to apply.
  - Factors the President of the Treasury Board must consider when making designations.

> This allows for **practical exemptions** for minor, low-impact fees (e.g., small administrative charges) without undermining the Act’s core principles.

> The regulations may be **amended** by the President of the Treasury Board, based on established factors.

---

## **10. Transitional Provisions**
- For fees that were **payable on the day the Act came into force** but **lacked a performance standard**:
  - The responsible authority must establish a performance standard **within one year** of that day.
- Once the standard is established, **Sections 5 to 8** (which cover performance standards, consultation, and remission) **apply** to the fee.

> This ensures **no fee is left without accountability** at the start of the Act’s operation.
