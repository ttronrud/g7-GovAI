**Detailed Summary of the *Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act* (CFPOA) is a Canadian federal statute enacted to prevent and criminalize acts of bribery and corruption involving foreign public officials in the context of international business transactions. It aligns Canada with international anti-corruption standards, particularly the **United Nations Convention against Corruption** and the **Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions** (the "Convention").

The Act establishes clear legal obligations for Canadian businesses and individuals to avoid offering, promising, or giving benefits to foreign public officials in exchange for favorable decisions or actions by those officials — whether in government, judicial, or administrative roles abroad.

### **2. Prohibition of Bribery (Section 3)**

#### **Offence**:
Every person commits an **indictable offence** if they:
- In order to **obtain or retain an advantage** in the course of business,
- **Directly or indirectly** give, offer, or agree to give or offer:
  - A **loan, reward, advantage, or benefit** of any kind,
- To a **foreign public official** or to **any person for the benefit of a foreign public official**,  
**as consideration for**:
  - An act or omission by the official in connection with their duties; **or**
  - To induce the official to use their position to influence decisions or actions of the foreign state or international organization.

#### **Penalty**:
- Imprisonment for a term of **up to 14 years**.

#### **Exemptions (No Offence if)**:
A person is **not guilty** of an offence under this section if:
1. The loan, reward, advantage, or benefit:
   - Is **permitted or required** under the laws of the foreign state or international organization where the official serves; **or**
2. Was made to cover **reasonable, good-faith expenses** incurred by or on behalf of the foreign public official directly related to:
   - The **promotion, demonstration, or explanation** of the person’s products or services; **or**
   - The **execution or performance of a contract** between the Canadian business and the foreign state.

> This provision protects legitimate business expenses and ensures that compliance with local laws does not constitute criminal conduct.

### **3. Prohibition of Financial Misconduct (Section 4)**

#### **Offence**:
Every person commits an **indictable offence** if they:
- For the purpose of **bribing** a foreign public official (or to **hide** such bribery), they:
  - Establish or maintain **accounts not disclosed** in required books and records;
  - Make **unrecorded or inadequately documented transactions**;
  - Record **non-existent expenditures**;
  - Enter **liabilities with incorrect identification** of the purpose;
  - Knowingly use **false documents**;
  - Intentionally **destroy accounting records** before they are legally required to be preserved.

#### **Penalty**:
- Imprisonment for a term of **up to 14 years**.

> This section targets financial concealment and fraud, recognizing that even if a bribe is not directly given, the act of hiding financial records can be a form of corruption.

---

### **4. Territorial Jurisdiction and Extraterritorial Application (Section 5)**

#### **Key Principle**:
An act or omission committed **outside Canada** may be treated as if it occurred **in Canada** under specific conditions.

#### **Who is Subject to Jurisdiction**:
A person is deemed to have committed an offence in Canada if:
- They are a **Canadian citizen**;
- They are a **permanent resident** (as defined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*) who, **after the act**, is present in Canada; **or**
- They are a **public body, corporation, society, company, firm, or partnership** incorporated or organized under Canadian law (federal or provincial).

#### **Consequences**:
- Proceedings for an offence under this Act may be **commenced in any territorial division of Canada**, regardless of where the act occurred.
- The accused may be **tried and punished as if the offence occurred in that jurisdiction**.
- The **Criminal Code’s rules** regarding the accused’s presence during proceedings (e.g., appearance requirements) apply to such cases.

#### **Plea of "Autrefois Acquit" or "Autrefois Convict" (Section 5, para. 4)**:
- If a person has been **tried and dealt with outside Canada** for the same act, they are deemed to have been tried in Canada **for the purposes of legal defences** such as:
  - *Autrefois acquit* (previously acquitted),
  - *Autrefois convict* (previously convicted),
  - *Pardon* (forgiveness).
- **Exception**:
  - A person **cannot plead "autrefois convict"** if:
    1. They were **not present** and **not represented by counsel acting under their instructions** at the trial outside Canada; **and**
    2. They were **not punished** in accordance with the sentence imposed in that trial.

> This ensures that foreign trials do not unfairly bar Canadian prosecution, while protecting individuals from double jeopardy if they were not properly represented or punished.

### **5. Enforcement and Reporting Requirements (Section 6)**

#### **Annual Reporting Mandate**:
- **Within four months of each fiscal year end**, the following ministers must jointly prepare a report:
  - **Minister of Foreign Affairs**
  - **Minister for International Trade**
  - **Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada**

#### **Content of the Report**:
- Implementation of the **Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions**;
- Enforcement of this Act;
- Trends, challenges, and outcomes in investigations and prosecutions.

#### **Public Disclosure**:
- The Minister of Foreign Affairs must **lay a copy of the report before each House of Parliament** on any of the first **15 days** after the report is completed.

> This promotes **transparency**, accountability, and public awareness of how the Act is being enforced.

---

### **6. Commencement of the Act**

- The Act comes into force on a date or dates **to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- **Effective Date**: The Act was first enacted on **February 14, 1999** (as noted in the note).

> This allows flexibility in implementation, especially to ensure readiness of enforcement agencies and legal frameworks.

## **Important Notes and Limitations**

- **No Broad Definition of "Benefit"**: The Act focuses on tangible or intangible advantages (e.g., gifts, loans, favors), but does not cover all forms of influence.
- **Exemptions are Narrow**: Only certain expenses (e.g., legitimate promotional or contractual costs) are exempt — most benefits are prohibited.
- **Criminal Penalties Are Severe**: Up to 14 years in prison reflects the seriousness with which Canada treats corruption involving foreign officials.
- **Enforcement Body**: Only **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers** or individuals **designated under the RCMP Act** may lay an information (formal charge) under this Act.

> *Note*: The original provision allowing prosecutions by non-RCMP officers (e.g., private individuals) was repealed in 2001 (Section 58), reinforcing that only authorized law enforcement can initiate proceedings.
