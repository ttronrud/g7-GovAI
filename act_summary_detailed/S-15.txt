## 🔧 STRUCTURAL AND PROCEDURAL FEATURES

### 1. **Domestic Industry Definition**
- Refers to **domestic producers** of like goods.
- A domestic industry is defined as:
  - The **collective production** of domestic producers of like goods,
  - Or a **major proportion** of total domestic production.
- **Exception**: If a domestic producer is related to an exporter or importer of dumped/subsidized goods, the industry may be interpreted as the **"rest" of the producers** (to prevent self-protection).
- **Relatedness** is determined if:
  - The producer controls or is controlled by the exporter/importer,
  - They are jointly controlled by a third party,
  - Or they jointly control a third party,
  - And there is evidence they treat the exporter/importer differently from unrelated producers.

> This prevents "domestic producers" from being used to shield themselves from competition.

---

### 2. **Dumping and Subsidy Definitions**

#### **Dumping**
- Occurs when the **export price** of goods is **below the normal value**.
- The **margin of dumping** is the difference between normal value and export price.
- If the margin is **less than 2%**, it is considered **insignificant** and not actionable.

#### **Subsidy**
- A **financial contribution** by a government (other than Canada) that confers a benefit on producers/exporters.
- **Excluded** from definition:
  - Duty or internal tax exemptions (e.g., remissions, refunds, drawbacks),
  - Energy/fuel used in production (if exempted),
  - Goods incorporated into exports (if exempted),
  - Price/income support under Article XVI of the GATT (WTO).
- **Prohibited subsidies**:
  - Any **export subsidy**,
  - Any subsidy contingent on the use of goods produced or originating in the country of export.

> Subsidies are only actionable if they are **specific** (i.e., targeted at a particular product or producer) and not exempted.

---

### 3. **Non-Actionable Subsidies**
Certain subsidies are **exempt from investigation** under the Act because they are considered **non-distorting** or **non-competitive**:
- Industrial research and development
- Pre-competitive development
- Regional development assistance
- Environmental adaptation
- University/research institution support
- Agricultural support under WTO Annex 1A (if compliant with Annex 2)

> These remain protected under international trade rules and do not trigger anti-dumping or countervailing duties.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Agricultural domestic support measures cease to be non-actionable when the **implementation period** under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture expires.

---

### 4. **Threat of Injury and Foreseeability**
- Dumping or subsidizing **must be clearly foreseen and imminent** to constitute a threat of injury.
- A mere possibility or future risk is not sufficient.
- This ensures that measures are only applied when there is a **real and present danger** to domestic industries.

---

### 5. **Procedural Safeguards**

#### **Properly Documented Complaint**
A complaint must:
- Clearly allege dumping or subsidizing,
- Specify the goods and link to injury or retardation,
- Provide reasonable detail on facts,
- Include all relevant information (prescribed or otherwise).

#### **Provisional Duty**
- Can be imposed under **Section 8** during investigation to prevent harm.
- Serves as a temporary remedy until a final decision is made.

#### **Tribunal Role**
- The **
