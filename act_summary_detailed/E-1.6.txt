### 🔹 **3. What Is a Commercial Electronic Message?**

A message qualifies as a **commercial electronic message (CEM)** if:
- It is reasonably expected to **encourage participation in a commercial activity**, such as:
  - Offering to buy, sell, barter, or lease products, services, land, or rights;
  - Offering business, investment, or gaming opportunities;
  - Advertising or promoting any of the above;
  - Promoting a person’s public image as being involved in such activities.

> **Key Rule**: Even if the message is **not explicitly promotional**, if its content, hyperlinks, or contact info suggest a commercial intent, it counts as a CEM.

#### Exceptions:
- A message is **not** considered commercial if it is sent for:
  - Law enforcement, public safety, national defence, international affairs, or protection of Canada.

#### Special Rule:
- A message that **requests consent** to send a commercial message is **still considered a commercial message** — but the sender must comply with consent rules.

---

### 🔹 **4. Who Is the Recipient of a Message?**

For legal purposes, the recipient is defined as:
- The **account holder** of the electronic address;
- **Any person reasonably believed** to be authorized by the account holder to use the address.

> This ensures that even if someone else accesses the account, they are still protected under the law.

---

### 🔹 **5. Conflict with Other Legislation**

> **Priority Rule**: If there is a conflict between this Act and **Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**, **this Act prevails** to the extent of the conflict.

> This reflects the Act’s **primary focus on commercial messaging**, even if it may overlap with privacy protections under PIPEDA.

---

### 🔹 **6. Prohibition on Sending Commercial Messages**

It is **prohibited** to send or cause to be sent a commercial electronic message **unless**:
1. The recipient has **consented** to receive it — either **expressly or impliedly**;
2. The message **complies with all prescribed requirements** (form, content, unsubscribe mechanism, etc.).

---

### 🔹 **7. Requirements for Compliance (Form and Content)**

All commercial electronic messages must:
- Be in a form that meets **prescribed requirements**.
- Include:
  - **Sender identification**: Name and contact details of the sender and, if different, the person on whose behalf it is sent;
  - **Contact information**: Enables the recipient to easily reach the sender or their representative;
  - **Unsubscribe mechanism**: Must comply with **section 11(1)** — allowing the recipient to opt out easily and permanently.

> The contact information must remain **valid for at least 60 days** after the message is sent.

---

### 🔹 **8. When Is a Message Considered "Sent"?**

- A message is considered sent **once transmission is initiated**, regardless of:
  - Whether the recipient’s address exists;
  - Whether the message reaches the recipient.

> This ensures that senders are held accountable from the moment they begin transmission.

---

### 🔹 **9. Exceptions to the Consent Requirement**

The consent rule **does not apply** in the following cases:

| Exception | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Personal/Family Relationships** | Messages sent between individuals with a personal or family relationship (as defined in regulations). |

| **Specific Classes or Circumstances** | Certain types of messages or situations (e.g., specific industries or contexts) exempted by regulation. |

#### Exceptions to the "Commercial Purpose" Rule:
A message **does not count as commercial** if it:
- Provides a **quote or estimate** for goods/services requested by the recipient;
- **Completes or confirms** a previously agreed commercial transaction;
- Provides **warranty, recall, safety, or security information** about a product or service used or purchased;
- Notifies the recipient about **ongoing use or subscription** (e.g., monthly billing, membership renewals);

- Communicates for a purpose **specifically allowed by regulation**.

> These are considered **non-commercial, legitimate notifications**.

### 🔹 **10. Exemptions for Telecommunications Providers**

- The Act **does not apply** to messages sent by or on behalf of a **telecommunications service provider** simply because their service enables message transmission.
- However, **exceptions exist**:
  - If the message is part of a **program offered by an online undertaking** (as defined in the *Broadcasting Act*), and:
    - The recipient **consented** (explicitly or implicitly) to receive that program;
    - The message is **part of that program** or sent during its transmission.

> This allows for legitimate content delivery (e.g., streaming services, online content) without violating the rules.

- **Interactive two-way voice communications** between individuals;
