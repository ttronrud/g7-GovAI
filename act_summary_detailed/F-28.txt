**Detailed Summary of the *Foreign Enlistment Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Foreign Enlistment Act* is a Canadian statute designed to prevent Canadian nationals and individuals from participating in or facilitating the enlistment of others into the **armed forces of a foreign state at war with a "friendly foreign state"** — that is, a country with which Canada maintains a formal alliance or is considered a close international partner (such as the United States or other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization). The Act also prohibits activities that support or enable such enlistment, including the building, equipping, or dispatching of ships for foreign military use, and the recruitment of personnel for foreign armed forces.

Although the Act was originally enacted in the early 20th century, it has been significantly amended and is still in force today, with key provisions updated to reflect evolving international conflicts and diplomatic relations. Notably, the provision that originally applied "within Canada" was **repealed in 1996** (by *c. 31, s. 85*), meaning the Act now applies regardless of location — both within and outside Canada — to offences involving foreign enlistment or support.

## **Historical and Practical Context**

- The Act was originally introduced in the early 20th century (1914) in response to fears that Canadians might be recruited into foreign military forces during World War I.
- It was a key tool in **protecting Canada’s neutrality** during times of international conflict.
- The 1996 repeal of the "within Canada" clause broadened its scope, making it applicable even when the offence occurs abroad — e.g., if a Canadian citizen travels to a foreign country to join a military force at war with a friendly nation.
- The Act remains relevant in modern times due to:
  - The potential for **state-sponsored recruitment** or **military cooperation** in conflicts involving Canada’s allies.
  - The need to **prevent dual
