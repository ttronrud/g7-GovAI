**Detailed Summary of the *Riding Name Change Act, 2014***

---

### **Overview**

The *Riding Name Change Act, 2014* is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. The Act formally amends the official names of various federal electoral districts (ridings) in Canada, primarily as a result of changes made to the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* in 2013. These amendments were implemented through the **representation order** declared in force on **October 1, 2013**, which restructured federal electoral boundaries across provinces to reflect population shifts and ensure equitable representation.

This Act does not introduce new legislation or create new rights or responsibilities. Instead, it serves a **naming and administrative correction** function—updating the official names of electoral ridings to reflect revised geographic boundaries and to improve clarity, historical accuracy, or inclusivity in naming.

The Act may be cited as the **Riding Name Change Act, 2014**, and its purpose is strictly procedural and descriptive.
