### 4. **Transitional Provisions**
- Several entries reference **"transitional provisions"**, which are common in modernization Acts.
- These provisions ensure that:
  - Existing rights and obligations are preserved during the transition.
  - Individuals or entities are not left without protection or access to benefits.
  - New rules do not retroactively affect past actions or claims.

Examples:
- Transitional arrangements for **benefits**, **obligations**, or **funding responsibilities**.

---

### 5. **Key Exclusions**
- **Sections 40, 76, and 77** are explicitly **excluded** from the general coming-into-force rule.
- This implies that these sections were either:
  - Already in force earlier (June 29, 2000).
  - Designed to serve as foundational or core provisions with immediate effect.
  - More stable or essential to the Act’s operation.

---

### 6. **Limitations of the Provided Text**
- **No actual sections** are listed (e.g., no descriptions of what Section 1 says, or what the modernization of benefits entails).
- The text only includes **citations, repeals, and implementation dates**, not the **substantive content** of the Act.
- Therefore, this excerpt **does not provide a full summary** of the Act’s purpose, scope, or provisions.
