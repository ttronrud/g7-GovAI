## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Preclearance Act, 2016**

### 📌 **1. Purpose and Background**

The *Preclearance Act, 2016* implements the **Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance** between Canada and the United States, signed on **March 16, 2015**, in Washington, D.C. This agreement builds upon the earlier **Air Transport Preclearance Agreement** from 2001 (signed in Toronto).

#### Key Objectives:
- **Facilitate cross-border travel and trade** by allowing border inspections to occur *before* travelers or goods enter the destination country.
- **Enhance security** by enabling early detection of threats (e.g., contraband, terrorism, public health risks).
- **Ensure compliance with both national laws** — while U.S. officers conduct preclearance in Canada, and Canadian officers do so in the U.S., **Canadian law remains supreme** in all matters involving rights, freedoms, and human dignity.

> The Act establishes a **reciprocal system** where:
> - U.S. preclearance officers may inspect travelers and goods **in Canada** before they enter the U.S.
> - Canadian border services officers may inspect travelers and goods **in the U.S.** before they enter Canada.
