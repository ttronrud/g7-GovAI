### **Key Provisions and Legal Implications**

#### **1. Exclusion of Payments from "Indian Money" under the Indian Act**
- **Provision:** *Amounts paid to the York Factory First Nation pursuant to the agreement* (whether before or after the coming into force of this Act) **are not considered "Indian moneys"** under subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*.
- **Significance:**  
  - Under the *Indian Act*, "Indian money" is a term that governs how certain financial transactions involving Indigenous peoples are regulated — including taxation, reporting, and control.
  - By explicitly excluding payments from the Flood Agreement from being classified as Indian money, the Act **removes regulatory constraints** that would otherwise apply (e.g., reporting requirements, taxation rules) to these specific payments.
  - This ensures that the financial compensation provided under the agreement is treated as a **direct, non-governmental transfer** of funds, preserving the autonomy and financial independence of the First Nation.

#### **2. Transfer of Funds to the York Factory First Nation**
- **Provision:** As soon as practicable after the coming into force of this Act, **all amounts collected, received, or held by Her Majesty in right of Canada** for the use or benefit of the York Factory First Nation under the agreement **shall be transferred to the York Factory First Nation** in accordance with the agreement.
- **Significance:**  
  - Ensures **timely and transparent financial accountability**.
  - Removes any potential delay or bureaucratic obstruction in accessing funds that were originally intended for the First Nation.
  - Reinforces the principle that the First Nation has a **legally recognized right to receive and manage** the financial benefits of the flooded land project.

#### **3. Exemption from Subsection 35(4) of the Indian Act**
- **Provision:** Subsection 35(4) of the *Indian Act* (which generally restricts the ability of Indigenous peoples to make claims for compensation or benefits unless they are directly related to land or property) **does not apply** to any amount paid to the York Factory First Nation under the agreement.
- **Significance:**  
  - Allows the First Nation to **exercise claims or rights to financial compensation** without being subject to the restrictions imposed by the Indian Act.
  - Provides a legal pathway for the First Nation to **claim or benefit from financial payments** arising from the Flood Agreement, even if those claims are not directly tied to land ownership or traditional Indigenous rights.

#### **4. Exemption from Section 36 of the Indian Act (Land Ownership and Transfer)**
- **Provision:** Where land is held or transferred under the agreement, **Section 36 of the Indian Act does not apply** if:
  - The holder or transferee of the land (or any subsequent holder or transferee) is **not Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- **Significance:**  
  - Section 36 of the *Indian Act* typically governs how land held by or transferred to Indigenous peoples is managed and regulated — including restrictions on alienation, transfer, and use.
  - By excluding this section, the Act **protects the First Nation’s right to hold, transfer, or manage the land** (or any interest in it) independently of the Crown.
  - This is a significant recognition of **self-governance and land rights**, allowing the York Factory First Nation to exercise full control over land held under the agreement, without being subject to Crown-imposed restrictions.

#### **5. Eligibility for Claims Under the Agreement**
- **Provision:** A claim provided for by both the Flood Agreement and the new agreement may be exercised by the following entities or individuals:
  - The **Council of the York Factory First Nation**  
  - The **York Factory First Nation** (as a whole)  
  - **Individual members** of the York Factory First Nation  
  - A **group or unincorporated association** that is **wholly or substantially comprised** of members of the First Nation  
  - An **unincorporated association established by the Council**  
  - A **share capital corporation** whose shares are **wholly or substantially owned and controlled** by the First Nation or its members  
  - A **non-share capital corporation** whose **membership consists wholly or substantially of members** of the First Nation or the York Factory First Nation  
- **Limitation:** All such claims **must be exercised in accordance with the agreement**.
- **Significance:**  
  - Expands the scope of who can access and benefit from claims under the agreement — including individuals, community groups, and corporations.
  - Supports **community-based governance and economic development** by enabling collective action and investment.
  - Ensures that **benefits are distributed fairly and democratically**, with participation by both individual members and organized groups.

#### **6. Application of Manitoba Arbitration Law**
- **Provision:** Except as otherwise provided in the agreement, **Manitoba’s legislation on arbitration** applies to any dispute between the parties to the agreement that is to be settled by arbitration.
- **Significance:**  
  - Establishes a clear, predictable, and **local dispute resolution mechanism**.
  - Encourages peaceful, fair, and efficient resolution of disagreements without resorting to court litigation.
  - Gives the parties (including the First Nation) **access to Manitoba’s established legal and procedural frameworks** for resolving disputes, which may be more culturally and administratively appropriate than federal processes.

### **Conclusion**

The *York Factory First Nation Flooded Land Act* is a landmark piece of legislation that reflects a shift toward **Indigenous self-determination, financial independence, and equitable treatment** in the context of federal and provincial land and resource development projects. By legally recognizing the York Factory First Nation’s rights to financial compensation and land, and by removing restrictive provisions of the *Indian Act*, the Act strengthens the First Nation’s ability to govern itself, invest in community development, and maintain cultural and economic sovereignty.

It stands as a model for how Indigenous rights can be formally recognized and protected in the Canadian legal system, particularly in relation to historical land-use decisions involving hydroelectric projects.
