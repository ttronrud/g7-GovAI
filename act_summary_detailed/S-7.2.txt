**Detailed Summary of the *Security Screening Services Commercialization Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Security Screening Services Commercialization Act* (the "Act") establishes a framework for the **commercialization of aviation security screening services** in Canada. It introduces a system where a designated body corporate (the "designated screening authority") is responsible for overseeing and managing security screening at designated aerodromes, including the authorization of private contractors to perform screening services. The Act balances **security effectiveness**, **cost recovery**, **transparency**, **public accountability**, and **international obligations** while ensuring that the process remains aligned with Canada’s aviation security standards and international commitments.
