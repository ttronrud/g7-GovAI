### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Namibia Tax Convention Act, 2013**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose of the Act**
The *Canada–Namibia Tax Convention Act, 2013* establishes the legal framework in Canada for implementing the **Canada–Namibia Tax Convention**, which was signed to **avoid double taxation** and **prevent fiscal evasion** with respect to taxes on income and capital. This Act enables the Convention to have full legal force and effect within Canada, ensuring that both countries’ tax systems operate in a fair, transparent, and mutually beneficial manner.

The Convention is not merely a bilateral agreement but is **integrated into Canadian law**, giving it enforceability and supremacy over conflicting domestic laws.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Act defines key terms used throughout the Convention:

- **Convention**: Refers to the tax treaty between Canada and the Republic of Namibia, as detailed in **Schedule 1**, and amended by the **Protocol in Schedule 2**.
- **Force of Law**: The Convention is approved and has the force of law in Canada **during the period it is in force**, as stipulated by its own terms.
- **Precedence of the Convention**: In case of inconsistency between the Convention, this Act, or any other Canadian law, **the Convention and this Act prevail**.
- **Precedence over Interpretation Act**: If there is a conflict between the Convention and the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*, the latter prevails to the extent of inconsistency — a procedural safeguard to maintain consistency with established tax interpretation principles.

#### **3. Regulatory and Notification Provisions**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** may issue **regulations** necessary to implement the Convention or give effect to its provisions.
- The **Minister of Finance** must publish a **notice in the Canada Gazette** within **60 days** of the Convention’s entry into force or termination, specifying:
  - The date on which the Convention comes into force.
  - The date on which it ceases to have effect.

This ensures transparency and public awareness of treaty timelines.

#### **6. Determination of Residency**

Residency is a central concept in tax treaties and determines where income is taxed.

##### **6.1 Individual Residents**
An individual is deemed a resident of **only one** Contracting State based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home**:  
   - If the individual has a permanent home in one State, they are deemed a resident of that State.  
   - If they have a permanent home in both, residency is determined by **"centre of vital interests"** — the State where personal and economic ties are stronger.

2. **If Centre of Vital Interests Cannot Be Determined**:  
   - Residency is assigned to the State where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **If Habitual Abode Exists in Both or Neither**:  
   - Residency is assigned to the State of which the individual is a **national**.

4. **If Individual is a National of Both or Neither**:  
   - The competent authorities of Canada and Namibia must **resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.

##### **6.2 Corporate Residents**
- If a company is a resident of both countries, the competent authorities must **reach mutual agreement** to determine residency.
- Factors considered include:
  - Place of **effective management**
  - Place of **incorporation**
  - Other relevant factors
- In the absence of agreement, the company **cannot claim any tax relief or exemption** under the Convention.

##### **6.3 Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships)**
- Similar to companies, these entities must have their residency determined by **mutual agreement** between the competent authorities.
- Without agreement, they are **not entitled** to any tax relief under the Convention.

#### **7. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise conducts business.

##### **Types of PE Included**:
- Place of management  
- Branch  
- Office  
- Factory  
- Workshop  
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any site related to natural resource exploration/exploitation  

##### **Exclusions (Do Not Constitute PE)**:
- Use of facilities **solely for storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of stock **for storage, display, or delivery**.
- Maintenance of stock **solely for processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place of business **solely for purchasing goods or collecting information**.
- Fixed place of business **solely for preparatory or auxiliary activities**.
- A combination of the above, **if the overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**.

> **Exception**: If a person (not an independent agent) acts on behalf of an enterprise and has **authority to conclude contracts** in a Contracting State, that enterprise is deemed to have a PE in that State **for any activities undertaken**, **unless** those activities fall under the excluded categories.

> **Note**: An enterprise **does not** have a PE simply because it uses a broker, general commission agent, or independent agent — **as long as the agent is acting in the ordinary course of business**.

> **No PE arises from control or ownership relationships**:
- Even if one company controls another, or operates in the other country, **this does not create a PE**.
