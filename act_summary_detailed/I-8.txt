**Detailed Summary of the *Industrial and Regional Development Act***

---

### **1. Act Title and Citation**
The Act is formally titled the **Industrial and Regional Development Act** and may be cited as such. It is a federal statute designed to promote economic growth and regional development across Canada by providing financial support and guarantees to commercial operations and institutions that support economic activity.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Act establishes several key definitions to clarify the scope and application of its provisions:

- **Approved Lender**: A financial institution designated by regulations as eligible to provide loans to commercial operations or eligible persons. These lenders must meet certain criteria set by the Governor in Council.

- **Commercial Operation**: A business or enterprise engaged in commercial activity. This includes any class of service industry operations designated by the Minister under subsection 7(2). The definition is not static and can be expanded by ministerial designation.

- **Development Index**: A performance-based index developed under regulations to assess the economic development level of each district. It considers factors such as per capita income, employment levels, and provincial revenue capacity. The index is used to rank districts and determine their tier group.

- **District**: A geographic unit defined by Statistics Canada for census purposes—i.e., a census division. These are used as the basis for regional classification and funding allocation.

- **Eligible Person**: An entity that supports commercial operations through activities such as infrastructure provision, marketing, research, or service delivery. Includes:
  - Economic, business, or technological institutes or centres
  - Municipal corporations
  - Municipal industrial development corporations

- **Minister**: The federal minister designated by the Governor in Council to administer the Act for a specific province or region. The Minister acts as the primary decision-maker for grant, loan, and guarantee approvals.

- **Prescribed**: Means as defined or set out in regulations made by the Governor in Council.

- **Province**: Excludes Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. These territories are treated separately under the Act.

### **3. Tier Group System (Regional Classification)**

Each year, on or before **July 1**, the Minister must classify all provincial districts into **four Tier Groups** based on the **Development Index**, which ranks districts according to their need for economic assistance.

#### Tier Group Breakdown:
| Tier Group | Population Coverage | Criteria |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Tier Group IV** | Up to 5% of provincial population | Districts requiring the *greatest* assistance; lowest development index; most in need of growth support |
| **Tier Group III** | Up to 15% of provincial population | Second-highest need; includes Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut |
| **Tier Group II** | Up to 30% of provincial population | Moderate need; after Tier III and IV |
| **Tier Group I** | Remaining districts | Highest level of development; receives minimal or no direct support |

> **Purpose**: This tiered system ensures targeted investment in underdeveloped regions while preserving resources for more advanced areas.

### **4. Financial Support Mechanisms**

The Act enables the Minister to provide financial assistance under three main categories:

#### **A. Support for Commercial Operations (Section 4)**  
On application, the Minister may provide:
- **Grants, contributions, or loans** to a commercial operation for:
  1. Establishing, expanding, modernizing, or enhancing productivity
  2. Promoting marketing of products/services
  3. Developing new or improved products or production processes (including research)
  4. Restructuring the operation to ensure long-term commercial viability

> Funding is **conditional** and must align with the **Tier Group** of the district where the project is located.

#### **B. Guarantee of Repayments (Section 4)**  
The Minister may **guarantee** repayment of a portion of the principal and interest on a loan made by an **approved lender** to a commercial operation, provided the project serves one of the above purposes.

> This reduces risk for lenders and encourages private financing of economically beneficial projects.

#### **C. Support for Eligible Persons (Section 5)**  
The Minister may provide grants, contributions, or loans to **eligible persons** (e.g., research centers, municipal bodies) if they:
- Provide frameworks for establishing, modernizing, or expanding commercial operations
- Promote marketing of commercial products/services
- Conduct research into new or improved products/processes
- Deliver services beneficial to commercial operations

> Again, funding is governed by the **Tier Group** of the commercial operation's location.

#### **D. Guarantee for Eligible Persons (Section 5)**  
The Minister may also **guarantee loans** to eligible persons if they support commercial operations in the above ways.

> This supports institutional development that indirectly fosters economic growth.

---

### **5. Conditions for Funding**

Funding is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions:

- **No Funding if Project Would Proceed Without It**: The Minister may deny funding if, in their judgment, the project would proceed or continue regardless of the financial support.
- **No Funding if No Significant Benefit to Canada**: The project or activity must make a **significant contribution** to Canada’s economic or social well-being.
- **Funding Must Be for Real Economic Impact**: The purpose must be tangible and contribute to regional or national development.

> These safeguards prevent misuse of public funds and ensure that support leads to measurable outcomes.

---

### **6. Geographic Scope and Location Rules**

- If a project or operation spans **multiple districts**, it is deemed to be located in **the district designated by the Minister**.
- This allows flexibility in applying funding where the primary impact occurs.

---

### **7. Ministerial Authority to Designate Activities**

The Minister has the power, by order, to **designate specific service industry operations** as “commercial operations” under the Act. This allows adaptation to evolving economic sectors (e.g., IT, green energy, healthcare services).

---

### **8. Limitations on Total Funding**

- The **aggregate amount of guarantees** issued under this Act and related government insurance programs (e.g., Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1a and 1e of Appropriation Act No. 1 and 4, 1980–82) **cannot exceed $1.2 billion at any one time**.
- This cap ensures fiscal responsibility and prevents overextension of public credit.

---

### **9. Recovery of Overpayments or Breach of Conditions**

- If a contribution is:
  - Not fully justified (e.g., the recipient is not entitled)
  - Excessively funded
  - Violates terms or conditions
- Then the **excess amount plus interest** (prescribed and calculated from the date of disbursement) becomes a **debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This debt can be **recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction**.

> **Exception**: If the Minister, under prescribed conditions, **notifies** the recipient in writing that recovery will **not** occur in a particular circumstance, then the obligation to recover ceases effective from the date of the breach.

---

### **10. Penalties for Fraud or Misrepresentation**

Any person who:
- Submits false or misleading information
- Makes a false statement
- Fails to disclose a material fact
in connection with an application for funding or otherwise, is guilty of an **offence**.

**Punishments**:
- **Summary conviction**: Fine up to CAD $10,000 or imprisonment up to 1 year, or both
- **Indictment conviction**: Fine up to CAD $100,000 or imprisonment up to 5 years, or both

> This enforces accountability and integrity in the application process.

---

### **11. Advisory Boards**

- The Minister may establish **advisory boards** to assist in the administration of the Act.
- Members are entitled to:
  - A daily remuneration fixed by the Governor in Council
  - Reasonable travel and other expenses
- Boards may exercise powers and perform duties as prescribed in regulations.

---

### **12. Annual Reporting to Parliament**

- The Minister must lay before **each House of Parliament** a report on the Act’s administration **by June 1** of the year following the end of each fiscal year (or the first day Parliament resumes if not sitting).
- The report is **permanently referred** to a parliamentary committee designated to review regional and industrial expansion policies.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and ongoing oversight of public spending.

---

### **13. Regulatory Powers**

The Governor in Council may make regulations to:

- Establish the **method of calculating the Development Index** (using per capita income, employment, and provincial revenue capacity)
- Define “commercial operation” and “approved lender”
- Specify the **scope of eligible activities** (e.g., what counts as research or marketing support)
- Set **terms and conditions** for grants, loans, and guarantees (including eligibility, duration, and repayment)
- Determine **maximum amounts** of funding per Tier Group
- Specify **types of costs** eligible for funding (e.g., equipment, R&D, training)
- Define rules for **acquisition, assignment, or sale of stock options** granted as conditions of funding
- Prescribe any other matter necessary to implement the Act

> These regulations provide flexibility to adapt the Act to changing economic realities.

---

### **14. Deadline for Applications**

- **No grant, contribution, or loan may be made under this Act after June 30, 1988**.
- This is a **time-bound limitation** that effectively ended the Act’s operation after that date.

> **Note**: This clause indicates that the Act was **intended as a transitional or temporary measure** and was not designed
