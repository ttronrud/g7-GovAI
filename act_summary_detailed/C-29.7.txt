**Detailed Summary of the *Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act* (CAANSA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that facilitates the **commercialization and operational independence** of civil air navigation services in Canada. It transfers responsibility for providing key air navigation services—from air traffic control to aeronautical information—from the federal government (specifically the Department of Transport) to **NAV CANADA**, a publicly owned corporation established under the Canada Corporations Act.

This Act enables the **efficient, cost-effective, and modernized delivery** of air navigation services while ensuring **aviation safety**, **public accountability**, and **procedural transparency** in decision-making—particularly regarding service changes, closures, or reductions in remote or northern regions.

The Act is rooted in international standards set by the **Chicago Convention**, and it aligns with Canada’s commitment to international civil aviation norms, particularly those related to safety, efficiency, and standardization.

### **3. Transfer of Authority and Responsibility**

#### **Transfer of Services**
- The **Minister of Transport** may designate certain assets (e.g., radar systems, communication facilities) as **civil air navigation services assets**.
- On or **after the transfer date**, **NAV CANADA** assumes full responsibility for providing civil air navigation services.
- The Corporation is **not an agent** of Her Majesty in right of Canada and does **not act on behalf** of the government when providing services.

#### **Continuity of Service**
- On and after the transfer date, NAV CANADA must provide **all civil air navigation services** that were previously provided by the Department of Transport—**to the same extent and quality**.

> This ensures a smooth transition with no interruption in service.

---

### **4. Prohibitions on Service Provision**

#### **Prohibited Activities (Post-Transfer Date)**
No person (other than NAV CANADA or acting under specific exceptions) may provide:
- **Aeronautical Information Services**
- **Air Traffic Control Services**
- **Specified Flight Information Services**

*In respect of Canadian airspace or any airspace where Canada has responsibility for air traffic control.*

> This prevents duplication and ensures NAV CANADA is the sole provider of core services.

#### **Exceptions**
A person may provide these services if:
- Acting under the authority of the **Minister of National Defence** (e.g., for military operations); or  
- With **written consent from NAV CANADA**.

> This maintains flexibility for national defence and emergency situations.

To ensure **safety and operational consistency**, the Corporation may:
- Propose **technical and operational standards** or **minimum liability insurance requirements** for aeronautical radio navigation services.
- Submit these proposals to the Minister for review.

#### **Minister’s Review and Approval**
The Minister may only incorporate standards or insurance requirements into regulations if they:
1. Are **adequate for aviation and public safety**;  
2. Do **not impose undue burdens** on providers; and
