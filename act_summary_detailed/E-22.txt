The provided text consists entirely of repeated legal annotations indicating that a particular section or provision of a statute has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by legislative action.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Notices**:  
  The repeated entries "[Repealed, 2013, c. 33, s. 199]" and "[Repealed, 1995, c. 5, s. 10]" indicate that the specific legal provision in question was formally removed from the statute book on two separate occasions:
  1. **Repealed in 2013** by **Chapter 33** of the Statutes of the province (likely Ontario, given the format and context), under **Section 199** of that act.
  2. **Previously repealed in 1995** by **Chapter 5**, under **Section 10** of that act.

- **Implication**:  
  This means that the original act or regulation containing the provision in question is no longer in force. Any legal obligations, rights, or duties derived from that provision have been nullified and are not enforceable under current law.

- **Contextual Notes**:
  - The repetition of the same repeal notice (15 times for 2013 and once for 1995) likely reflects a typographical or formatting error in the original document, possibly due to a failure to properly edit or remove redundant entries.
  - In legal databases or legislative registers, such repetitions are typically not meaningful—they do not indicate multiple repeals or different provisions. They are usually errors or formatting artifacts.

- **Legal Consequence**:  
  Any reference to the repealed section in legal interpretations, case law, or administrative decisions is now outdated and must be disregarded. The law as it currently stands does not include the provisions that were previously in effect.

### Conclusion:

The provision referenced in the text has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer part of the current legal framework**. It was first repealed in 1995 (by c. 5, s. 10) and reaffirmed or formally removed again in 2013 (by c. 33, s. 199). The repeated entries are likely errors and do not indicate multiple repeals or distinct provisions. As such, the summary is that:

> **The provision is obsolete and legally void. It was repealed in 1995 and again in 2013, and therefore no longer applies.**

This repeal means that any legal actions, interpretations, or regulations based on this section are no longer valid under current law.
