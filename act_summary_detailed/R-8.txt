**Detailed Summary of the Revolving Funds Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Revolving Funds Act* is a legislative instrument that authorizes specific Ministers of the Government of Canada to make expenditures from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** (CRF) for designated purposes. These expenditures are governed by strict financial limits based on the revenues generated from those same purposes—effectively creating a "revolving fund" model where spending is capped at a fixed multiple of incoming revenues. The Act also includes provisions for amendments, repeals, and oversight by the Treasury Board.

Importantly, **many of the provisions in this Act have been repealed or replaced over time**, particularly through subsequent legislation. This summary focuses on the **original content and structure** of the Act as presented, noting where repeals occurred and their implications.

## **Key Themes and Implications**

| Theme | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Revolving Fund Model** | The Act enables a "revolving" mechanism where funds are spent and then replenished, as long as expenditures do not exceed a defined multiple of revenues. This allows flexibility without requiring new appropriations each time. |
| **Strict Financial Caps** | Most provisions impose very tight limits (e.g., $1.00 over revenue, $2M, $45M, $25M), ensuring that spending remains closely aligned with income and minimizing fiscal risk. |
| **Purpose-Specific Authority** | Each Minister has clear, narrowly defined powers tied to specific government functions (e.g., agriculture, immigration, film). |
| **Oversight by Treasury Board** | Ensures accountability and transparency in how funds are used. |
| **High Degree of Repeal** | The Act contains **multiple repealed sections**, indicating that many of these revolving fund powers were deemed obsolete or redundant over time due to changes in government structure, legislation, or policy priorities. |

## **Conclusion**

The *Revolving Funds Act* was designed to provide **flexible, revenue-linked funding mechanisms** for specific government departments and programs. It enabled Ministers to spend from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for purposes such as race track oversight, travel document services, public infrastructure, and film operations—subject to strict financial caps and Treasury Board oversight.

However, **the Act has been largely repealed** since its enactment, with most of its provisions removed in the early 2000s through various legislative amendments and budgetary reforms. As a result:

> ✅ **The Act is largely inactive today** and does not currently govern any major government expenditures.  
> ❌ **It is not a current source of funding authority** for any federal department.

Its historical significance lies in demonstrating how Canada has experimented with revolving fund models to provide operational flexibility in specific areas—though such models have since been replaced by more traditional appropriation-based funding.

## **Recommendation for Use**
This summary should be used **historically or in legal analysis**, particularly when examining:
- The evolution of Canadian government funding mechanisms
- The development of revolving fund legislation
- The repeal process of public finance laws

For current funding authority, reference should be made to:
- The *Department of Public Works and Government Services Act*  
- The *National Film Board Act*  
- The *Criminal Code* (for race track supervision)  
- Annual appropriations and budget acts

📌 **Final Note:** The *Revolving Funds Act* is **not currently in force** and has been **repealed in its entirety** in most of its sections. Any references to it today are primarily for historical or interpretive purposes.
