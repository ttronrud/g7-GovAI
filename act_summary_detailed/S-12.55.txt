## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006**

### 🔍 **Overview and Purpose**
The *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* (SLPECA) was enacted by the Government of Canada to impose a **tariff-like export charge** on softwood lumber products exported to the **United States**. The primary objective was to:

- **Protect the Canadian softwood lumber industry** from unfair competition due to lower-priced U.S. lumber.
- **Generate revenue** to offset potential losses from exports that could otherwise flood the U.S. market.
- **Encourage sustainable and fair trade practices** by adjusting charges based on market conditions and export volumes.

The Act was introduced in response to concerns that U.S. softwood lumber producers were undercutting Canadian prices, especially through the use of lower-cost, less-regulated products. It applied specifically to **softwood lumber products** exported to the U.S. and introduced a **tiered, market-responsive charge system**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The Act was **phased out** in 2015, with most of its provisions ceasing to apply on **October 12, 2015**, as noted in *SOR/2016-155*. Some provisions were later replaced or modified under subsequent trade agreements (e.g., the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and related trade policy shifts).

### 4. **Charge Calculation and Rates**

#### A. **Base Rate Determination (Section 12)**

The **rate of charge** depends on:
- Whether an **export allocation** is required (under section 6.3(3)(b) of the *Export and Import Permits Act*).
- The **reference price** (based on U.S. market data).

##### 🔹 **Reference Price**:
- Defined as the **most recent four-week average** of the **Framing Lumber Composite Price (FLCP)** published by **Random Lengths Publications Incorporated**.
- Must be available at least **21 days before the start of the month**.
- If Random Lengths changes methodology or stops publishing, a **prescribed formula** applies.
- Reference price is **rounded to the nearest dollar**, with ties going to the **higher multiple**.

##### 🔹 **Rate Structure (Based on Reference Price)**

| Export Type | Reference Price | Rate |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| **Requires Export Allocation** | > $355 | 0% |
| | ≥ $336 to ≤ $355 | 2.5% |
| | ≥ $316 to ≤ $335 | 3% |
| | ≤ $315 | 5% |

| **No Export Allocation Required** | Reference Price | Rate |
|-------------------------------|------------------|------|
| > $355 | 0% |
| ≥ $336 to ≤ $355 | 5% |
| ≥ $316 to ≤ $335 | 10% |
| ≤ $315 | 15% |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Section 12 and 12.1 ceased to be in force on **October 12, 2015**.

#### B. **Additional Charges for Overcapacity (Section 13)**

If:
- The export **does not require an export allocation**, **and**
- The **monthly export volume exceeds the trigger volume** (101% of the monthly trigger volume),

👉 Then the **charge is increased by 50%**.

> 🔍 **Monthly Trigger Volume Formula** (for regions other than BC Coast):

\[
\text{Trigger Volume} = (\text{Expected Monthly American Consumption}) \times \text{Region Multiplier} + \text{Adjustment Term}
\]

Where:
- **Expected monthly American consumption** is calculated via a prescribed formula (based on historical data and consumption trends).
- **Region multipliers**:
  - Ontario: 3.15  
  - Quebec: 4.39  
  - Manitoba: 0.29  
  - Saskatchewan: 0.42  
  - Alberta: 2.49  
  - BC Interior: 17.43  

> 🔍 **BC Coast Trigger Volume**:
- Uses **seasonal multipliers** based on month:
  - Jan: 0.7212 / 0.9288  
  - Feb: 0.9767 / 0.8944  
  - Mar: 0.9025 / 1.0014
