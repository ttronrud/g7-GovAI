### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Transportation Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**
The *Canada Transportation Act* (CTA) establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing transportation in Canada. It is designed to ensure a **competitive, efficient, safe, secure, and environmentally sustainable national transportation system** that serves all Canadians — urban and rural, disabled and non-disabled — while promoting economic growth and competitiveness.

The Act applies to all forms of transportation under the legislative authority of **Parliament**, including air, rail, road, and marine transport. It serves as the primary legislation governing the regulation and oversight of transportation services in Canada.

#### **2. Legislative Authority and Precedence**
- **Applicability**: The Act applies to transportation matters within Parliament’s legislative jurisdiction.
- **Conflict Resolution**: 
  - If there is a conflict between a regulation made under this Act and a regulation from another Act of Parliament concerning the same mode of transportation, **the regulation under the Canada Transportation Act prevails**.
  - However, this does **not** override the *Competition Act* — except in specific circumstances.
- **Competition Act Exception**: 
  - **Section 5** explicitly states that, **except for Division IV of Part III**, nothing in or under the CTA affects the operation of the *Competition Act*. This ensures that market competition remains central to transportation policy.
- **International Agreements**: 
  - In cases where an international agreement or convention on air services conflicts with the *Competition Act*, the **international agreement takes precedence** to the extent of the conflict. This reflects Canada’s obligations in global aviation agreements.

#### **3. Core Objectives of the Transportation System**
The Act declares that a national transportation system should:
1. Be **competitive, economically efficient, and accessible**.
2. Meet the **highest practicable safety and security standards**.
3. Contribute to a **sustainable environment**.
4. Make **optimal use of all transportation modes** at the **lowest total cost**.
5. Achieve these goals through:
   - **Market forces** (competition and market dynamics) as the primary mechanism for providing viable services.
   - **Strategic public intervention** only when market forces fail to achieve desired outcomes — especially in areas involving safety, security, environmental protection, or social equity.
6. Ensure **no undue obstacles** to:
   - The movement of goods and people within Canada.
   - The export of Canadian goods.
7. Ensure **accessibility** without barriers for all persons, including those with disabilities.
8. Promote **collaboration between governments and the private sector** to create an **integrated transportation system**.
