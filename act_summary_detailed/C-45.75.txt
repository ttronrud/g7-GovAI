**Detailed Summary of the *Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee Governance Agreement Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee Governance Agreement Act* is a federal law enacted by the Parliament of Canada on July 18, 2017, to give legal effect to the **Agreement on Cree Nation Governance** — a landmark treaty between the **Government of Canada**, the **Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee)**, and the **Cree Nation Government**. This Act formally ratifies and operationalizes the governance framework established in the Agreement, affirming the self-governance, constitutional autonomy, and legal rights of the Cree people of Eeyou Istchee in northern Quebec.

The Act ensures that the Agreement is not only legally binding but also fully integrated into Canadian law, with specific provisions protecting Cree land rights, property immunity, tax exemptions, judicial recognition, and the authority of Cree institutions — all while respecting the hierarchy of existing agreements and federal laws.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**  
- The Act is enacted to **ratify and give effect** to the *Agreement on Cree Nation Governance*, signed on **July 18, 2017**, between:
  - The Government of Canada,
  - The Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee),
  - The Cree Nation Government.
- It establishes the **Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee Governance Agreement Act** as the legal instrument that implements the Agreement in Canadian law.

---

### **2. Definitions**  
Key terms are clearly defined to ensure consistency and clarity across the Act:  
- **Agreement**: Refers to the 2017 Governance Agreement, including all amendments.  
- **Cree Constitution**: A constitution developed under Section 3.1 of the Agreement and ratified in accordance with Sections 31.4, 31.6, and 31.7. It becomes a binding legal document.  
- **Cree Nation / Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee**: As defined in Section 1.1 of the Agreement.  
- **Cree Nation Government**: The legal entity established under *An Act respecting the Cree Nation Government* (CQLR, Chapter G-1.031).  
- Other terms (e.g., Category IA land, Cree First Nation, Cree law, federal law, James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement) retain their meanings as defined in the original Agreement.

---

### **3. Legal Effect and Binding Nature**  
- The **Agreement is approved, given effect, and declared valid** with the force of law.  
- It is **binding on all parties** and **all other persons and bodies**, including individuals, corporations, and government entities.  
- **Hierarchy of Laws**:  
  - The **James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA)** **prevails over** the Agreement where there is conflict or inconsistency.  
  - The **Agreement prevails over this Act** in case of conflict.  
  - This Act **prevails over other federal laws** in conflict with it.  
  - The **James Bay and Northern Quebec Native Claims Settlement Act (JBNQNCSSA)** **prevails over this Act** where there is inconsistency.

> This establishes a clear legal hierarchy: JBNQA is paramount, followed by the Agreement, then this Act, with federal laws only overriding where explicitly superseded.

---

### **4. The Cree Constitution**  
- The **Cree Constitution** is given full legal force and is binding on all persons and bodies.  
- However, it **does not bind Her Majesty in right of Canada or any province** — preserving federal jurisdiction over constitutional matters in national governance.

> This reflects a balance between Indigenous self-governance and federal sovereignty.

---

### **5. Cree Laws**  
- Cree laws made in accordance with the Agreement and the Cree Constitution have **full legal force**.  
- These laws are **binding on all persons and bodies**.  
- However, they **do not bind the federal government or any province**.

> This ensures that Cree self-governance is recognized and respected without undermining provincial or federal authority.

---

### **6. Continuation and Creation of Cree First Nations**  
- Cree bands that were incorporated as corporations under the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act* **before the Act comes into force** are **continued as Cree First Nations** and remain legally unchanged.  
- **New Cree First Nations** may be established under **Chapter 23 of the Agreement**, which outlines procedures for their creation.

> This provides continuity for existing communities while allowing for future governance structures.

---

### **7. Legal Capacity of Cree First Nations**  
- A Cree First Nation has the **capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person** — meaning it can enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued, and make decisions independently — **subject to the Agreement**.

> This is a foundational step toward full legal personhood for Indigenous nations.

---

### **8. Exemption from Statutory Instruments Act**  
- The **Statutory Instruments Act** does **not apply** to:
  - Cree laws,
  - Resolutions of Cree First Nations, or
  - Resolutions of the Cree Nation Government made under the Agreement.

> This ensures that Cree governance instruments are not subject to the usual administrative review or approval processes, allowing greater autonomy.

---

### **9. Exemption from the Indian Act**  
- **The Indian Act does not apply** to:
  - Cree First Nations, nor
  - Category IA land (land designated for Cree use and benefit),  
  **except** for determining whether a Cree beneficiary is an "Indian" under the Indian Act.

> This removes a major source of legal and administrative interference in Cree governance and land use, promoting self-determination.

> **Note**: The Indian Act still applies only to determine eligibility for status under federal Indian law — not to govern land or rights.

---

### **10. Exemption from Corporate Laws**  
- The following federal corporate laws **do not apply** to Cree First Nations:
  - *Canada Corporations Act*,
  - *Canada Business Corporations Act*,
  - *Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act*,
  - Any other federal corporate legislation.

> This allows Cree First Nations to operate without being subject to corporate governance rules designed for non-Indigenous entities.

> **Exception**: The Governor in Council may, **by order at the request of the Cree Nation Government**, allow a federal corporate law to apply to a specific Cree First Nation.

> This provides flexibility for future integration or specific needs.

---

### **11. Tax and Seizure Exemptions (Continuity and Expansion)**  
- The **tax and seizure exemptions** from the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act* (Sections 187–193) **continue to apply** as per Sections 14–20 of that Act.  
- These exemptions are extended to:
  - **Interest in Category IA land** by an Indian or Cree First Nation,
  - **Personal property** situated on Category IA land.

> This protects land and property rights from taxation and seizure.

---

### **12. Tax Exemption Provisions**  
- **No taxation** applies to:
  - Ownership, occupation, possession, or use of property on Category IA land by an Indian or Cree First Nation.
  - Succession duties, inheritance taxes, or estate duties on the death of an Indian who inherits such property.

> This ensures that Cree communities are protected from financial burdens related to land and inheritance.

> **Conditions**: These exemptions are subject to:
  - Cree First Nation laws made under **paragraph 6.2(1)(k)** of the Agreement, or
  - Cree Nation Government laws made under **Section 8.15** of the Agreement.

> This allows for community-specific rules that may impose conditions on exemptions.

---

### **13. Immunity from Privilege, Hypothec, and Seizure**  
- Property located on **Category IA land** (whether movable or immovable) belonging to:
  - A Cree beneficiary,
  - An Indian resident on Category IA land,
  - A Cree First Nation,
  - Or the Cree Nation Government  
  is **immune from**:
  - Privilege, hypothec, or charge,
  - Attachment, levy, seizure, or execution,
  - By any third party.

> This is a strong protection against creditors or government actions targeting Cree land or property.

> **Exception**:  
> - A person **other than a Cree beneficiary or Cree First Nation** may have their property seized **only if** the Cree First Nation has **authorized** the pledge or hypothecation.  
> In such cases, creditors may pursue normal remedies.

> This protects the integrity of Cree land ownership while allowing limited exceptions with community consent.

---

### **14. Rights of Sellers with Retained Property Rights**  
- A seller who sells **movable property** to:
  - A Cree beneficiary,
  - An Indian resident on Category IA land, or
  - A Cree First Nation  
  may **retain the right of property or possession** of that item, even if the property is located on Category IA land.

> This protects property rights in transactions where ownership or possession remains with the seller.

---

### **15. Deemed Location of Property on Category IA Land**  
- Certain property is **deemed to be on Category IA land** if:
  - It became property of a Cree First Nation via Section 13 or 13.1 of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act* and was purchased with federal
