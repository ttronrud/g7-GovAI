The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular provision or set of provisions has been **repealed**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Text Content**:  
  The repeated lines state:  
  `[Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 65]`  
  This notation is standard in legislative documents and signifies that a specific section (or subsection) of a statute was **officially removed or canceled** by an act of Parliament.

- **Year and Citation**:  
  - **2014**: The repeal occurred in the year 2014.  
  - **c. 2**: This refers to *Chapter 2* of the Statutes of the relevant jurisdiction (likely the *Ontario* or *Canadian* legislative framework, though the exact jurisdiction would depend on context).  
  - **s. 65**: This refers to *Section 65* of that chapter.

- **Number of Repeals Listed**:  
  There are **65 repetitions** of this entry. This suggests that **65 different provisions** (or subsections) within a legislative act or part of a statute were repealed by **the same legislative amendment** (likely *Chapter 2, 2014*).

- **Nature of the Repeal**:  
  The repeal means that the original provisions referenced in Section 65 (or its subsections) are **no longer in force**. They have been formally removed from the legal framework, and any legal effect, rights, obligations, or penalties previously derived from them are **nullified**.

- **Legal Implications**:  
  - Any prior legal action, interpretation, or administrative rule based on these repealed sections is no longer valid.  
  - The repeal may have been enacted to simplify legislation, correct errors, align with new policies, or reflect changes in law or governance.  
  - It reflects legislative modernization or streamlining — a common practice in legal reform.

- **Jurisdictional Context**:  
  While the exact jurisdiction is not specified, the format (c. 2, s. 65) is typical of **Ontario’s Statutes**, as Canada’s provincial legislation often uses such numbering. Chapter 2 of the 2014 Statutes of Ontario (e.g., the *Statutes of Ontario, 2014*) may have included a bill that repealed multiple sections, including those in Section 65 of a prior act.

- **Why Repeal?**  
  Common reasons for repealing sections include:  
  - Outdated or obsolete provisions  
  - Overlapping or conflicting laws  
  - Inconsistencies with current policy  
  - Legislative simplification or consolidation  
  - Errors or unintended consequences in prior law

### Final Summary:

> The provided text is a list of **65 repeated repeals** of provisions under **Section 65 of Chapter 2** of a statute, officially **repealed in 2014** by *c. 2, s. 65*. This indicates that 65 distinct legal sections or subsections were formally removed from the law, rendering them inoperative.
