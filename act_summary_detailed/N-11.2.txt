**Detailed Summary of the *National Housing Strategy Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Housing Strategy Act* is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada to establish a **national framework for addressing housing insecurity**, particularly for vulnerable populations, and to advance the **right to adequate housing** as a fundamental human right. Rooted in international law, social justice, and sustainable development, the Act creates a coordinated, inclusive, and rights-based approach to housing policy across Canada.

It mandates the development and implementation of a **National Housing Strategy**, establishes a high-level governance body—the **National Housing Council**—and appoints a dedicated **Federal Housing Advocate** to monitor progress, conduct research, and ensure accountability. The Act emphasizes **participation by civil society, persons with lived experience, and marginalized groups**, and aligns housing policy with Canada’s international commitments and national development goals.
