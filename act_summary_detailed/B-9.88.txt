**Detailed Summary of the *Building a Green Prairie Economy Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Building a Green Prairie Economy Act* is a federal legislative initiative enacted by His Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. The Act aims to promote sustainable economic development in the Prairie provinces—Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba—by advancing a transition to a **green, climate-resilient, and inclusive economy**. It establishes a structured, collaborative framework for cross-sectoral coordination and long-term planning, with a strong emphasis on equity, local engagement, and environmental stewardship.

The Act is formally cited as the *Building a Green Prairie Economy Act* and serves as a foundational policy instrument to guide federal investment, policy integration, and intergovernmental cooperation in support of climate action and economic transformation in the region.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Indigenous Governing Body**  
   - Refers to any council, government, or entity recognized and authorized to act on behalf of an Indigenous group, community, or people.  
   - This definition is grounded in **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, which affirms Indigenous rights.  
   - Ensures that Indigenous voices and governance structures are formally included in decision-making processes related to land, environment, and economic development.

2. **Minister**  
   - Specifically refers to the **Minister responsible for economic development in the Prairie provinces**.  
   - This minister leads the implementation of the Act and coordinates with other federal ministers to ensure a cohesive, multi-sectoral approach.

### **Core Provisions and Objectives**

#### **1. Development of a Coordinated Framework for Green Economy Implementation**

The Minister is required to, **in collaboration with five other federal ministers**, develop a comprehensive framework to:

- Coordinate local cooperation and engagement across federal programs  
- Promote **economic sustainability, growth, and employment** in the Prairie provinces  
- Align federal efforts with regional needs and climate goals  

**Ministers involved**:
- Minister of the Environment  
- Minister of Transport  
- Minister of Industry  
- Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food  
- Minister of Finance  
- Minister of Natural Resources  

This cross-ministerial collaboration ensures that policies in transportation, energy, agriculture, environment, and finance are aligned to support a unified green economy strategy.

#### **2. Consultation Requirements**

To ensure inclusivity and legitimacy, the Minister must **consult with** the following stakeholders during the development of the framework:

- Provincial government representatives (in transportation, environment, and employment)  
- Municipalities  
- Indigenous governing bodies  
- The private sector  
- Representatives of employers and employees  

**Important Note**:  
- Consultation is **only required if not already mandated** by another federal Act, provincial legislation, or municipal by-law.  
- This provision prevents duplication and respects existing governance structures while ensuring new initiatives are inclusive and participatory.

#### **3. Key Elements of the Framework**

The framework must include specific measures designed to achieve the following objectives:

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Improve transportation access in small communities** | Addresses the lack of viable transportation options in rural and small cities by advancing **innovative public transportation solutions** (e.g., electric buses, shared mobility, rural transit models). |
| **Foster job creation and skills transfer** | Supports the transition of communities historically dependent on traditional energy (e.g., oil, gas) to a **net-zero emissions economy** by creating new green jobs and transferring relevant skills (e.g., in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean technology). |
| **Prioritize natural infrastructure and clean environments** | Prioritizes projects that generate **natural capital**, such as: <br> - Tree-planting initiatives <br> - Solar energy projects <br> - Environmental management of the boreal forest <br> - Use of all energy sources, including **nuclear energy**, where appropriate and safe |
| **Support clean energy development** | Encourages innovation and expansion in clean energy across key sectors: <br> - Agriculture (e.g., precision farming, biogas) <br> - Forestry (e.g., carbon sequestration, sustainable timber) <br> - Transportation (e.g., electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel) <br> - Manufacturing (e.g., green manufacturing, circular economy) <br> - Tourism (e.g., eco-tourism, low-impact travel) |
| **Stimulate local green economy programs** | Establishes programs that are **tailored to local conditions**, and that actively involve: <br> - Local businesses <br> - Governments <br> - Civil society organizations (e.g., NGOs, community groups) |
| **Prepare climate-adaptive infrastructure** | Develops infrastructure that helps communities **adapt to climate change** and **mitigate its adverse effects** (e.g., flood-resistant buildings, drought-resilient agriculture, heat management in urban areas). |

### **Reporting Requirements**

The Act establishes a **transparent and accountable reporting mechanism** to monitor progress and ensure effectiveness.

#### **1. Initial Report (Within 12 months of enactment)**  
- The Minister must prepare a **detailed report** outlining the framework developed under Section 3.  
- The report must be **tabled in both Houses of Parliament** on any of the first 15 days after a House convenes following its completion.  
- The report must be **published on the federal department’s official website within 10 days** of being tabled.

> This ensures early transparency, public access, and parliamentary oversight.

#### **2. Progress Reports (Every 5 years, starting 2 years after the initial report)**  
- The Minister, **in collaboration with the same six federal ministers**, must prepare a **progress and effectiveness report** every **five years** (starting two years after the initial report).  
- The report must include:  
  - A summary of progress made in implementing the framework  
  - Evaluation of effectiveness and impact  
  - Clear conclusions and **recommendations for improvement or adjustment**  
- This report must also be **tabled in both Houses of Parliament** on any of the first 15 days after a House convenes.

> This creates a **long-term monitoring and evaluation cycle**, ensuring continuous improvement and accountability.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Climate Action and Net-Zero Transition**  
   - The Act directly supports Canada’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with a focus on the Prairie provinces—regions historically reliant on fossil fuels.

2. **Economic Diversification**  
   - Aims to reduce economic vulnerability in the Prairies by shifting investment toward sustainable industries, thereby creating new employment opportunities and reducing regional inequality.

3. **Inclusivity and Equity**  
   - Mandates consultation with Indigenous governing bodies, recognizing their rights and traditional knowledge.  
   - Promotes inclusion of local businesses, civil society, and workers in green economy initiatives.

4. **Cross-Sectoral Integration**  
   - Bridges traditionally siloed sectors (transportation, agriculture, environment, energy) through coordinated policy design and implementation.

5. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - Regular parliamentary reporting ensures public trust and enables democratic scrutiny of federal green economy investments.

6. **Adaptation to Climate Change**  
   - Goes beyond mitigation by emphasizing infrastructure that helps communities adapt to climate impacts (e.g., extreme weather, shifting precipitation patterns).
