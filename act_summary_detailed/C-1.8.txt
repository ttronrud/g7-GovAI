The provided text consists entirely of repeated annotations indicating that a particular legal provision has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Statute 2009, Chapter 23, Section 313**, and in one instance, a prior repeal by **Statute 1986, Chapter 26, Section 51**.

---

### 🔍 Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
This is **not a functioning act or statute** but rather a **repeal notice**. The repeated entries of:
> [Repealed, 2009, c. 23, s. 313]

indicate that the specific legal provision (or set of provisions) previously listed or referenced in a statute or regulation has been **officially removed from the law**.

#### 2. **Repeal Date and Legislative Action**
- **Repealed in 2009** under **Chapter 23, Section 313** of the *Statutes of Canada* (or the relevant provincial jurisdiction, depending on context).
- This section of the act (c. 23, s. 313) likely contains a list of provisions or subsections that were formally canceled.
- The repeal was part of a broader legislative amendment or consolidation effort to modernize, simplify, or remove outdated or redundant laws.

#### 3. **Prior Repeal (1986)**
- One entry notes:  
  > [Repealed, 1986, c. 26, s. 51]  
  This indicates that the provision may have been previously repealed in **1986** under **Chapter 26, Section 51**, and then **reinstated or referenced again** before being **finally repealed in 2009**.

> ⚠️ However, the fact that it is now listed as "repealed" in 2009 suggests that the 1986 repeal was either **incomplete or superseded**, and the 2009 repeal is the **final and definitive removal**.

#### 4. **Purpose of Repeal**
Common reasons for repealing a provision include:
- Obsolescence (the law no longer applies to current circumstances),
- Inconsistency with newer legislation,
- Redundancy (overlap with other laws),
- Legal or policy changes,
- Legislative consolidation (removing fragmented or overlapping rules).

#### 5. **Legal Implications**
- Any law or regulation that was previously governed by the repealed provision is **no longer valid**.
- Courts, government agencies, and individuals are **not bound** by it.
- References to the provision in prior documents or case law may need to be updated or interpreted in light of the repeal.

#### 6. **Absence of Content**
Importantly, **no actual text, definitions, or substantive provisions** of the original act are included in the provided text. The summary is purely about the **status** (repeal) of the law, not its content.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

> **There is no active or detailed act described in the provided text.**  
> Instead, the content is a list of **repeal notices** indicating that a legal provision (or multiple provisions) has been **officially canceled**:
> - First in **1986** (c. 26, s. 51),
> - And definitively in **2009** (c. 23, s. 313).

This means the law **no longer exists** in its former form and should not be referenced or applied in any legal or administrative context.

### 📌 Recommendation:
If you are researching a specific law or regulation, you should:
1. Consult the **official statutes database** (e.g., [CanLII](https://www.canlii.org), [ParlInfo](https://www.parl.ca), or the relevant provincial legislative website),
2. Search for **Chapter 23, 2009**, or **Section 313**, to understand the scope of the repeal,
3. Check whether the provision was part of a larger legislative reform or consolidation.
