The **Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act (FPLRRA)** is a foundational piece of legislation in Canada that establishes the framework for labour-management relations within the federal public service. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the Act, covering its purpose, key definitions, core principles, institutional roles, and procedural mechanisms.

## 🔍 **Overview and Purpose**

The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act (FPLRRA) was enacted to:

- Ensure that labour-management relations in the federal public service are **fair, effective, and respectful of the public interest**.
- Promote **collaborative, transparent, and constructive dialogue** between employers (the Government of Canada) and employee representatives (bargaining agents).
- Protect the **public interest** by ensuring that public services operate efficiently and with accountability.
- Provide a **structured, equitable system** for collective bargaining, dispute resolution, and workplace relations.

It reflects the government’s commitment to balancing employee rights with operational effectiveness and national security.

> The Act recognizes that public service employees are not just workers—they are stewards of public trust, and their voices must be heard in decisions affecting their working conditions.
