**Detailed Summary of the Act**

**Title:**  
*An Act to incorporate the Western Canada Telephone Company, being Chapter 66 of the Statutes of Canada, 1916, is repealed.*

**Purpose and Context:**  
This legislative instrument serves as a formal repeal of an outdated corporate incorporation statute—specifically, Chapter 66 of the Statutes of Canada, 1916, which originally provided the legal framework for incorporating the *Western Canada Telephone Company* (WCTC). The repeal reflects the modernization of Canada’s corporate legal framework, as older statutes are replaced or amended to align with current regulatory and corporate governance standards.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Chapter 66 of the Statutes of Canada, 1916:**  
   The Act formally repeals the original incorporation law for the Western Canada Telephone Company. This means that the legal basis under which the company was originally established—specifically, the 1916 statute—is no longer in force. The repeal is not a dissolution of the company but a removal of the original legal charter that governed its formation and operation under that old legislation.

2. **Continuation of TELUS Communications (B.C.) Inc. as a Legal Entity:**  
   Despite the repeal of the 1916 statute, the company known as *TELUS Communications (B.C.) Inc.* continues to exist as a legally recognized entity. This continuity is crucial to ensure business stability and legal certainty.  
   - TELUS Communications (B.C.) Inc. is now governed by the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA), which is the current federal law governing the formation, operation, and regulation of business corporations in Canada.  
   - The repeal does not terminate or dissolve the company; rather, it transfers its legal status and governance to the modern CBCA framework.

3. **Protection of Existing Rights and Interests:**  
   The rights of various stakeholders associated with TELUS Communications (B.C.) Inc. are explicitly preserved:  
   - Holders of securities (e.g., shares)  
   - Holders of debentures (debenture holders) under trust deeds  
   - Beneficiaries of other financial instruments issued by or in respect of the company  
   These rights are not affected by the repeal of the 1916 statute. This provision ensures legal protection for investors and creditors, preventing any unintended loss of entitlements due to the change in corporate legislation.

4. **Coming Into Force:**  
   The Act does not take effect immediately. It comes into force on a day to be designated by the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet). This allows for administrative and regulatory preparation before the repeal is fully operational.  
   - The Act was actually enacted into force on **February 1, 2001**, as noted in the official citation (SI/2001-18 – Statutory Instrument 2001-18). This date marks the effective date of the repeal and the transition of TELUS (B.C.) Inc. to full operation under the CBCA.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Modernization of Corporate Law:** The repeal reflects a broader trend in Canadian legislation to replace archaic statutes with modern, flexible, and standardized corporate laws. The Canada Business Corporations Act provides a uniform, comprehensive, and adaptable legal structure for all Canadian corporations, including those in the telecommunications sector.

- **Business Continuity:** The continuation of TELUS Communications (B.C.) Inc. under the CBCA ensures that the company can operate without disruption. This is particularly important in the telecommunications industry, where continuity of service and investor confidence are essential.

- **Legal Certainty for Stakeholders:** By protecting the rights of shareholders, debenture holders, and beneficiaries, the Act safeguards the interests of those who have invested in or relied upon the company’s financial instruments. This prevents legal uncertainty or claims of unfair treatment due to the repeal of an old statute.

- **Historical Note:** The Western Canada Telephone Company was a historical entity that played a role in the development of telecommunications infrastructure in Western Canada. Its original incorporation under the 1916 statute is now obsolete, but its legacy lives on through the modern TELUS Corporation, which has evolved into a major telecommunications provider in Canada.

**Conclusion:**  
This Act is a concise but significant piece of legislative modernization. It formally removes an outdated corporate charter while ensuring that the successor entity—TELUS Communications (B.C.) Inc.—continues to exist and operate under current, applicable corporate law. It affirms legal protections for investors and creditors and marks a transition from historical to contemporary corporate governance in Canada’s telecommunications sector. The effective date of February 1, 2001, reflects a deliberate and orderly process to implement this change without disrupting ongoing operations or financial commitments.
