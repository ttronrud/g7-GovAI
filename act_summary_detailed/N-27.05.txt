**Detailed Summary of the *Northwest Territories Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Northwest Territories Act* (NWT Act) is a foundational piece of legislation governing the administration, governance, and legislative powers of the Northwest Territories (NWT) in Canada. It replaced the former *Northwest Territories Act, Chapter N-27 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985* ("former Act") and came into force on June 25, 2013, as part of broader efforts to modernize governance and recognize Indigenous rights through land claims and self-government agreements.

This Act establishes a framework for the territorial government, defines key terms, outlines legislative authority, and incorporates provisions related to Indigenous rights, environmental management, natural resource development, and intergovernmental cooperation — particularly with respect to federal responsibilities and Aboriginal organizations.
