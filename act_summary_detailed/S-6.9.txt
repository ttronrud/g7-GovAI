### **Detailed Summary of the *Security of Canada Information Disclosure Act***

---

#### **Overview**
The *Security of Canada Information Disclosure Act* (SCIDA) is a federal law enacted to **facilitate the responsible and effective sharing of sensitive information among Government of Canada institutions** in order to **protect Canada’s national security and the safety of its people**. It recognizes that threats to Canada’s security are increasingly complex, global, and covert, and that no single government agency can operate in isolation when responding to such threats.

The Act establishes a **clear legal framework** for inter-agency information sharing, balancing the need for timely intelligence cooperation with the imperative to **respect privacy rights, uphold legal accountability, and prevent misuse of information**.

---

## **Key Background and Legislative Principles**

The Act begins with several foundational "wheres," which establish the rationale behind its creation:

1. **Right to Safety**: Canadians are entitled to live free from threats to their lives and security.
2. **Nature of Modern Threats**: Security threats are now clandestine, deceptive, global, sophisticated, and rapidly evolving.
3. **Core Government Duty**: Protecting the country and its citizens is the most fundamental role of government.
4. **Non-Use as a Conduit**: Canada must not be used as a tool or channel for activities that threaten another nation’s security.
5. **Transcendence of Institutional Capacity**: No single institution can alone manage or respond to all security threats — collaboration is essential.
6. **Need for Information Sharing**: Effective protection requires the aggregation and disclosure of disparate information across agencies.
7. **Accountability and Compliance**: All disclosures must be responsible, lawful, and respectful of privacy laws, including the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the *Privacy Act*.
8. **Need for Explicit Authority**: A clear, statutory authority is required to enable effective and responsible information sharing.

## **Core Definitions**

### 1. **Activity that Undermines the Security of Canada**
This is the central concept defining what constitutes a threat under the Act. It includes:

- Interference with government functions in areas such as:
  - Intelligence
  - Defence
  - Border operations
  - Public safety  
- Use of force or unlawful means to influence a Canadian government
- Espionage, sabotage, or covert foreign-influenced operations
- Terrorism
- Proliferation of nuclear, chemical, radiological, or biological weapons
- Significant or widespread interference with:
  - Critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, water systems)
  - Global information infrastructure (as defined in the *Communications Security Establishment Act*)
- Conduct occurring in Canada that undermines the security of another state

> **Note**: Advocacy, protest, dissent, or artistic expression is *not* considered an activity that undermines security — unless it occurs in conjunction with a security-threatening activity.

---

### 2. **Government of Canada Institution**
Refers to:
- Any government institution defined in **section 3 of the Privacy Act**, *except* those listed in **Schedule 1** (which are excluded due to specific sensitivities).
- Institutions explicitly listed in **Schedule 2**.

> This ensures that only institutions with legitimate security-related mandates are included in the sharing framework.

---

### 3. **People of Canada**  
*Note: This definition was repealed in 2019 (c. 13, s. 115)* — it is no longer part of the current Act.

---

## **Purpose of the Act**
To **encourage and facilitate the disclosure of information** between Government of Canada institutions so that Canada can effectively protect itself against activities that undermine its sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity.

---

## **Guiding Principles for Disclosure**

The Act is guided by five key principles:

1. **Effective and Responsible Disclosure**  
   Information sharing must directly contribute to protecting Canada and its people.

2. **Respect for Caveats and Originator Control**  
   The original source of information must retain control over how it is used, and any restrictions (caveats) must be respected.

3. **Appropriate Entry into Information-Sharing Arrangements**  
   Sharing should occur regularly between institutions that already exchange information — indicating a proven need and operational relationship.

4. **Feedback Mechanism**  
   Recipient institutions must provide feedback on:
   - How the information was used
   - Whether it was useful in preventing or responding to threats  
   This promotes accountability and continuous improvement.

5. **Limited Access Based on Jurisdiction**  
   Only individuals within an institution who carry out duties related to activities that undermine security should receive disclosed information — ensuring minimal exposure and targeted access.

---

## **When and How Information Can Be Disclosed**

### **Section 5 – Authority to Disclose Information**

A Government of Canada institution may disclose information **if**:

- The disclosure will help the recipient institution:
  - Exercise its jurisdiction under an Act of Parliament
  - Carry out its responsibilities under a lawful authority
  - In relation to activities that undermine the security of Canada

- The disclosure will **not affect any individual’s privacy interest more than is reasonably necessary**.

> This is a **permissive, discretionary power** — institutions may act on their own initiative or upon request.

### **Mandatory Disclosure Requirements**

Upon disclosure, the **disclosing institution must provide**:
- A statement of **accuracy** of the information
- A statement of **reliability** of the method used to obtain it

This ensures transparency and helps build trust in the integrity of shared intelligence.

---

## **Retention and Destruction of Personal Information**

### **Section 5.1 – Handling of Personal Information**

- Any personal information (as defined in the *Privacy Act*) that is **not necessary** for the institution to fulfill its security-related duties must be:
  - **Destroyed**, or
  - **Returned** to the disclosing institution

> This is a strict requirement to protect individual privacy rights.

### **Exceptions**
- The rule **does not apply** if:
  - Retention is required by law
  - The **Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)** is involved and the information relates to its duties under **section 12 of the CSIS Act**

> This recognizes CSIS’s unique mandate and legal immunity in certain cases.

---

## **Prohibitions and Limitations**

- **No Authorization for Collection or Use**  
  The Act **does not authorize** the collection or use of information beyond what is disclosed. It only governs the sharing of existing information.

- **No Presumption of Joint Investigation or Waiver of Privilege**  
  Disclosure under this Act:
  - Does **not** imply that the disclosing and receiving institutions are conducting a joint investigation
  - Does **not** create a presumption that the disclosing institution has the same obligations (e.g., to produce evidence in legal proceedings)
  - Does **not** waive any legal privilege (e.g., confidentiality in court) or require consent for disclosure to non-government entities

> This protects institutional independence and legal rights.

---

## **Privacy Act Implications**

- The Act **explicitly includes** the authority to disclose **personal information** under the *Privacy Act* (paragraph 8(2)(b))  
- This means that even personal data (e.g., names, addresses, biometrics) can be shared under this Act, provided it meets the thresholds of necessity and proportionality.

> This is a significant expansion of information-sharing powers, but is tightly constrained by privacy safeguards.

---

## **Recordkeeping Requirements**

All institutions involved must maintain detailed records of all disclosures and receptions:

### **For Institutions That Disclose Information (Disclosure Records)**  
Must include:
- Description of the information
- Name of individual who authorized disclosure
- Name of recipient institution
- Date of disclosure
- Description of information used to justify the disclosure
- Any other information specified by regulation

### **For Institutions That Receive Information (Reception Records)**  
Must include:
- Description of the information
- Name of disclosing institution
- Name or position of the head of the recipient institution (or designated person)
- Date received
- Whether the information was destroyed or returned
- If destroyed: date of destruction
- If returned: date of return
- Any other information specified by regulation

> These records ensure **transparency, accountability, and auditability**.

---

## **Annual Reporting to the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA)**

- **Within 30 days after the end of each calendar year**, every institution that:
  - Disclosed information under Section 5, or
  - Received such information  
  must submit a **copy of all relevant records** to the **NSIRA**.

> This allows independent oversight and public accountability, while protecting sensitive details through redaction.

---

## **Regulatory Powers (Governor in Council)**

The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) may make regulations to:

1. **Specify the manner of disclosure** under Section 5  
2. **Define specific types of information** for purposes of certain clauses (e.g., paragraph 9(1)(f) or (2)(f))  
3. **Prescribe how records are to be prepared, kept, and retained**, including:
   - Format
   - Duration of retention (e.g., 5 years, 10 years)

> These regulations allow flexibility to adapt to emerging threats and technological changes.

---

## **Schedules and Institutional Inclusion**

### **Schedule 1**  
Lists institutions **excluded** from the scope of the Act due to high sensitivity (e.g., institutions dealing with personal data or classified operations).  
> The Governor in Council can **add or remove** institutions from this list.

### **Schedule 2**  
Lists institutions that are **included** in the Act’s scope.  
> Can be amended or updated by order.

### **Schedule 3**  
Lists **
