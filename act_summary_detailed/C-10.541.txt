### **2. Definitions**

Key terms are clearly defined to ensure clarity and consistency in interpretation:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Ukraine, signed on September 22, 2023.
- **Commission**: Refers to the **Joint Commission** established under **Paragraph 1 of Article 27.1** of the Agreement. This body serves as the central coordinating mechanism for ongoing negotiations, dispute resolution, and monitoring of implementation.
- **Federal Law**: Includes any Act of Parliament or regulatory instrument (orders, regulations, etc.) made under parliamentary authority.
- **Minister**: Specifically defined as the **Minister for International Trade**.

> These definitions ensure legal precision and alignment with the Agreement’s language.

---

### **3. Interpretation Principles**

Two critical interpretive principles are included:

- **Consistency with the Agreement**: All provisions of this Act and any federal law implementing the Agreement must be interpreted **in a manner consistent with the Agreement**.
- **Exclusion of Natural Resources**: Nothing in the Act applies to **natural surface or ground water** in any state (liquid, gaseous, or solid). This clarifies that environmental protections under the Agreement do not extend to water resources, which are governed separately.

> This exclusion is important to prevent overreach and to avoid conflicts with existing environmental legislation governing water.

- **Parliamentary Sovereignty**: The Act explicitly confirms that **Parliament retains full legislative authority** to pass laws implementing the Agreement or fulfilling obligations under it. No provision in this Act limits Parliament’s ability to legislate in this area.

---

### **4. Legal Binding and Enforcement**

- The Act is **binding on His Majesty in right of Canada**, meaning it has direct legal effect on the federal government.
- **No private enforcement**: Under **Section 9–15** and **Article 20.24 of the Agreement**, **no individual or entity may bring legal proceedings** to enforce rights or obligations arising solely from those provisions—**unless authorized by the Attorney General of Canada**.

> This is a significant protection for the Government, allowing it to manage disputes and obligations without exposing private parties to litigation.

---

### **5. Approval of the Agreement**

- The **Agreement is formally approved** by the Canadian Parliament through this Act. This is a necessary step to give the Agreement legal force and enable its implementation.

---

The Minister is the **principal representative of Canada** on the **Joint Commission** and has key responsibilities:

#### a) Appointment Powers
- Can appoint Canadian representatives to:
  - Committees, subcommittees, or working groups under **Article 27.1** of the Agreement (subject to subsection (2) and paragraph (3)(a));
  - A **panellist** as per **Article 28.8**;
  - Propose or select the **chair of a panel** under Article 28.8.

#### b) Environmental Representation

- The **Minister of Labour** may:
  - Appoint representatives to the **Labour Council** under **Article 14.10**;
  - Designate a **National Administrative Office** under **Article 14.11**.

> These appointments ensure that key policy areas (environment, labor) are adequately represented in the Commission and related bodies.

---

### **7. Administrative Support and Cost Responsibility**

- The Government of Canada is responsible for:
  - Designating an **agency, division, or branch** to facilitate the operation of **Chapter 28** of the Agreement (which deals with dispute settlement and panels).

- The Government bears the **full or appropriate share of costs**, including:
  - Remuneration and expenses for:
    - Panel members, committee members, working groups, expert groups, and assistants;

- Suspension of rights or privileges granted to Ukraine or its businesses/investors;
- Modification or suspension of federal laws affecting Ukraine or its entities;
- Extension of federal laws to Ukraine;
- Any other measure deemed necessary under Article 28.13 of the Agreement.

> These powers are **temporary and limited**—an order remains in effect only for the duration specified in it, unless otherwise extended.

> This provision provides **flexibility during crises**, such as economic instability, non-compliance, or security concerns, but is subject to strict oversight.

---

### **9. Compliance with Principles and Guidelines (Section 20)**

- The **Minister for International Trade** is required to ensure that **Canadian companies operating in Ukraine** comply with the **principles and guidelines** set out in **Article 15.14** of the Agreement. These include:
  - Human rights;
  - Anti-corruption;

- The Minister must also:
  - Establish a **complaint mechanism** for individuals or organizations to report violations of these principles.
  - Prepare and publish an **annual report** (starting in 2025) summarizing:
    - Activities related to compliance;
    - Enforcement actions;
    - Challenges and outcomes.

- The report must be **tabled in both Houses of Parliament** within the first 30 days after completion.

> This creates a **transparent, accountable, and responsive system** for monitoring corporate behavior in Ukraine.

---

### **10. Repeal and Entry into Force**

- The **old Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Chapter 8 of the Statutes of Canada, 2017**, is **repealed** to ensure legal clarity and prevent overlap.

- This Act comes into force on a **day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the Cabinet).

> **Note**: Certain provisions (specifically subsections 19(3), 20(2) and (4), 21(2), 22(2), 23(2), 24(2), 25(2), and 26(2)) will **come into force six years after the initial date of enactment**. This staggered implementation allows for phased adaptation and regulatory development.

> As of July 1, 2024, most of the Act is already in force (per SI/2024-16), with the delayed provisions activating on the sixth anniversary of the effective date.
