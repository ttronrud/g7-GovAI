**Detailed Summary of the *Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act* (the "Act") establishes a **fair, efficient, and proportionate administrative monetary penalty (AMP) system** to enforce compliance with key Canadian agri-food legislation. It serves as an **alternative to criminal prosecution** and a **supplement to existing enforcement mechanisms**, allowing for faster, more flexible, and cost-effective resolution of violations—particularly those that do not constitute serious criminal offences.

The Act applies to a range of agri-food-related laws, including the *Farm Debt Mediation Act*, *Feeds Act*, *Fertilizers Act*, *Health of Animals Act*, *Pest Control Products Act*, *Plant Protection Act*, and *Safe Food for Canadians Act*. Its primary goal is to improve regulatory compliance while minimizing the burden on individuals and businesses, especially small operators.

3. **Establishing penalties** for each violation, including:
   - A **range of penalties** (e.g., $5,000 to $25,000).

## **Who Can Issue Notices of Violation?**

The Minister may designate **specific individuals or classes of persons** (e.g., inspectors, officers) to issue **notices of violation**. These notices must:
- Name the person,
- Identify the violation,
- Include a **warning** (if applicable), or
- State the **penalty amount**, payment deadline, and **option for a reduced payment** (if allowed by regulation).

---

## **Content and Rights in a Notice of Violation**

Every notice must:
- Clearly summarize, in **plain language**, the **rights and obligations** of the person served, including:
  - Right to request a **review of the facts** by the Minister or the Tribunal.
  - Procedure for making such a request.

### **Two Types of Notices**

| Type | Content |
|------|--------|
| **With Warning** | The person is warned they have committed a violation. They may request a review by the Minister or Tribunal within the prescribed time. If no review is requested, they are **deemed to have committed the violation**. |
| **With Penalty** | Specifies the penalty amount, payment deadline, and optional reduced payment. |

> 🔍 **Important**: If a person pays the full penalty or the reduced amount **within the prescribed time and manner**, they are **deemed to have committed the violation**, and the proceedings end.

---

## **Options for the Person Served**

Instead of paying the penalty, the person may:
1. **Request a compliance agreement** (only if the penalty is $2,000 or more).
2. **Request a review by the Minister** of the facts.
3. **Request a review by the Tribunal** of the facts.

> ❌ If the person **fails to pay the penalty or make a request** within the prescribed time, they are **deemed to have committed the violation**.

---

## **Compliance Agreements**

- A person may request a **compliance agreement** with the Minister to ensure future compliance.
- The Minister may enter into such an agreement **on terms and conditions** that are satisfactory, including:
  - Requiring **reasonable security** (e.g., bond or deposit) as a guarantee of compliance.
  - **Reducing the penalty** in whole or in part.
- Upon entering into the agreement:
  - The person is **deemed to have committed the violation**.
- If the person **complies with the agreement**, the Minister:
  - Serves a **notice of compliance**.
  - The proceedings end.
  - Any security is **returned** to the person.
- If the person **fails to comply**:
  - The Minister serves a **notice of default** stating:
    - The person must pay **twice the original penalty**, or
    - The security is **forfeited** to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- Upon payment of the default amount:
  - The amount is accepted as full satisfaction.
  - Proceedings end.

> 💡 This mechanism promotes **correction over punishment** and allows for **rehabilitation**.

## **Review Process**

### **1. Review by the Minister (Under Section 8)**
- After a request for review, the Minister determines whether the violation occurred.
- If the violation is confirmed, the person may:
  - Pay the penalty, or
  - Request a **review by the Tribunal**.

### **2. Review by the Tribunal (Under Section 13 & 14)**
- The Tribunal may:
  - **Confirm, vary, or set aside** the Minister’s decision.
  - Determine whether the violation occurred.
  - If the violation occurred but the penalty was **not properly established**, the Tribunal **corrects the penalty amount**.
- The Tribunal’s decision is **final** and binding.
- The person must pay the penalty as ordered.
- Upon payment, the Minister accepts it as full satisfaction, and the proceedings end.

> 📌 The Tribunal’s role is **final appellate review**—it ensures fairness and consistency in penalty determination.
