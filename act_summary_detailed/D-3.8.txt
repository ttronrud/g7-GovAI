**Detailed Summary of the DNA Identification Act (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The **DNA Identification Act** is a federal law enacted by Her Majesty in Council, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada. It establishes a **national DNA data bank** to support law enforcement efforts in identifying individuals involved in criminal investigations and to assist in locating missing persons and identifying human remains. The Act ensures that the use of DNA profiling is strictly governed, with strong privacy protections and safeguards against misuse.

## **1. Key Definitions**

The Act defines several key terms used throughout:

- **Authorization**: A legal authorization granted under either:
  - Section 487.055 or 487.091 of the *Criminal Code* (for criminal investigations), or
  - Section 196.24 of the *National Defence Act* (for military-related cases).

- **Commissioner**: Refers to the **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, who is responsible for administering the DNA data bank.

- **Designated Offence**: A crime specified under either:
  - Section 487.04 of the *Criminal Code*, or

- **DNA**: Deoxyribonucleic acid — the genetic material found in all living organisms.

- **DNA Profile**: The unique forensic fingerprint derived from analyzing DNA in a bodily substance (e.g., blood, saliva, hair).

- **Forensic DNA Analysis**: The scientific process of extracting and analyzing DNA from a bodily sample.

- **Human Remains**: Includes any detached body part, even if the person is still alive (e.g., in cases of trauma or medical procedures).

- **Investigating Authority**: Any of the following:
  - A Canadian law enforcement agency;
  - A coroner, medical examiner, or similar official acting under statutory duties;
  - A laboratory involved in an investigation.

## **2. Purpose of the Act**

The primary objectives are:

1. **Criminal Identification**: To help law enforcement identify individuals suspected of committing designated offences — including those committed before the Act came into force.
2. **Missing Persons & Human Remains Identification**: To assist in locating missing persons and identifying human remains through DNA matching.

This dual purpose underscores the Act’s role in both **public safety** and **social welfare**.

---

## **3. Core Principles and Values**

The Act recognizes and affirms several foundational principles:

- **Justice and Public Safety**: Early detection, arrest, and conviction of offenders are enhanced by DNA profiling.
- **Social Welfare**: Locating missing persons and identifying human remains serves societal well-being.
- **Privacy Protection**: DNA profiles and bodily samples must be used only as authorized and protected under strict conditions.
- **Safeguards**: Access, use, and communication of DNA data are strictly regulated to protect individual privacy and prevent misuse.

## **4. Establishment of the National DNA Data Bank**

The **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** is responsible for establishing a **national DNA data bank**, maintained by the **Commissioner of the RCMP**.

The data bank is structured into **six distinct indices**, each serving a specific purpose:

| Index | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Crime Scene Index** | Contains DNA profiles from bodily substances found at crime scenes, on victims, or on items worn/carrying the victim. |
| **Convicted Offenders Index** | Contains DNA profiles from individuals who have been convicted of designated offences and have submitted samples under orders or authorizations. |
| **Victims Index** | Contains DNA profiles from victims of designated offences, either voluntarily submitted or obtained from personal effects, remains, or associated locations when the victim is deceased or unable to consent. |
| **Missing Persons Index** | Contains DNA profiles from missing persons, including those obtained from personal effects. |
| **Relatives of Missing Persons Index** | Contains DNA profiles from relatives who voluntarily submit samples to help confirm the identity of a missing person or human remains. |
| **Voluntary Donors Index** | Contains DNA profiles from individuals (not victims) who voluntarily donate samples, with the potential relevance to investigations involving designated offences or missing persons/human remains. |

> *Note:* Each profile is accompanied by **associated information**, such as:
> - The case number of the investigation (for crime scene, convicted offenders, victims);
> - Identity of the person from whom the sample was taken (if known);
> - Biological relationship (e.g., parent-child) where relevant.

---

## **5. Procedures for Adding DNA Profiles to the Indices**

Profiles are only added to the data bank under specific conditions:

### **Crime Scene Index**
- Profiles are added when DNA is found at a crime scene, on a victim, or on items associated with the offence.

### **Convicted Offenders Index**
- Profiles are added when samples are taken under **valid orders or authorizations**.

### **Victims Index**
- **Voluntary submission** by the victim.
- If the victim is **unidentified, deceased, or unable to consent**, samples may be obtained from:
  - Personal effects;
  - Locations associated with the offence;
  - Human remains (if deceased).

> **Requirement**: The Commissioner must have **reasonable grounds to suspect** that comparing the profile will assist in investigating a designated offence.

### **Missing Persons Index**
- Profiles are added only if:
  - There is reasonable suspicion the comparison will assist in finding the missing person;
  - Other investigative methods have failed or are unlikely to succeed;
  - The situation is urgent.

### **Relatives of Missing Persons Index**
- Only if:
  - The relative voluntarily submits a sample;
  - The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe the profile will help confirm identity;
  - The person providing the sample gives **written consent** (as per regulations).

### **Voluntary Donors Index**
- Only if:
  - The donor provides **written consent**;
  - The profile may assist in an investigation involving a designated offence or missing person/human remains.

## **6. Forensic Analysis and Review of Orders/Authorizations**

When a sample is submitted under an order or authorization, the **Commissioner must verify**:

- Whether the offence described is a **designated offence**.

### **If the offence is a designated offence**:
- The Commissioner conducts **forensic DNA analysis**.
- The resulting DNA profile is added to the **convicted offenders index**.
- A copy of the order or authorization is retained.

### **If the offence is NOT a designated offence**:
- The Commissioner **retains** the bodily substance and related information.
- Sends a **notice of defect** to:
  - The **Attorney General of the province** (if under Criminal Code);
  - The **Director of Military Prosecutions** (if under National Defence Act).

#### **Outcomes of Review**:
- If the Attorney General or Director confirms the order is valid, or provides a corrected version → analysis proceeds.
- If they confirm the offence is not designated → the sample and data are **destroyed immediately**.
- If the review is pending (e.g., before a judge or in court) → the sample is retained for up to **180 days**, with possible extension of up to **90 days**.

> *After 180 days*, unless a valid confirmation, correction, or review notice is received, the sample and data are **destroyed**.

## **7. DNA Profile Comparisons and Communication of Information**

The Commissioner must **compare every new DNA profile** added to any index with all existing profiles in that index.

### **Types of Comparisons and Actions**:

| Scenario | Action Taken |
|--------|-------------|
| **Match found (not in missing persons/human remains index)** | Communicate information to appropriate law enforcement agencies or labs for: <br> - Investigation of a designated offence (if profile is in victims index); <br> - Any designated offence (in all other cases). |
| **Match found (in missing persons/human remains index)** | Communicate information to investigating authorities for the purpose of identifying a missing person or human remains. |
| **Profiles are similar (no match but similar)** | Communicate to authorities to assess whether a match is possible. |
| **Authorities confirm similarity and no match excluded** | Treated as a match and communicated under applicable rules. |
| **No match or similar result** | Communicate the fact to relevant investigating authorities. |

> **Subsequent communication** is permitted under strict conditions:
> - To individuals involved in investigations or prosecutions;
> - To law enforcement members who have **reasonable grounds** to believe the information will assist in the investigation or prosecution.

## **8. International Cooperation**

The Commissioner may communicate DNA profiles to foreign governments, international organizations, or institutions **only if**:

- A formal **agreement or arrangement** exists with that entity (as per regulations);
- The communication is solely for:
  - Investigation or prosecution of a **designated offence** (for crime scene, convicted offenders, etc.);
  - Investigation of a **missing person or human remains** (for missing persons/human remains indices).

### **Types of International Communications**:
- **Receiving a profile from
