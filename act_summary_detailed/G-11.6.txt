The provided text consists solely of repeated notes stating:

> "[Repealed before coming into force, 2008, c. 20, s. 3]"

This indicates that the specific legislation or section in question was **repealed (cancelled or abolished) prior to coming into effect**. The details are as follows:

- **Repealed before coming into force**: The provision was not enacted or implemented as intended; it was formally removed before it could take effect.
- **Year**: 2008
- **Statute**: Chapter 20 of the Statutes of the year 2008 (commonly referred to as "c. 20")
- **Section**: Section 3 of that chapter

This means that the act or section originally intended to be introduced or applied in 2008 was **never actually in force**, because it was formally repealed (cancelled) before it could be enacted. The repealing legislation (c. 20, s. 3) likely removed the provision due to legislative review, redundancy, inconsistency, or policy change.

### Summary:
The referenced act or section has **no legal effect** because it was **repealed before it came into force** in 2008. As such, it does not form part of current law and should not be considered in legal or regulatory contexts. The repeated entries suggest that multiple provisions or sections were affected by the same repeal, possibly indicating a broader legislative revision or consolidation.

### Conclusion:
There is **no detailed content** to summarize because the original act or section was **never enacted**. The information provided only reflects its **repeal status**, not its substance, purpose, or provisions. Therefore, the summary is that the legislation was **not enacted** and **does not exist in current law**.
