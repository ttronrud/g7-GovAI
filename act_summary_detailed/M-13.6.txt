**Detailed Summary of the *Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act* (MLA Act) establishes the legal framework by which Canada provides and receives mutual legal assistance in criminal matters from other countries and international bodies. It enables cooperation between Canadian authorities and foreign states or international tribunals to investigate, prosecute, and enforce criminal offences across jurisdictions. The Act ensures that such cooperation is conducted in a lawful, transparent, and consistent manner, respecting Canada’s sovereignty, human rights, and the rule of law.

This Act is central to Canada’s international criminal justice cooperation and is designed to support investigations and prosecutions involving cross-border crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking, financial crime, fraud, and human rights violations.

## **Key Definitions**

The Act begins with a clear set of definitions that shape its application:

1. **Agreement**  
   - Refers to any treaty, convention, or international agreement in force to which Canada is a party and that includes provisions on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.  
   - Also includes, *to the extent applicable to criminal investigations or prosecutions*, the **Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (1988)**, as amended, and **comprehensive tax information exchange agreements** or **tax treaties** (as defined in section 248(1) of the *Income Tax Act*).  
   - *Note*: The 1999 repeal of "treaty" and "foreign state" is relevant—these terms are now obsolete, and the Act focuses on active agreements and specific international institutions.

2. **Competent Authority**  
   - Includes:
     - The **Attorney General of Canada**
     - The **attorney general of a province**
     - Any person or authority responsible in Canada for investigating or prosecuting offences  
   - This ensures that the appropriate legal bodies are empowered to act on requests.

3. **Data**  
   - Defined broadly as representations (e.g., signs, signals, symbols) that can be understood by individuals or processed by computers.  
   - This definition supports modern digital evidence, including electronic records, metadata, and digital communications.

4. **Record**  
   - A physical or digital medium on which data is stored or marked (e.g., hard drives, paper files, databases).  
   - Important for requests involving evidence preservation or access.

5. **Request**  
   - A formal request for assistance (e.g., evidence, witness testimony, document production) submitted under an agreement.

6. **State or Entity**  
   - Includes:
     - A state, province, or political subdivision of a state that is a party to an agreement with Canada.
     - An **international criminal court or tribunal** whose name appears in the *Schedule* to the Act.  
   - This allows Canada to engage with international justice bodies such as the International Criminal Court (ICC).

7. **Judge**  
   - Specifies which judges have jurisdiction in each province:
     - Ontario: Superior Court of Justice  
     - Prince Edward Island: Trial Division of Supreme Court  
     - Quebec: Superior Court  
     - New Brunswick, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan: Court of Queen’s Bench  
     - Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut: Supreme Court (or Nunavut Court of Justice in Nunavut)  
   - Ensures that enforcement actions are carried out by appropriate judicial bodies.

8. **Minister**  
   - Refers to the **Minister of Justice**, who is responsible for administering the Act and implementing international agreements.

## **General Principles and Provisions**

### **1. Supremacy of This Act**
- If there is a conflict between this Act and another federal law (excluding laws that prohibit disclosure of information under certain conditions), **this Act prevails**.
- This ensures that mutual legal assistance obligations take priority over conflicting domestic rules.

### **2. Non-Abrogation of Existing Cooperation**
- The Act **does not override or undermine existing arrangements** between Canadian authorities and foreign bodies. It respects existing practices and agreements.

### **3. Judicial Notice of Agreements**
- Agreements and provisions published in the **Canada Gazette** or the **Canada Treaty Series** are **judicially noticed**—meaning courts must treat them as valid and binding without requiring further proof.

---

## **Implementation of Agreements**

### **Publication Requirement**
- Any international agreement (treaty, convention) related to mutual legal assistance must be:
  - Published in the **Canada Gazette** within **60 days** of coming into force.
  - Or published in the **Canada Treaty Series** (if applicable), also within 60 days.
- This ensures transparency and legal certainty for all stakeholders.

## **Administrative Arrangements (Where No Formal Agreement Exists)**

When **no formal agreement** exists between Canada and a foreign state or entity, or when the state/entity is not listed in the Schedule, the Minister of Foreign Affairs may enter into an **administrative arrangement** with the state/entity.

### **Conditions for Administrative Arrangements**
- **Type 1 (Investigations of Indictable Offences):**  
  - For investigations of acts that would constitute an **indictable offence** in Canada.  
  - Must be for a **specific investigation** and limited in scope.

- **Type 2 (Non-Offence Acts):**  
  - In **exceptional circumstances**, for acts that would be **contraventions of federal or provincial laws** (e.g., violations of environmental or trade laws), not criminal offences per se.  
  - Requires **Ministerial agreement** and is only available in rare, justified cases.

### **Key Features of Administrative Arrangements**
- Can be implemented **in the same way as a formal agreement** under this Act.
- **Duration:** Limited to **no more than six months**.
- **Scope:** Limited to the **specific type of legal assistance** specified in the arrangement.
- **Exclusion of Sections 4 and 5:** These sections (which may relate to procedural or evidentiary requirements) **do not apply** to administrative arrangements.
- **Admissibility in Evidence:**  
  - An administrative arrangement signed by the Minister or a designated officer is **admissible in evidence** without proof of signature or official character—this streamlines enforcement and reduces procedural delays.

## **Minister’s Role and Responsibility**

- The **Minister of Justice** is **responsible for**:
  - Implementing all international agreements related to mutual legal assistance.
  - Administering the Act.
  - Receiving and processing requests from foreign states or entities.

---

## **Processing Requests**

- When a request is made under an agreement:
  - The Minister must process it **in accordance with the agreement and this Act**.
  - **Exception:** The Minister **cannot give effect** to a request unless the agreement explicitly provides for assistance on the subject matter of the request.

- **Exception for States/Entities in the Schedule:**  
  - If the requesting state/entity is listed in the Schedule (e.g., ICC), the Minister **may provide assistance on any subject matter**, even if not explicitly covered in the agreement.

## **Enforcement of Fines (Section 9.1)**

### **Purpose**
- To allow Canada to enforce **fines imposed by foreign courts** in criminal cases.

### **Key Provisions**
- When a foreign court imposes a fine for an offence, and Canada receives a request to enforce it:
  - A **Canadian court has jurisdiction** to enforce the fine.
  - The fine is **recoverable in civil proceedings** as if it were imposed by a Canadian court.

- **Time Limit:**  
  - No proceedings under this section may be initiated **more than five years after the fine was imposed**.

- **Definition of "Fine":**  
  - Includes any **pecuniary penalty** imposed by a foreign court to represent the value of property, benefits, or advantages obtained through criminal conduct—regardless of where the property is located.
