**Detailed Summary of the *Parks Canada Agency Act***

### **Overview**

The *Parks Canada Agency Act* (2019, as amended) establishes **Parks Canada Agency** as a standalone federal body corporate responsible for the **protection, management, presentation, and stewardship** of Canada’s national parks, national historic sites, national marine conservation areas, and other protected heritage areas. The Act is grounded in the national interest to preserve Canada’s natural and cultural heritage for present and future generations, promote Canadian identity, and ensure sustainable public access and enjoyment.

This legislation replaces the previous structure of the Department of Environment and Climate Change (formerly part of the Department of the Environment), creating a more focused, effective, and accountable agency with distinct administrative, financial, and operational powers.
