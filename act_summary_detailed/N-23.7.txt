## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the *Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act***

### 🔹 **1. Purpose and Title**
- The Act is formally titled: **"The Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act"**.
- It authorizes the **sale or disposal of shares** in two Canadian corporations — **Nordion International Inc.** and **Theratronics International Limited** — by the **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)**.

### 🔹 **2. Key Definitions**
The Act establishes precise definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Minister** | A member of the Queen’s Privy Council designated by the Governor in Council to oversee the divestiture process. |
| **Nordion** | Nordion International Inc. or any successor corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act. |
| **Theratronics** | Theratronics International Limited or any successor corporation. |
| **Resident vs. Non-resident** | A *resident* is any individual, corporation, government, or trust that is not a non-resident. A *non-resident* includes foreign individuals, foreign corporations, foreign governments, trusts established by non-residents, or entities controlled by such entities. |
| **Voting Share** | Any share with voting rights, including convertible shares, options, or rights to acquire shares. |
| **Associate** | A complex relationship defined by shared control, ownership, or agreements (e.g., joint control, voting trusts, partnerships). |

> ⚖️ **Note**: Unless otherwise stated, words have the same meaning as in the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)*. If there's a conflict, **this Act prevails**.

---

### 🔹 **3. Authority to Dispose of Shares**
- **Section 4(1)**: The **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)** is authorized to:
  - Sell or otherwise dispose of **any or all shares** in Nordion and Theratronics.
  - Do so on **terms and conditions approved by the Governor in Council**.
  - Enter into any necessary agreements or arrangements.

> ✅ This grants CDIC broad discretion to complete the divestiture process in a way that aligns with fiscal, strategic, or regulatory goals.

---

### 🔹 **4. Exemption from CBCA and Financial Administration Rules**
- **Subsections 189(3) to (9)** of the CBCA and **subsections 99(2) to (5)** of the *Financial Administration Act* **do not apply** to any sale or disposal authorized under this Act.
- This exemption ensures that:
  - The divestiture process is **not subject to standard corporate disclosure or approval requirements** (e.g., public notification, shareholder consent, or mandatory reporting).
  - The transaction can proceed **without triggering procedural delays** normally associated with share sales.

---

### 🔹 **5. Amendments to Nordion’s Articles of Incorporation**
- **Section 6(1)**: Nordion must prepare and submit **articles of amendment** to its corporate documents to the **Minister** within **four months** of the Act coming into force.
- These amendments must:
  - Impose **restrictions on the issuance, transfer, and ownership** of voting shares.
  - Prevent **non-residents** (and their associates) from collectively holding, beneficially owning, or controlling **more than 25% of the voting power** in Nordion (i.e., more than 25% of the votes that can be cast to elect directors).

> 📌 **Purpose**: To ensure **national ownership and control** of key Canadian scientific and medical technology companies, preventing foreign influence or concentration of power in non-resident hands.

---

### 🔹 **6. Application of CBCA Regulations**
- **Section 6(2)**: The regulations under **subsection 174(6)** of the CBCA apply to Nordion **as if** the 25% voting restriction were a **"constraint"** under paragraph 174(1)(a) of the CBCA.
- This means:
  - The restriction is treated as a **formal corporate constraint**.
  - It triggers the **regulatory regime** that governs foreign ownership and control in Canadian corporations.

> 🔍 This ensures that the 25% ownership cap is legally enforceable and recognized under Canadian corporate law.

---

### 🔹 **7. Exceptions to the 25% Ownership Restriction**
The restrictions **do not apply** in the following cases:

| Exception | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Underwriters** | Persons holding shares solely for distribution to the public (e.g., IPO underwriters). |
| **Clearing intermediaries** | Entities acting only as intermediaries in securities trading (no investment intent). |
| **Investments deemed beneficial to Canada** | If the acquisition is an investment under **sections 21–23 of the Investment Canada Act (ICA)** that is: <br> - Likely to be of **net benefit to Canada**, and <br> - Not prohibited under **Part IV.1 of the ICA** (which deals with national security or foreign control concerns). |

> ✅ These exceptions protect legitimate market activities and foreign investments that serve Canadian interests.

---

### 🔹 **8. Exceptions for Subsequent Holders**
- If shares are held by someone under one of the above exceptions (e.g., underwriters), and **later transferred to another person**, the restriction **does not apply** to the new holder.
- This prevents **"passing" of ownership** to evade the restriction.

---

### 🔹 **9. Definition of "Associate"**
A person is an **associate of a non-resident** if any of the following apply:
- One is a director or officer of the other.
- One controls the other (or a group of persons).
- One is a partner in a partnership or a trustee in a trust.
- Both are controlled by the same person.
- Both are in a voting trust related to Nordion.
- Both have an agreement to act in concert.
- Both are associates of the same non-resident.

> 🚨 This creates a **network of ownership and control** that is monitored to prevent foreign influence.

---

### 🔹 **10. Special Provisions for Residents**
- **Paragraph 6(4)** provides **exemptions** for residents:
  - A **resident** who submits a **statutory declaration** stating that their shares are **not held for or on behalf of a non-resident** is **not considered an associate** of that non-resident — **as long as the shares are not held contrary to the declaration**.
  - Two corporations are **not associates** just because they are both associated with the same individual.
  - If a person holds **less than 0.02% of the voting power** (i.e., ≤ 0.02% of votes or 2,000 votes, whichever is less), they are **not considered an associate** of anyone else.

> ✅ This allows flexibility for Canadian individuals and entities while maintaining strict oversight.

---

### 🔹 **11. Definition of "Control"**
- A **body corporate** is controlled by a person if:
  - More than 50% of the voting power is held by or for the benefit of that person.
  - That voting power is sufficient to elect a majority of directors.
- A **partnership or unincorporated organization** is controlled if:
  - More than 50% of its assets are held by or for the benefit of that person.

> 🔍 This ensures that **control thresholds are clearly defined** and legally enforceable.

---

### 🔹 **12. Prohibitions on Corporate Actions**
- **Nordion and its shareholders/directors** are prohibited from:
  - Applying for **continuance in another jurisdiction** (i.e., moving operations abroad).
  - Adopting **by-laws or articles** that conflict with the **amended articles of incorporation**.

> ⚠️ This ensures **corporate stability** and prevents attempts to circumvent the ownership restrictions.

---

### 🔹 **13. Application to Theratronics**
- **Sections 5 to 7** (with exceptions) apply to **Theratronics** as if:
  - All references to “Nordion” were replaced with “Theratronics”.
  - The 25% threshold in Section 6(1) is replaced with **49%**.

> 📌 This reflects the **different ownership structure or risk profile** of Theratronics, requiring **stricter foreign ownership limits** (49% instead of 25%) to protect Canadian interests.

---

### 🔹 **14. Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA) Extension**
- For employees of Nordion or Theratronics who meet all of the following criteria:
  1. Were employed and a contributor under the PSSA **before** the first sale of shares.
  2. Have **not received a payment** under section 40 of the PSSA (i.e., no government payment to the company).
