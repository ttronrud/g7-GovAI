The **Nisga’a Final Agreement Act** is a federal statute enacted in Canada to give legal effect to the **Nisga’a Final Agreement**, a landmark treaty and land claims agreement between the Nisga’a Nation and the Crown (represented by Her Majesty in right of Canada and British Columbia). This Act serves as the foundational legislative instrument that enables the implementation of the terms of the agreement and ensures its enforceability under Canadian law. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the Act, organized by key themes and provisions.

---

## **1. Purpose and Context**

### **Why This Act Exists**
- The Act exists to **formally enact and implement** the **Nisga’a Final Agreement**, which was negotiated and signed in 1999 as a means of achieving **reconciliation** between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state.
- It reflects the principle that **reconciliation is best achieved through negotiation and agreement**, not through court litigation or conflict — a key legal and social goal emphasized by Canadian courts.
- The Act affirms the **sovereignty and self-determination** of the Nisga’a Nation within the framework of Canadian constitutional law.

> *“Whereas the reconciliation between the prior presence of aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of significant social and economic importance to Canadians”*  
This underscores the importance of recognizing historical and ongoing Indigenous rights and relationships in shaping modern Canadian society.

## **2. Constitutional and Legal Framework**

### **Supremacy of the Constitution**
- The **Constitution of Canada** is the supreme law of the land.
- The Nisga’a Final Agreement **does not alter** the Constitution of Canada, affirming that it operates within constitutional boundaries.

### **Treaty and Land Claims Status**
- The Agreement is recognized as both:
  - A **treaty** under **Section 25 of the Constitution Act, 1982**
  - A **land claims agreement** under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**
- This recognition affirms that the Nisga’a Final Agreement is a **constitutional treaty**, with rights and obligations protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

> **Key Point**: The Agreement is not a mere contract; it is a legally binding constitutional instrument that carries the weight of the Constitution.

## **3. Key Definitions**

The Act establishes clear definitions for central terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Nisga’a Final Agreement** | The 1999 agreement signed by the Nisga’a Nation and the Crown (Canada and BC), including all amendments made in accordance with its provisions. |
| **Settlement Legislation** | Federal and provincial laws enacted to give effect to the Agreement — including this Act and the BC version of the Act. |
| **Taxation Agreement** | A separate but related agreement on taxation, entered into on the effective date of the Final Agreement, including amendments. |

> These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in interpreting the Agreement across all legal contexts.

## **4. Legal Effect and Binding Nature**

### **Validity and Force of Law**
- The Nisga’a Final Agreement is:
  - **Approved, given effect, and declared valid**
  - **Binding on all persons** (individuals, governments, institutions)
- It has the **force of law** and supersedes conflicting provisions in federal or provincial laws.

### **Precedence Over Other Laws**
- In the event of **inconsistency or conflict** between the Agreement and any federal or provincial law, **the Agreement prevails** to the extent of the conflict.
- This principle ensures that Indigenous rights and self-governance arrangements are not undermined by general legislation.

---

## **5. Aboriginal Rights and Title**

### **Modification of Aboriginal Title**
- The Agreement **modifies** the existing aboriginal rights and title of the Nisga’a Nation — not extinguishes them.
- The modification is **permanent and legally binding**.

> **Specifically:**
> - Aboriginal title, as it existed before the Agreement, is **modified** and continues as:
>   - **Estate in fee simple** over specific areas identified in the Agreement as:
>     - Nisga’a Lands
>     - Nisga’a Fee Simple Lands
>     - Category A and Category B Lands

> This means the Nisga’a Nation now holds **full ownership rights** (fee simple) over these lands, including the right to use, develop, and manage them — a significant step toward self-determination.

> **Note**: This modification is **not a derogation from the common law** in all cases. The Act explicitly states that the express derogation in the Agreement does **not limit** the effect of other provisions that do not contain such derogations.

---

## **6. Ownership and Land Rights**

### **Ownership on the Effective Date**
- On the effective date of the Agreement (May 4, 1999), the Nisga’a Nation owns:
  - All **Nisga’a Lands** as identified in the Lands Chapter (paragraphs 1 and 2)
  - **Category A and Category B Lands**

> This establishes a clear, legally recognized **ownership structure** that provides the Nisga’a Nation with full control over its territory.

---

## **7. Financial Obligations and Funding**

### **Capital Transfer and Fisheries Payments**
- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** (Canada’s central fund) will pay the sums required to meet Canada’s obligations under:
  - The **Capital Transfer and Negotiation Loan Repayment Chapter**
  - The **Fisheries Chapter**

> This ensures that the financial commitments made in the Agreement are fulfilled through federal funding.

---

## **8. Regulatory and Administrative Powers**

### **Regulatory Authority**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **regulations or orders** to implement any provision of:
  - The Nisga’a Final Agreement
  - The Taxation Agreement

> This gives the federal government flexibility to adapt to practical implementation needs while respecting the Agreement’s terms.

---

## **9. Judicial Notice and Evidence**

### **Judicial Notice**
- Courts are required to take **judicial notice** of:
  - The Nisga’a Final Agreement
  - The Taxation Agreement
  - Nisga’a laws

> This means that these documents are **automatically presumed true and admissible** in legal proceedings, without requiring proof.

### **Evidence of Laws**
- A copy of a Nisga’a law **deposited in the public registry** is **evidence of that law** and its contents.
- A copy purporting to be published by the **Queen’s Printer** is **deemed valid**, unless proven otherwise.

> This strengthens the legal standing of Nisga’a governance and ensures that Indigenous laws are recognized in court.

---

## **10. Taxation Provisions**

### **Taxation Agreement Overview**
- The **Taxation Agreement** is:
  - Approved, valid, and has the force of law during its term
  - **Not part of the Nisga’a Final Agreement**
  - **Not a treaty or land claims agreement** under Section 25 or 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982

> This distinction is important: the Taxation Agreement governs tax matters separately and does not confer treaty status.

### **Tax Exemptions**
- **Transfers of Nisga’a capital (non-cash)** between:
  - The Nisga’a Nation
  - Nisga’a Villages
  - Nisga’a Government Corporations  
  are **not taxable** under federal law during the period the Taxation Agreement is in force.

> This supports economic self-sufficiency and internal governance of the Nisga’a people.

> ⚠️ *Note: This provision was repealed in 2022 (s. 177, c. 10)* — **this is a critical update**. The tax exemption for capital transfers is no longer in force.

---

## **11. Application of Provincial and Federal Laws**

### **Provincial Law Application**
- Where a **BC law does not apply of its own force** to the Nisga’a Nation or its entities:
  - It **applies to them**, **subject to the Nisga’a Final Agreement and other federal laws**

> This ensures that Nisga’a communities are not excluded from general provincial laws, but are governed by their own legal framework as defined in the Agreement.

### **Exemption from the Indian Act**
- The **Indian Act does not apply** to the Nisga’a Nation, Villages, Institutions, or Citizens as of the effective date of the Agreement — **except for determining whether an individual is an “Indian”**.

> This is a major step toward **decolonizing governance** and removing colonial legal structures from Indigenous self-government.

> **Exception**: Section 126 of the *Criminal Code* (which deals with criminal liability) **does not apply** to matters required by or under the Agreement.

> **Important**: The Nisga’a laws and instruments under the Agreement are **not statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*, meaning they do not require parliamentary approval for creation.

> Also, **Nisga’a Institutions and Courts** are **not considered federal tribunals** under the *Federal Courts Act*, reinforcing their autonomy.

## **12. Legal Proceedings and Consultation Requirements**

### **Notice Requirement in Legal Proceedings**
- If a party raises an issue in a judicial or administrative proceeding about:
  - The **interpretation or validity** of the Nisga’a Final Agreement, or
  - The **validity or applicability** of settlement
