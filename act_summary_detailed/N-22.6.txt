**Detailed Summary of the *New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act***

---

### **Act Title and Citation**  
The Act is officially titled the *New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act* and may be cited accordingly. It establishes a legal framework for the planning, construction, operation, and financial management of a new bridge system across the St. Lawrence River, specifically connecting key areas of Montreal and Brossard, replacing or supplementing existing bridges.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Bridge**  
   - Refers to a structure that spans the St. Lawrence River and connects:
     - The **Island of Montreal to the City of Brossard** (a new main bridge),
     - The **Nuns’ Island to the City of Brossard** (a replacement for the existing Nuns’ Island Bridge),
     - The **Montreal Island to Nuns’ Island** (a replacement for the existing Nuns’ Island Bridge),
   - Also includes the **approaches** (sides or ramps) leading to both bridges.  
   → This definition ensures comprehensive coverage of infrastructure, including access roads and adjacent developments.

2. **Construction**  
   - Encompasses not only the building of the bridge but also:
     - Demolition of existing structures,
     - Any other work or activity directly related to the bridge’s construction.  
   → Broadly defines the scope of construction activities, including site preparation and infrastructure modifications.

3. **Minister**  
   - Initially defined as the member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada designated under Section 3.  
   - The Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet) may designate a specific individual as the Minister for the purposes of this Act.  
   → Provides flexibility in administrative oversight and allows for appointment of a designated official to manage the project.

4. **Operation**  
   - Includes all activities related to the ongoing use and functionality of the bridge, such as:
     - Maintenance,
     - Repairs,
     - Routine management.  
   → Ensures long-term functionality and safety of the structure.

5. **Person**  
   - Includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, and joint ventures.  
   → Broadens the scope of parties that may participate in agreements or be subject to obligations under the Act.

6. **Related Work**  
   - Includes:
     - Works useful to the bridge’s operation (e.g., toll facilities),
     - Works accessory to the bridge or any related work (e.g., reconstruction and widening of Highway 15 between the Nuns’ Island Bridge approach and the Atwater interchange).  
   → Highlights integration with regional transportation networks and infrastructure improvements.

### **Administrative Authority and Oversight**

- The **Minister** is primarily responsible for administering the Act and exercising all powers, duties, and functions related to the bridge and related works.  
- The Minister may enter into agreements with any person (private entity or public body) for purposes such as:
  - Design,
  - Construction,
  - Operation,
  - Toll collection.  
- These agreements may include provisions for toll collection and financial arrangements.

> **Important Clarification**:  
> A person who enters into such an agreement is **not considered an agent** of Her Majesty in right of Canada.  
> → This protects private contractors from being legally bound as representatives of the Crown, while still allowing the Crown to enforce its interests through contractual mechanisms.

---

### **Exemption from Other Federal Laws**

- The **Bridges Act** does **not apply** to the new bridge or related works.  
  → Ensures the project is governed by this specific Act rather than general bridge legislation.
  
- The **Service Fees Act** does **not apply** to tolls, fees, or charges established by regulations under paragraph 12(b).  
  → Allows the government to set tolls independently, without being constrained by existing service fee regulations.

---

### **Agreements and Government Collaboration**

- The Minister may enter into agreements with:
  - Any private person,
  - The **Government of Quebec**, or
  - Any **municipality in Quebec** or its agencies/mandataries.  
- This fosters **intergovernmental cooperation** between federal and provincial authorities, enabling shared responsibility and coordination in infrastructure development.

---

### **Tolling and Financial Obligations**

- **Vehicle Users**: Any owner of a vehicle using the bridge must pay applicable tolls, fees, or charges.  
- **Tolls as Debt**:  
  - All tolls, fees, or charges under this Act constitute a **debt owed to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.  
  - This debt is **recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction**, ensuring legal enforceability.  
- The Minister may issue **regulations** to:
  - Set specific tolls, fees, or charges for vehicles or vehicle categories (e.g., passenger cars, trucks, buses),  
  - Designate violations of the Act as **offences punishable on summary conviction**, with fixed maximum fines.  
  → Provides flexibility in pricing and enforcement while maintaining accountability.

---

### **Exemptions from Permits and Approvals**

- The **Governor in Council** may, by order:
  - Exempt any person from requirements under **federal Acts** (e.g., environmental, land-use, or construction permits) for the construction of the bridge or related works,  
  - **On conditions** that the Governor in Council determines are in the **public interest**.  
- The **Statutory Instruments Act does not apply** to such orders, meaning they do not require prior parliamentary approval or formal legislative procedure.  
- However, the order **must be published in the Canada Gazette** to ensure transparency and public awareness.

> **Post-Construction Effect**:  
> If a permit or authorization was required under a federal law but was waived due to an exemption, that exemption is **deemed to have been granted** after construction is complete.  
> → This avoids administrative delays and ensures continuity in regulatory compliance.

---

### **Declaration of Public Benefit**

- The bridge and related works are **declared as works for the general advantage of Canada**.  
  → Emphasizes the national importance of the project, justifying federal investment and intervention.
