The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, 1997, c. 20, s. 44]

This indicates that the specific legislation or provision in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Act No. 20 of 1997**, specifically under **section 44** of that act.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Act/Provision**: The legislation or section previously in force has been **repealed**. This means it is no longer legally valid or in effect.
  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal occurred in **1997**.

- **Repealing Legislation**: The repeal was enacted through **Chapter 20 of the Statutes of 1997** (commonly referred to as "c. 20, 1997").

- **Section of the Repealing Act**: The repeal specifically targets **Section 44** of that chapter. This section likely contained provisions that were deemed obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent with current laws or policy objectives.

- **Implication**: Any legal rights, obligations, or regulatory requirements derived from the repealed provision are no longer enforceable. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to current statutes and regulations that have replaced or superseded the repealed content.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated nature of the entry suggests that the original legislation or a series of related provisions were all repealed under the same section.
- The absence of any substantive content (such as definitions, provisions, or purposes) in the original text implies that the summary is not of a detailed act, but rather of a **repeal notice**.
- This type of notation is common in legal databases or legislative registers to indicate that a provision has been formally removed from the statute book.

### Conclusion:
There is **no detailed content** of the original act being summarized, as the entry only indicates that it was **repealed in 1997 under section 44 of Act No. 20**. Therefore, the summary is limited to the legal status and procedural context of the repeal. To understand what the original provision might have done, one would need to consult the full text of the prior legislation or historical records of the repealed section — which are not provided here.

In short:  
**The provision referenced has been officially canceled (repealed) by Section 44 of Act No. 20, 1997, and thus is no longer in force.**
