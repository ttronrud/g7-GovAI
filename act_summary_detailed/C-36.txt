**Detailed Summary of the *Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act* (CCAA)**

---

### **Overview**

The **Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA)** is a federal Canadian statute that provides a legal framework for the restructuring of financially distressed companies. It enables a debtor company to propose a compromise or arrangement with its creditors — both secured and unsecured — to avoid bankruptcy and to reorganize its affairs under court supervision. The CCAA operates as an alternative to insolvency proceedings under the *Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA)*, offering greater flexibility in restructuring while preserving business continuity.

It is particularly relevant when a company faces financial distress but has the potential to recover and continue operations. The CCAA allows for the negotiation of a reorganization plan, including debt repayment, equity adjustments, and employee and pension obligations, all subject to court approval.

## **Core Process: Proposal, Meeting, and Court Sanction**

### **1. Proposal of a Compromise or Arrangement**

A compromise or arrangement may be proposed between:
- The debtor company and its **unsecured creditors** (or a class thereof), or
- The debtor company and its **secured creditors** (or a class thereof).

The proposal may include:
- Debt restructuring
- Payment plans
- Equity adjustments
- Claims against directors (subject to restrictions)

> **Note**: The proposal may include compromise of claims against **directors** that arose before the commencement of proceedings, **provided** the claims relate to the company’s obligations and not to contractual rights, misrepresentations, or wrongful/oppressive conduct by directors.

### **2. Court-Ordered Meeting of Creditors**

- The court may order a meeting of:
  - Creditors (or a class of creditors), and
  - Shareholders (if the court determines it is appropriate).

- The meeting must be summoned by the court in a manner it directs.

### **3. Approval by Creditors**

A compromise or arrangement may be **sanctioned by the court** if:
- A **majority in number and two-thirds in value** of the relevant creditors (excluding equity claim holders unless ordered otherwise) **vote in favor** of the proposal — either as proposed or as modified at the meeting.

> This is a strict majority threshold to ensure fairness and broad creditor support.

### **4. Binding Effect of Sanction**

Once sanctioned, the compromise or arrangement becomes **binding on**:
- All creditors (or classes),
- Any trustee for that class (secured or unsecured),
- The debtor company,
- In cases involving assignments or winding-up, also on the **trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator** and **contributories** (those who contributed to the company’s assets).

### **5. Amendment of Company’s Constituting Instruments**

The court may **amend the company’s constitution** (e.g., bylaws, articles of incorporation) to reflect changes resulting from the compromise or arrangement, **if such changes are lawful under federal or provincial law**.

## **Mandatory Provisions and Government Interests**

### **1. Payment to the Crown (Canada or a Province)**

Unless Her Majesty (the Crown) agrees otherwise, the court **may not sanction** a compromise or arrangement **unless it provides for full payment to the Crown** within **six months** of court sanction of:
- Amounts due under **subsection 224(1.2) of the Income Tax Act** (e.g., tax withheld from employee payments),
- Contributions to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or **Employment Insurance (EI)**, including employee/employer premiums and related interest or penalties,
- Similar provincial legislation that collects contributions or taxes of a comparable nature.

> If the company is in **default** on any such payment **after** the application for sanction, the court **cannot sanction** the arrangement.

### **2. Employee and Former Employee Payments**

The compromise or arrangement **must provide** for:
- Immediate payment to employees and former employees of:
  - **At least the amounts** they would have received under **paragraph 136(1)(d) of the BIA** if the company had become bankrupt on the date of commencement,
  - **Wages, salaries, commissions, or compensation** earned after the commencement of proceedings but before the court sanctions the arrangement,
  - **Travel disbursements** for traveling salespersons properly incurred during that period.

> The court must be **satisfied** that the company **can and will** make these payments.

### **3. Pension Plan Obligations**

If the company participates in a **prescribed pension plan**, the compromise or arrangement **must include** payment of:
- All amounts deducted from employee remuneration for pension contributions,
- The **normal cost** (as defined in the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985*) required to be paid to the pension fund,
- **Special payments** required to liquidate unfunded liabilities or solvency deficiencies (as per section 9 of the Regulations),
- Any other unfunded liabilities or solvency deficiencies as determined on the date of commencement,
- Amounts required under **defined contribution provisions**,
- Amounts required to be paid to the **administrator of a pooled registered pension plan** (PRPP),
- In the case of other prescribed plans, the **normal cost** and **special payments** as if the plan were regulated by federal law.

> Again, the court must be satisfied that the company **can and will** make these payments.

> **Exception**: Despite these requirements, the court **may sanction** a compromise that does **not** include payment of pension amounts **if** the relevant parties have entered into a **prior agreement**, **approved by the pension regulator**, respecting those payments.

## **Prohibitions and Restrictions**

- **Equity Claims Cannot Be Compromised Without Full Disclosure**  
  A compromise or arrangement that involves **equity claims** (e.g., dividends, capital returns) **must provide that all equity claims are fully and fairly compromised**.

- **Claims Against Directors Are Restricted**  
  A compromise of claims against directors **cannot include**:
  - Claims based on
