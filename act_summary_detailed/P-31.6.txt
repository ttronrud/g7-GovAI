**Detailed Summary of the Public Sector Compensation Act (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Sector Compensation Act* is a foundational piece of legislation in Canada that establishes the rules governing **compensation, compensation plans, and employment conditions** for employees within the federal public service. Enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons, the Act provides a comprehensive framework for how pay, benefits, and related entitlements are administered, extended, and regulated—particularly during transitional periods or in response to workforce adjustments.

The Act applies to a wide range of public sector employees and institutions, including departments of the Government of Canada, federal agencies, Parliament, and certain key federal officials. It is designed to ensure **stability, fairness, and consistency** in compensation while also allowing for necessary adjustments due to restructuring, budgetary changes, or workforce reductions.

## **Key Definitions**

Before diving into substantive provisions, the Act defines several core terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Bargaining Agent** | The representative body (e.g., union) authorized to negotiate on behalf of employees. Defined under the Canada Labour Code, Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act, or Public Service Staff Relations Act. |
| **Compensation** | All forms of pay, benefits, and perquisites provided to employees, **excluding** retirement benefits under specific acts (e.g., Public Service Superannuation Act), or payments made under directives, policies, or agreements approved by the Treasury Board or negotiated bilaterally. Includes lump-sum payments under certain conditions. |
| **Compensation Plan** | Any formal arrangement—whether collective agreement, arbitral award, unilateral policy, or statutory provision—for determining and administering compensation. Includes wage rates, increases, bonuses, and other entitlements. |
| **Employee** | A person performing duties that entitle them to a fixed or ascertainable rate of pay. Excludes independent contractors and individuals covered by local engagement rules or excluded under section 41 of the Public Service Employment Act. |
| **Strike** | Defined consistently with relevant labour legislation (Canada Labour Code, Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act, Public Service Staff Relations Act). |
| **Wage Rate** | A fixed or range-based rate of pay, including cost-of-living adjustments. Excludes allowances, bonuses, or premiums unless specified by Treasury Board order. |

> **Important Note**: If a compensation plan lacks an expiration date, it is deemed to expire **one day before** the next scheduled revision of wage rates.

## **Extension of Compensation Plans (Stability Provisions)**

To prevent abrupt changes in pay and benefits, the Act provides **automatic extensions** for existing compensation plans that were in place before a certain date.

### **1. General Extension (Section 5)**
- All compensation plans in effect on **February 26, 1991** (including those extended under section 6) are extended for **72 months** (six years) beginning on the day after they would have otherwise expired.
- This ensures continuity and stability for employees whose plans were already in place at that time.

### **2. Special Extensions for Specific Groups (Section 3(3.1))**
- Compensation plans in effect on **December 10, 1992** for the following individuals are extended for **48 months** (four years):
  - Chief Electoral Officer
  - Commissioner of Official Languages
  - Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada

### **3. Extension for Plans That Expired Before 1991 (Section 5(3))**
- If a plan expired before February 26, 1991, and no new plan was established before or after that date, it is extended for **12 months** (one year) beginning on the day after the original expiry date.

> These extensions apply **only** to plans that would have otherwise expired before the specified dates and are intended to prevent sudden cuts in pay or benefits.

---

## **Prohibition of Incremental Increases (Section 5.1)**

A significant restriction is placed on **performance-based or merit-based increases** during the extension period:

> **No employee is entitled to incremental increases** (e.g., merit increases, in-range increases, performance bonuses, skill-based raises) during the **first 24 months** after the coming into force of this provision.

> **Exception**: This restriction **does not apply** to increases based on **years of experience**.

> **Purpose**: To prevent inflation of compensation during transitional periods and to maintain fiscal discipline.

## **Treasury Board’s Authority to Modify Compensation Plans**

The **Treasury Board** has broad powers to modify compensation plans when needed, particularly in response to **classification changes** or **workforce restructuring**.

### **1. Modification Due to Classification Changes (Section 5(2))**
- If the Treasury Board changes terms and conditions of a compensation plan to implement a **new or revised classification standard**, the resulting plan is:
  - Extended for **48 months** (if the change occurred before December 10, 1992)
  - Extended for **24 months** (if the change occurred on or after December 10, 1992 but before the Act came into force)
- Additionally, **wage rates in effect on the expiry date are frozen** during the extension period.

> This ensures stability when reclassifications occur (e.g., moving from one grade to another), preventing immediate pay increases.

### **2. Authority to Authorize Changes (Section 6)**
- The Treasury Board may authorize changes to:
  - Compensation plans that would have expired before February 26, 1991
  - Collective agreements or arbitral awards that include compensation plans
- This power is available **even if the parties (employer and bargaining agent) fail to agree** on changes.

> **Limitation**: Any such change must comply with **section 10** (which governs wage rate adjustments).

## **Civilian Reduction Program (Section 7.1)**

This section deals with **workforce reductions** and **surplus employee payments** in response to budget cuts.

### **Background**
- The program originated from the **February 22, 1994 budget**.
- It allows the Treasury Board to offer **payments** to indeterminate employees (those without fixed-term contracts) in departments such as:
  - Department of National Defence
  - Emergency Preparedness Canada
  - Communications Security Establishment (CSE)

### **Key Provisions**
- **Before June 22, 1998** (when the section was repealed), payments could be offered to surplus employees.
- **After June 22, 1998** (as per note in the text), the provision **ceased to apply**.
- However, **employees who were offered payments before or after the date** and who had not yet ceased employment become subject to the program.
- Any such employee who receives a payment under this program is **not eligible for any further payments** under section 7.2.

> **Note**: This section was **repealed in 1998** (see note: "ceases to be in force June 22, 1998").

## **Early Departure and Unpaid Surplus Status Program (Section 7.2)**

This section governs a **workforce adjustment program** introduced in response to the **February 27, 1995 budget**.

### **Key Elements**
