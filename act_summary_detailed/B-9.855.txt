## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Interest Calculations in the Customs and Excise Acts (Amendments to Sections 37–41 and 43, 48, 49)**

**Purpose:**  
To ensure that interest on amounts due under the *Customs Act* and the *Excise Act* is calculated as if certain sections had come into force on **July 1, 2006**, rather than their actual date of enactment.

**Specifics:**
- For **sections 37 to 41** of the *Customs Act*, interest on any amount due shall be computed as if these sections had taken effect on **July 1, 2006**.
- For **sections 43, 48, and 49** of both the *Customs Act* and the *Excise Act*, interest shall be computed as if these sections had taken effect on **July 1, 2006**.

**Implication:**  
This amendment effectively retroactively applies interest rules to past financial obligations, ensuring consistency and fairness in the calculation of penalties or interest on unpaid duties, taxes, or fees. It provides a uniform method of interest computation for financial obligations that were outstanding before July 1, 2006, by aligning them with a specific legal threshold.

> *Note:* These provisions are technical and administrative, aimed at ensuring legal certainty in financial assessments.

### **3. Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Act (Enacted and Amended)**

This section enacts the *Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Act*, which governs the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed Mackenzie Gas Project — a major natural gas exploration initiative in northern Canada.

#### **Key Provisions:**
- The Act is **set out in Schedule 2** of the legislation.
- Sections 208 to 212 of the Act **come into force on a day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council** (i.e., by Cabinet decision).
- **Note:** These sections were in force on **November 10, 2006**, as per a statutory instrument (SI/2006-132).

#### **Transfer of Powers and Functions (Major Administrative Change)**

On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, the **Governor in Council** (Cabinet) transfers:

1. **Powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of the Environment under:
   - The *Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Act* (in relation to the Mackenzie gas project), and  
   - Section 209 of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2006*.

2. **Control and supervision** of the **Mackenzie Gas Project Office** (a unit within the Department of the Environment) from the Department of the Environment to the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**.

**Effective Date:**  
This transfer became effective on **February 16, 2011**.

#### **Rationale and Implications:**
- The transfer reflects a strategic shift in federal governance, recognizing that the Mackenzie gas project involves significant impacts on Indigenous communities and northern regions.
- Placing oversight of the project under DIAND ensures that Indigenous rights, land use, environmental protection, and regional development concerns are addressed through a department with direct responsibility for Indigenous affairs and northern development.
- This move was part of a broader effort to improve Indigenous engagement and accountability in resource development projects.

> *Note:* The *Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Act* was **repealed in 2013** (under *c. 40, s. 286*), indicating that the project was either abandoned, restructured, or superseded by other policies.

### **4. Repeals and Amendments**

Several provisions in the Act were later repealed:
- **Sections 198 and 21 (in 2011)**: Repealed under *c. 15, s. 21*, which removed the original child care funding provisions.
- **Sections of the Mackenzie Gas Project Act**: Repealed in 2013 under *c. 40, s. 286*.

These repeals suggest that the government later determined that the original program or project was no longer viable or necessary.
