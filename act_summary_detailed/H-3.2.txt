**Detailed Summary of the *Department of Health Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Department of Health Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian federal legislation enacted on **July 12, 1996**, to establish a centralized, independent department of the Government of Canada responsible for the promotion, protection, and preservation of public health. It consolidates and restructures health-related responsibilities previously scattered across various departments, particularly from the former *Department of National Health and Welfare* and the *Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs*. The Act provides a clear mandate for the Minister of Health, outlines the powers and duties of the department, and establishes mechanisms for regulation, fee-setting, interdepartmental coordination, and accountability.

This Act replaced the old *Department of National Health and Welfare* with a new **Department of Health**, reflecting a modernization and streamlining of Canada’s public health governance.

---

### **5. Service Provision and Fee Structures**
The Department may provide services to, and receive services from, any board or agency under its responsibility — and vice versa.

#### a) **Fee Setting Authority**
- The Minister may **fix fees** for services provided by the Department or any associated board/agency.
- Similarly, any such board or agency may fix fees for services provided to the Department or to each other — **despite section 6(1)** (a limitation in other statutes).

#### b) **Fee Limitations**
- Fees must not exceed the **actual cost of providing the service**.
- Fees are subject to **approval by the Treasury Board**.
- In the case of **regulatory processes or approvals**, fees must not exceed the amount needed to cover **reasonable outlays** incurred by the Government.

#### c) **Consultation Requirement**
- Before setting any fee under sections 6, 7, or 8, the Minister must **consult with relevant stakeholders** (e.g., industry, public health groups, affected communities).

#### d) **Public Disclosure**
- All fees must be **published within 30 days** of being set:
  - In the *Canada Gazette*
  - Through authorized electronic or other means (as per Treasury Board regulations)

#### e) **Review by Parliamentary Committee**
- Any fee established under sections 6, 7, or 8 is **automatically referred to the Committee under section 19 of the Statutory Instruments Act** for review and scrutiny — as if it were a statutory instrument.

> This ensures **transparency, public accountability, and democratic oversight** of fee-setting.

#### f) **Regulatory Authority**
- The **Treasury Board** may make regulations to implement sections 6 to 9 (on fees), and the **Governor in Council** may make regulations to give effect to and implement the Act.

---

### **6. Interim Orders for Emergency Public Health Actions**
- In cases where there is a **significant, immediate risk to health or safety**, the Minister may issue an **interim order** — equivalent to a regulation — to address the threat.
- Interim orders are effective immediately but **cease after**:
  - 14 days (unless approved by the Governor in Council),
  - The day it is repealed,
  - The day a permanent regulation with the same effect comes into force,
  - Or one year after issuance (or a shorter period specified in the order).

> This provides **flexibility in responding to urgent health threats** (e.g., pandemics, chemical spills, disease outbreaks).

#### Key Legal Safeguards:
- **No conviction** can occur for violating an interim order **unless** the person:
  - Was **notified** of the order, or
  - **Reasonable steps** were taken to inform them of the order.
- Interim orders are **exempt from certain provisions** of the *Statutory Instruments Act* (e.g., sections 3, 5, and 11), allowing faster implementation.
- Interim orders must be **published in the Canada Gazette within 23 days** of issuance.
- A copy must be **tabled in both Houses of Parliament within 15 days** of issuance.

> This balances **urgent action** with **legal and democratic accountability**.

---

### **7. Non-Interference with Provincial Health Authorities**
- **No jurisdiction or control** is granted to the Minister or Department over **provincial health authorities** operating under provincial laws.
- The Act explicitly **does not authorize federal intervention** in provincial health governance, preserving provincial autonomy in health policy and delivery.

> This is a critical constitutional safeguard, respecting the division of powers between federal and provincial governments under the *Constitution Act, 1867*.

---

### **8. Continuity of Public Service Employment**
- Employees who were working in the **Department of National Health and Welfare** or the **Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** before the Act came into force are **protected** in their positions.
- Specifically, employees in the following roles are **transferred to the new Department of Health**:
  - Positions in the **Product Safety Branch** (under Consumer and Corporate Affairs)
  - Positions in the **Family Violence Prevention Division, Children’s Bureau, Brighter Futures programs, Community Action Program for Children, HIV/AIDS Research and Development, and Seniors Independence Research Program**

> This ensures **continuity of service**, avoids disruption in critical public health programs, and protects the rights of public servants.

> **Definition**: "Employee" is defined as per subsection 2(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act* — meaning civil servants in the federal public service.

---

### **9. Appropriation of Funds**
- Any **unexpended appropriations** from the fiscal year in which the Act comes into force, originally allocated to the *Department of National Health and Welfare*, are **automatically deemed to be appropriated to the Department of Health**.
- This ensures **financial continuity** and avoids budgetary gaps or reallocations.

---

### **10. Automatic Legal Re-Reference (Legal Continuity)**
- Any reference to:
  - The **Minister of National Health and Welfare**
  - The **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs**
  - The **Department of National Health and Welfare**
  - The **Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs**
  
  in any Act of Parliament, regulation, or instrument is **automatically read as a reference to the Minister of Health or the Department of Health**, **unless the context otherwise requires** or unless the power/duty has been reassigned.

> This provides **
