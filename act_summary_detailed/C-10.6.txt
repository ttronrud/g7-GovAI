**Detailed Summary of the *Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act* (C-14) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted on **January 1, 1989**, to implement the **Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA)**, which was signed on **January 2, 1988**. This Act provides the legal framework necessary for Canada to fully adopt and operationalize the terms of the Free Trade Agreement, ensuring that it is effectively integrated into Canadian law and governance.

The Act is not merely a technical implementation tool—it establishes a comprehensive structure for trade, investment, dispute resolution, and intergovernmental cooperation between Canada and the United States, while also safeguarding national interests and respecting constitutional and legal boundaries.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Objectives of the Agreement**

The Act sets out the primary goals of the Free Trade Agreement, which include:

- **Eliminating barriers to trade** in goods and services between Canada and the United States.
- **Facilitating fair competition** within the newly established free-trade area.
- **Liberalizing investment conditions**, making it easier and more attractive for Canadian and U.S. investors to operate across borders.
- **Establishing effective administrative and dispute-resolution mechanisms** to ensure compliance and resolve conflicts efficiently.
- **Laying the groundwork for future bilateral and multilateral cooperation** to expand the benefits of free trade globally.

These objectives reflect both economic efficiency and strategic partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.

### **2. Definition of Key Terms**

The Act defines several key terms essential to understanding its scope and operation:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the Free Trade Agreement signed on January 2, 1988, including its full text (contained in Part A of the Schedule) and the Tariff Schedules of Canada and the United States referenced in Annex 401.2.
  
- **Commission**: Establishes the **Canada-United States Trade Commission** (CUS-TC), a binational body responsible for administering and overseeing the Agreement, including monitoring compliance and resolving disputes.

- **Minister**: Refers to the Minister designated by the Governor in Council for specific provisions of the Act. This allows for delegation of responsibilities across departments (e.g., Finance, Trade, Foreign Affairs).

- **Prescribed**: Means "prescribed by regulation made by the Governor in Council," giving flexibility to adapt rules as needed through regulation.

- **United States**: Defined broadly to include:
  - The 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico;
  - Foreign trade zones in those areas;
  - Areas beyond the territorial sea where the U.S. may exercise rights under international law (e.g., seabed and natural resources).

> *Note: The definition of "water" is explicitly excluded from the scope of the Agreement (see Section 3), meaning that trade in water (natural surface or groundwater) is not governed by this Act, even in liquid, gaseous, or solid forms. However, bottled or packaged water is excluded from this exception.*

---

### **3. Publication and Legal Authority**

- The full text of the Agreement, including tariff schedules, is to be **published in the Canada Treaty Series**, ensuring public access and transparency.
- The Act is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada**, meaning it has full legal force and effect under Canadian law.

---

### **4. No Judicial or Private Enforcement of Agreement Obligations**

A critical provision is that:

> *No person has any cause of action, and no proceedings of any kind shall be taken without the consent of the Attorney General of Canada, to enforce or determine any right or obligation claimed solely under Part I of the Act or the Agreement.*

This means:
- Individuals or private parties **cannot sue** to enforce rights or obligations under the Agreement.
- All enforcement actions must be authorized by the **Attorney General**, ensuring that legal action remains under federal government control and aligns with national policy.

This provision protects the government from being exposed to costly litigation and ensures that disputes are handled through formal, administrative, or diplomatic channels.

---

### **5. Parliamentary Sovereignty and Flexibility**

To prevent the Act from limiting Parliament’s legislative authority, the Act explicitly states:

> *For greater certainty, nothing in this Act, by specific mention or omission, limits in any manner the right of Parliament to enact legislation to implement any provision of the Agreement or fulfil any of the obligations of the Government of Canada under the Agreement.*

This clause affirms that:
- Parliament retains the power to pass new laws as required to meet evolving trade needs.
- The Act does not create a rigid legal framework that would restrict future legislative action.

---

### **6. Exclusion of Water from the Scope**

- The Agreement **does not apply to water** (natural surface or groundwater in any state).
- This exclusion is important because water is a natural resource with distinct environmental and regulatory considerations.
- Packaging of water (e.g., bottled beverages) is **not included** in this exclusion, meaning such products are subject to the Agreement only if they are traded as goods under normal commercial conditions.

> *This reflects a recognition that water is not a commodity subject to tariff or trade liberalization in the same way as manufactured goods or services.*

---

### **7. Regulation Making Power – Chapter Eight of the Agreement**

Chapter Eight of the Agreement deals with **provincial cooperation and regulatory alignment**, particularly in areas such as standards, labeling, and product safety.

The Act grants the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) broad regulatory powers under this chapter:

- Can make **regulations** to implement Chapter Eight, including rules that:
  - Require or prohibit certain actions;
  - Establish penalties for non-compliance.
- However, such regulations **shall not come into force** in any province where:
  - The province has already enacted **provincial laws** that are consistent with the relevant provisions of Chapter Eight.
- Before making such regulations, the **Minister must consult with the provincial government**.
- Regulations may be **revoked or suspended** by order of the Governor in Council for any province, giving provinces flexibility to opt out or adjust their approach.
- Regulations made under this power are **binding on Her Majesty in right of that province**, meaning they have direct legal force in that jurisdiction.

> *This provision balances federal authority with provincial autonomy, recognizing that provinces have jurisdiction over local standards and regulations.*

---

### **8. Appointment of Ministers and Officials**

- The **Governor in Council** may designate any member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** as the **Minister** for any provision of the Act.
- This allows for flexibility in assigning responsibility based on policy priorities or departmental expertise.

---

### **9. Establishment of Committees, Commissions, and Panels**

The Governor in Council may:

- Establish **committees, commissions, panels, or other bodies** to carry out functions under the Agreement.
- Appoint members and define their **terms of reference**.
- Authorize such bodies to exercise specific powers and perform designated duties.
- Pay members reasonable **remuneration and expenses** for their work.

> This enables the federal government to create specialized, expert groups to manage complex aspects of trade implementation (e.g., technical standards, market access, dispute resolution).

---

### **10. Appointment of the Canadian Section of the Trade Commission**

- The Governor in Council may appoint a member of the Privy Council as the **principal representative** of Canada to the **Canada-United States Trade Commission (CUS-TC)** established under Chapter Eighteen of the Agreement.
- The Government of Canada is responsible for **paying half of all expenditures** incurred by the Commission.
- The **Main Estimates for 1989** (External Affairs Vote 1) explicitly extend funding to cover Commission-related expenditures, ensuring financial support from the federal budget.

> This ensures that Canada has a strong, funded presence in the joint trade administration body, promoting equity and effective collaboration with the U.S.

---

### **11. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The Act (and its provisions) **come into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- This provides flexibility to allow for phased implementation, ensuring that all stakeholders (e.g., industries, provinces, regulators) are prepared.

> *Note: The Act was implemented in stages:*
> - Sections 1 to 60, 66 to 107, and 109 to 149 came into force on **January 1, 1989**.
> - Sections 61 to 65 came into force on **February 13, 1989**.

---

### **12. Conditions for Regulation Making**

- No regulation under Section 7 (regarding Chapter Eight) may be made **unless the Governor in Council is satisfied** that the **United States has taken satisfactory steps** to implement the Agreement.
- This ensures that Canada does not proceed with regulatory actions that could be inconsistent with U.S. compliance, promoting mutual accountability and trust.

---

### **13. Repeal and Amendments**

- Certain sections were **repealed in 2018** (under *c. 27, s. 298*), reflecting the evolution of trade policy and the eventual replacement of CUSFTA with the **Canada-U.S. Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)** in 2020.
- The Act remains historically significant as the **first major trade implementation law** in Canada and laid the foundation for future trade agreements.
