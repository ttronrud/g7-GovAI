**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Revenue Agency Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Revenue Agency Act* (CRA Act) is a foundational piece of legislation that establishes, defines, and governs the structure, powers, responsibilities, and operational framework of the **Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)**. Enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, the Act continues the legacy of the former Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) as a federal body corporate responsible for administering and enforcing Canada’s tax and revenue laws.

This Act provides a comprehensive legal foundation for the CRA’s mandate, including its relationship with the federal government, provincial governments, Indigenous governments, and its internal governance through a Board of Management and a Commissioner.
