**Detailed Summary of the *Alberta Natural Resources Act* (1930)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Alberta Natural Resources Act*, enacted on May 30, 1930, is a foundational piece of legislation that formally transfers control of key natural resources from the federal government of Canada to the provincial government of Alberta. This act was not a standalone law but rather the **legal embodiment of a bilateral agreement** between the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta. It was designed to place Alberta on **equal footing with the original provinces of Confederation** (such as Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia) in terms of administrative control over its natural resources — a long-standing goal since Alberta joined Confederation in 1905.

The Act is often referred to in historical and legal contexts as the **"Alberta Natural Resources Agreement"**, and it is notable for being one of the first major steps in the **devolution of natural resource management** from the federal to provincial governments in Canada.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

- **Objective**: To ensure that Alberta, as a new province, enjoys **equal rights and administrative control** over its natural resources (land, minerals, water, fisheries) as the original provinces under Section 109 of the *British North America Act, 1867*.
- **Background**: Under the original *Alberta Act* (1905), Crown lands, mines, minerals, and royalties were vested in the Crown and administered by Canada — a condition that placed Alberta at a disadvantage compared to other provinces.
- **Historical Justification**: The 1930 agreement corrected this imbalance, allowing Alberta to manage its own natural resources independently, thereby fostering provincial autonomy and economic self-reliance.

### **2. Transfer of Rights in Natural Resources**

#### **(a) Crown Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties**
- From the **coming into force** of the agreement, all rights in:
  - Crown lands
  - Mines (precious and base)
  - Minerals
  - Royalties derived therefrom
- **Transfer to the Province of Alberta**, subject to:
  - Existing trusts
  - Any non-Crown interests
- These resources will be **administered by the Province of Alberta** for its own purposes.

> **Exception**: Any payments made by Canada *before* the agreement came into force remain the property of Canada. The Province is **not liable to account** to Canada for such prior payments, and Canada is **not liable to account** to the Province for future payments under this agreement.

#### **(b) Water Rights and Water Powers**
- The Crown’s interest in:
  - Waters within Alberta
  - Water powers under the *North-West Irrigation Act, 1898* and the *Dominion Water Power Act*
- Is transferred to the Province.
- The Province gains the right to **dispose of these rights** via sale, license, or other means.
- **Federal jurisdiction** remains over sea-coast and inland fisheries — meaning the Parliament of Canada retains legislative authority in these areas.

> **Important Note**: Section 4 of the *Dominion Water Power Act* (declaring all such undertakings as "works for the general advantage of Canada") is **repealed** within Alberta as of the agreement’s coming into force.

### **3. Obligations and Responsibilities of the Province**

#### **(a) Contracts and Leases**
- The Province must **carry out all existing contracts, leases, or arrangements** with third parties (e.g., individuals or companies) involving Crown lands, mines, or minerals.
- It **cannot alter or terminate** these agreements without:
  - The **consent of all parties** involved (except Canada)
  - Or general legislation that applies to all similar agreements across the province
- Exceptions include:
  - Legislation related to **oil or gas conservation**
  - Regulation of production (e.g., restrictions, prohibitions, repressuring)
  - Compulsory purchase of wells or fields

> This provision protects long-term investments and ensures stability in resource development.

#### **(b) Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) Lands**
- The Province must:
  - Fulfill the terms of the **Deed of Surrender** from HBC to the Crown (1924)
  - Grant any lands HBC is entitled to select
  - Release and discharge reservations in patents (if not already done)
- **No prejudice** to HBC’s existing rights or land interests under prior agreements.

> This reflects Canada’s commitment to honoring its treaty obligations with Indigenous partners and ensuring continuity in Indigenous land rights.

### **4. School Lands Fund Transfer**

- A portion of the **School Lands Fund** (originally created under Dominion Land Acts) is transferred to Alberta.
- The fund includes:
  - Money derived from the disposition of school lands in Alberta
  - Specific school lands designated under Section 37 of the *Dominion Lands Act*
- The Province will:
  - Administer the fund **in accordance with the Dominion Lands Act** (adjusted for provincial law)
  - Invest the funds in **Canadian or provincial securities**, or in securities **guaranteed by Canada or Alberta**
  - Apply the **interest earned** (after management costs) to support **public schools** in accordance with Alberta’s laws

> This provision ensures that Alberta’s education system benefits from the transfer of a significant financial asset.

---

### **5. Indian Reserves and Treaty Obligations**

- **Indian reserves** (confirmed or unconfirmed) remain **vested in the Crown** and administered by Canada.
- The Province agrees to:
  - Set aside **additional Crown lands** (from unoccupied lands now transferred to Alberta) as needed to fulfill Canada’s treaty obligations with Indigenous peoples.
  - These areas will be administered by Canada **as if they had never passed to Alberta**.
- The **provisions of the Ontario Agreement (March 24, 1924)** apply to these reserves — including:
  - No transfer of proceeds or land to the Province
  - No administrative rights for the Province over these lands

> This clause reflects Canada’s constitutional obligation to protect Indigenous rights and maintain treaty-based land governance.

### **6. Parks and Protected Areas**

- The **national parks** listed in the Schedule to the agreement:
  - Remain under federal control
  - Include all lands, mines, and royalties within them
- **Exception**: If Parliament of Canada later declares that a park or part of it is no longer needed for park purposes:
  - The land, minerals, and royalties **automatically transfer to Alberta**
  - The Province then administers them under **paragraph 3** (i.e., with the same rules as other transferred resources)

> This allows flexibility in future land use planning while preserving federal oversight for scenic and environmental protection.

- **Federal jurisdiction** over these areas remains **exclusive**, even if parts are outside the park boundaries.
- Provincial laws that are **not in conflict** with federal laws apply within the parks.
- Provincial taxation laws apply unless excluded by federal authority.

> Canada agrees to introduce legislation to **exclude commercially valuable areas** from national parks — areas previously agreed upon by federal and provincial officials.

> The Province agrees **not to reduce water flow** in rivers or streams within parks below levels deemed necessary to preserve scenic value.

### **7. Liens and Advances**

- Liens on unpatented Crown lands (for seed grain, fodder, or relief under the *Soldier Settlement Act*) remain with Canada.
- The Province will **collect payments due** on these advances on behalf of Canada.
- Upon payment, the lien is discharged by a provincial officer authorized under provincial law.
- The Province will **account for and remit all collected funds to Canada**, with deductions for collection costs (agreed between Canada and Alberta).

> This ensures continuity in federal support programs while allowing the province to manage collections.

---

### **8. Exclusions from Transfer**

- The transfer **does not apply** to:
  - Lands already granted and registered under the **Alberta Land Titles Act** (where Canada is or may become the registered owner)
  - Ungranted Crown lands where:
    - Public funds were spent by Canada
    - The land is currently in use or reserved for federal purposes

> These exclusions protect federal interests in existing infrastructure and administrative operations.

---

### **9. Historic Sites and Conservation Areas**

- The Province agrees **not to dispose of** any historic site notified by Canada.
- Canada undertakes to **maintain** such sites.
- The Province will:
  - Continue and preserve existing **bird sanctuaries and public shooting grounds**
  - Set aside **additional sanctuaries** through agreement between Canada and Alberta

> The Province may **discontinue** any such sanctuary **only if**:
  - An agreement is approved by both federal and provincial ministers
  - The agreement specifically provides for discontinuance

> This balances environmental protection with provincial flexibility.

### **10. Annual Payment to Alberta (Equalization Payment)**

To ensure Alberta is placed on **equal footing with the original provinces**, Canada agrees to make **annual, half-yearly payments** to Alberta based on population:

| Population Range | Annual Payment |
|------------------|----------------|
| Up to 800,000     | $562,500       |
| 800,001 to 1,200,000 | $750,000     |
