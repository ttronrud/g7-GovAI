**Detailed Summary of the *Energy Monitoring Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Energy Monitoring Act* is a Canadian federal statute designed to enhance transparency and oversight of key energy-related activities by requiring detailed reporting from energy enterprises and oil and gas dealers. The Act establishes a framework for collecting, verifying, and managing financial, operational, and ownership data related to the exploration, development, production, processing, refining, and marketing of energy commodities. Its primary objective is to support public policy decisions—particularly in areas such as energy security, taxation, market regulation, and environmental stewardship—by providing reliable, comprehensive data on the energy sector.

Although the Act was originally introduced in 1988, it has undergone significant amendments and was **repealed in 2001** (specifically sections 42–44) under *Chapter 34, Section 42–44*. However, the content provided appears to represent a **draft or historical version** of the Act, likely reflecting its original intent or a version used prior to repeal. As such, this summary focuses on **the structure, provisions, and policy implications** of the Act as presented, even though it is no longer in force.

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

### **1. Key Definitions**
- **Canada**: Includes the continental shelf of Canada.
- **Energy Commodity**: 
  - Initially defined as oil and gas, and any prescribed product derived from their processing or refining.
  - Can be expanded to include **coal, thorium, and uranium**, or any designated substance under section 10. This allows flexibility in scope depending on future regulatory needs.
- **Energy Enterprise**:
  - Any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, or organization involved in:
    - Exploration for, or
    - Development, production, processing, refining, or marketing of energy commodities.
- **Gas**: Any hydrocarbon or mixture of hydrocarbons that are gaseous at 15°C and 101.325 kPa.
- **Oil**: Any hydrocarbon mixture other than gas or coal.
- **Petroleum Product**: A prescribed product resulting from the production, processing, or refining of oil or gas.
- **Prescribed**: Means as defined by regulations (i.e., subject to ministerial discretion).
- **Controlled Corporation**: A corporation where more than 50% of voting shares are held directly or indirectly (not merely as security) by an energy enterprise or another corporation.

> These definitions establish a broad but precise framework for identifying who falls under the Act’s regulatory purview.

## **Applicability of the Act**

The Act applies to **every energy enterprise** that meets **either** of the following thresholds:

1. **Gross annual revenues** from energy activities (as defined) exceeding **$10 million**, or a higher amount prescribed by regulation.
2. **Assets related to energy activities** exceeding **$10 million**, or a higher amount prescribed by regulation.

> The thresholds are flexible and can be adjusted by regulation to reflect economic changes or sectoral developments.

> **Note**: The Act does not apply to all energy enterprises. Exceptions exist for certain types of entities (e.g., those with low volumes of activity), and the Minister may extend reporting obligations if it is in the public interest.

|--------|--------|
| Ownership & Control | Who owns or controls the enterprise? |
| Sources & Use of Funds | Where do funds come from? How are they used? |
| Financial Position & Performance | Profitability, liquidity, balance sheet data |
| Exploration, Development, Production, Processing, Refining, Marketing | Full activity tracking |
| Costs & Revenues | Per activity, including capital and non-capital expenses |
| Tax Deductions | Resource allowances, capital cost allowances, losses, credits |

### **2. Reporting for Non-Resident or Foreign-Based Energy Enterprises**
For energy enterprises that are:
- Individuals not ordinarily resident in Canada,
- Corporations incorporated outside Canada,
- Partnerships where all partners are non-residents or foreign-incorporated,
- Trusts governed by foreign laws,

They must still file returns covering:
- Ownership and control,
- Holdings and operations in Canada,
- Operations and holdings of any controlled corporations.

> This ensures that foreign entities with Canadian operations remain subject to Canadian energy monitoring.

---

### **3. Minister’s Discretionary Authority**
Where the Minister determines that it is in the **public interest**, he may:
- Require **non-applicable energy enterprises** (those below threshold) to file returns.
- Require **corporations that control energy enterprises** to report on:
  - Ownership and control,
  - Holdings and operations in Canada (specifically paragraphs (a), (b), (h), and (j)).

> This gives the Minister flexibility to respond to emerging risks or policy concerns.

---

### **4. Additional Documentation and Compliance**
All energy enterprises and oil and gas dealers required by the Act must:
- Maintain **accurate records, books of account, and documents** at their Canadian place of business or a prescribed location.
- Retain these records for **six years** from the end of the reporting period.
- Make records **available for audit or examination** at reasonable times to authorized persons (e.g., Minister’s officials).
- Provide **all reasonable assistance**, including access to sites, answers to questions, and documentation.

> This ensures data integrity and facilitates regulatory oversight.

## **Reporting for Oil and Gas Dealers**

### **Applicability**
The Act does **not apply** to oil and gas dealers who:
- Supplied, transported, or stored **less than 100 million litres** of oil, gas, or petroleum products in the 12 months before the reporting period.

> This creates a **volume-based exemption** to reduce administrative burden on small-scale dealers.

### **Mandatory Reporting Requirements**
Dealers must report on:
- Production, processing, refining, storage, marketing, sale, and use of oil, gas, and petroleum products.
- Costs, revenues, prices, and profits related to each activity.

> This enables monitoring of market flows and pricing dynamics.

### **Minister’s Discretionary Power**
If the Minister considers it in the public interest, he may require even non-applicable dealers to file returns.

### **Data Sharing with the Energy Supplies Allocation Board**
The Minister may **share statistics and documentation** obtained from oil and gas dealers with the **Energy Supplies Allocation Board** (established under the *Energy Supplies Emergency Act*), which is responsible for managing energy supply during emergencies.

> This strengthens emergency preparedness and supply chain monitoring.

## **Public Disclosure and Privacy Protections**

### **Publication of Reports**
- The Minister may publish reports on energy commodities and enterprises.
- **Privacy Protection Clause**: The Minister **cannot publish** any data that:
