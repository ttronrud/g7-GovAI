**Detailed Summary of the *Postal Services Interruption Relief Act***

---

### **1. Title and Purpose**
The *Postal Services Interruption Relief Act* is a legislative measure designed to provide **relief to individuals who suffer loss or hardship** due to the **interruption of normal postal services in Canada for more than 48 hours**. The Act enables affected individuals to apply for judicial relief when they are unable to meet time requirements or period of limitations under Canadian laws—specifically because of the postal disruption.

The core purpose of the Act is to **ensure that legal rights and obligations are not unduly prejudiced** by circumstances beyond the individual’s control, such as a prolonged failure of postal services that prevents timely communication or submission of documents.

---

### **2. Who Can Apply for Relief?**
Any person who:
- Has suffered **loss or hardship** as a result of an interruption in normal postal services in Canada,
- And the interruption has lasted **more than 48 hours**,  
may apply for relief under this Act.

This includes individuals who, because of the postal failure, failed to comply with a **time requirement or period of limitation** in any Canadian law (e.g., deadlines for filing a claim, responding to a notice, initiating legal proceedings, etc.).

---

### **3. How to Make an Application**
An applicant must:
- Submit a **written application** to the **Deputy Attorney General of Canada** within **14 days** of the date the application is made.
- The application must be made on **14 days’ written notice** to the Deputy Attorney General.

Additionally, if the applicant believes that **any other person may be affected** by the relief order (e.g., if the delay impacts a third party’s rights), they must also serve notice on that other person.

> **Note**: This notice requirement ensures transparency and allows affected parties to be informed and potentially participate in the process.

---

### **4. Conditions for Granting Relief**
A judge of the Federal Court may grant relief **only if** the following conditions are satisfied:

1. **Loss or Hardship**  
   The applicant must have suffered actual loss or hardship due to the interruption of postal services.

2. **Reasonable Efforts to Comply**  
   The applicant must have taken **all reasonable steps possible** to comply with the time requirement or limitation, but those efforts were **unsuccessful**.

3. **No Undue Delay**  
   The application must have been made **without undue delay** after the interruption began.

These criteria ensure that the relief is not granted arbitrarily or in cases where the applicant could have reasonably acted to meet deadlines.

---

### **5. Powers of the Judge to Grant Relief**
If the judge is satisfied with the above conditions, they may issue an order (relief) that includes the following:

#### a) **Waiver of Time Requirements**
- The judge may **waive** the original time requirement or period of limitation for the applicant.
- The judge may **fix a new, reasonable time requirement** or period of limitation, based on the specific circumstances.

> Example: If a person missed a 30-day deadline to file a complaint due to postal failure, the judge may extend the deadline to 60 days.

#### b) **Further Orders to Enable Compliance**
- The judge may issue **additional orders** necessary to allow the applicant to:
  - Effectively perform any act,
  - Exercise any legal right,
  - Or carry out any obligation that they would have been able to fulfill **but for the failure to meet the deadline**.

> Example: If a person missed a deadline to serve a notice of claim, the judge may order that the notice be served now, or that the claim be filed with a new date.

---

### **6. Special Provision for Legal Proceedings**
Where the time requirement or limitation relates to:
- The **commencement** of a legal proceeding (e.g., filing a lawsuit),
- Or the **continuation** of such a proceeding,

Then the judge has the power to issue orders that **enable the proceeding to proceed as though the deadline had never been missed**.

> This means the proceeding can be treated as if it had been timely initiated, including the ability to proceed with discovery, hearings, or appeals.

This is a significant provision—it effectively **preserves the integrity of legal processes** even when postal failures prevent timely actions.

---

### **7. Public Notice Requirement**
If the judge determines that **public notice of the hearing** should be given (to ensure that others who may be affected by the order are aware and can respond), then:

- The judge may **direct the applicant** to give public notice of the hearing.
- The notice must be in a form and manner deemed appropriate by the judge.

After public notice is given, the judge may issue **further directions** over time to ensure that any affected person has a fair opportunity to:
- Be heard,
- Make representations,
- Or object to the proposed order.

This promotes **transparency, fairness, and accountability** in the judicial process.

---

### **8. Jurisdictional Flexibility**
The Act includes a key provision of **jurisdictional flexibility**:

> Any matter or requirement authorized or required by this Act to be done or acted upon by a judge of the Federal Court **may be carried out by any other judge** of the Federal Court, as though the application were made directly to that judge.

This means that:
- The application does not need to be heard by a specific judge.
- The process is **not geographically or administratively restricted**.
- It enhances **accessibility and efficiency** in the judicial system.
