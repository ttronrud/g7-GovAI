The provided text consists entirely of repeated annotations indicating that certain provisions have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished) by specific legislative acts and sections.

### 🔍 Detailed Summary:

**Title:**  
*Summary of a Repealed Legal Provision (No Original Act Specified)*

**Key Information:**

- The text lists **over 100 instances** of repeals, all referencing the same legislative action:
  - **Repealed, 2002, c. 7, s. 282**
  - A few additional repeals reference other statutes:
    - *Repealed, 1996, c. 27, s. 6*
    - *Repealed, 1994, c. 43, s. 101*

- These entries indicate that **specific sections or provisions** of prior legislation were **officially removed or canceled** by amendments passed in:
  - **2002** (most frequently): *Chapter 7, Section 282* of the Statutes of the province (likely Ontario, given the format and context of Canadian legislation)
  - **1996**: *Chapter 27, Section 6*
  - **1994**: *Chapter 43, Section 101*

- The repeated nature of the entries suggests that **multiple provisions** were repealed under the same authority (Section 282 of Chapter 7, 2002), possibly due to consolidation, modernization, or redundancy in the legal framework.

### 📚 Interpretation:

There is **no active, substantive content** in the provided text — it does not describe the original law, its purpose, or its provisions. Instead, it is a **list of repeals**, meaning:

> "This section or provision of the law is no longer in force and has been officially removed by statute."

Thus, the **summary of the act** is not of a functioning law, but rather a **record of legislative amendments that removed outdated or obsolete laws**.

### 📌 Key Points:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nature of the Text** | A list of repeals (cancellations) of legal provisions |
| **Primary Repeal Authority** | *2002, c. 7, s. 282* (Section 282 of Chapter 7 of the 2002 Statutes) |
| **Other Repeals** | Also includes references to 1994 and 1996 statutes |
| **Original Law Status** | All referenced provisions are **no longer valid** |
| **Purpose of Repeal** | Likely due to redundancy, obsolescence, or legislative consolidation |
| **Jurisdiction** | Likely **Ontario, Canada**, based on the format of statutory citations (common in Ontario legislation) |

### 🚫 Important Note:

Since the original provisions have been **repealed**, there is **no current legal effect** of these sections. Any attempt to reference or apply them would be invalid.

### ✅ Conclusion:

**The provided text does not summarize an active act or law. It is a record of repeals — a list of legal provisions that have been formally abolished.**  
The most significant repeal authority cited is *2002, c. 7, s. 282*, which removed numerous prior sections of legislation. These repeals reflect efforts by the legislature to streamline, modernize, or eliminate outdated or overlapping laws.

➡️ **In short:**  
*There is no detailed summary of an act because the content consists only of repeals. The original laws referenced have been officially canceled and are no longer in force.*

If you have a specific original act or section (e.g., a section that was repealed) and would like a summary of what it *used to* cover, I can help reconstruct that based on historical records or legal databases.
