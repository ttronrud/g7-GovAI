**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Safety Act***  

---

### **1. Title and Applicability**

- **Citation**: The Act is known as the *Railway Safety Act*.
- **Applicability**: The Act applies to **railways within the legislative authority of Parliament**, meaning national railways (not provincial ones).
- **Exclusions**:
  - Railways referenced in **Section 16 of the Harbour Commissions Act** (e.g., certain harbor-related railways).
  - Railways referenced in **Section 29 of the Canada Marine Act**, except where **regulations under subsection 29(2)** extend its application.

> This ensures that the Act does not apply to certain specialized or marine-related railways, preserving jurisdictional boundaries.

### **2. Objectives of the Act**

The Act is designed to achieve four core objectives:

1. **Safety and Security**:
   - Promote and ensure the safety and security of the **public, railway personnel, property, and the environment** during railway operations.

2. **Stakeholder Collaboration**:
   - Encourage active **participation and collaboration** among interested parties (e.g., employees, communities, unions, contractors) to improve railway safety and security.

3. **Corporate Responsibility**:
   - Hold railway companies accountable by requiring them to **demonstrate continuous risk management** through formal **Safety Management Systems (SMS)** and other tools.

4. **Modern and Flexible Regulation**:
   - Establish a **modern, adaptable, and efficient regulatory framework** that enables ongoing improvements in railway safety and security.

### **3. Role of the Minister of Transport**

The **Minister of Transport** is primarily responsible for:

- Developing and regulating safety and security matters related to railways.
- Supervising all railway-related activities.

#### Powers and Functions:
- Promote railway safety through appropriate means (e.g., public awareness, education, research).
- Provide facilities and services for collecting, publishing, or disseminating safety-related information.
- Conduct or cooperate in **technical research, studies, investigations**, and projects.
- Inspect, examine, and report on railway operations and safety practices.
- Undertake other activities deemed appropriate by the Minister or directed by the **Governor in Council** (the federal Cabinet).

> This gives the Minister broad authority to ensure compliance and drive safety improvements.

### **5. Safety and Threat Assessment Principles**

- **Safety Evaluation**:
  - Safety is assessed not only for **passengers and cargo** but also for **other persons and property** (e.g., nearby residents, infrastructure).
  
- **Definition of Threat**:
  - A **threat** is a hazard or condition that could reasonably lead to injury, illness, environmental damage, or property loss.
  - A threat is **immediate** if such harm already exists.

> This broadens the scope of safety beyond just operational risks to include community and environmental impacts.

---

### **6. Filing and Notification Procedures**

For notices or documents:
- **Individuals**: Must be delivered by **personal service, facsimile, or registered mail** to the latest known address.

- **Electronic means**: Approved by the Minister and subject to conditions.

> Ensures proper notice and transparency in all regulatory processes.

---

### **7. Supremacy of the Act**

- The **Railway Safety Act and its regulations, orders, certificates, and emergency directives** **prevail over any conflicting agreements or orders** that allow railway operations.
- This ensures that federal safety standards take precedence over private or contractual arrangements.

> Prevents unsafe practices justified by private agreements.

---

### **8. Coordination with Other Acts**

- If a railway work affects a **navigable waterway** (as defined in the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act*), the requirements of **both acts apply** — they are **not mutually exclusive**.
