The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular provision or set of provisions has been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from law) by **Bill C-33, 2017**, under **section 227** of that act.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The referenced provisions are **repealed** (no longer in force).
- **Repealing Legislation**: *Bill C-33, 2017* (an act of the Canadian Parliament).
- **Repealing Section**: Section 227 of Bill C-33, 2017.
- **Number of Repeals**: The text lists the same repeal entry 14 times, suggesting that multiple provisions (or clauses) within a particular statute were repealed under this section. However, the specific statute being repealed is not named in the input.

### Interpretation:

The repeated "[Repealed, 2017, c. 33, s. 227]" entries indicate that **a number of provisions from a prior act or regulation were removed by the passage of the Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017 (Bill C-33)**. Bill C-33 was introduced to modernize and reform certain aspects of the *Criminal Code*, including changes related to sentencing, cybercrime, and other criminal law provisions.

Section 227 of Bill C-33 specifically included provisions that **repealed outdated or redundant sections** from the *Criminal Code* or other related statutes. While the exact provisions are not listed here, such repeals typically involve:

- Outdated definitions or penalties
- Provisions that were rendered obsolete by new legislation
- Laws that were inconsistent with current legal standards or public policy

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or enforceable law** in this text. The content is a **list of repeals**, not a description of a current act. Therefore:

> **The act referenced in this summary has been repealed and is no longer in force.**  
> It was formally removed by **Section 227 of Bill C-33, 2017**, which was passed in the Canadian Parliament to modernize the *Criminal Code*.  
> The repeated entries simply reflect that multiple provisions were affected by this repeal.

### Note:
To provide a more precise summary (e.g., which specific sections were repealed or what the original purpose was), the **original statute** being repealed would need to be identified. Without that, this summary is based solely on the repealing legislation and the status of the provision.

If you can provide the name of the original act or section that was repealed, I can offer a more detailed and specific analysis.
