## 🏛️ **Detailed Summary of the Building Canada Act**

### **1. Purpose and Legislative Context**

The *Building Canada Act* (Bill C-34) was enacted to **accelerate the development of nationally significant infrastructure projects** across Canada — particularly in underserved or remote regions such as the North — by streamlining regulatory processes while maintaining environmental protections and respecting Indigenous rights.

#### **Core Objectives:**
- Strengthen **national economic security**, **sovereignty**, and **energy resilience**.
- Enhance **trade corridors**, **economic connectivity**, and **market access**.
- Create **good-paying, unionized jobs**.
- Promote **clean growth** and **climate change mitigation**.
- Improve **regulatory certainty** and **investor confidence**.
- Ensure **transparency**, **accountability**, and **public participation**.

The Act responds to growing recognition that Canada needs faster, more efficient pathways for major infrastructure projects — especially those critical to energy, transportation, and resource development — without compromising environmental or Indigenous rights.

### **3. Process for Designating National Interest Projects**

#### **Step 1: Determining National Interest**
- The **Governor in Council** may designate a project as a **national interest project** by **amending Schedule 1**.
- Before doing so, the Governor must:
  - Publish a **30-day public notice** in the *Canada Gazette*.
  - Obtain **written consent from the provincial or territorial government** if the project falls within exclusive provincial/territorial jurisdiction (e.g., land use, water rights).
- The order must include **specific, measurable criteria** for why the project is in the national interest.

> 🔍 **Criteria Considered:**
> - Strengthens national autonomy, resilience, and security.
> - Provides economic or other benefits to Canada.
> - Has a high likelihood of successful execution.
> - Advances Indigenous peoples’ interests.
> - Contributes to clean growth and climate goals.

#### **Step 2: Time Limits and Accountability**
- The Governor **must issue the order within 15 days** of the Act coming into force.
- If no order is issued within that time, the **Minister must table a report** in both Houses of Parliament explaining the delay and outlining a revised timeline.

> ⚠️ **No designations allowed during prorogation or dissolution of Parliament**, nor after the **fifth anniversary** of the Act’s commencement.

#### **Step 3: Amendments and Removal**
- The Governor can:
  - **Add** a new project to Schedule 1 (with public notice and consultation).
  - **Amend** the name or description of an existing project.
  - **Remove** a project if it is no longer in the national interest.
- However, **removal is prohibited once a formal authorization document has been issued** for the project.

> 🚫 **Important Limitation**: Once a document (authorization) is issued under Section 7, the project cannot be removed from Schedule 1.
