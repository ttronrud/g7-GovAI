**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act***

---

### **Act Title and Citation**  
The Act is titled the *Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act* and may be cited as such. It establishes a federal funding mechanism to support large-scale strategic infrastructure projects across Canada.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Eligible Project**  
   - Refers to a *large-scale project* involving the **construction, renewal, or material enhancement** of strategic infrastructure.  
   - Must be carried out (or planned to be carried out) by an **eligible recipient**.  
   - The focus is on significant investments that deliver tangible public benefits.

2. **Minister**  
   - The individual appointed by the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) to serve as the Minister responsible for administering the Fund.  
   - This role includes assessing applications, determining eligibility, and negotiating agreements with eligible recipients.

3. **Strategic Infrastructure**  
   - Defined as fixed capital assets used or operated for the public benefit. Specific categories include:
     - Highway or rail infrastructure  
     - Local transportation infrastructure  
     - Tourism or urban development infrastructure  
     - Sewage treatment infrastructure  
     - Water infrastructure  
   - Additionally, the Governor in Council may, by regulation, **add other types of infrastructure** to this list (e.g., energy, broadband, or climate-resilient systems).

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Fund**

The primary objective of the *Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund* is to:

- Provide **financial contributions** to eligible recipients for carrying out large-scale strategic infrastructure projects.  
- Support projects that:
  - Contribute to **economic growth** in Canada  
  - Improve **quality of life** for Canadians  
  - Advance Canada’s national infrastructure goals (e.g., sustainability, resilience, equity, innovation)

The Fund also aims to **promote public-private partnerships (PPPs)** where appropriate, encouraging collaboration between government and private sector entities to leverage resources, expertise, and innovation.

### **Eligible Recipients**

Eligible recipients are those organizations capable of carrying out eligible projects. They fall into three categories:

#### 1. **Provincial or Municipal Governments**
   - Includes:
     - Provinces
     - Municipal or regional governments established under provincial legislation

#### 2. **Public Sector Bodies**
   - Must meet two conditions:
     - Carry out (or be capable of carrying out) an eligible project in Canada  
     - Have legal capacity, or be composed of organizations each of which has legal capacity  
   - These may include agencies or authorities created by provincial legislation, regulation, or in partnership with provincial governments.

#### 3. **Private Sector Bodies**
   - Must meet two conditions:
     - Carry out (or be capable of carrying out) an eligible project in Canada  
     - Have legal capacity, or be composed of organizations each of which has legal capacity  
   - This allows private companies (e.g., construction firms, infrastructure developers) to participate, especially in PPP models.

> **Note:** The Minister has discretion in assessing whether a recipient is capable of carrying out a project — this introduces a degree of flexibility in eligibility determination.

---

### **Funding Mechanism**

- The **Minister** may enter into an **agreement** with an eligible recipient to provide a **financial contribution** for an eligible project.  
- The contribution is intended to support the project's implementation, not to replace full public funding.  
- The amount and conditions of the contribution will be determined through negotiation and based on the project's merit, public benefit, and alignment with national infrastructure priorities.

---

### **Regulatory Authority**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has broad powers to make regulations to implement the Act, including:

1. **Expanding the Definition of Strategic Infrastructure**  
   - Can add new types of fixed capital assets to the list in section 2 (e.g., renewable energy infrastructure, digital infrastructure, or climate adaptation systems).

2. **Defining "Large-Scale Project"**  
   - Can establish criteria for what constitutes a "large-scale" project (e.g., minimum investment threshold, geographic scope, or scale of impact).

3. **Setting Additional Terms and Conditions**  
   - Can introduce requirements for project reporting, performance metrics, environmental standards, transparency, or public accountability.

> These regulations ensure the Fund remains adaptable to evolving infrastructure needs and policy priorities.

---

### **Repeal of Prior Provision**

- **Section 47 of Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2002** (which previously governed a similar infrastructure fund) is **repealed**.  
- This indicates a deliberate shift or replacement of an older, potentially outdated framework with a more modern, focused, and flexible mechanism under the new *Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act*.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Public Benefit Focus** | Projects must deliver measurable benefits to economic growth and quality of life. |
| **Inclusive Eligibility** | Opens the door to private sector participation through PPPs, enhancing efficiency and innovation. |
| **Flexibility via Regulation** | Allows adaptation to emerging infrastructure needs (e.g., green infrastructure, digital networks). |
| **Federal Oversight** | The Minister and Governor in Council maintain control over eligibility, funding decisions, and regulatory development. |
| **Modernization** | Replaces outdated legislation, signaling a renewed federal commitment to infrastructure investment. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act* establishes a targeted, flexible, and forward-looking federal program to finance large-scale infrastructure projects that serve the public interest. By enabling both public and private actors to participate, and by allowing regulatory adaptation to new challenges (such as climate change or digital transformation), the Act supports Canada’s long-term economic resilience, regional equity, and sustainable development. It represents a strategic investment in the nation’s physical and social foundations, aligning infrastructure development with national priorities and cross-sector collaboration.

This Act is a foundational piece of legislation in Canada’s ongoing efforts to modernize its infrastructure network and ensure that future growth is built on robust, inclusive, and sustainable foundations.
