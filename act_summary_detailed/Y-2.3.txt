**Detailed Summary of the Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act* (often referred to as the **Yukon Land Claims Act**) is a foundational piece of Canadian federal legislation enacted to give legal effect, validity, and enforceability to land claims agreements between the Government of Canada, the Government of the Yukon Territory, and various First Nations in the Yukon. The Act formalizes and ratifies the outcomes of several final agreements reached under the umbrella of the **Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA)** signed on May 29, 1993.

This Act serves as the legal framework that enables the implementation of land claims settlements, establishes rights and responsibilities of First Nations, and ensures that these agreements are recognized and upheld under Canadian law — including constitutional law.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

The Act is rooted in the **Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA)** signed on May 29, 1993, by:
- Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada,
- The Government of the Yukon Territory,
- The Council for Yukon Indians (representing First Nations in the Yukon).

The UFA sets out **common principles and provisions** applicable to all First Nations in the Yukon, such as:
- Land rights,
- Self-governance,
- Resource management,
- Cultural preservation,
- Enrollment and membership rules,
- Dispute resolution mechanisms.

Each First Nation then entered into a **specific final agreement** incorporating the UFA and adding provisions tailored to their unique circumstances.

This Act provides **legal recognition and enforceability** to those final agreements and any future agreements, ensuring they are binding and effective under Canadian law.

---

### **2. Definitions**

Key terms defined in the Act include:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Final Agreement** | A land claims agreement specific to a First Nation that incorporates the UFA and includes any amendments made over time. |
| **First Nation** | A First Nation named in the Schedule (e.g., Champagne and Aishihik, Teslin Tlingit, Vuntut Gwitchin). |
| **Settlement Land** | Land identified in a First Nation’s final agreement as belonging to that Nation. |
| **Transboundary Agreement** | Agreements involving shared resources or territories across jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., between Yukon and BC or NWT), incorporating the UFA and subject to amendments. |
| **Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA)** | The 1993 agreement signed by all parties, including all amendments made in accordance with its provisions. |

These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in how the agreements are interpreted and applied.

---

### **3. Approval and Validity of Agreements**

#### **Approved Final Agreements**
The Act explicitly approves, gives effect to, and declares valid the following four final agreements signed in 1993:
- Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Final Agreement  
- First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun Final Agreement  
- Teslin Tlingit Council Final Agreement  
- Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Final Agreement  

These are now legally binding and enforceable under Canadian law.

#### **Future Agreements**
The Governor in Council (federal minister) may, by order, approve, give effect to, and declare valid:
- Any **new final agreement** or **transboundary agreement** entered into after the Act comes into force.

Such orders must be laid before the **House of Commons** within the first 30 days of the House’s sitting after the order is made — ensuring parliamentary oversight.

---

### **4. Constitutional Recognition**

> **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982** recognizes Aboriginal and treaty rights.

The Act explicitly states that:
- A **final agreement or transboundary agreement in effect is a land claims agreement** within the meaning of Section 35.
- This recognition affirms the **constitutional status** of these agreements as part of Canada’s legal and constitutional framework.

---

### **5. Binding Effect and Legal Authority**

To ensure enforceability and clarity:

- The agreements are **binding on all persons and bodies not party to them** (i.e., third parties).
- A First Nation has **exclusive rights, title, obligations, and liabilities** regarding its **settlement land**, as defined in its final agreement.
- Any individual or body (e.g., a council, commission, or organization) that is granted powers, rights, or benefits under a final agreement **must perform duties and is liable** for any obligations imposed.

---

### **6. Capacity of Entities Established Under Agreements**

The Act grants **legal personhood** to certain bodies established under the agreements, allowing them to act independently and have legal standing:

| Entity | Capacity and Rights |
|-------|---------------------|
| Yukon Land Use Planning Council, Heritage Resources Board, Geographical Place Names Board, Fish and Wildlife Management Board (including salmon subcommittee), and Dispute Resolution Board | Have the **capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person** to carry out their objectives. |
| Renewable Resources Council (established under a final agreement) | Has the capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person. |
| Kluane National Park Management Board (under Champagne and Aishihik Final Agreement) | Has the capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person. |
| Any body established under a final agreement or transboundary agreement after the Act comes into force | Has such capacity **from the date the agreement is given effect**, to the extent provided by the agreement. |

This enables these entities to:
- Enter into contracts,
- Own property,
- Sue or be sued,
- Apply for funding or permits.

### **7. Supremacy of Final Agreements**

In cases of conflict or inconsistency, the following rules apply in order of priority:

| Conflict Type | Prevailing Provision |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Final agreement vs. federal or territorial law | **Final agreement prevails** |
| This Act vs. another federal or territorial law | **This Act prevails** |
| UFA (incorporated into final agreement) vs. specific provisions of the final agreement | **UFA prevails** |
| Inuvialuit Final Agreement (as of March 31, 1993) vs. a final agreement or transboundary agreement | **Inuvialuit Final Agreement prevails** |

> This hierarchy ensures that **First Nations’ land rights and self-determination are protected** and that agreements are not overridden by general legislation.

---

### **8. Interpretation and Ambiguity**

- If there is **doubt about the meaning of a provision in this Act**, the **final agreement or transboundary agreement** may be examined as an aid to interpretation.
- This allows for **contextual and community-based interpretation**, respecting the intent and cultural understanding of the First Nations.

---

### **9. Financial Obligations**

- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** will pay out the **monetary obligations** of Canada under:
  - Chapter 19 of each final agreement (which typically includes compensation, funding, and other financial commitments),
  - Corresponding provisions in any transboundary agreement.

This ensures that financial obligations are met and that funding is available for implementation.

---

### **10. Record-Keeping and Access**

The Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs is required to deposit certified copies of:
- Final agreements,
- Transboundary agreements,
- Any amendments,

in the following places:
1. **Library and Archives of Canada** (national archive),
2. **Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs** (in the National Capital Region),
3. **Regional offices of the Government of Canada in Yukon** (as deemed advisable),
4. **Other locations** as the Minister considers appropriate.

This promotes **transparency, accountability, and public access** to land claims documents.

---

### **11. Consultation Requirements**

- Consultations required under **Clause 20.6.3** of a final agreement (e.g., regarding implementation of clauses 20.6.1 or 20.6.2) must be carried out **in accordance with the procedures set out in the agreement**.

This ensures that **community input and participation** are respected during implementation.

---

### **12. Regulatory Authority**

- The Governor in Council may make **orders and regulations** necessary to implement any provision of a final agreement or transboundary agreement.

This allows for **flexible, practical enforcement** of the agreements while maintaining legal authority.

---

### **13. Repeals and Amendments**

- **Section 339 (2009)**: Repealed certain outdated provisions.
- **Section 257 (2002)**: Repealed provisions related to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, updated to reflect the renaming of the department to **Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs**.
- **Section 258**: Repealed provisions related to the date of coming into force.

> The Act was **initially in force on February 14, 1995**, but key provisions (especially those related to departmental references) were **repealed and updated in 2002 and 2009** to reflect modern governance structures.
