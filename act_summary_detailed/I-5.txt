## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Indian Act**

---

### 🔹 **Overview and Purpose**
The *Indian Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian federal legislation that governs the status, rights, and responsibilities of **Indigenous peoples** (specifically, "Indians") and their communities — known as **bands** — in relation to land, governance, and financial matters. It establishes a legal framework for the administration of reserves, band membership, and the rights of Indigenous individuals in Canada.

> **Citation**: *This Act may be cited as the Indian Act.*

### 🔹 **Key Definitions (Core Legal Terms)**

| Term | Definition & Context |
|------|------------------------|
| **Band** | A group of Indians for whom land or funds have been set aside by Her Majesty (the Crown) before or after September 4, 1951. A band may be formally declared by the Governor in Council. It is the primary unit of governance under the Act. |
| **Band List** | A list maintained by a band or the Department of Indigenous Services (Department) of individuals who are members of the band. It is essential for determining voting rights and membership. |
| **Child** | Includes both legally adopted children and those adopted under Indigenous custom. |
| **Common-law Partner** | A person cohabiting with another in a conjugal relationship for at least one year. Recognized for legal and governance purposes. |
| **Council of the Band** | The governing body of a band. Its composition depends on the band's status:<br>• If covered by the *First Nations Elections Act*, the elected council under that Act.<br>• If removed from that schedule, the council under a community election code.<br>• Otherwise, chosen according to band custom or, if no council exists, the chief is elected by custom. |
| **Department** | The *Department of Indigenous Services* (formerly known as the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development). Responsible for administering the Indian Register, Band Lists, and related functions. |
| **Designated Lands** | Land held by the Crown that was once a reserve but where the band has *released or surrendered* its rights (not absolutely). These are not reserves but are still subject to certain regulations. |
| **Elector** | A person who is:<br>• Registered on a Band List,<br>• At least 18 years old,<br>• Not disqualified from voting at band elections. |
| **Estate** | Includes real and personal property and any interest in land. Important in matters of inheritance and mental incapacity. |
| **Indian** | A person registered in the Indian Register or entitled to be registered under this Act. Excludes Inuit (though this exclusion is limited and historically significant). |
| **Indian Moneys** | All money collected, held, or received by the Crown for the use and benefit of Indians or bands. Includes reserves, trust funds, and revenues. |
| **Indian Register** | The official record of all persons entitled to be registered as Indians. Maintained by the Registrar in the Department. |

| **Mentally Incompetent Indian** | An Indian found by provincial law to be mentally defective or incompetent for estate administration purposes. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Indigenous Services. Serves as the **superintendent general of Indian affairs**. |
| **Registrar** | The officer in the Department responsible for maintaining the Indian Register and Band Lists. |
| **Reserve** | Land set apart by the Crown for the use and benefit of a band. **Excludes designated lands** unless otherwise specified (see exceptions in section 18). |
| **Superintendent** | Includes various officials (commissioners, regional supervisors, Indian superintendents, etc.) appointed by the Minister. Responsible for oversight of bands and reserves. |
| **Surrendered Lands** | Reserves or parts of reserves that have been formally released or surrendered by the band. Still legally held by the Crown. |

### 🔹 **Governance and Decision-Making Requirements**

> **General Principle**: Powers conferred on a band or its council are **not exercised unless approved by a majority** of relevant electors or councillors.

- **Band Powers**: Must be exercised with the consent of a **majority of the electors** of the band.
- **Council Powers**: Must be exercised with the consent of a **majority of the councillors present** at a duly convened meeting.

> **Note**: This ensures democratic accountability within band governance, even when decisions are made by councils or bands.

---

### 🔹 **Role of the Minister and Governor in Council**

- The **Minister of Indigenous Services** is the **superintendent general of Indian affairs**, providing overall oversight.
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by **proclamation**, declare that:
  - This Act (or parts of it) **does not apply** to certain Indians, groups, reserves, or surrendered lands.
  - Such declarations can be **revoked** at any time.
- **Special Authority**: The Governor in Council is deemed to have had the authority to make declarations regarding **sections 11, 12, and 14** (which relate to registration and eligibility) **prior to April 17, 1985** — a critical historical reference point.

> **Purpose**: Allows flexibility in applying the Act to specific communities or circumstances, especially where cultural or legal differences exist.

---

### 🔹 **Application of the Act to Non-Resident Indians**

> **Sections 114 to 117 and sections 42 to 52 do NOT apply** to any Indian who:
- Does **not ordinarily reside** on a reserve or on Crown-owned lands (in Canada or a province).

> **Implication**: The Act's provisions on land rights, band membership, and governance are **not automatically extended** to non-resident Indigenous individuals. This reflects a shift from broad application to more localized, community-based governance.

---

### 🔹 **Broadening the Scope of "Indian" in Key Provisions**

> In several provisions, a reference to "an Indian" is **deemed to include** any person whose name is entered in a **Band List** and who is **entitled to have it entered**.

This includes:
- Definitions of "band", "Indian moneys", "mentally incompetent Indian"
- Voting rights (sections 20, 22–25)
- Succession and inheritance (sections 31, 35, 51–52.3)
- Band membership and governance (sections 58, 61, 63, 65, 66, 70, 71, 84, 87, 88, 89, 107)

> **Significance**: Expands the reach of the Act beyond strict registration to include **band members** — even if not formally registered as "Indians" — in matters involving voting, property, and governance.

## 🔹 **Indian Register: Rules and Procedures**

### 1. **Establishment and Continuity**
- The Indian Register is maintained in the Department and contains the names of all persons entitled to be registered as Indians.
- The names in the Indian Register **as of April 17, 1985** are the official ones on that date — a key **legal reference point**.

### 2. **Addition or Deletion**
- The **Registrar** may add or delete names from the Register based on applications or legal determinations.
- Each entry includes the **date of addition or deletion**.

### 3. **Application Process**
- A name is **not required** to be recorded unless an **application is submitted** to the Registrar.

### 4. **Determining Ancestry When Parental Identity is Unknown**
> A major innovation in the 1985 amendments.

If a parent, grandparent, or ancestor of an applicant is **unknown or unstated** on a birth certificate:
- The Registrar **does not need to establish identity**.
- Can make a determination **based on credible evidence** presented by the applicant.
- Must **draw every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant**.
- **No presumption** that the ancestor was not entitled to be registered.

> **Key Principle**: Prevents disqualification due to missing documentation. Recognizes Indigenous knowledge and oral traditions.

## 🔹 **Who Is Entitled to Be Registered as an Indian?**

> **Subject to Section 7**, a person is entitled to registration if **any of the following conditions apply**:

### ✅ Paragraph (1)(a)
- Was registered or entitled to be registered **before April 17, 1985**.
- Or, their name was **omitted or deleted** from the Indian Register or a Band List **before September 4, 1951**, under specific provisions (e.g., 12(1)(a)(iv), 12(1)(b), 109(2)).
