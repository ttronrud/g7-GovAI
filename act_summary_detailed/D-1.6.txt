**Detailed Summary of the *Depository Bills and Notes Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Depository Bills and Notes Act* (DBNA) is a Canadian statute that establishes a legal framework for the issuance, negotiation, settlement, and enforcement of two types of financial instruments: **depository bills** and **depository notes**. These instruments are designed to function within the securities settlement system of Canada, specifically through **clearing houses**, which act as central intermediaries for the clearing and settlement of transactions involving these instruments.

The Act replaces or modifies the traditional rules governing bills of exchange and promissory notes under the *Bills of Exchange Act*, providing a modern, efficient, and secure system tailored to the needs of financial markets and institutional participants.

### **3. What Constitutes a Depository Bill**

A **depository bill** is an **unconditional order in writing** that must meet the following criteria:

1. **Signed by the drawer** and addressed to another person.
2. **Requires payment** at a fixed or determinable future time to a specified person or to the order of a person.
3. **Unconditionally accepted** by the person to whom it is addressed (the acceptor).
4. **Clearly marked** on its face and within its text with one of the following:
   - "This is a depository bill subject to the Depository Bills and Notes Act"
   - "Lettre de dépôt assujettie à la Loi sur les lettres et billets de dépôt"
5. **Not prohibited** from negotiation, transfer, or assignment (no words restricting such rights).
6. **Made payable to a clearing house** (originally or by endorsement).
7. **Deposited** with the clearing house to which it is payable.

> Note: The absence of conditions (e.g., payment from partnership assets) does not make the instrument conditional under this Act.

---

### **4. What Constitutes a Depository Note**

A **depository note** is an **unconditional promise in writing** that must meet the following criteria:

1. **Signed by the maker**, promising to pay at a fixed or determinable future time.
2. **Payable to a specified person or to the order of a person**.
3. **Clearly marked** with one of the following:
   - "This is a depository note subject to the Depository Bills and Notes Act"
   - "Billet de dépôt assujetti à la Loi sur les lettres et billets de dépôt"
4. **Not prohibited** from negotiation, transfer, or assignment.
5. **Made payable to a clearing house** (originally or by endorsement).
6. **Deposited** with the clearing house to which it is payable.

> Again, limitations to payment from partnership or trust assets do not render the instrument conditional.

---

### **5. Exclusion of the Bills of Exchange Act**

- The *Bills of Exchange Act* **does not apply** to depository bills or notes.
- This ensures that the DBNA governs these instruments independently, allowing for a more flexible and market-driven system suited to modern settlement practices.

---

### **6. Presumption of Authenticity**

- In the **absence of contrary evidence**, a signature on a depository bill or note is **presumed to be genuine and authorized**.
- This provides legal certainty and reduces the risk of disputes over authenticity in transactions.

---

### **7. Record-Keeping and Effect of Transactions**

- A **transaction** (such as transfer, pledge, assignment) involving a depository bill or note may be **effected by appropriate entries** in the clearing house’s records.
- Such a record entry has the **same legal effect** as a physical delivery of a bearer bill of exchange under the *Bills of Exchange Act*.
- The **governing law** for the transaction is determined by the **jurisdiction agreed upon** by the clearing house and its participants.
- A participant who receives a transaction entry is **deemed to be in possession** of the depository bill or note (or an interest in it).

---

### **8. Fungible Bulk and Net Settlement**

- **Fungible bulk**: A group of identical depository bills or notes where any unit is equivalent to any other (e.g., all identical in terms, value, and terms).
- Transactions involving like bills or notes may be recorded as a **bulk** (i.e., a quantity of identical instruments).
- The clearing house may record **net entries** (e.g., net settlement) when multiple transactions occur in the same bulk.
- This promotes efficiency and reduces settlement costs in financial markets.

> Example: If 100 bills are transferred, the clearing house may record a single net entry of “100 units transferred” rather than 100 separate entries.

---

### **9. Errors in Records**

- **Errors in the clearing house’s records do not invalidate**:
  - The validity of entries
  - The obligations of the clearing house
  - The rights of participants adversely affected by the error
- This provides **operational resilience** and protects participants from being penalized due to administrative mistakes.

---

### **10. Liability of Parties**

#### **(a) Acceptor Liability (Depository Bill)**
- The **acceptor** is liable to provide funds to the clearing house so that the clearing house can **pay the participants** on the due date and in accordance with the terms of the bill.

#### **(b) Drawer Liability (Depository Bill)**
- If a depository bill is **dishonoured by the acceptor**, the **drawer** is liable to pay the amount to the clearing house.

#### **(c) Endorser Liability (Depository Bill)**
- If the bill is **dishonoured by both drawer and acceptor**, **every endorser** is **jointly and severally liable** to pay the amount to the clearing house.

#### **(d) Maker Liability (Depository Note)**
- The **maker** is liable to provide funds to the clearing house so that it can pay the **principal amount and interest** on the due date to participants.

#### **(e) Endorser Liability (Depository Note)**
- If the note is **dishonoured by the maker**, **every endorser** is **jointly and severally liable** to pay the principal and interest to the clearing house.

> These liabilities are **not contingent** on whether the instrument is a binding contractual obligation.

---

### **11. Dishonour Exceptions**

- A depository bill or note **is not dishonoured** if:
  - The payment is limited to assets of a partnership, trust, unincorporated association, or estate.
  - The party liable (acceptor, drawer, or maker) **provides funds** to the clearing house in accordance with the order or promise to pay.
  - The provision is made **in compliance with section 17** (the funding requirement).

> This provision ensures that instruments tied to specific entities (e.g., trusts) are not automatically considered dishonoured simply because their assets are restricted.

---

### **12. Discharge of Liability**

- A party who **makes final and irrevocable payment** of the amount due to the clearing house on the due date or dates is **discharged of liability** under sections 11 to 15.

---

### **13. Duty of the Clearing House to Enforce Payment**

- A clearing house **must enforce** the payment of a depository bill or note payable to it.
- It must do so **for the account and benefit of each participant** who holds an interest in the instrument.
- The **expense of enforcement** is borne by the clearing house.

> **Exception**: A clearing house is **not required to enforce** payment if:
  - Its membership
