  - Must use either:
    - A **numerical count**, or
    - A **unit of measurement** from *Schedule I of the Weights and Measures Act* (e.g., grams, liters).
  - Units must be **prescribed** by regulation.

### **2. Prohibition of False or Misleading Representations**
- **Prohibited Actions**:
  - No dealer may sell, import, or advertise a prepackaged product with **false or misleading information** about:
    - Net quantity
    - Composition, quality, origin, performance, function, or method of production
    - Implication that the product contains ingredients not present or lacks ingredients it actually contains

- **What Constitutes False or Misleading Representation**:
  - Use of expressions, figures, symbols, or depictions that **qualify or mislead** about net quantity.
  - Implication that the product contains ingredients it doesn’t have or lacks ingredients it actually has.
  - Descriptions or illustrations that **deceive consumers** about type, quality, or origin.

> Example: A label stating “Contains 100% natural ingredients” when it contains synthetic preservatives may be misleading.

- **Exception**: A declaration is **not false or misleading** if:
