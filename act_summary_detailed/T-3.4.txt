**Detailed Summary of the *Telecommunications Act* of Canada**

---

### **Overview**

The *Telecommunications Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the regulatory framework governing telecommunications services, transmission facilities, and international operations. Enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and House of Commons, the Act aims to ensure that Canada's telecommunications system is **accessible, affordable, reliable, and aligned with national policy objectives**, including economic development, technological innovation, and national sovereignty.

It applies to **telecommunications common carriers**—entities that provide telecommunications services to the public for compensation—and sets out rules regarding ownership, control, licensing, competition, service quality, and international operations. The Act also defines key terms, outlines policy goals, and establishes the authority and procedures of the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** in regulating the sector.
