**Detailed Summary of the *Tla’amin Final Agreement Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Tla’amin Final Agreement Act* is a federal statute enacted by the Parliament of Canada to ratify and give legal force to the **Tla’amin Final Agreement**, a landmark treaty and land claims agreement between the **Tla’amin Nation**, the **Government of Canada**, and the **Government of British Columbia**. This Act serves as the legal framework through which the constitutional, legal, and administrative rights and responsibilities of the Tla’amin Nation are formally recognized and implemented in accordance with the *Constitution Act, 1982*.

The Act is rooted in Canada’s commitment to **Aboriginal rights**, **reconciliation**, and **self-determination**, and it establishes a new, mutually respectful relationship between the Crown and the Tla’amin people.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Constitutional Foundations**
- **Recognition of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights**:  
  The Act begins with a preamble affirming that the *Constitution Act, 1982* recognizes and affirms the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of Canada’s Indigenous peoples. This establishes the legal basis for the Agreement as a constitutionally protected instrument.

- **Reconciliation as a National Priority**:  
  The Act emphasizes that reconciliation between Aboriginal peoples and the Crown is essential for social and economic well-being in Canada. It reflects the principle that reconciliation is best achieved through **negotiation**, not imposition.

#### **2. Parties to the Agreement**
- The Agreement involves:
  - The **Tla’amin Nation**, an Aboriginal people of Canada.
  - The **Government of Canada**.
  - The **Government of British Columbia**.

#### **3. Nature of the Agreement**
- The **Tla’amin Final Agreement** is defined as:
  - A **treaty** and a **land claims agreement** under **Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
  - It is **approved, given effect, and declared valid**, with full legal force.
- The Agreement includes:
  - A **Tax Treatment Agreement** (a separate but related instrument), which is referenced and given legal effect but is explicitly **not** a treaty or land claims agreement under the Constitution.

#### **4. Definitions and Scope**
- Key terms are defined, including:
  - *Agreement*: The full Tla’amin Final Agreement, including any amendments.
  - *Tax Treatment Agreement*: The fiscal arrangement under Paragraph 22 of Chapter 21 of the Agreement.
- The terms **Tla’amin Nation, Tla’amin Citizen, Tla’amin Government, Tla’amin Lands, Tla’amin Public Institution**, etc., are given the same meanings as in Chapter 1 of the Agreement.

#### **5. Legal Effect and Precedence**
- **Binding Nature**:
  - The Agreement is binding on all persons and bodies.
  - Any person or body referred to in the Agreement has the **rights, powers, privileges, and benefits** conferred upon them and is subject to the **duties and liabilities** imposed.
- **Precedence of the Agreement**:
  - The Agreement **prevails over any federal law** to the extent of any inconsistency.
  - This Act (the ratification legislation) **prevails over any other federal law** in case of conflict.

#### **6. Financial Obligations**
- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** must pay any monetary obligations of the Government of Canada under:
  - **Chapters 18 and 19** of the Agreement.
- This ensures that financial commitments made in the Agreement are fully funded and legally enforceable.

#### **7. Land Ownership and Title**
- As of the **effective date of the Agreement**, the **Tla’amin Nation owns the estate in fee simple** in:
  - The **Tla’amin Lands** (as defined in Chapter 3 of the Agreement).
  - The **Other Tla’amin Lands**.
- **Exception**: Lands described in **Part 1 of Appendix C-3** of the Agreement are **excluded** from this ownership, indicating specific areas may remain under Crown or other jurisdictional control.

#### **8. Application of the Indian Act**
- The **Indian Act does not apply** to the Tla’amin Nation, its citizens, government, public institutions, or lands, **except for determining whether an individual is an “Indian”**.
- This is a major step toward **decolonization and self-governance**, removing federal jurisdiction over day-to-day governance and land use.
- Exceptions:
  - The **Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act** and the **Sliammon First Nation Land Code** (pre-2016 version) **do not apply** to the Tla’amin Nation or its lands.

#### **9. Indemnity Provision (Historical Continuity)**
- Despite the removal of the Indian Act and other land management frameworks, an **indemnity obligation** is established:
  - For as long as the *Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act* is in force, **either the Government of Canada or the Tla’amin Nation must indemnify the other** for actions or omissions related to the **Former Sliammon Indian Reserves**.
  - The indemnity applies **in the same manner and under the same conditions** as if the old land management law had remained in effect.
- This provision ensures **legal continuity and fairness** in managing historical land issues.

#### **10. Tla’amin Laws and Statutory Status**
- **Tla’amin Laws** (laws made under the Agreement) are **not considered statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.
- This means they are **not subject to the same review or approval processes** as regular federal or provincial statutes, reinforcing their status as **autonomous, self-governed laws**.

#### **11. Application of Provincial Laws**
- Under **Class 24 of Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867**, Parliament has **exclusive legislative authority** over Indigenous matters.
- If a **provincial law of British Columbia does not apply by force** to the Tla’amin Nation or its lands due to this exclusive federal jurisdiction, then:
  - That provincial law **applies by virtue of the Agreement**, **subject to this Act and any other federal law**.
- This ensures that provincial laws can be applied where appropriate, but only in a way consistent with the Agreement and federal authority.

#### **12. Judicial Notice and Evidence**
- **Judicial notice must be taken** of:
  - The Agreement.
  - The Tax Treatment Agreement.
  - Tla’amin Laws.
- A **copy of the Agreement or Tax Treatment Agreement**, published by the **Queen’s Printer**, is **evidence of the agreement and its contents**.
- A copy purporting to be published by the Queen’s Printer is **presumed valid** unless proven otherwise.
- Similarly, a **copy of a Tla’amin Law** deposited in the public registry (as per Chapter 15, subparagraph 19.a) is **evidence of that law**, unless challenged.

#### **13. Judicial Proceedings and Notice Requirements**
- If a dispute arises in any **judicial or administrative proceeding** regarding:
  - The **interpretation or validity of the Agreement**,
  - The **validity or applicability of this Act**, or
  - Any **Tla’amin Law**,
- Then the party raising the issue **must serve notice** to:
  - The **Attorney General of Canada**,
  - The **Attorney General of British Columbia**, and
  - The **Tla’amin Nation**.
- The notice must include:
  - Description of the proceeding,
  - Subject matter of the issue,
  - Day on which the issue will be argued,
  - Necessary particulars to support the argument,
  - And must be served **at least 14 days before the hearing**, unless the court or tribunal allows a shorter period.
- The three parties (AG Canada, AG BC, Tla’amin Nation) may **appear and participate as full parties** with the same rights as any other party.
- This provision ensures **fairness, transparency, and meaningful consultation** in legal disputes involving Indigenous rights.

#### **14. Deemed Effect of Agreement Provisions**
- Despite Section 4(1) (which would otherwise require full enforcement), **Chapters 22 and 23 of the Agreement are deemed to have effect as of April 1, 2009**.
- This allows for **early implementation** of key provisions, such as land use, environmental protection, or governance structures, even before the full ratification date.

#### **15. Regulatory Authority**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **orders and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement or the Tax Treatment Agreement.
- This provides flexibility to address practical implementation issues.

#### **16. Coming into Force**
- Most provisions of the Act (except **Section 19**) come into force on a day **to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- **Note**: The provisions came into force on **April 5, 2016** (as per SI/2016-4).
