**Detailed Summary of the *Diplomatic Service (Special) Superannuation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Diplomatic Service (Special) Superannuation Act* establishes a specialized superannuation (pension) regime for certain high-ranking Canadian diplomatic and public officials serving abroad. It provides tailored retirement benefits, survivor protections, and contribution rules that differ from standard public service pension schemes. The Act ensures fair and equitable treatment for diplomats and comparable public officials, while also recognizing conjugal relationships and offering flexibility in service and retirement options.

This Act applies specifically to **ambassadors, ministers, high commissioners, consul-generals**, and **other persons of comparable status** serving in foreign countries under the Canadian government. It governs pension entitlements, retirement options, death benefits, survivor shares, and contribution obligations.

## **Core Provisions and Key Features**

---

### **1. Retirement Age and Continuation of Service**

- **Default Retirement Age**: Every Public Official who is not already a contributor under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* **ceases to hold office at age 65**.
- **Extension of Service**: A Public Official who reaches 65 may **continue serving year by year** if the **Governor in Council approves** each year prior to the anniversary of their birthday.
- This allows for flexibility in service, especially for those in diplomatic roles with extended duties or health-related considerations.

---

### **2. Retirement and Pension Entitlements**

A Public Official is entitled to a pension or deferred pension based on **length of service**, **age**, and **status**.

#### **Eligibility Criteria**:
- Must have served **at least 5 years** as a Public Official.
- Must **not have been a contributor** under the *Civil Service Superannuation Act* or the *Public Service Superannuation Act* immediately before appointment.

#### **Types of Benefits**:
| Scenario | Benefit |
|--------|--------|
| **Age 65 or disabled** | Entitled to a **pension** calculated as follows: |
| - 5–10 years service | 15/50 of average salary |
| - 10–20 years service | 25/50 of average salary + 1/50 × (years over 10) |
| - 20+ years service | 35/50 of average salary |
| **Under age 65** | Can choose: |
| - A **deferred pension** (paid at age 65) |
| - A **return of total contributions + interest** (up to a limit) |

> **Exception**: If the Public Official is **45+ years old with ≥10 years of service**, they are **not entitled to a return of contributions** for any service after **September 30, 1967**.

### **3. Deductions from Pensions (Canada Pension Plan)**

If a Public Official:
- Retires at or after age 65, **or**
- Becomes disabled and receives a CPP disability pension,

Then **a deduction is made** from their pension under this Act:

- **For years 1966–1975**: Deduct **1/50 of AMPE per year** of contribution.
- **For years after 1975**: Deduct **1/100 of AMPE per year** of contribution.

> This ensures that CPP contributions are factored into the total pension package, preventing double-counting.

---

### **4. Pension Adjustment for CPP Underpayment**

If the pension payable under this Act (after CPP deductions) is **less than what it would have been without deductions**, the Public Official can **apply for an increase**.

- The increase equals the **difference** in pension amounts.
- Effective from the date determined by **regulations**.
- This protects individuals from being disadvantaged due to CPP deductions.

> **Cap on Total Pension**: The total pension (under this Act + any prior pension) **cannot exceed** what the individual would have received if their prior service and salary had been treated as additional years and salary in a Public Office.

---

### **5. Return of Contributions (No Pension Eligible)**

If a Public Official:
- Was not previously a contributor,
- And is **not entitled to a pension** under Section 5,

Then they are entitled to a **return of total contributions + interest** upon retirement or resignation.

> This is a key benefit for those who did not qualify for a pension but still contributed to the system.

---

### **6. Death Benefits for Survivors**

Upon the death of a Public Official (who is a contributor), the **survivor** receives:

- The **total contributions** made under this Act, **plus interest** (calculated as per Section 5(10)).

#### **Apportionment of Death Benefit (if two survivors)**:
- **Survivor (a)**: Married to the official or cohabited conjugal partner — entitled to a share based on:
  - Total years cohabiting (married + conjugal)  
  - Divided by total years cohabited with both survivors.

- **Survivor (b)**: Common-law partner only — entitled to a share based on:
  - Years cohabited in conjugal relationship  
  - Divided by total years cohabited with both survivors.

> **Note**: A partial year is counted as a full year if **6 months or more**; otherwise, ignored.

---

### **7. Interest on Contributions**

The **President of the Treasury Board** is responsible for:
- Determining total contributions made **before 1974** and **each year after 1973**.
- Calculating **interest at 4% per annum compounded annually**:
  - On pre-1974 contributions: from **Dec 31, 1973** to **one year before retirement**.
  - On annual contributions: from **Dec 31 of each year** to **one year before retirement**.

> This ensures that contributions are not lost due to time and provides financial value to long-serving officials.

---

### **8. Contribution Obligations**

- Every Public Official who is **not a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act** and is **not in a special pension plan** must contribute **6% of their salary**, **after subtracting the amount they would contribute under the CPP**.
- **Contribution cap**: No contributions after **35 years of service**, **minus** the number of years on which prior pensions are based.

> This prevents over-contribution and ensures fairness for long-serving officials.

---

### **9. Prior Service Recognition**

A person who:
- Was employed in federal public administration **before** appointment to a Public Office, or
- Was a **judge** in a superior, district, or county court,

May **count prior service as service in a Public Office** if they:
- Elect to contribute under this Act within **one year** of appointment.
- Choose to count **all or part** of that prior service (but only the **most recent part** can be elected).

#### **Contribution Calculation**:
- The amount is equal to what the official would have paid **if they had contributed during that period** at the **salary rate at the time of becoming a contributor**, plus **simple interest at 4% per year** until the election is made.

> **Note**: No prior service can be counted if the person is already entitled to a pension under another Act of Parliament.

---

### **10. Payment of Contributions**

- Contributions may be paid:
  - In **one lump sum**, or
  - In **installments** (life or fixed term, whichever is shorter).
- Installments are computed based on **mortality rates and interest** as prescribed by **regulations**.
- If a Public Official **ceases service before paying all installments**, the unpaid amounts may be **reserved** from future payments (e.g., pensions or retirement benefits) until paid or death.

> **Irrevocable Election**: Once a person makes an election to contribute for prior service, it is **final and cannot be reversed**.

---

### **11. Spousal and Common-Law Partner Benefits**

When a Public Official retires, their **spouse or common-law partner** is entitled to a **half pension** (1/2 of the official’s pension).
