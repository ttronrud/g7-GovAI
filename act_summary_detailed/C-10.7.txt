### 4. **Residency Determination (Key Principle)**

Determining residency is critical for determining where income is taxed.

#### For Individuals:
1. **Permanent home**:
   - Resident of the country where they have a permanent home available to them.
2. **Centre of vital interests**:
   - If home is in both or neither country → resident of the country with **closer personal and economic ties**.
3. **Habitual abode**:
   - If centre of vital interests cannot be determined → resident of the country with **habitual abode**.
4. **Citizenship**:
   - If no habitual abode → resident of the country of **citizenship**.
5. **Mutual agreement**:
   - If citizenship is shared or neither → competent authorities resolve via **mutual agreement**.

> ✅ Exception: An individual who is employed by a government entity in one country (e.g., working in the U.S. for a Canadian government body) and is subject to similar income tax obligations in that country **shall be deemed a resident** of the country where employed.

> 📌 Spouse and dependent children of such individuals are also deemed residents of that country.

#### For Companies:
- If created under the laws of a Contracting State → deemed a **resident of that State**.

#### For Estates, Trusts, or Other Entities:
- If resident of both countries → **competent authorities must resolve** via mutual agreement.

> 🔍 **Note**: Residency determines which country has taxing rights over income.

### 5. **Permanent Establishment (PE) – Key Concept**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which a resident conducts business in another country.

#### Included:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry
- Building site or construction project **if lasting more than 12 months**
- Drilling rig or ship used for exploration/exploitation of natural resources **for more than 3 months in any 12-month period**

#### Excluded:
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods
- Maintenance of stock for storage, display, or delivery
- Maintenance of stock for processing by another party
- Purchase of goods or collection of information
- Advertising, research, or auxiliary activities (preparatory or auxiliary)

> 🚫 **Important**: A resident’s business through a **broker, agent, or commission agent** (acting independently) **does not** constitute a PE.

> ✅ **Control relationships do not create a PE**:
- If a Canadian company controls a U.S. company, or vice versa, **neither is a PE of the other**.

> 💡 The PE concept is used to determine where business profits are taxed.

### 6. **Taxation of Business Profits**

#### General Rule:
- A resident’s business profits are taxable **only in their home country**.
- **Exception**: If the resident operates through a PE in the other country → profits attributable to that PE may be taxed in the foreign country.

#### How Profits Are Attributed:
- The profits are attributed to the PE using the **arm’s length method**:
  > “The profits which the PE would make if it were a separate entity, engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, dealing independently with the resident and other related parties.”

#### Deductions:
- All **expenses incurred** for the PE (including executive and administrative costs) are allowed as deductions.
- **No deduction** required for expenses that are not generally allowed under domestic tax law.

#### Exclusions:
- Profits from **mere purchase of goods**, **provision of managerial/administrative services**, or **use of facilities** are **not attributable** to a PE.

> 📅 Profits are determined **year by year**, unless there is good reason to vary.

> 🚫 Profits that are already addressed in other Articles (e.g., royalties, dividends) are **not affected** by this rule.

> ✅ Business profits attributed to a PE **include only those derived from the PE’s assets or activities**.

  - **Rental of ships, aircraft, or containers** used in international traffic
