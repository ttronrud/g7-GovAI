### **Detailed Summary of the Impact Assessment Act (Canada)**

The **Impact Assessment Act** (IAA) is a foundational piece of federal legislation enacted by Parliament to establish a comprehensive, transparent, and inclusive process for evaluating the environmental, social, and cultural effects of major projects and physical activities within Canada’s federal jurisdiction. The Act reflects Canada’s commitment to environmental responsibility, Indigenous rights, scientific integrity, and sustainable development.

---

## **I. Background and Legislative Intent**

The Act is grounded in several key principles and commitments:

1. **Environmental Protection**:  
   Parliament is committed to preventing or mitigating *significant adverse effects* within federal jurisdiction—defined as non-negligible changes to the environment, health, social, or economic conditions—before major projects proceed.

2. **Respect for Indigenous Rights**:  
   The Government of Canada reaffirms its commitment to:
   - The **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**,
   - The rights of Indigenous peoples recognized and affirmed under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.

3. **Cooperative and Inclusive Decision-Making**:  
   The Act promotes:
   - **Coordinated action** among federal, provincial, and Indigenous jurisdictions,
   - **Meaningful public participation**,
   - **Integration of Indigenous Knowledge (IK)** with scientific data,
   - **Transparency, efficiency, and timeliness** in assessments,
   - A **positive investment climate** for sustainable development.

4. **Climate Change and Sustainability**:  
   The process supports Canada’s environmental obligations and climate commitments by promoting **sustainability**—defined as protecting the environment, ensuring social and economic well-being, and preserving health for present and future generations.

5. **Precautionary Principle and Innovation**:  
   The Act encourages the use of **innovative technologies and approaches** to prevent or mitigate adverse effects and applies the **precautionary principle** where risks are uncertain.

6. **Regional and Strategic Assessments**:  
   Recognizing that impacts are often cumulative and regional, the Act emphasizes:
   - **Regional assessments** (to understand effects of existing or future physical activities),
   - **Strategic assessments** (to evaluate federal policies, plans, or programs that may affect the environment).

## **III. Core Provisions and Obligations**

### **1. Scope and Application**
- The Act applies to:
  - Designated projects carried out on **federal lands** or **outside Canada** funded or supported by a federal authority.
  - Projects that may cause **significant adverse effects within federal jurisdiction** or **direct/incidental adverse effects**.
- **Exemption**: Physical activities carried out **wholly within lands described in Schedule 2** are excluded (e.g., certain rural or remote areas).

### **2. Purpose of the Act**
To **prevent or mitigate significant adverse effects** by:
- Anticipating, identifying, and assessing potential environmental, health, social, and cultural impacts,
- Informing decisions under other Acts of Parliament,
- Ensuring that decisions are based on sound, science-based, and inclusive analysis.

### **3. Principles of Administration**
Federal authorities, the Minister, and the **Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (IAA)** must:
- Foster **sustainability**,
- Respect **Section 35 Indigenous rights**,
- Consider **Indigenous Knowledge (IK)**,
- Evaluate **cumulative effects** of multiple activities,
- Apply the **precautionary principle**,
- Promote **cooperation** among jurisdictions and with Indigenous peoples.

### **4. Fairness, Predictability, and Scientific Integrity**
- Processes must be:
  - **Fair, predictable, and efficient**,
  - Based on principles of **scientific integrity, honesty, objectivity, thoroughness, and accuracy**.

### **5. Prohibition on Project Activities**
- A **proponent** (entity or authority proposing or carrying out a project) **must not carry out any activity** that may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction **unless**:
  - The Agency determines **no impact assessment is required** and posts this decision on the Internet site,
  - The proponent complies with conditions in a **decision statement** issued under Section 65 (and it is not expired or revoked), or
  - The Agency **permits** the activity with conditions to provide information for a future assessment.

> This provision acts as a **safeguard** to prevent environmental harm before formal assessment.

### **6. Authority to Designate Physical Activities**
- The **Minister of the Environment** may designate a physical activity (not already prescribed) if:
  - It may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or direct/incidental adverse effects.
- In deciding, the Minister must consider:
  - Public concerns,
  - Impacts on Indigenous peoples’ rights (including Indigenous women),
  - Relevant prior assessments (e.g., under Sections 92, 93, 95),
  - Whether an alternative to impact assessment exists,
  - Any other relevant factor.

### **7. Information Requirements**
- The **Agency may require** any person or entity to provide information about a physical activity that could be designated.
- The **Minister must respond to such requests within 90 days**, with **reasons**, and post the response on the **Internet site**.
- The Agency may **suspend the 90-day deadline** if a prescribed activity (e.g., environmental study) is underway and must post the reason for suspension.

### **8. Federal Authority Powers and Restrictions**
A federal authority **may not**:
- Exercise a power or perform a duty (under any Act) that would permit a designated project to proceed **unless**:
  - The Agency has determined **no assessment is required** and posted it,
  - The decision statement shows that adverse effects are **not likely to be significant**, or
  - The Minister or Governor in Council has determined the effects are **justified in the public interest** (under para 60(1)(b) or 62(b)),
  - Or the action is for the purpose of **authorizing a specific activity** under para 7(3)(c).

> This ensures that no federal action (e.g., granting permits, funding) occurs without proper assessment or justification.
