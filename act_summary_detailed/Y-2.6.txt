**Detailed Summary of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act* (the "Act") is a foundational piece of federal legislation enacted by Parliament in 1994 to implement and formalize **self-government agreements** between the Government of Canada, the Government of the Yukon Territory, and First Nations in Yukon. It provides the legal framework through which First Nations gain **greater autonomy** in governance, law-making, and administration of their affairs—particularly on their **settlement lands**—while operating within the broader constitutional and legal structure of Canada.

The Act is rooted in the **Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA)** signed on May 29, 1993, which established a model for land claims settlement and self-government across Yukon’s First Nations. The Act operationalizes the self-government agreements concluded under that framework, ensuring they are legally recognized, enforceable, and integrated into Canadian law.

## **Key Background Provisions (WHEREAS Clauses)**

1. **Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA):**  
   Signed in 1993 by Her Majesty in right of Canada, the Yukon Government, and the Council for Yukon Indians, the UFA sets out **common principles** for land claims settlement and self-government. It is not a standalone agreement but serves as a **template** for final agreements with individual First Nations.

2. **Final Agreements with Specific First Nations:**  
   The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, the Teslin Tlingit Council, and the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation have each entered into **final land claims agreements** that:
   - Incorporate the UFA;
   - Include unique provisions specific to each First Nation;
   - Provide for negotiations on **self-government agreements**.

3. **Self-Government Agreements:**  
   These are formal agreements between each First Nation and the Crown (Her Majesty) and the Yukon Government, establishing the **rights, powers, and responsibilities** of the First Nation in governance.

4. **Future Agreements:**  
   Other First Nations in Yukon may also enter into self-government agreements in the future.

5. **Federal Legislative Role:**  
   The Government of Canada has committed to recommending legislation to **bring these self-government agreements into effect**—which the Act fulfills.
