**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act***

---

### **1. Introduction and Citation**
The *Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act* (the "Act") is a legislative instrument enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. It serves as the domestic enabling legislation to implement the **Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Korea**, signed on September 22, 2014, in Ottawa (commonly referred to as the "Agreement").

This Act provides the legal framework, definitions, responsibilities, and procedural mechanisms necessary for Canada to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement, ensuring that Canada’s domestic laws and institutions operate in alignment with the Agreement’s objectives.

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Agreement**: Refers specifically to the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Korea, signed in 2014. This is the foundational treaty that governs trade, investment, labour, environment, and other economic relations between the two countries.

- **Commission**: Refers to the **Joint Commission** established under **Article 20.1** of the Agreement. This body is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Agreement, including resolving disputes, monitoring compliance, and facilitating cooperation between Canada and South Korea.

- **Federal law**: Encompasses any Act of Parliament, regulation, order, or other instrument enacted or issued in the exercise of powers granted by Parliament. This broad definition ensures that all relevant domestic legislation is considered in the context of implementing the Agreement.

- **Minister**: Specifically refers to the **Minister for International Trade**, who acts as Canada’s principal representative in the Joint Commission and other bodies established under the Agreement.

### **3. Interpretive Principles**

The Act includes several important interpretive clauses to ensure consistency and clarity in implementation:

- **Consistency with the Agreement**: This Act and any federal law implementing provisions of the Agreement must be interpreted in a manner that is **consistent with the Agreement**. This principle ensures legal coherence and prevents domestic legislation from contradicting the terms of the treaty.

- **Exclusion of Natural Resources**: Nothing in the Act applies to **natural surface or ground water** in any state (liquid, gaseous, or solid). This explicitly excludes environmental or resource rights related to water from being governed by this Act.

- **Parliamentary Authority**: The Act does **not limit Parliament’s power** to pass legislation to implement the Agreement or fulfill Canada’s obligations under it. This reinforces the principle that Parliament retains full legislative authority over trade and economic policy.

### **4. Purpose of the Act**

The primary purpose of the Act is to **implement the Agreement** and achieve the following key objectives:

1. **Establish a Free Trade Area**: Create a comprehensive, market-oriented trade relationship between Canada and South Korea by reducing tariffs and trade barriers.

2. **Promote Reciprocal Trade**: Expand bilateral trade in goods and services to foster mutual economic growth and development.

3. **Ensure Fair Competition**: Promote fair and transparent trade practices that prevent unfair advantages or anti-competitive behavior.

4. **Enhance Investment Opportunities**: Encourage and facilitate cross-border investment in both Canada and South Korea.

5. **Eliminate Trade Barriers**: Remove obstacles to trade in goods and services, contributing to broader regional and global trade expansion.

6. **Strengthen Environmental Cooperation**: Enhance and enforce environmental laws and regulations, and promote joint efforts on environmental protection and sustainability.

7. **Protect and Strengthen Workers’ Rights**: Uphold and advance fundamental labour rights, including fair wages, safe working conditions, and freedom of association. It also supports cooperation on labour standards and practices.

8. **Promote Sustainable Development**: Align economic growth with environmental protection and social well-being, ensuring long-term prosperity.

### **5. Limitations on Legal Actions (Enforcement Provisions)**

To prevent litigation over certain provisions, the Act includes a **non-action clause**:

- **Sections 9 to 15 and Orders Thereunder**: No individual or entity may bring a legal action or initiate proceedings to enforce or determine rights or obligations arising solely under these sections or orders made under them — **unless authorized by the Attorney General of Canada**.

- **The Agreement Itself**: Similarly, **no legal action may be taken** without the Attorney General’s consent to enforce or determine any rights or obligations arising solely under the Agreement itself.

> This provision is designed to prevent disputes from being litigated in courts, thereby preserving the stability and diplomatic nature of the Agreement and ensuring that disputes are resolved through formal, structured mechanisms (such as the Joint Commission or dispute resolution panels).

---

### **6. Approval of the Agreement**

The Act formally **approves the Free Trade Agreement** between Canada and South Korea. This is a critical step in the legal process, confirming that the Agreement is now enforceable under Canadian law.

### **7. Role of the Minister for International Trade**

The Minister is designated as the **principal representative of Canada** on the Joint Commission and has key responsibilities, including:

- **Appointing representatives** to committees, subcommittees, working groups, or other bodies established under **paragraph 5 of Article 20.1** of the Agreement.

- **Appointing panellists** in accordance with **paragraph 3 of Article 21.7** of the Agreement.

- **Proposing candidates** to serve as chairs of review panels under Article 21.7.

These appointments ensure Canada has a strong, active presence in the governance and oversight of the Agreement’s implementation.

  - Appoints Canadian representatives to the **Environmental Affairs Council** (Article 17.11).

### **9. Administrative and Financial Responsibilities**

- The Government of Canada is responsible for:
  - Paying the **remuneration and expenses** of members of panels, committees, subcommittees, working groups, and independent experts.
  - Covering **general operating expenses** of these bodies.

- The Government designates a specific **agency, division, or branch** within the federal government to:

This ensures efficient, coordinated management of the Agreement’s implementation and dispute resolution processes.

### **10. Suspension Powers (Governor in Council)**

The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, under **Article 21.11 of the Agreement**, issue orders to suspend benefits or modify the application of Canadian laws in specific circumstances involving South Korea or its goods. The powers include:

- Suspending rights or privileges granted to South Korea or its goods under the Agreement or federal law.
- Modifying or suspending the application of any federal law to South Korea or its goods.
- Extending the application of federal laws to South Korea or its goods.
- Taking any other measure deemed necessary.

> These powers are **limited in scope** and only apply when necessary to protect national interests or address breaches of the Agreement.

- **Duration**: Any such order remains in effect for the period specified in the order, unless revoked.

> **Note**: Several references to this provision were marked as **repealed in 2017 (c. 6, s. 131)**, suggesting that the suspension powers may have been modified or removed. However, the current text appears to retain the provision, possibly reflecting a later amendment. This indicates potential legislative revision or correction.

### **11. Commencement and Implementation**

- The Act comes into force on **January 1, 2015**, **unless** the Governor in Council issues an order setting a later date.

> This ensures a clear timeline for implementation, with a fallback mechanism for delay if needed.

- **Sections 59 and 60** are explicitly excluded from the commencement date, suggesting they may contain provisions that are intended to be activated at a later stage or under different conditions.

---

### **12. Amendments and Updates**

The Act includes numerous **amendments** and **revisions** (indicated by "[Amendment]" or "[Amendments]") throughout its text. These reflect ongoing legislative refinement, including updates to administrative procedures, panel appointments, or dispute resolution mechanisms. Some amendments appear to have been made after 2017, indicating that the Act has evolved over time to meet new policy or operational needs.
