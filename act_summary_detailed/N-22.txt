**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (CNA) is a federal statute that regulates human activities—particularly construction, alteration, and maintenance—within **navigable waters** in Canada. Its primary objective is to **protect and preserve the safety, functionality, and usability of waterways** for both commercial and recreational navigation, while also **respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples of Canada** under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*.

The Act establishes a comprehensive framework for **authorizing works** (structures, devices, or activities) in or across navigable waters, ensuring that such activities do not interfere with navigation and that public safety and Indigenous rights are upheld.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Navigable Water** | A body of water (natural or man-made) that is used or has a reasonable likelihood of being used by vessels for commercial, recreational, or Indigenous transportation purposes. Public access (by land or water), or ownership by the Crown or a province, is required. <br> *Excludes artificial irrigation channels and drainage ditches.* |
| **Work** | Any structure, device, or thing made by humans (temporary or permanent), including repair/maintenance equipment. Also includes dumping fill or excavating/dredging materials from the bed of a navigable water. |
| **Major Work** | Any work designated under paragraph 28(2)(b) of the Act. Requires formal application and ministerial approval. |
| **Minor Work** | Any work designated under paragraph 28(2)(a). May be carried out with fewer restrictions, provided compliance with the Act is maintained. |
| **Indigenous Knowledge** | The traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples of Canada, recognized and affirmed under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*. Must be considered in decision-making. |
| **Indigenous Peoples of Canada** | Defined as "aboriginal peoples of Canada" under subsection 35(2) of the *Constitution Act, 1982*. Includes First Nations, Métis, and Inuit. |
| **Owner** | Includes actual or reputed owners, agents, possessors, or those responsible for construction, operation, maintenance, or removal of a work. Also includes those proposing to undertake such activities. |
| **Person in Charge (of Obstruction)** | Owner of an obstruction, registered owner, managing owner, master, or subsequent purchaser of a vessel that is obstructing navigation. |
| **Vessel** | Any ship, boat, or floating craft (with or without propulsion), including all components like machinery, cargo, and equipment. |
| **Obstruction** | Any object (natural or man-made) that impedes navigation. Natural obstructions are excluded *unless caused by a person*. |

> **Note:** Several definitions have been repealed over time (e.g., *designated work*, *ferry cable*, *minor water*), reflecting legislative modernization and simplification.

## **Core Principles and Prohibitions**

### 1. **General Prohibition on Works**
> Except as permitted under this Act, it is **prohibited** to construct, place, alter, rebuild, remove, or decommission any work in, on, over, under, through, or across any **navigable water**.

This establishes a baseline of protection for navigable waters from unauthorized human intervention.

---

## **Permitted Activities and Exceptions**

### ✅ **Minor Works**
- Owners of minor works may carry out construction, alteration, or removal **without prior ministerial approval**, provided they:
  - Comply with all requirements of the Act;
  - Repair, maintain, operate, and use the work in accordance with the Act.

> *Minor works are defined as those designated under paragraph 28(2)(a).*

---

### ✅ **Major Works & Works Listed in Schedule**
- **Major works** and **non-minor works listed in the Schedule** require **formal application and ministerial approval** before any construction or alteration begins.

#### Requirements for Application:
- The owner must:
  - Deposit specific information with the Minister in a designated place;
  - Publish a public notice in a manner specified by the Minister;
  - Invite interested parties to submit written comments within **30 days** (or a shorter period if prescribed).

> *If the Minister determines that the proposed work would not interfere with navigation, no approval is required.*

> *If the work may interfere with navigation, the Minister must issue an approval before construction can proceed.*

---

## **Minister’s Approval Process**

### Criteria for Approving a Work
When deciding whether to grant approval, the Minister must consider:

1. **Characteristics of the navigable water** (e.g., depth, width, flow, seasonality)
2. **Safety of navigation**
3. **Current and anticipated vessel traffic**
4. **Impact of the work** on navigation (including during construction, operation, or decommissioning)
5. **Cumulative impacts** with other existing works (if information is available)
6. **Indigenous knowledge** provided to the Minister
7. **Comments from interested persons**
8. **Owner’s compliance history**
9. **Any other relevant factors**

> The Minister may request **additional information** from the owner to support a decision.

---

### Conditions Attached to Approval
The Minister may impose **terms and conditions**, including:
- Maintaining water levels or flows necessary for navigation;
- Providing financial security (e.g., letter of credit, bond, insurance) to ensure compliance;
- Designating an area adjacent to the work as part of the approved project for safety reasons.

> An approval **replaces any prior approval** for the same work.

---

### Amendments, Suspension, and Cancellation

| Action | Conditions |
|-------|-----------|
| **Amendments** | Can be made if: <br> - The work now interferes more with navigation than when approved; <br> - It poses a serious and imminent danger; <br> - The amendment is in the public interest; <br> - The owner consents. |
| **Suspension or Cancellation** | If the Minister finds that: <br> - The owner has failed to comply; <br> - Approval was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation; <br> - A fine or penalty is unpaid; <br> - The situation is in the public interest (e.g., due to poor compliance history). |

> The owner is given **30 days’ notice** of any amendment or suspension/cancellation **unless** it's made without consent or due to fraud.

## **Procedures for Works Not Listed in the Schedule**

For works **not listed in the Schedule** (but not major or minor):

- If the work **would not interfere with navigation**, the owner may proceed **without approval**, provided:
  - They deposit required information with the Minister;
  - They publish a public notice inviting comments.

- If the work **may interfere with navigation**, the owner must:
  - Make a formal application to the Minister; OR
  - Deposit information and publish a notice (as above).

> An application under this provision is treated as if it were made under subsection 5(1), and if approved, the work is deemed to be in a **listed navigable water**.

> A **comment period** of 30 days (or less) is required. If comments raise navigation concerns:
- The owner and commenter must attempt to resolve the issue within **45 days**.
- If a **material change** is made to the proposal, new information and a new notice must be submitted.
- If concerns remain unresolved, the commenter may request the Minister to **require an approval application**.

> The Minister may decide whether an approval is required based on the nature and severity of the concerns.

## **Critical Prohibitions and Safeguards**

### ❌ **Prohibition on Works That Extinguish Navigation**
> No work may be constructed, placed, altered, rebuilt, removed, or decommissioned that **extinguishes navigation** for any class of vessels that currently or may reasonably navigate the waterway.

> This is a strict protection against activities that permanently eliminate access to waterways.

### ⚠️ **Material Changes to a Work**
> If an owner makes a **material change** to the work or its method of construction/removal, they must:
- Either submit a new application under paragraph 10(1)(a); OR
- Deposit updated information and publish a new public notice.

> This ensures ongoing compliance and public transparency.

## **Emergency Powers**

Even without a prior application or notice, the Minister may **authorize work** (for works other than minor ones) if they believe it must be carried out **immediately** to respond to:

1. A **matter of national security**;
2. A **national emergency** under the *Emergencies Act*;
3. An **emergency** that:
   - Poses a serious and imminent danger to navigation;
   - Requires immediate action to prevent harm.

> Such authorization is subject to **terms and conditions** deemed appropriate by the Minister.

---

## **Notification Requirements**

- Any owner must **immediately notify the Minister** if the work or its activity:
  - Causes or is likely to cause a **serious and imminent danger** to navigation.

- The owner must then take **all reasonable measures** (consistent with public safety and navigation safety) to:
  - Prevent or mitigate the danger;
  - Counteract adverse effects.
