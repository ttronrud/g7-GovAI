The provided text is a **summary of a section of an Act (now repealed)** that originally granted jurisdiction to the **Exchequer Court** (a federal court in Canada) over **interprovincial and federally regulated railways**. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the provisions, including their legal context, scope, key powers, and implications — even though the section has since been **repealed** by the *Statutes of Canada, 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.), section 64*.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Repealed Act Section**

### 🔹 **1. Jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court Over Railways**
The Exchequer Court had exclusive jurisdiction over:
- Any **railway or section of a railway** that is **not wholly within one province**, or
- Any railway that is **subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada** (i.e., federally regulated railways).

This jurisdiction allowed the court to:
- Order and decree the **sale** of such railways, including:
  - The railway itself
  - All **rolling stock**
  - **Equipment and other accessories** (e.g., signaling systems, tracks, stations)

This power applied in specific circumstances, including:

---

### 🔹 **2. Grounds for Court Intervention (Initiation of Sale or Foreclosure)**

The court could intervene at the instance of:

#### ✅ (a) The Minister of Transport
- The federal government could initiate proceedings if a railway was in distress.

#### ✅ (b) A Creditor of a Railway Company
- If the company:
  - Has become **insolvent**, or
  - Has **failed to operate efficiently for more than 30 days**, or
  - Has **become unable to continue operating** any part of the railway.

#### ✅ (c) A Creditor with a First Lien or Charge
- A creditor holding a **first lien** (priority claim) on the railway could request court action.

#### ✅ (d) A Holder of a First Mortgage
- A mortgagee (lender with a first mortgage) could initiate proceedings.

#### ✅ (e) Foreclosure by a Mortgagee
- If a mortgagee (lender) had a default, the court could order:
  - **Foreclosure** of the railway interest
  - Sale of the railway, rolling stock, equipment, and accessories
  - **Equity of redemption** (the right of the borrower to reclaim the property after foreclosure)

> ⚖️ **Modelled on English Law**: The power to foreclose on railways was based on the authority of the **High Court of Justice in England** over **mortgaged lands** in England. This reflects Canada’s historical legal borrowing from English common law.

---

### 🔹 **3. Powers of the Court in Proceedings**

The court had broad powers to ensure effective enforcement of its orders, including:

- **Appointment of a Receiver** (before or after default)
- **Interim preservation** of the railway property
- **Delivery of possession** to the receiver
- Conducting **inquiries** into the condition and operations of the railway
- **Taking accounts** (financial records)
- **Settling and determining claims** of creditors and priorities
- **Taxing and paying costs**
- Taking all other actions necessary to make the order effective

> This mirrors the powers of the **High Court of Justice in England** in mortgage actions.

---

### 🔹 **4. Powers and Duties of the Receiver**

Upon appointment, the receiver was given extensive responsibilities:

#### 🚆 **Possession and Operation**
- Took possession of:
  - The railway or section
  - All rolling stock, equipment, and accessories
- Was authorized to **carry on the working and operating** of the railway or any part of it.

#### 🛠️ **Maintenance and Renewal**
- Must **keep and maintain** the road, rolling stock, and equipment in good condition
- Must **renew** or repair any part of the railway as needed
- Perform all acts necessary for:
  - Preservation
  - Working
  - Maintenance
  - Administration
  - Operation

#### 🏛️ **Legal Representation**
- Could **institute or defend legal actions** on behalf of the company (in the name of the company)

#### 🏗️ **Completion of Construction or Equipment**
- If directed by the court, the receiver could:
  - Complete construction
  - Equip the railway
  - Carry out any necessary development

> This was a critical provision to ensure continuity of service during transitions.

---

### 🔹 **5. Remuneration of the Receiver**

- The **remuneration** (salary) of the receiver was **set by the court**.
- The remuneration, **plus all lawful expenses** incurred (e.g., operation, maintenance, legal fees), became:
  - A **debt of the company**
  - A **first charge** (priority claim) on:
    - The railway
    - Rolling stock
    - Equipment
    - Accessories
    - Earnings

> This meant the receiver’s compensation was protected as a priority claim — creditors could not claim it after other debts.

---

### 🔹 **6. Definition of Insolvency for Railway Companies (Section 26)**

A railway company was deemed **insolvent** under the Act if **any one** of the following occurred:

| Condition | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unable to pay debts as they become due** | Basic insolvency test |
| **Calls a meeting of creditors to compound** | Indicates financial distress |
| **Provides a statement showing inability to meet liabilities** | Formal admission of insolvency |
| **Assigns, removes, or disposes of property with intent to defraud or delay creditors** | Fraudulent transfer |
| **Procures seizure or levy of property via process** | Intentional avoidance of creditors |
| **Makes a general conveyance or assignment of property** | Without creditor consent or satisfaction of claims |
| **Sells or conveys major assets without creditor consent** | Especially if not for creditor benefit |
| **Permits execution to remain unsatisfied** | If seizure occurs and remains unpaid for **4 days** (after sheriff's notice) or **15 days** after seizure |

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Taking possession of a railway by **trustees under a mortgage deed** (for bondholders) is **not** considered a general conveyance or sale — it does not trigger insolvency under this section.

---

### 🔹 **7. Exception: Provincial Jurisdiction for Fully Provincial Railways**

- **Nothing in this Act affects** the existing jurisdiction of **provincial courts** over:
  - Railways that are **wholly within a single province**
- Provincial superior courts **retain concurrent jurisdiction** with the Federal Court in matters involving such railways.

> This ensured that local courts could still handle local railway issues, while federal courts handled cross-provincial or federally regulated ones.

---

## 🚨 Important Note: The Section is Repealed

> ✅ **Repealed by R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.), s. 64**

This means:
- The law **no longer applies** in current Canadian law.
- The Exchequer Court (now largely succeeded by the **Federal Court of Canada**) no longer has this specific jurisdiction over railways.
- The **provisions on receivership, insolvency, and foreclosure** are no longer active in Canadian law.

> This repeal occurred as part of broader reforms to Canada’s transportation and insolvency laws, particularly in the context of:
> - The **1966 Transportation Act** and subsequent modernization
> - The **passage of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act (1985)**, which replaced older insolvency rules
> - The **privatization and deregulation** of railways (e.g., CN, CP Rail)

## 📚 Historical and Legal Context

- The Act reflects **early 20th-century Canadian federalism**, where railways were seen as **federally significant infrastructure**.
- The **English model** of mortgage foreclosure and receiver appointment was adopted due to legal tradition.
- The **receiver system** was designed to preserve operations during financial distress — a pragmatic approach to avoid total collapse of vital transportation networks.
- The **insolvency definition** was strict and included both financial and fraudulent acts — aimed at preventing asset stripping.
