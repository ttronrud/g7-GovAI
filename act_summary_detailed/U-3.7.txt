The provided text appears to be a section of a Canadian statute, specifically a legislative enactment, but it contains a significant omission in content: **the actual provisions or sections of the act are entirely missing**, and instead, the text consists of repeated lines stating:

> [Repealed, 2017, c. 20, s. 456]

This notation indicates that the particular provision or section of the law in question was **repealed (officially cancelled or abolished)** by **Bill C-20, 2017**, which is known as the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017*.

---

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Text:**
The passage does not contain any substantive law (such as definitions, rights, obligations, or regulations), nor does it outline any new legislation. Instead, it is a **formal placeholder or header** indicating that a prior section of a statute has been **repealed**.

**2. Meaning of "Repealed":**
- "Repealed" means that the specific provision or section of law previously in force has been formally removed and is no longer valid.
- In this case, the section (or subsection) referenced as **section 456** of **Bill C-20, 2017** (the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017*) repealed the original provision.

**3. Legal Context – Bill C-20, 2017:**
- Bill C-20, 2017 was a major budget-related act introduced by the Government of Canada.
- It included numerous amendments to existing laws, including tax changes, regulatory updates, and the repeal of outdated or redundant provisions.
- Section 456 of this bill specifically targeted the removal of certain provisions from prior legislation, likely related to administrative or regulatory frameworks (the exact subject matter would depend on the original law being repealed).

**4. Significance of the Repeal:**
- The repeal of such a section suggests that the original law was either:
  - Outdated,
  - Inconsistent with current policy,
  - Overlapping with newer legislation,
  - Or no longer necessary.
- Repealing a section helps streamline legislation and avoid legal ambiguity.

**5. Absence of Original Provisions:**
- The original content of the provision that was repealed is not included in the provided text.
- Without access to the original statute (e.g., the prior act that contained the section being repealed), it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the law that was removed.

### Conclusion:

The provided text is **not a detailed summary of an active act**, but rather a **formal notice of repeal**. It indicates that a specific section (section 456) of a prior law was **officially cancelled and removed** by the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017* (Bill C-20). The actual legal content, purpose, and scope of the repealed provision are not included in this excerpt.

To fully understand the implications, one would need to consult:
- The original statute that contained the repealed section,
- The full text of Bill C-20, 2017, particularly section 456,
- Or a legal database such as CanLII (Canadian Legal Information Institute).

In short:  
👉 **This is not a new or active act — it is a notice that a prior law was repealed in 2017.**  
👉 **No substantive content, provisions, or policy details are present in the provided text.**  
👉 **The repeal reflects legislative modernization and streamlining.**

If you can provide the original act or section that was repealed, I can offer a more detailed analysis of its content and impact.
