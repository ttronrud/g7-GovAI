### **2. Key Definitions**
The Act establishes clear definitions of core terms used throughout the legislation:

- **Acquirer**: An entity that enables merchants to accept card payments by providing access to a payment card network for transmitting or processing transactions. *Excludes agents or mandatories of the acquirer.*

- **Entity**: A broad term encompassing corporations, trusts, partnerships, unincorporated associations, or organizations.

### **3. Scope of Application**
This Act applies specifically to **payment card network operators** — entities that manage and operate national payment card networks. It does not apply to individual merchants, issuers, or other participants in the payment ecosystem, but focuses on the oversight of the central infrastructure that connects them.

### **4. Regulatory Oversight: The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)**
The **Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)** is the primary regulatory body responsible for supervising payment card network operators to ensure compliance with this Act and any associated regulations.

#### Key Powers of the Commissioner of FCAC:
- **Annual Examinations and Inquiries**: The Commissioner must conduct at least one examination or inquiry each year, or as often as necessary, to assess whether the network operators are complying with the Act and regulations.
- **Power to Obtain Evidence**: The Commissioner has all the powers of a commissioner under the *Inquiries Act*, including the right to:
  - Require testimony under oath;
  - Conduct investigations;
  - Obtain evidence through subpoenas or other legal means.
- **Delegation of Powers**: These powers can be delegated to any person acting under the Commissioner’s direction.
- **Access to Records**: The Commissioner has the right to access all records — including electronic records — of a payment card network operator.
- **Requirement to Provide Information**: The Commissioner may require directors or officers of a network operator to provide information and explanations, to the extent reasonably possible.

#### Confidentiality of Information:
- Any information obtained by the Commissioner or a delegate during investigations — including business data or information about individuals involved — is **confidential** and must be treated as such.
- Exceptions to confidentiality:
  - The Commissioner may disclose such information to:
    - The **Deputy Minister of Finance** or any authorized officer of the Department of Finance, for **policy analysis** related to regulating payment card networks.
    - The **Governor of the Bank of Canada** or any authorized officer, for the purpose of:
      - Carrying out the Bank of Canada’s objectives under the *Retail Payment Activities Act*; or
      - Planning future actions related to those objectives (even if a provision is not currently in force).

---

### **5. Compliance Agreements**
The Commissioner may enter into a **compliance agreement** with a payment card network operator. These agreements are intended to:
- Improve compliance with the Act and regulations;
- Address specific areas of non-compliance;
- Set measurable targets or corrective actions;
- Include monitoring and reporting requirements.

Such agreements are a tool for constructive engagement and corrective action rather than punitive enforcement.

---

### **6. Regulatory Powers of the Governor in Council**
The **Governor in Council** (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) may make regulations to implement and expand the Act’s provisions. These include:

#### Specific Regulatory Areas:
- **Rates and Fees Disclosure**:
  - Mandate that payment card network operators disclose certain types of fees and rates.
  - Specify how these disclosures must be made (e.g., format, frequency, accessibility).
- **Notice Requirements**:
  - Require operators to provide timely notice of:
    - New rates;
    - Changes in existing rates or fee structures.
  - Specify the timeframes, methods (e.g., website, email, consumer notices), and recipients (e.g., issuers, acquirers, consumers).
- **Conditions in Agreements**:
  - Require that agreements between network operators and **issuers** include certain conditions (e.g., transparency, fairness, anti-discrimination).
  - Require that agreements with **acquirers** include specific terms (e.g., equitable access, reasonable fees).
- **Prescriptive Provisions**: Allow the government to prescribe any other matters that fall under the Act’s scope.
- **General Provisions**: Enable regulations to fulfill the broader purposes of the Act.

#### Enforcement of Regulatory Conditions:
- Any payment card network operator that is a party to an agreement containing conditions required by regulations (under paragraphs 6(d) or (e)) must take **reasonable measures to enforce** those conditions. This ensures that the terms are not just paper agreements but are actively implemented.

### **7. Exemptions**
The **Minister of Finance** may, by order, **exempt a payment card network operator** from any provision of this Act or its regulations. Such exemptions are discretionary and typically used in exceptional circumstances (e.g., for national security, public interest, or transitional arrangements), and must be justified and subject to review.

### **Significance and Impact**
The *Payment Card Networks Act* plays a critical role in shaping the integrity and fairness of Canada’s digital payment ecosystem. By regulating the backbone of card-based transactions — the payment card networks — it:
- Increases consumer confidence in card payments;
- Promotes competition among issuers and acquirers;
- Prevents abuse of market power by dominant network operators;

It combines **strong consumer protections**, **transparent fee structures**, **robust oversight mechanisms**, and **flexible enforcement tools** to ensure that the payment system remains fair, efficient, and trustworthy for all users — from consumers to merchants and financial institutions.

This Act represents a foundational step toward modernizing Canada’s payment infrastructure in a way that supports innovation while protecting public interest.
