### **Detailed Summary of the Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act**

---

#### **Overview**

The **Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that legally enacts and gives effect to the **Inuvialuit Claims Agreement** of 1984 — a landmark land and resource settlement between the **Inuvialuit people** and the **Government of Canada**. The Act formalizes the surrender of Inuvialuit native title claims in exchange for a comprehensive package of rights, benefits, and compensation, particularly in the **Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR)** of the **Northwest Territories and Yukon**.

This Act was enacted to provide legal certainty, recognize the Inuvialuit’s traditional rights, and ensure their full and meaningful participation in economic, cultural, and social life in the Arctic region.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

#### **1. Background and Context (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with several "whereas" clauses that establish the historical, legal, and policy context:

- **Traditional Use and Occupancy**: The Inuvialuit have historically occupied and used lands in the Northwest Territories and Yukon based on traditional practices (hunting, fishing, trapping).
- **Government Assumption of Obligations**: In return for surrendering their native title, the Government of Canada assumed specific obligations under the Agreement — including land grants, hunting/fishing rights, cultural preservation, and financial compensation.
- **Scope of Rights and Benefits**: The Agreement includes:
  - Granting of land (for settlement and development).
  - Rights to hunt, fish, trap, and engage in commercial activities within the ISR.
  - Protection of Inuvialuit cultural identity and values.
  - Equal participation in the northern and national economy and society.
  - Environmental protection of Arctic wildlife, ecosystems, and biological productivity.
  - Financial compensation to the Inuvialuit.
- **Surrender of Native Claims**: In exchange for these benefits, the Inuvialuit formally surrender all native claims, rights, title, and interests in the Territory.
- **Consultation with Territorial Governments**: The governments of the Northwest Territories and Yukon were consulted and participated in discussions, recognizing their jurisdiction over local matters.
- **Legislative Necessity**: It is deemed expedient for Parliament to approve, validate, and give legal force to the Agreement.

#### **2. Title and Definitions**

- **Title of the Act**: *Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act*  
- **Key Definitions**:
  - **Agreement**: Refers to the original 1984 Agreement between the **Committee for Original Peoples’ Entitlement** (representing the Inuvialuit) and the Government of Canada. This includes the **Amending Agreements**.
  - **Amending Agreements**: Three key amendments passed in 1985, 1987, and 1987 (P.C. 1985-1144, P.C. 1987-26, P.C. 1987-26A/B) that clarified and expanded the original terms. These amendments addressed issues such as land management, revenue sharing, and governance.
  - **Territory**: Defined as the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and adjacent offshore areas within Canadian sovereignty.

---

#### **3. Legal Effect of the Agreement**

- **Approval and Validity**: The Act **formally approves, gives effect to, and declares valid** the Agreement. This means that the Agreement is now a binding legal instrument under Canadian law.
- **Rights Upon Extinguishment of Claims**: Once native claims are extinguished, the beneficiaries (the Inuvialuit) are entitled to **all rights, privileges, and benefits** outlined in the Agreement — including:
  - Land titles granted under **Section 7(1) and (2)** of the Agreement.
  - Rights to hunt, fish, trap, and conduct commercial activities.
  - Cultural and environmental protections.

---

#### **4. Extinction of Native Title**

- **Full Surrender of Claims**: All native claims, rights, title, and interests of Inuvialuit individuals or groups in the Territory are **formally extinguished**.
- **Important Exception**: Despite the extinguishment of native title:
  - Inuvialuit retain their status as **Canadian citizens**.
  - They continue to enjoy **all rights and benefits of citizenship**, including access to public services, social programs, and federal protections.
  - Their **aboriginal status** remains intact, and they continue to benefit from **other relevant legislation** (e.g., the *Indian Act*, *Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada* policies, and other aboriginal rights laws).

> ✅ This provision ensures that while native title is extinguished, the Inuvialuit are not deprived of their broader rights as citizens or aboriginal peoples.

---

#### **5. Tax Exemption of Compensation**

- The **financial compensation** provided under:
  - **Section 15** of the Agreement (direct compensation),
  - **Subsections 16(8)** and **17(3)** (funds for infrastructure, community development, and economic programs),
  
  is **exempt from taxation** in the manner and extent specified in those sections.

> 🔍 This ensures that the financial benefits of the settlement are accessible to the Inuvialuit without being reduced by income or capital gains taxes, preserving the economic value of the settlement.

---

#### **6. Regulatory Authority**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has the power to **make regulations** necessary to:
  - Implement the Agreement.
  - Provide administrative, operational, or procedural guidance.
  - Enforce the rights and obligations under the Agreement.

> 📝 Example: Regulations may govern how hunting and fishing rights are administered, how land is managed, or how revenue is distributed.

---

#### **7. Precedence Over Other Laws**

- If there is **any conflict or inconsistency** between:
  - This Act,
  - The Agreement,
  - And any other existing law applying to the Territory,

> The **Agreement and this Act prevail** in the area of conflict.

> ✅ This ensures that the Inuvialuit rights and benefits under the Agreement are not overridden by general or territorial laws.

---

#### **8. Territorial and Sovereignty Limitations**

- Nothing in the Act or Agreement grants rights, privileges, or benefits **beyond the limits of Canadian sovereignty or jurisdiction**.

> 🔒 This reinforces that the settlement is confined to Canada’s territory and does not extend to foreign or international waters or areas outside Canadian control.

---

#### **9. Funding of Financial Obligations**

- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** (Canada’s main federal revenue pool) will provide the necessary funds to meet Canada’s **monetary obligations** under:
  - Section 15 (compensation),
  - Subsections 16(8) and 17(3) (community development and economic programs).

> 💰 This ensures that the financial commitments are fully funded and legally enforceable.

---

#### **10. Coming into Force**

- The Act **comes into force on a day to be fixed by Proclamation** (a formal government announcement).
- **Note**: The Act was originally enacted on **July 25, 1984**, as indicated in the note.
