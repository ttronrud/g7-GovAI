**Detailed Summary of the Bills of Exchange Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Bills of Exchange Act* is a comprehensive piece of legislation that governs the creation, validity, negotiation, enforcement, and legal treatment of **bills of exchange** and **promissory notes** (collectively referred to as "bills or notes") in Canada. It establishes a clear legal framework for negotiable instruments, ensuring consistency, fairness, and enforceability in commercial transactions involving payment obligations.

This Act harmonizes common law principles with statutory rules, particularly those derived from English law (including the *law merchant*), while introducing specific provisions tailored to Canadian practice—especially regarding holidays, business days, delivery, and the rights of holders. It also includes special provisions related to **patent rights**, **protests**, **bank operations**, and **defences**.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Acceptance** | A formal assent by the drawee to pay the amount specified, completed either by physical delivery or notification. Acceptance is valid if signed and does not condition payment on any other means. |
| **Action** | Includes counter-claims and set-offs, meaning parties may assert claims against each other in dispute. |
| **Bank** | A bank or authorized foreign bank as defined under the *Bank Act*. |
| **Bearer** | The person in physical possession of a bill or note payable to bearer. |
| **Bill** | A bill of exchange—a written, unconditional order to pay a sum of money. |
| **Note** | A promissory note—a written promise to pay a sum of money. |
| **Defence** | Includes counter-claims; any valid legal objection to payment. |
| **Delivery** | Transfer of possession—actual or constructive—between parties. |
| **Holder** | The payee or endorsee in possession of a bill or note, or the bearer. |
| **Issue** | The first delivery of a completed bill to a person who takes it as a holder. |
| **Non-Business Days** | Days declared by law as holidays or non-juridical days (e.g., Sundays, statutory holidays); all time limits are calculated excluding these days. |
| **Value** | Valuable consideration—something of value exchanged for the instrument. |
| **Good Faith** | Honest conduct, even if negligent; acts done in good faith are deemed valid. |

> **Note**: A signature need not be handwritten; it may be signed by another person under the authority of the signer. For corporations, a duly sealed corporate seal suffices for signing, though no requirement exists for the instrument to be under seal.

## **Time Limitations and Business Days**

- **Time limits** for actions (e.g., acceptance, payment) are calculated **excluding non-business days**.
- If a deadline falls on a **Saturday**, it is deemed to fall on the **next business day**.
- A **bill payable on demand** cannot be properly presented for acceptance or payment on a **Saturday**.
- Failure to act on a Saturday does **not create any rights**.
- **Exception**: A cheque may be presented and paid on a Saturday or non-juridical day **if** the drawee bank is open for business at the time, and the presentation otherwise complies with the Act. In such cases, non-acceptance or non-payment gives **the same rights** as if presented on a regular business day.
- If a **bank branch is closed** on a business day, the time limit for actions at that branch is extended to the **next business day when the branch is open**.
- Similarly, presentation of a bill or note payable on demand **cannot occur** on a closed day.
- Failure due to closure does **not create rights**.

> These rules ensure that time-sensitive obligations are not unfairly disrupted by closed days or bank operations.

## **Provisions on Crossed Cheques and Warrants**

- The rules governing **crossed cheques** (e.g., restrictions on negotiability) **apply to warrants for dividend payments**.

> This ensures consistency in how negotiable instruments are treated across different financial instruments.

---

## **Application of Common Law and the Bank Act**

- The **rules of English common law and the law merchant** apply unless they conflict with specific provisions in this Act.
- The Act **does not override** the provisions of the *Bank Act* (e.g., banking regulations, licensing, etc.).

---

## **Protests and Evidence of Dishonour**

- A **protest** of a bill or note (within Canada) and a **notarial copy** of it are **evidence in any legal action** of:
  - Presentation and dishonour;
  - Service of notice of presentation and dishonour.
- For bills or notes presented **outside Canada**, a **notarial copy of the protest**, notice of dishonour, and **certificate of service** are admissible in all courts as evidence.

> This strengthens the enforceability of dishonoured instruments in litigation.

---

## **Prohibition on Bank Personnel Acting as Notaries**

- **No clerk, teller, or agent of a bank** may act as a notary when protesting a bill or note payable at the bank or any of its branches.

> Prevents conflicts of interest and ensures impartiality in the recording of protests.

## **Patent Rights and the "Given for a Patent Right" Requirement**

This section introduces a **critical safeguard** against the misuse of negotiable instruments in transactions involving intellectual property.

### **Mandatory Disclosure**
- Any instrument (bill or note) where the **consideration includes**:
  - Purchase money for a **patent right**, or
  - A **partial interest** (geographically limited or otherwise) in a patent right  
  must have the words **“Given for a patent right”** printed or written **prominently and legibly** across its face **before issuance**.

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance**
- If the required words are **missing or improperly placed**, the instrument and **any renewal** are **void**, **except** in the hands of a **holder in due course** (who is protected from defects).
- The **endorsee or transferee** of such an instrument takes it **subject to any defence or set-off** that would have existed between the original parties (e.g., a claim based on patent infringement).

### **Offence for Willful Misrepresentation**
- Any person who:
  - Issues, sells, or transfers
  - A bill or note **lacking** the required phrase
  - **Knowing** that the consideration involved purchase of a patent right
  is guilty of an **indictable offence**.
- Punishment: **Imprisonment for up to one year** or a **fine of up to $200**, or both.

> This provision protects intellectual property owners from fraudulent or misleading financial instruments.

## **Definition and Validity of a Bill of Exchange**

A **bill of exchange** is defined as:

> An **unconditional order in writing**, addressed by one person to another, **signed by the drawer**, requiring the drawee to pay a **sum certain in money** either:
- On demand, or
- At a fixed or determinable future time  
to or to the order of a specified person or to bearer.

### **Conditions for Validity**
- The instrument must be **unconditional** (no conditions or contingencies).
- It must **not order any act other than payment**.
- An order to pay from a specific fund is **not unconditional** unless:
  - It is an unqualified order to pay, **plus**:
    - An indication of a specific fund or account to be debited, or
    - A clear statement of the transaction giving rise to the bill.
- A bill **payable on a contingency** is **not valid**—the occurrence of the event does **not cure** the defect.

### **Multiple Drawees**
- A bill may be addressed to **two or more drawees** (e.g., partners).
- However, an order **in the alternative** (e.g., "A or B") or **in succession** (e.g., "A, then B") is **not a valid bill**.

### **Payee Designation**
- A bill may be payable:
  - To **bearer** (anyone in possession),
  - To **order** (a named person),
  - To **two or more payees jointly**,
  - In **alternative** to one of two or more payees,
  - To the **holder of an office** at the time.

> Payee must be named with **reasonable certainty**. If the payee is **fictitious or non-existent**, the bill may be treated as payable to bearer.

> A bill payable to a **specific person** (not to his order) is still **payable to him or his order at his option**.

## **Payability Conditions**

| Payability Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Payable on demand** | Expressed as “on demand” or “on presentation”; or no time specified. |
| **Payable at a fixed future time** | E.g., “30 days after date” or “on or at a fixed period after a certain event” (even if the event's timing is uncertain). |
| **Overdue acceptance** | If a bill is accepted after being overdue, it is deemed payable on demand. |
| **Overdue endorsement** | An endorser who endorses an overdue bill is treated as accepting it on demand. |

> These rules ensure that obligations are enforceable even if delayed.
