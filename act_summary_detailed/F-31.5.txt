**Detailed Summary of the *Framework on Palliative Care in Canada Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Framework on Palliative Care in Canada Act* is a legislative measure introduced to strengthen and standardize access to high-quality palliative care across Canada. It responds directly to key findings in the **Final Report of the External Panel on Options for a Legislative Response to *Carter v. Canada***, which emphasized that **a request for physician-assisted dying cannot be considered truly voluntary if adequate palliative care is not available** to relieve suffering.

This Act establishes a national framework to ensure that all Canadians—particularly those considering physician-assisted dying—have equitable, accessible, and comprehensive access to palliative care, regardless of where they live or the type of care setting they are in.

### **Key Provisions and Objectives**

#### 1. **Purpose and Citation**
- The Act is officially titled the *Framework on Palliative Care in Canada Act*.
- It recognizes that **palliative care is a fundamental component of end-of-life care** and a prerequisite for informed, voluntary decisions regarding physician-assisted dying.

#### 2. **Mandate for the Minister of Health**
The Minister of Health is tasked with developing a comprehensive **national framework for palliative care**, in close collaboration with:
- Provincial and territorial health authorities (representatives),
- Palliative care providers (hospitals, home care, long-term care facilities, residential hospices), and
- Other relevant stakeholders.

The framework must include the following core elements:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition of Palliative Care** | Clearly define what constitutes palliative care, including its goals (e.g., relieving suffering, managing symptoms, supporting patients and families) and scope of services. |
| **Training and Education Needs** | Identify the specific training, education, and professional development requirements for healthcare providers and caregivers (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers) to deliver effective palliative care. |
| **Support for Providers** | Establish measures to support palliative care providers—including staffing, resources, funding, and work environments—to ensure sustainability and quality of care. |
| **Research and Data Collection** | Promote research into palliative care practices and outcomes, and establish systems for collecting reliable, consistent, and anonymized data across Canada. |
| **Equitable Access Across Canada** | Develop strategies to ensure consistent and equitable access to palliative care, addressing disparities based on geography, income, language, disability, or other factors. |
| **Incorporation of Existing Best Practices** | Take into account existing provincial and territorial palliative care frameworks, strategies, and successful models to avoid duplication and build on proven approaches. |
| **Review of the Secretariat on Palliative and End-of-Life Care** | Evaluate whether it is advisable to **re-establish the Department of Health’s Secretariat on Palliative and End-of-Life Care**, which would provide centralized coordination, policy guidance, and intergovernmental support. |

#### 3. **Timeline for Implementation**

| Action | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| **Initiation of Consultations** | Must begin within **six months** of the Act coming into force. |
| **Development and Submission of Framework Report** | Must be prepared and laid before **each House of Parliament within one year** of the Act coming into force. |
| **Public Accessibility of Report** | The framework report must be posted on the Minister of Health’s official website within **10 days** of being tabled in Parliament. |
| **Progress Report on Palliative Care State** | A follow-up report on the **state of palliative care in Canada** must be prepared and submitted to Parliament within **five years** of the initial framework report being tabled. |
| **Submission and Public Access of Five-Year Report** | This report must be laid before each House of Parliament on **any of the first 15 days** when that House is sitting after completion. It must also be posted on the departmental website within **10 days** of tabling. |

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

- **Voluntary Dying and Ethical Integrity**: The Act reinforces that **physician-assisted dying must be a last resort**, and only after all available palliative care options have been exhausted. Without access to proper palliative care, a patient’s decision may be influenced by desperation or inadequate symptom management, undermining the ethical foundation of voluntary choice.
  
- **Equity and Accessibility**: By mandating consistent access across Canada, the Act addresses systemic disparities in palliative care availability—particularly in rural, remote, and underserved regions.

- **Interprovincial Coordination**: The requirement for consultation with provincial and territorial governments ensures that the framework respects regional differences while promoting national coherence.

- **Evidence-Based and Adaptive Policy**: The emphasis on research and data collection ensures that the framework evolves based on real-world outcomes and emerging evidence.

- **Institutional Memory and Oversight**: The proposed re-establishment of the Secretariat reflects a long-term commitment to institutionalizing palliative care policy, providing ongoing oversight, coordination, and strategic direction.

### **Implications and Outcomes**

1. **Improved End-of-Life Care**: Canadians will have better access to symptom management, emotional support, and holistic care during terminal illness.
2. **Enhanced Patient Autonomy**: Patients considering physician-assisted dying will be better informed and supported, knowing that their suffering has been properly addressed through palliative care.
3. **Workforce Development**: Clear training needs will guide education programs, improving the skills of healthcare professionals in end-of-life care.
4. **Accountability and Transparency**: Regular reporting to Parliament ensures public accountability and allows for parliamentary scrutiny and adjustments over time.
5. **National Standardization**: The framework aims to create a unified, evidence-based national standard that supports both patient dignity and healthcare system efficiency.

### **Conclusion**

The *Framework on Palliative Care in Canada Act* is a significant step toward ensuring that **palliative care is not just a supplement to end-of-life care, but a foundational element of it**. By embedding access to high-quality, equitable, and well-supported palliative care into national policy, the Act strengthens the ethical and practical basis for physician-assisted dying while prioritizing the well-being of patients and their families.

It reflects a shift from viewing palliative care as a secondary option to recognizing it as a **core, non-negotiable component of dignified end-of-life care**—a shift that aligns with both medical best practices and the principles of patient autonomy and compassion.

--- 

**In short**: This Act creates a legally binding, time-bound, and collaborative national strategy to improve access to palliative care in Canada—ensuring that every Canadian has the opportunity to receive compassionate, effective, and equitable care, especially when considering physician-assisted dying.
