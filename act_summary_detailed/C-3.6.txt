**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Education Savings Act* (CESA)**

---

### **1. Introduction and Purpose**
The *Canada Education Savings Act* (CESA) is a federal law enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to promote early financial planning for children’s post-secondary education. The primary objective of the Act is to **encourage the financing of children’s post-secondary education through savings beginning in early childhood**, specifically via **Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs)**.

This Act establishes two key financial incentives:
- **Canada Education Savings (CES) Grants**
- **Canada Learning Bonds (CLBs)**

These incentives are designed to support low- and middle-income families by providing direct financial assistance to RESP trusts for eligible beneficiaries.

### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

#### **Core Definitions in the Act**
- **Canada Child Benefit (CCB):**  
  A deemed overpayment under the Income Tax Act (specifically Subdivision A.1 of Division E of Part I). This is used as a proxy to determine eligibility for enhanced CES grants based on family income levels.

- **Canada Learning Bond (CLB):**  
  A one-time payment made to an RESP trust for a beneficiary who meets specific age and income criteria. It is available only to children born after 2003.

- **CES Grant:**  
  A grant paid by the Government of Canada to an RESP trust to help cover education costs. It is available for contributions made to an RESP by or on behalf of a subscriber for a beneficiary under 17 years of age at the end of the prior year.

- **Primary Caregiver:**  
  - For a beneficiary or child: the eligible individual (e.g., parent or guardian) responsible for them.  
  - If a special allowance is payable under the *Children’s Special Allowances Act*, the department, agency, or institution maintaining the child is considered the primary caregiver.

- **First Threshold & Second Threshold:**  
  These refer to adjusted income thresholds from the Income Tax Act (paragraphs 117(2)(a) and (b)) that determine eligibility for enhanced CES grants:
  - **First Threshold:** Income ≤ first threshold → higher CES grant (up to 20% of contribution).
  - **Second Threshold:** Income between first and second thresholds → reduced grant (10% of contribution).

> *Note:* These thresholds are adjusted annually under the Income Tax Act.

- **Adjusted Income:** As defined in section 122.6 of the Income Tax Act — used to assess eligibility for CES grants and CLBs.

- **Beneficiary, Contribution, Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP), Subscriber, Trust:** All defined under section 146.1 of the Income Tax Act.

### **3. Canada Education Savings (CES) Grants**

#### **Eligibility and Application**
- The Minister may pay a CES grant to a trustee of an RESP trust **on application**, in a form and manner approved by the Minister.
- The contribution must have been made in **1998 or a subsequent year** to an RESP for a beneficiary **under 17 years of age** at the end of the preceding year.

#### **Maximum Amount of CES Grant**
The amount of a CES grant for a given year is the **lesser of**:
1. **20% of the contribution**, or  
2. The amount by which the lesser of:
   - $1,000 (or $800 for years 1998–2006),
   - The beneficiary’s **unused CES grant room**  
   exceeds the total of all prior CES grants paid for that year (excluding those under subsection 4(4)).

> *Note:* The $800 cap applies only from 1998 to 2006; from 2007 onward, it is $1,000.

#### **Unused CES Grant Room**
Calculated using a formula based on the beneficiary’s age and residency:
- If the beneficiary was **17 years or older** at the end of the previous year → **no unused room**.
- Otherwise:
  - **Years alive between 1997 and 2006 (before 2007):** subtract years when ineligible or not resident in Canada.
  - **Years alive from 2006 onward (up to and including the current year):** same adjustment.
  - Subtract total CES grants already paid (excluding subsection 4(4)).

> This ensures that a beneficiary cannot receive more than a certain total over their lifetime.

#### **Enhanced Grants Based on Income**
If the beneficiary is a **qualified dependant** of an eligible individual:
- **If adjusted income ≤ first threshold:**  
  → 20% of contribution **plus** an additional $100 (if under 17 years old at time of contribution).
- **If adjusted income > first threshold but ≤ second threshold:**  
  → 10% of contribution **plus** an additional $50 (if under 17 years old at time of contribution).

> *Note:* The additional amount is only available if the individual qualifies for a Canada Child Benefit (CCB) or a special allowance.

#### **Adjustment for First Month of Eligibility**
- If no CCB eligibility was established in January, the adjusted income used is that from the **first month** in the year when eligibility was established.
- For beneficiaries born in **December**, eligibility is considered to begin in **January of the next year**.
- If someone becomes the primary caregiver after January, the income used is based on the **first month** when eligibility was established for that caregiver.

#### **Designation of Trust**
- The CES grant must be paid to the **trustee of a trust designated** by:
  - The primary caregiver, or
  - The caregiver’s cohabiting spouse or common-law partner.
- If multiple trusts are designated, the grant is first paid to the trust where the contribution was made.
- If the first trust receives less than the maximum, the remaining amount may be distributed to other designated trusts.

#### **Lifetime Limit**
- **No more than $7,200** in CES grants may be paid in respect of a single beneficiary over their lifetime.

### **4. Canada Learning Bond (CLB)**

#### **Eligibility and Availability**
- Available to beneficiaries born **after 2003** who are under **21 years of age** at the time of application.
- The Minister may pay the CLB to a trustee of an RESP trust upon application.

#### **When the Minister Can Proactively Open an RESP**
- If a child born **after 2023** would be eligible for a CLB **if they were a beneficiary**, and:
  - The child’s Social Insurance Number (SIN) is provided to the Minister,
  - The child is **not already a beneficiary** under an RESP,
- Then the Minister **must notify** the primary caregiver that:
  - The child is eligible for a CLB,
  - The Minister will open an RESP for the child to receive the bond.

#### **Timing for Opening the RESP**
- **If child is under 3 years old:**  
  Open no earlier than the day the child turns **4**, or any date set by the Minister.
- **If child is 3 years or older:**  
  Open no earlier than **365 days after** the eligibility determination, or any date set by the Minister.

> *Note:* The Minister may delay opening the RESP if the primary caregiver (or their spouse/common-law partner) has formally **refused** the CLB.

#### **Refusal Clause**
- The Minister **cannot open an RESP** if:
  - The primary caregiver or their cohabiting spouse/common-law partner has **refused** the CLB in writing (in approved form).
  - The child is already a beneficiary under an RESP.

> *Exception:* An application for a CLB may still be made even if a refusal was previously communicated.

### **5. Amount of the Canada Learning Bond**

#### **Benefit Year Definition**
A "benefit year" runs from **July 1 to June 30** of the following year.

#### **Payment Amounts**
- **First Benefit Year:**
  - $500 if:
    - The beneficiary is under 15 years old at the beginning of the month before the benefit year,
    - Or was born during the benefit year or the month before,
    - And for at least one month during the year:
      - Is a qualified dependant of an eligible individual whose adjusted income used to determine CCB was:
        - ≤ First threshold (if ≤3 dependants), or
        - Less than the amount calculated under subsection (2.1) (if >3 dependants), or
      - Is a person receiving a special allowance under the *Children’s Special Allowances Act*.
- **Subsequent Benefit Years (after first):**
  - $100 per year, provided the beneficiary remains under 15 years old at the start of the month before the benefit year and meets the same income criteria.

#### **Formula for Income Threshold (Clause 2.1)**
For eligible individuals with **more than 3 dependants**, the threshold is calculated as:

>  
> **Threshold = First Threshold for the year**  
> **+ (Number of dependants in excess of 2) × $2,308.27 × 0.333**

> *Example:*  
> If there are 5 dependants:  
> Excess = 2 → 2 × $2,308.27 × 0.333
