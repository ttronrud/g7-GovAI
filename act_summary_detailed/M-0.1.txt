The provided text consists entirely of repeated lines indicating that a particular section of a statute has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Chapter 40, Section 287** of a legislative act in the year **2013**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Status**: The content listed is not an active law or a detailed provision of an act. Instead, it is a series of **repeal annotations**, indicating that multiple sections (or provisions) of a prior statute have been formally removed from the legal code.
  
- **Repealing Legislation**: The repeal was enacted through **Act No. 40, 2013**, specifically under **Section 287** of that act. This section of the 2013 legislation serves as the legal instrument that invalidates or cancels the previously existing provisions.

- **Number of Repealed Provisions**: The text lists the repeal annotation **21 times**, suggesting that **21 different sections or subsections** of the original statute were repealed by this single section (s. 287) of the 2013 Act.

- **Nature of the Repealed Content**: Since no actual text of the repealed provisions is included in the input, we cannot determine the subject matter (e.g., environmental regulation, taxation, employment law, etc.) of the repealed sections. However, the fact that multiple provisions are being repealed in one legislative action suggests a **comprehensive legislative update or reform** aimed at modernizing or streamlining the legal framework.

- **Legal Implications**:
  - Any law, rule, or regulation derived from the repealed sections is no longer valid.
  - Legal proceedings, administrative actions, or court decisions based on those sections may be subject to review or invalidation.
  - The repeal may reflect a shift in policy, a consolidation of laws, or the replacement of outdated or redundant provisions.

- **Contextual Note**: The repeated nature of the annotation (21 times) may indicate a typographical or formatting error in the original document, or it may be a way to list multiple repealed sections in a single legislative reference. In official legal databases, such annotations are often grouped under one repeal section.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not contain a substantive act**—it is a **list of repeals**. The summary is that:

> A total of 21 sections of a prior statute were formally repealed by **Section 287 of Act No. 40, 2013**, which means those provisions are no longer in force. The specific content or subject of the repealed sections is not provided in the input, so a detailed analysis of their original purpose or scope cannot be conducted. This repeal likely reflects legislative reform or modernization efforts, and the repealed sections are now legally obsolete.

If you have access to the original statute or the full text of the 2013 Act, the specific provisions that were repealed could be identified and analyzed in more detail.
