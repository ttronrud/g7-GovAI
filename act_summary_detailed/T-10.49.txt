**Detailed Summary of the *Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act*, 1930**

---

### **Overview**

The *Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act*, enacted on March 20, 1930, is a foundational piece of legislation that establishes a comprehensive agreement between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of the Province of Saskatchewan** regarding the administration, ownership, and control of natural resources within Saskatchewan. This Act resolves a long-standing dispute over the legal status of Crown lands, minerals, water rights, and other natural resources in the province—particularly in light of Canada’s original assumption of control over these assets under the *Saskatchewan Act* (1905) and the *British North America Act, 1867*.

The core objective of the Act is to **place Saskatchewan on equal footing with the original provinces of Confederation** in terms of ownership and management of its natural resources, thereby affirming provincial autonomy and self-governance in resource matters.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Transfer of Ownership and Administration of Natural Resources**

> *"The interest of the Crown in all Crown lands, mines, minerals (precious and base), and royalties derived therefrom within the Province... shall from and after the coming into force of this agreement belong to the Province."*

- **Ownership Transfer**:  
  All Crown lands, mines, minerals (including precious and base metals), and associated royalties within Saskatchewan are transferred from the **Government of Canada** to the **Government of Saskatchewan** effective upon the coming into force of the agreement.

- **Administrative Authority**:  
  The Province gains full administrative control over these resources, including the power to manage, develop, lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of them for the benefit of the province and its residents.

- **Exception – Exceptions to Transfer**:  
  Certain assets remain under federal jurisdiction:
  - **Indian Reserves**: Lands within Indian reserves continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by Canada for the purposes of Canada.
  - **National Parks**: Lands in the Prince Albert National Park remain under federal control as national parks.

### **2. Retroactive and Forward-Looking Financial Provisions**

> *"All payments received by Canada in respect of any such lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement shall continue to belong to Canada."*

- **No Accounting Obligation**:  
  Canada is **not liable to account** to the Province for any payments made prior to the agreement’s coming into force, whether in advance or otherwise. This ensures financial stability and prevents claims against Canada for past revenues.

- **Future Payments**:  
  Starting from the date of the agreement, Canada will make **annual, half-yearly payments** to the Province based on population:

  | Population Level | Annual Payment |
  |------------------|----------------|
  | Up to 1,200,000 | $750,000 |
  | Over 1,200,000 | $1,125,000 |

  - Payments are due on **January 1st and July 1st** each year.
  - The population is based on the most recent **quinquennial (every five years) census**.

- **Proportionality Clause**:  
  Any prior payments made under Section 20 of the Saskatchewan Act (before 1930) that fell within a half-year period ending after the agreement’s date will be treated as having been made under this new agreement.

### **3. Protection of Existing Contracts and Agreements**

> *"The Province will carry out in accordance with the terms thereof every contract to purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals and every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown."*

- **Binding Effect**:  
  All existing contracts, leases, or arrangements involving Crown lands, mines, or minerals must be honored and enforced by the Province.

- **Non-Disruption Clause**:  
  The Province **cannot alter or terminate** any such contract through legislation or administrative action unless:
  - It obtains **consent from all parties involved** (including Canada), or
  - The change applies **generally** to all similar agreements across the province.

- **Reserve Powers**:  
  Any rights reserved to federal officers (e.g., Governor in Council, Minister of Interior) may be exercised by **provincial officers** (e.g., Provincial Secretary), unless otherwise specified by provincial law.

- **HBC Entitlements**:  
  The Province is obligated to:
  - Grant HBC lands eligible under the **Deed of Surrender** (December 23, 1924).
  - Release and discharge any **reservations in patents** related to HBC claims, if not already done before the agreement.

### **6. Water Rights and Water Power**

> *"All rights of fishery shall, after the coming into force of this agreement, belong to and be administered by the Province."*

- **Fisheries Ownership**:  
  All fishing rights (including rights to fish and hunt) within the province are transferred to the Province.

- **Disposal Rights**:  
  The Province may sell, license, or otherwise dispose of fishery rights.

- **Federal Oversight**:  
  The **Parliament of Canada retains legislative jurisdiction** over sea-coast and inland fisheries, meaning it can still regulate or legislate on fisheries matters.

> *"The provision in Section 4 of the Dominion Water Power Act (declaring undertakings as works for the general advantage of Canada) shall be repealed in relation to undertakings within Saskatchewan."*

- **Repeal of Federal Water Power Clause**:

- **Indigenous Hunting and Fishing Rights**:  
  - The Province **assures Indigenous peoples** the right to hunt, trap, and fish for food **year-round** on unoccupied Crown lands and on lands to which they have access.

- **Federal Control**:  
  The park and its lands, including mines and minerals, remain under **federal ownership and administration**.

  If Parliament of Canada later declares that a portion of the park is no longer needed for park purposes, those lands, minerals, and royalties **immediately transfer to the Province**.

- **Application of Provincial Provisions**:  
  Once transferred, the lands are subject to **Paragraph 3 of this agreement**, meaning they become provincial property and are administered by the
