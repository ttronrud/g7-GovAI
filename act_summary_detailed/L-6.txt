**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Lands Surveys Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Lands Surveys Act* is a federal statute that establishes the legal framework for conducting, managing, and verifying land surveys of **Canada Lands**—that is, lands belonging to Her Majesty in right of Canada or under the Government of Canada’s power to dispose of them—located in **Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut**. It governs the authority, procedures, and responsibilities related to surveying these lands, including the use of monuments, measurement standards, record-keeping, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

The Act was significantly amended and partially repealed in 1998 (e.g., sections on "Board," "candidate," "examination," "Secretary," "prescribed," and "commission" were repealed), reflecting modern administrative restructuring. The current version focuses on **survey integrity, accountability, and consistency**, with strong emphasis on **professional standards, oversight, and public accountability**.

## **Core Provisions and Functional Structure**

### **1. Administration and Oversight**

- **Minister of Natural Resources (or Northern Affairs)** has **overall administrative, directional, and controlling authority** over all surveys under this Act.
- The **Surveyor General** manages day-to-day survey operations and holds **custody of all original survey records**, including:
  - Field notes
  - Journals
  - Plans
  - Maps
- The Minister may authorize **an employee of the Department of Natural Resources** (who is a qualified surveyor) to perform duties of the Surveyor General.
- The **Governor in Council** may issue **orders and regulations** as needed to implement the Act or address gaps.

> ✅ *This ensures centralized control and accountability while allowing flexibility in implementation.*

---

### **2. Surveyor Accountability and Verification**

- Every surveyor must **verify and affirm by oath or otherwise** (to the satisfaction of the Surveyor General) that their survey was conducted **faithfully and correctly** in accordance with:
  - This Act
  - Instructions issued by the Surveyor General
- If a **court finds a survey was improperly executed**, the **Attorney General of Canada** may initiate legal proceedings to recover **costs from the surveyor** who provided the false verification.
- Surveyors must **maintain exact, regular field notes** and **file them with the Surveyor General in chronological order**.

> 🔍 *This establishes a strong system of professional accountability and legal recourse for errors.*

---

### **3. Measurement Standards**

- All surveys must use:
  - A **measuring device approved by the Surveyor General**, which is **calibrated, checked, and verified** according to the Surveyor General’s instructions; **or**
  - **Alternative methods of measurement** authorized by the Surveyor General based on specific circumstances.

- The **measure of length** used is the **Canadian measure of length**, as defined by the *Weights and Measures Act*.

> 📏 *Ensures uniformity and legal consistency across all surveys.*

---

### **4. Scope of Surveys – What Lands Are Covered**

Canada Lands include:
- All Crown lands in Yukon, NWT, and Nunavut
- Specific types of reserves and Indigenous lands (with exclusions)
- Lands in **National Parks** and **Rouge National Urban Park**
- **Submerged lands** under Canadian ownership

> ⚠️ Exclusions:
> - Certain reserve lands under the *First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act*
> - Specific Indigenous land bases (e.g., Doncaster Reserve No. 17)

> ✅ *This ensures inclusivity while respecting Indigenous land rights and legal distinctions.*

---

### **5. Conduct of Surveys**

- **Only Canada Lands Surveyors** may conduct surveys of Canada Lands **unless**:
  - The survey affects **adjacent non-Canada Lands** (i.e., private land), in which case it **must be conducted by a provincial surveyor**.

- The **Minister may direct** how Canada Lands are surveyed—**in any manner, by any method, with any description**—if it is deemed desirable due to geographic, environmental, or administrative factors.

- The Minister may establish **Coordinated Survey Areas (CSAs)** within any land under this Act. These areas are formally announced in the *Canada Gazette*.

> 🌐 **Within a CSA:**
> - All new monuments must be positioned via **surveyed connection to reference points**.
> - Coordinates must be expressed using the **system of coordinates specified** for that area.
> - **Prior monuments** may also be repositioned using the same method.
> - If a monument is lost, its **coordinates are deemed proof of its original location**—unless contradicted by evidence.

> 🏁 *CSAs promote consistency, accuracy, and interoperability across large or complex regions.*

---

### **6. Official Plans and Confirmation**

- All survey plans must be **plotted from field notes and supporting documents**, under the **direction of the Surveyor General**.
- The plan must show:
  - Direction and length of boundaries
  - Nature and position of boundary monuments
- The **Surveyor General must confirm** the plan if satisfied that:
  - It was conducted in accordance with the Act
  - It is satisfactory to the relevant Minister or Commissioner

> ✅ **On confirmation, the plan becomes an "official plan"** under the Act.

> ❌ **No survey is complete until confirmed** by the Surveyor General.

> 🔁 If a plan is found to contain:
> - Improper or incorrect plotting
> - Omissions
> - Clerical errors
> - Defects  
> → A **new plan** must be created and confirmed by the Surveyor General.

> 📂 Once confirmed, the **new plan replaces all previous official plans** affecting the land.

---

### **7. Filing of Official Plans**

- The **Minister must send a copy of the official plan** to the **registrar of deeds or land titles** in the relevant jurisdiction (county, district, etc.) for **filing in the land registry**.

> 🔗 *This ensures legal recognition and integration into property records.*

> ⚠️ *Note:* Plans made by the Surveyor General for **administrative purposes only** do not need to be confirmed or filed.

---

### **8. Legal Effect of Boundary Lines**

- After confirmation, **boundary lines defined by monuments** in surveys become the **true legal boundaries** of roads, streets, lots, parcels, or subdivisions—even if, on admeasurement, they do not match the described area or dimensions in a grant or patent.

> 💡 *This means the survey defines the legal boundary, regardless of actual area.*

> 🚧 *Exception:* In Yukon, NWT, and Nunavut, **all allowances** (e.g., for roads, streets, commons) laid out in surveys become **public highways or commons**.

---

### **9. Resurveys**

Resurveys may be conducted for:
- Correcting errors or supposed errors
- Re-establishing lost monuments
- At the request of the **Member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council for Canada** or the **Commissioner** administering the land

- Resurveyed plans are treated **identically** to original surveys:
  - Must be confirmed by the Surveyor General
  - Replace all prior official plans

> 🔄 *Resurveys ensure ongoing accuracy and legal continuity.*

---

### **10. Special Surveys (for Territorial Lands)**

Special surveys may be conducted for:
1. Correcting errors in existing surveys
2. Subdividing land not previously subdivided
3. Fixing road or highway locations
4. Establishing boundary lines where monuments are lost or unclear
5. Any other purpose deemed necessary by the Minister or Commissioner

#### **Process for Special Surveys:**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Minister of Natural Resources** orders the survey upon request |
| 2 | **Surveyor General** manages the survey under direction of the Minister |
| 3 | Survey must be conducted by a **Canada Lands Surveyor** under instructions from the Surveyor General
