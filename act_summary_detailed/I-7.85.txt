**Detailed Summary of the *Indigenous Languages Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Indigenous Languages Act* is a landmark piece of legislation introduced by the Government of Canada to formally recognize, support, and advance the rights of Indigenous peoples related to their languages. Enacted in response to long-standing historical injustices, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) Calls to Action, and international commitments such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), this Act establishes a comprehensive legal framework to promote, revitalize, and protect Indigenous languages across Canada.

The Act acknowledges that Indigenous languages are not only vital components of cultural identity but are deeply interwoven with spiritual beliefs, land connections, worldviews, and self-determination. It affirms the inherent rights of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples to control and manage their languages and ensures that Indigenous-led initiatives take precedence in language revitalization efforts.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

### **1. Legislative Context and Motivations**
The Act is grounded in several foundational principles:
- **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action**: Specifically, it responds to Calls to Action 13–15, which emphasize the need to protect and revitalize Indigenous languages.
- **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**: The Act affirms that Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, revitalize, and protect their languages, as recognized under UNDRIP.
- **International Recognition**: 2019 was designated the *International Year of Indigenous Languages* by the UN, highlighting global concern over language extinction and reinforcing Canada’s commitment.
- **Historical Harm**: The Act explicitly references colonial policies such as residential schools, forced assimilation, and the Sixties Scoop, which have severely damaged Indigenous language transmission and fluency.

These motivations underscore that language loss is not just a linguistic issue—it is a consequence of systemic colonialism and a threat to cultural survival.
