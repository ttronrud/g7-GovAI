**Detailed Summary of the Korean War Veterans Day Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Korean War Veterans Day Act* is a legislative measure passed by the Parliament of Canada to formally recognize and honor the service, sacrifice, and enduring legacy of Canadian veterans who participated in the Korean War (1950–1953) and the subsequent peacekeeping operations that followed the armistice. The Act designates **July 27** each year as **Korean War Veterans Day**, a national day of remembrance and appreciation.

While not a legal holiday or a day off work, the Act establishes a formal, symbolic recognition of the contributions of Canadian military personnel and their families during one of the most significant and challenging conflicts of the 20th century.

### **Key Provisions and Background Context**

#### **1. Historical Trigger: The Outbreak of War (June 25, 1950)**
The Act begins with a historical reference to the invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces on June 25, 1950, which marked the beginning of the Korean War. This conflict, lasting over three years, became a pivotal Cold War confrontation between communist and capitalist blocs, with the United Nations (UN) leading a multinational coalition to support South Korea.

#### **2. Canadian Military Involvement**
The Act highlights the significant and courageous role Canada played in the conflict:

- **26,791 Canadians served** in direct combat or support roles during the war.
- **Approximately 7,000 Canadians served as peacekeepers** after the 1953 armistice, helping to maintain the fragile ceasefire.
- These efforts were part of Canada’s broader commitment to international peace and collective security under the United Nations.

#### **3. Human Cost and Legacy of Sacrifice**
The Act underscores the profound personal and emotional toll of the war on Canadian veterans and their families:

- **516 Canadian service members died** in service during the Korean War.
  - Their names are inscribed in two prominent memorials:
    - The **Korean War Book of Remembrance** in the **Peace Tower, Ottawa**.
    - The **Wall of Remembrance** at **Meadowvale Cemetery, Brampton, Ontario**.
- **Nearly 400 of these fallen soldiers are buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea**, symbolizing the deep and lasting connection between Canada and South Korea.
- Many veterans returned home with **physical and psychological injuries**, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which they continued to face throughout their lives.

#### **4. Canada’s Role in the UN Campaign**
Canada was among the **top contributors** among the 16 UN member nations that provided combat support during the war. This reflects Canada’s early commitment to multilateralism and international peacekeeping, establishing a foundation for its future role in global security.

#### **5. Historical Transformation of South Korea**
The Act notes the remarkable transformation of South Korea since the war:
- From a **poor, war-torn nation** in the 1950s to a **major global economic power**.
- Today, South Korea is a **G20 member**, a leader in technology, innovation, and international diplomacy.
- This transformation is framed as a testament to the enduring value of the sacrifices made by Canadian soldiers and civilians who defended freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula.

#### **6. Designation of July 27 as Korean War Veterans Day**
- **July 27, 1953**, is the date on which the **Korea Armistice Agreement** was signed in Panmunjom, effectively ending active hostilities in the war.
- The Act identifies this date as **symbolically appropriate** for honoring Canadian veterans because it marks the end of the fighting and the beginning of a period of peace—peace that was made possible by the bravery and dedication of Canadian forces.
- The day is chosen not only for its historical significance but also as a day to express **gratitude and appreciation** to veterans and their families for their sacrifices in pursuit of peace and democracy.

---

#### **7. Parliamentary Recognition**
- On **June 8, 2010**, the **Senate of Canada unanimously passed a motion** recognizing July 27 as **National Korean War Veterans Day**.
- This motion laid the foundation for the formal enactment of the Act, reflecting strong bipartisan and cross-party support for honoring Canadian veterans.

---

#### **8. Legal and Symbolic Nature of the Day**
- The Act explicitly states that **Korean War Veterans Day is not a legal holiday**.
- It is **not a day off work** or a non-juridical day (i.e., it does not automatically grant leave to employees or public servants).
- However, it is a **national day of remembrance**, encouraging:
  - Public ceremonies and events.
  - Educational initiatives.
  - Commemorative activities in schools, communities, and military institutions.
  - Honoring veterans through public discourse and historical reflection.
