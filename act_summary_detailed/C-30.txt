### **Detailed Summary of the *Canada-United Kingdom Civil and Commercial Judgments Convention Act***

---

#### **1. Purpose and Title**
The **Canada-United Kingdom Civil and Commercial Judgments Convention Act** establishes the legal framework for the **reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments** between Canada and the United Kingdom (UK). The Act enables judgments rendered in one country to be recognized and enforced in the other, promoting judicial efficiency, legal certainty, and cross-border commercial confidence—particularly in matters involving the payment of money.

The Convention is a modern, tailored version of the **1968 Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters**, adapted to reflect the specific legal systems and practical needs of Canada and the UK.

#### **4. Recognition and Enforcement via Registration**
A judgment creditor may apply to a court in the **other Contracting State** to have the judgment **registered**, which gives it the same legal force as if it were a judgment issued locally.

- **Time Limit for Application**:  
  The application must be made **within six years** of:
  - The date of the original judgment, **or**
  - The date of the last judgment in appeal proceedings (if an appeal was filed).

- **Effect of Registration**:
  - The registered judgment has **the same force and effect** as a judgment given by the registering court.
  - It can be **enforced** as if it were a domestic judgment.
  - The **registering court retains control** over enforcement (e.g., to initiate enforcement actions, issue orders, or set aside enforcement).

- **Costs and Fees**:
  - The judgment is registered **for reasonable costs and incidental expenses**, including obtaining a certified copy from the original court.

- **Partial Registration**:
  - If the judgment covers multiple issues, and only some parts are enforceable independently, the judgment may be registered **only for the enforceable parts**.
  - If the judgment is **partially satisfied** at the time of application, registration is granted only for the **remaining balance**.
