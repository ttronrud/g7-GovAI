**Detailed Summary of the Defence Production Act (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The **Defence Production Act** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to ensure the nation’s ability to produce and supply essential defence-related goods and infrastructure during times of national emergency, war, or when the security of Canada is at risk. It grants broad powers to the federal government—particularly the Minister of Public Works and Government Services (now known as the Minister of National Defence or a related minister)—to mobilize, regulate, and control the production and supply of **defence supplies** and **defence projects** in order to protect national security.

This Act operates under a framework of **emergency powers**, enabling the government to override normal market mechanisms and commercial practices when it is deemed necessary for national defence. It is especially relevant in times of conflict, global instability, or threats to Canada’s sovereignty.
