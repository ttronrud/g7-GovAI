**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Relocation and Crossing Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Railway Relocation and Crossing Act* (hereinafter referred to as the "Act") is a Canadian federal statute designed to facilitate major transportation infrastructure development by enabling the reconfiguration of railway systems—particularly in urban areas—when such changes are necessary to improve public transportation, land use, and overall mobility. The Act establishes a structured framework for provincial and municipal governments, railway companies, and the Canadian Transportation Agency (Agency) to collaborate on large-scale transportation planning, including the relocation of railways, closure of grade crossings, and reallocation of rail rights-of-way.

The core objective is to balance **public transportation needs** with **railway operational and financial impacts**, ensuring that any relocation or modification of rail lines is justified, transparent, and financially equitable.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Agency**  
   - Refers to the **Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)**, the federal body responsible for regulating transportation in Canada.  
   - It has regulatory authority over railway operations and land use in transportation planning.

2. **Railway Crossing**  
   - Defined broadly as any intersection between a railway and a highway, or vice versa.  
   - Includes physical configurations such as:
     - Elevation or depression of one line over the other (e.g., overpasses or underpasses),
     - Diversion of routes,
     - Any construction or work authorized by the Agency to enhance public safety and convenience.

3. **Transportation Plan**  
   - A comprehensive plan outlining the future layout of transportation infrastructure within a defined area, including:
     - Streets, highways, bridges,
     - Railway lines, crossings (at-grade or grade-separated),
     - Bus routes, rapid transit lines, stations, terminals, and airports.  
   - Serves as the blueprint for future urban development and mobility.

4. **Urban Area**  
   - Defined as areas classified as urban by **Statistics Canada** in its most recent census.  
   - Includes adjacent areas, and forms the primary focus of the Act.

5. **Urban Development Plan**  
   - A land-use plan that regulates and controls the development of land within or adjacent to an urban area.  
   - Covers use for industry, commerce, housing, recreation, transportation, education, and public services.

## **Core Provisions and Mechanisms**

### **1. Acceptance of a Transportation Study Area and Accepted Plan**  
- A **"transportation study area"** is a defined geographic region that may include part or all of an urban area.  
- For an application to be submitted to the Agency, **both**:
  - The **provincial government** and
  - All **municipalities** within the area  
  must have jointly agreed upon an **"accepted plan"**—a combined **urban development plan** and **transportation plan**.

> *Exception*: If only a portion of an urban area is involved, the Agency may still accept the application if it determines that the plan **materially affects only those municipalities** within the study area.

---

### **2. Funding for Planning (Cost Sharing)**  
The **Minister of Transport** may authorize the use of federal funds to partially cover the costs of preparing:
- Transportation plans, and  
- Urban development plans  

**Limitation**:  
- No more than **50%** of the total cost of these plans may be funded under this provision.

> *Purpose*: To encourage proactive planning and investment in long-term infrastructure solutions without placing undue financial burden on the federal government.

---

### **3. Federal Program Requirements for Applications**  
An application to the Agency **will not be accepted** unless:
1. The **Minister of Transport** confirms that:
   - The proposed **federal programs** (e.g., grants, subsidies) are **available** and will **significantly improve** the urban area.
2. The **Governor in Council** agrees to **allocate funds** from the federal budget for **relocation grants** under this Act.

> *Rationale*: Ensures that federal support is tied to tangible benefits and avoids unfunded or speculative plans.

---

### **4. Application Requirements and Financial Plan**  
Every application must include a detailed **financial plan** that clearly outlines:
- How **costs and benefits** are shared among:
  - Province,
  - Municipalities,
  - Affected railway companies,
  - Other stakeholders.
- How the **transportation plan’s costs** will be met, including:
  - Any existing or proposed financial assistance (excluding Agency grants).
- Specific **dates** for key payments or transactions.
- All **external financial assistance sources** (e.g., municipal bonds, private investment).

> *Purpose*: To ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in cost distribution.

---

### **5. Agency Review and Approval of the Plan**  
The Agency may accept the plan **as submitted** or with modifications if:
- The financial plan:
  - Does **not impose greater costs or losses** on railway companies than the benefits they receive, and
  - Does **not provide benefits exceeding costs** incurred by rail companies.
- The **planning parties** (provincial/municipal developers) agree to amend the plan to reflect Agency recommendations.
- The Agency is confident that **financial assistance** will be committed to the plan when needed.

> *Note*: The financial plan must show what the Agency would likely recommend or apply in terms of funding.

---

### **6. Hearing Requirement Before Orders Are Issued**  
Before making any order under **Section 7 or 8**, the Agency **must hold a public hearing**.  
- Ensures due process, stakeholder input, and transparency in decision-making.

---

### **7. Types of Orders the Agency May Issue**  
Once an accepted plan is approved, the Agency may issue orders requiring railway companies to:

#### a) **Cease Operation** on Certain Lines  
- Require a railway company to stop operating on specific lines within the transportation study area.  
- May include **removal of tracks, buildings, bridges, or other structures**.

#### b) **Allow Third-Party Use** of Rail Rights-of-Way  
- Permit **other railways** or **public transit systems** (e.g., rapid transit, buses) to operate on the company’s lines.  
- Terms and conditions, including **compensation**, are set in the approved financial plan.  
- Rules for operations are prescribed by the Agency.

#### c) **Restrict Traffic Types**  
- Require the railway to operate **only specific classes of traffic** (e.g., freight only, passenger only) on designated lines.

#### d) **Build New Rail Lines or Connections**  
- Require construction of new rail lines or connections between existing lines or transit systems.

#### e) **Close Grade-Level Crossings**  
- Mandate closure of any at-grade railway crossings if required by the accepted plan.

> *All orders are subject to the Railway Safety Act*, ensuring safety standards are maintained.

### **8. Land Acquisition and Disposition**  
When a railway line is discontinued or reconfigured:

- If the Agency orders a cessation of operations, it may **recommend** that the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** acquire the land previously occupied by the railway.
- Acquisition can occur via:
  - Purchase,
  - Expropriation under the *Expropriation Act*.
- The Minister may **sell, lease, or otherwise dispose** of the land, provided:
  - The disposition is consistent with the accepted plan,
  - Any conditions set by the Agency are met.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring**  
- If the Agency suspects that the transportation plan is **not being implemented** as scheduled or in the prescribed manner:
  - It may **withhold** any financial assistance (relocation grants) until it is satisfied that **reasonable efforts** are being made to implement the plan.

> *Purpose*: To ensure accountability and prevent delays or non-compliance.

---

### **10. Relocation Grants**  
- The Agency may **recommend** a **relocation grant** to help cover the costs of implementing the transportation plan.
- The grant **cannot exceed 50%** of the **net costs of railway relocation**, as determined under Section 15.

> *Purpose*: To provide targeted financial relief to railway companies affected by necessary relocations.

### **11. Determining Net Costs of Railway Relocation**  
The Agency uses a detailed **schedule** to calculate the net costs of relocation, which considers:

#### Key Components:
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Costs of New Railway Facilities** | Construction costs of new rail lines or connections, excluding land acquisition and grade separations. |
| **Current Value of Existing Maintenance & Operating Costs** | Capitalized value (over 15 years) of ongoing maintenance and operating costs, using a pre-determined interest rate. |
| **Current Value of New Maintenance & Operating Costs** | Capitalized value of future maintenance costs under the new system. |
| **Decrease in Land Value** | Loss in value of land owned by the railway due to relocation. |
| **Increase in Land Value** | Gain in value of land due to relocation (e.g., due to redevelopment). |

#### Rules for Net Costs:
- **If land value decreases**:  
  Net costs = (Decrease in land value) + (Adjusted costs of new facilities)  
- **If land value increases**:  
  Net costs = (Adjusted costs of new facilities) – (Increase in land value)  
- **If no change in land value**:  
  Net costs = Adjusted costs of new facilities  

> *Adjustment Formula for New Facility Costs*:  
- If new operating costs > existing:  
  Adjusted cost = New construction cost + (difference in capitalized operating costs)  
- If new
