**Detailed Summary of the Government Services Resumption Act (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Government Services Resumption Act* (G.S.R.A.) is a Canadian legislative instrument enacted on **December 15, 1989**, by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. The Act was designed to **resume normal operations** in specific government services that had been suspended due to ongoing industrial disputes, particularly involving strikes. It provides a legal framework for the immediate resumption of work, the restoration of employment duties, and the subsequent negotiation of new collective agreements through a formal conciliation process.

The Act is most relevant in the context of the **1988–1989 public service strikes**, during which key government services were suspended. This legislation effectively **ends the strike period**, reinstates employees to their duties, and establishes a structured process for resolving outstanding disputes over wages, working conditions, and agreement terms—without allowing further strike action during a defined transitional period.

### **4. Notice and Compliance Obligations (Section 4)**
The **bargaining agent (PSAC)** and its officers/representatives must:

- **Ensure compliance** with the resumption of duties by taking reasonable steps.

> This provision ensures that no union activity (such as strike threats or encouragement) is permitted after the Act comes into force, reinforcing the legal obligation to return to work.

---

### **5. Protection from Disciplinary Action (Section 5)**
No officer or representative of the **employer** may:
- Impede an employee from complying with the resumption of duties; or

- All **group-specific agreements** and the **master agreement** remain in force **on and after the coming into force** of the Act.
- These agreements **expire on the date fixed by the conciliation board** established for each bargaining unit.
- If either party had previously agreed in writing that a provision of an agreement should take effect **before** the Act came into force, that provision **is deemed effective from that earlier date**.

---

### **7. Amendments and Binding Effect of Agreements (Section 7)**
- Any amendments made by or pursuant to this Act are **effective and binding** on the parties involved.
- The Act treats the amended agreements as if they were **originally agreed upon** under the standard terms of the PSSRA.
- For the purposes of any **federal legislation**, the amended agreement is deemed to be a **binding agreement between the employer and each employee** in the bargaining unit.

> This strengthens the legal standing of the new agreements and ensures they are recognized under broader employment and labor laws.

---

### **8. Prohibition on Strike Activity (Section 8)**
For the **duration of a group-specific agreement** as defined in subsection 5(1):
- **No officer or representative of the bargaining agent** may declare, authorize, or direct a strike.

### **9. Establishment of Conciliation Boards (Section 9)**
The **Chair of the Public Service Staff Relations Board** must:
- Establish **two conciliation boards**:
  - **Board 1**: For the **Hospital Services (supervisory and non-supervisory)** group (GSA expired Dec 21, 1987).
  - **Board 2**: For the **Ships’ Crews (supervisory and non-supervisory)** groups (both expired Dec 31, 1987).
- Appoint:
  - **Michael Bendel** (Ottawa) as Chair of Board 1.

### **10. Appointment of Board Members (Section 10)**

Each board must:
- **Mediate** matters related to:
  - Amendments or revisions of the relevant group-specific agreements or the master agreement.

### **12. Legal Effect of Board Decisions (Section 12)**

  - The fixed expiry date.
- These **amended agreements become new group-specific agreements or master agreements**.

> This ensures that the outcome of the conciliation process is **legally binding and enforceable**.

### **13. Flexibility in Agreement Amendments (Section 13)**
- The parties retain the right to **amend any provision** of the agreement (except the expiry date).
