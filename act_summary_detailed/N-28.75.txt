## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Nunavut Planning and Project Assessment Act**

### 📌 **Overview and Purpose**

The *Nunavut Planning and Project Assessment Act* (the "Act") is a foundational piece of legislation enacted in Canada to implement and operationalize the **land use planning and project assessment regime** established under the **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA)**, which came into force on **July 9, 1993**.

This Act provides a **statutory framework** for:
- Responsible land use planning,
- Environmental and social project assessment,
- Sustainable economic development,
- Conservation of ecosystems,
- Protection of Inuit rights and cultural values,
- Promotion of Inuit self-reliance and well-being,
- And balanced engagement between federal, territorial, and Inuit interests.

It ensures that the institutions created by the NLCA — the **Nunavut Planning Commission (Commission)** and the **Nunavut Impact Review Board (Board)** — have clear, enforceable powers, duties, and functions under law.

## 🔍 Key Provisions and Structure

### 1. **Applicability and Scope**

- **Applies to the Designated Area**:  
  The "designated area" consists of:
  - The **Nunavut Settlement Area**, and  
  - The **Outer Land Fast Ice Zone**.

- **Extended Application**:  
  The Act also applies to projects:
  - Carried out **wholly or partly outside** the designated area,  
  - And to **impacts outside** the area, **where necessary** to fulfill specific provisions such as:
    - Sections 80, 98, 113, 133, 156–162, 168, 185–187 (which relate to environmental protection, ecosystemic impacts, Indigenous rights, and cross-border effects).

> This ensures that decisions affecting the environment or communities in Nunavut — even if located beyond its borders — are assessed with due regard to their regional and ecological consequences.

### 3. **Hierarchy of Legal Authority**

- **The Agreement Prevails**:  
  In case of conflict between:
  - The Act and the NLCA,  
  - The Act and other federal/territorial laws,  
  → The **Agreement takes precedence**.

- **Statutory Precedence**:  
  The Act and its regulations **prevail over conflicting federal or territorial laws**.

- **Exception for Other Acts**:  
  An order made under Section 214 (likely a project review or approval order) does **not override** a requirement from another Act — even if that Act is inconsistent — because the Act is deemed to prevail.

> This protects the integrity of the land claims agreement and ensures that Inuit rights and environmental safeguards are not undermined by other legislation.

### 4. **Inuit Participation and Representation**

The Act emphasizes **meaningful Inuit involvement**, particularly through:
- **Designated Inuit Organizations** (Tunngavik and Makivik),
- **Representation in Commission and Board appointments**,

#### 📌 Representation in the Commission:
- At least one member appointed by the **federal Minister**,
- At least one by the **territorial Minister**,
- **Half** of the members appointed by **Tunngavik** (the designated Inuit organization in Nunavut).

> **Special provision for areas of equal use and occupancy**:  
> In such areas (shared use zones), **Makivik** may nominate a number of persons equal to **half** the number of members appointed by Tunngavik. These nominees are appointed by the federal Minister and act in place of the Tunngavik-appointed members.

#### 📌 Representation in the Board:
- Two members appointed by the **federal Minister**,
- Four members appointed by the federal Minister **on nomination by Tunngavik**,
- One by the **territorial Minister**,
- One by **one or more territorial ministers**.

> Again, if a project is in an area of equal use and occupancy, **Makivik** can nominate a number of persons equal to half of the Tunngavik-appointed members, who are then appointed by the federal Minister.

> **Preference for local residents**: If equally qualified, the federal Minister gives preference to nominees who **reside in the designated area**.
