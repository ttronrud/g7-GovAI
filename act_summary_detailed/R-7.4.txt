**Detailed Summary of the *Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Act* is a historical Canadian statute enacted in 1933 to provide financial protection and support to **returned soldiers** and their families—specifically, widows, widowers, and dependents—following their service in **World War I** (the "Great War"). The Act establishes a **life insurance scheme** for eligible individuals, offering death benefits and disability benefits with provisions for beneficiary designations, annuity options, and administrative flexibility.

Although the Act is largely **repealed or superseded** by modern legislation (notably the *Veterans’ Benefits Act* and other post-World War II reforms), it remains a significant piece of Canadian social policy history, reflecting early efforts to provide long-term financial security to veterans and their families.

### **2. Death Benefit and Payment Options**

The core of the Act is the **death benefit**, which can be paid in several forms:

- **Full face value** of the policy (up to $5,000).
- **Annuity options**:
  - For **5, 10, 15, or 20 years**;
  - As a **life annuity**;
  - As a **guaranteed annuity** (for 5–20 years) followed by a life annuity.

> The insured has **full discretion** over how the benefit is paid—either as a lump sum or as an annuity.

#### **Beneficiary Designation Rules**

- **Primary Beneficiaries**:
  - If the insured has a **spouse, common-law partner, or children**, these are the primary beneficiaries.
  - If none exist, the **future spouse, future common-law partner, or future children** are considered.

- **Multiple Beneficiaries**:
  - The insured may **apportion** (allocate) the benefit among beneficiaries.
  - If no apportionment is made, the benefit is split **equally** among surviving designated beneficiaries.

- **Death of a Designated Beneficiary During the Insured’s Lifetime**:
  - The insured may **re-designate** the share to another beneficiary.
  - If no re-designation occurs, the share is **divided equally** among surviving designated beneficiaries.

- **No Designated Beneficiary or All Die**:
  - If no beneficiary is named or all die before the insured, the benefit goes to:
    - The **spouse, common-law partner, and children** in equal shares.
    - If the insured survives these, and there are **no contingent beneficiaries**, the benefit goes to the **estate or succession** of the insured.

> This structure ensures a clear hierarchy of beneficiaries while allowing flexibility through designations.

---

### **3. Contingent Beneficiaries**

A separate provision allows the insured to designate **contingent beneficiaries** in case the primary beneficiaries (spouse, partner, children) do not survive the insured.

#### **Eligible Contingent Beneficiaries Include**:
- Grandchildren
- Parents
- Brothers/sisters
- Uncles/aunts
- Nephews/nieces
- First cousins
- Any person prescribed by regulation

> These beneficiaries receive the benefit **only if the primary beneficiaries do not survive**.

#### **Apportionment and Re-designation**:
- Like primary beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries can be **apportioned** or **re-apportioned**.
- If a contingent beneficiary dies during the insured’s lifetime, their share goes to surviving contingent beneficiaries (equal division if none are named).
- If no contingent beneficiary survives, the benefit goes to the **estate**.

> This provision provides a safety net for extended family members.

---

### **4. Changes and Modifications to Beneficiary Designations**

- The insured may **change**:
  - Beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries;
  - The **mode of payment** (lump sum, annuity);
  - The **apportionment** of benefits.

- Such changes must be submitted in a **document satisfactory to the Minister**.

> The insured has significant control over the policy, ensuring personalization of benefits.

---

### **5. Post-Death Variations in Payment**

- A beneficiary or contingent beneficiary who **survives the insured but dies before receiving all benefits**:
  - The **remaining unpaid amount** is paid to the **estate or succession** of the deceased beneficiary.

> This prevents benefit forfeiture due to premature death of a beneficiary.

---

### **6. Disability Benefits**

If the insured becomes **totally and permanently disabled** (unable to pursue any substantially gainful occupation), the following applies:

- **Premiums are waived** during the period of disability.
- The insured receives a **disability benefit** in the form of **installments**:
  - Not exceeding **1/20th of the sum insured per year** of disability.
  - Benefits continue for up to **20 years**.
- If the insured dies **before** the total disability benefit equals the sum insured, the **remaining balance** is paid as a **death benefit**.

> **Exclusions**:
- The disability benefit does **not apply** if the insured already receives:
  - A pension under the *Pension Act* or equivalent UK/Allied government pension;
  - Allowances from the Department of Veterans Affairs for war-related disability.

> **Definition of Total and Permanent Disability**:
- If the disability has existed **continuously for at least one year**, it is deemed total and permanent.

> **After Discontinuation of Disability**:
- If the insured ceases to qualify for premium waiver (e.g., due to recovery), the **premiums are based on the reduced insurance amount** (original sum minus disability benefits paid).

---

### **7. Premium Waiver After Age 85**

- **After the insured reaches age 85**, premiums due on or after the anniversary of the contract are **automatically waived**.

> This provision recognizes the financial vulnerability of elderly veterans and protects them from financial hardship.

---

### **8. Premium Payment Structure**

- Premiums may be paid:
  - As a **single premium**;
  - Or as **uniform premiums** during the insured’s lifetime;
  - Or for a fixed period (10, 15, or 20 years);
  - Or until the insured reaches age **65**.

> The actual premium amounts are set in the **Schedule to the Act**.

> *Note: Premiums for those over age 65 are computed on the same basis as younger individuals, with rates provided upon application.*

---

### **9. No Legal or Political Consequences**

- **No person** is disqualified from:
  - Sitting in or voting in the **House of Commons**;
  - Being elected to Parliament;
  - Or facing penalties due to **entering into insurance contracts** or receiving benefits.

> This clause ensures that receiving benefits under the Act does not result in political or legal disenfranchisement.

---

### **10. Unassignability and Protection from Creditors**

- The **insurance money is unassignable**.
- It is **not subject to the claims of creditors** of the insured or the beneficiary.

> This protects beneficiaries from being pursued by creditors and ensures the benefit remains a secure financial asset.

---

### **11. Ministerial Payments (Provision for Unproven Death or Death of Beneficiary)**

This is a key administrative provision allowing the Minister to **make payments in cases where death is unproven**.

#### **When Ministerial Payment Applies**:
- If the **death of the insured** is not proven (per regulations), but the Minister is satisfied (after reasonable efforts) that the person has died or cannot be located.
- Similarly, if the **death of a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary** is not proven, but the Minister believes they died or are unlocatable.
