**Detailed Summary of the *Cape Breton Development Corporation Divestiture Authorization and Dissolution Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Cape Breton Development Corporation Divestiture Authorization and Dissolution Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by Her Majesty in Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It provides the legal framework for the divestiture (sale or disposal) of all or substantially all assets of the **Cape Breton Development Corporation (the "Corporation")**, and ultimately dissolves the Corporation. The Act also addresses legal liabilities, continuity of public works, and the timing of certain provisions.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Authorization to Dispose of Assets**
- **Subsection (1)**: The Corporation is formally authorized to:
  - Sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of **all or substantially all of its assets**.
  - Carry out **all necessary actions or activities** incidental to closing out its affairs.
- This provision effectively ends the Corporation’s operational life by enabling a complete wind-down and transfer of its property and responsibilities.

> **Purpose**: To legally permit the Corporation to exit its operations in a structured, lawful manner, ensuring that its assets are either sold or transferred to other entities (e.g., government or private sector) to realize value and support regional development.

---

#### **2. Exemption from Financial Administration Act Provisions**
- **Subsections 99(2) to (5) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)** do **not apply** to this divestiture authorization.
- These provisions typically govern the rules for the expenditure of public funds and the requirement for financial accountability and public reporting in government bodies.

> **Significance**: This exemption allows the Corporation to proceed with asset disposal and closure without being subject to strict financial disclosure or oversight requirements that would normally apply to public entities. It streamlines the process and reduces administrative burdens during dissolution.

---

#### **3. Legal Liability and Proceedings**
- **Any legal action, suit, or proceeding** arising from:
  - Obligations or liabilities incurred by the Corporation in connection with closing out its affairs,
  - May be brought **against Her Majesty in Canada** (i.e., the Crown) in any court that would have had jurisdiction over the Corporation.
- **Pending legal proceedings** against or involving the Corporation on the day this Act comes into force may be **continued by or against Her Majesty** in the same manner and to the same extent as they could have been continued against the Corporation.

> **Purpose**: 
> - Provides continuity of legal exposure and protection for the Crown, ensuring that claims related to the Corporation’s winding-down phase are not lost due to the Corporation’s dissolution.
> - Ensures that creditors, contractors, or other parties can pursue legal remedies through the Crown, which acts as a legal successor to the Corporation in such matters.
> - Maintains legal certainty and prevents the collapse of ongoing litigation.

---

#### **4. Dissolution of the Corporation**
- The **Corporation is formally dissolved** on a day to be **fixed by order of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet).
- This date is not specified in the Act but will be determined administratively through a formal order.

> **Implication**: The Corporation ceases to exist as a legal entity after this date. All its powers, rights, and obligations end, and its operations are fully concluded.

---

#### **5. Public Works and Undertakings**
- All **works and undertakings** operated or carried on by the Corporation **on or after June 15, 1967**, are **declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada**.
- This declaration gives these assets or facilities a public character and status under federal law.

> **Purpose**:
> - Ensures that key infrastructure (such as energy, transportation, or industrial facilities) previously managed by the Corporation continues to serve the broader public interest.
> - Provides a legal basis for future government management, maintenance, or transfer of these assets to other public institutions or agencies.
> - Reinforces the principle that post-1967 developments are not private property but public assets benefiting Canada.

#### **6. Effective Dates of Amendments (Schedule of Implementation)**
- **Subsections 7(2) and 8(2)** and **Sections 18 to 22** come into force on a day or days to be **fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- These amendments are not immediately effective but are scheduled for activation at a later date, based on administrative discretion.

> **Specific Implementation Dates**:
> - **Subsections 7(2) and 8(2)**: Came into force on **June 3, 2002** (as per SI/2002-92).
> - **Sections 18 to 22**: Came into force on **December 1, 2011** (as per SI/2011-106).

> **Note**: These amendments likely relate to procedural, financial, or operational changes that support the transition or ongoing governance of the Corporation’s legacy assets or functions, even after dissolution.

### **Historical and Contextual Background**
- The Cape Breton Development Corporation was established in the 1960s to promote economic development in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.
