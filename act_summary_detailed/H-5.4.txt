### **Key Provisions and Context**

#### 1. **Historical Background and Purpose**
The Act begins with a series of *whereas* clauses that establish the historical and moral foundation of the legislation:

- The **Holocaust** is defined as a deliberate, state-sponsored campaign of persecution and extermination of European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between **1933 and 1945**.
- It emphasizes that **six million Jewish men, women, and children** were murdered in this genocide.
- The Act also acknowledges that **millions of others** — including people with physical or mental disabilities, individuals based on race, religion, or sexual orientation — were victims of this policy of systematic hatred and violence.
- It underscores that the **memory of the Holocaust must never be forgotten**, as it serves as a powerful warning against the recurrence of such atrocities.
- The Act recognizes that **systemic violence, racism, and hatred continue to exist globally**, reinforcing the need for ongoing vigilance and action.

#### 2. **Commitment of the Canadian Parliament**
The Parliament of Canada is explicitly committed to:

- This day is **officially recognized in Canada** and is observed annually on the **date determined by the Jewish lunar calendar** for Yom ha-Shoah (the "Day of Remembrance").

- The Act ensures that this day is **not a fixed date** but is observed according to the traditional Jewish calendar, preserving cultural and religious significance.

The Act identifies the **educational and reflective purpose** of the day:
- To **reflect on the enduring lessons** of the Holocaust, including the dangers of intolerance, dehumanization, and state-sponsored violence.
