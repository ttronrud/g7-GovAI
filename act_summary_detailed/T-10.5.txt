**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act, No. 2 (1930)**

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The document presented is not a standalone legislative act in the traditional sense but rather a **formal confirmation and legal enactment of a bilateral agreement** between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of the Province of Saskatchewan**, dated **March 20, 1930**, and subsequently confirmed by concurrent legislation on **August 7, 1930**.

This instrument is officially cited as:

> *The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act, No. 2, and The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act, chapter forty-one of the statutes of 1930 (first session)*  
>  
> And collectively, as *The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Acts*

It serves as a **statutory confirmation** of a key intergovernmental agreement concerning the **management, regulation, and division of natural resources** in Saskatchewan, particularly in relation to the **division of powers and responsibilities** between the federal and provincial governments.

### **Key Provisions and Context**

#### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
- The Act confirms and gives legal effect to a prior agreement made on **March 20, 1930**, between:
  - The **Government of the Dominion of Canada**, represented by **Hon. Charles Stewart**, Minister of the Interior.
  - The **Government of the Province of Saskatchewan**, represented by **Hon. James Thomas Milton Anderson**, Premier of Saskatchewan.

- The agreement was intended to **clarify and formalize the relationship** between federal and provincial authorities over natural resources, especially in light of Canada's evolving federal-provincial division of powers under the *Constitution Act, 1867*.

#### **2. Authority to Amend the Agreement**
- Paragraph 26 of the original agreement provided that:
  > "The provisions of the said agreement might be varied by agreement confirmed by concurrent statutes of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the Province."

- This provision grants **legislative authority** to both levels of government to modify the agreement through **joint legislation**, ensuring flexibility and adaptability as circumstances evolve.

#### **3. Adjustment of Effective Dates**
- Originally, the agreement was scheduled to come into force on **August 1, 1930** (as specified in paragraph 28).
- However, the **Province of Saskatchewan requested** that the existing powers and rights of both parties remain **unchanged until October 1, 1930**.
- The parties agreed to this request, and the Act **modifies the effective date** of any provision in the agreement that refers to a date for altering powers or rights.

> **Key Change:**
> - Any reference in the original agreement to a date (such as "the 1st day of August, 1930") that triggers a change in powers or rights is **reinterpreted** to mean:
>   > **"The 1st day of October, 1930"**

- This adjustment ensures **provincial stability and continuity** in governance during the transition period, preventing abrupt changes in jurisdiction or authority over natural resources.

#### **4. Legislative Recommendations**
- The Act mandates that:
  - The **Government of Canada** will recommend legislation to **Parliament**.
  - The **Government of Saskatchewan** will recommend legislation to its **Legislature**.
- These recommendations will be made to **implement and give effect** to the terms of the agreement.

- This reflects a **collaborative legislative process**, where both governments are responsible for enacting laws that operationalize the agreement’s provisions.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Clarification of Federal-Provincial Jurisdiction**
   - The Act helps define the **division of authority** over natural resources (such as minerals, forests, water, and land) between federal and provincial governments.
   - It establishes a **framework for cooperation**, avoiding overlapping or conflicting regulations.

2. **Stability During Transition**
   - By extending the effective date of changes from August 1 to October 1, the Act provides **a grace period** during which existing administrative practices and legal rights remain intact.

3. **Inter-Governmental Cooperation Model**
   - This is a foundational example of **intergovernmental cooperation** in Canada, where federal and provincial governments negotiate and legislate jointly on shared resources.

4. **Historical Context**
   - This agreement occurred during a period of significant development in Canada’s resource sector and growing federal-provincial tensions over jurisdiction.
   - It reflects the **early institutionalization of resource governance** in Western Canada, particularly in the Prairie provinces.

### **Conclusion**

The **Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act, No. 2 (1930)** is not a standalone law that creates new rights or obligations, but rather a **statutory confirmation** of a bilateral agreement between Canada and Saskatchewan. Its primary function is to:

- **Formally ratify** the terms of a resource governance agreement,
- **Adjust the effective date** of key provisions to provide stability (from August 1 to October 1, 1930),
- **Establish a process** for both governments to recommend and pass legislation to implement the agreement.

This Act represents a **pioneering moment in Canadian federal-provincial relations**, particularly in the area of natural resource management, and laid the groundwork for future intergovernmental frameworks in resource governance across Canada.

**Note**: While the Act is titled "The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act, No. 2," it is important to clarify that it is a **confirmation of an agreement**, not a new statute creating broad regulatory powers. The actual regulatory framework would be developed through subsequent legislation recommended by the two governments.
