---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The Act defines several key terms used throughout:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the *Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Peru*, signed on **May 29, 2008**. This is the central treaty governing trade relations between the two countries.

- **Federal Law**: Encompasses any part of an Act of Parliament or any regulation, order, or instrument issued by the federal government in exercise of powers granted by an Act of Parliament. This ensures that all federal legislation related to the FTA is covered under this Act.

- **Joint Commission**: The body established under **Article 2001 of the Agreement** to oversee implementation, resolve disputes, and ensure compliance with the FTA. It serves as a key mechanism for bilateral cooperation.

- **Minister**: Refers specifically to the **Minister for International Trade**, who acts as Canada’s principal representative in the Joint Commission and other related bodies.

#### **3. Interpretation Principles**
To ensure consistency and clarity:
- **Interpretation in Accordance with the Agreement**: This Act and any federal law implementing the Agreement or related agreements must be interpreted in a manner **consistent with the text and intent** of the Agreement or related agreement.

- **No private proceedings** can be initiated against the Government of Canada or under the Agreement or related agreements **without written consent** from the **Attorney General of Canada**, including the reasons for that consent.
- This provision protects the Government from being subjected to litigation over trade obligations, which are intended to be governed through **bilateral mechanisms**, not individual legal claims.

> **Exception**: This rule is subject to certain conditions:
> - **Section B of Chapter Eight** of the Agreement and

> — These exceptions allow for limited private enforcement in specific labor-related matters.
