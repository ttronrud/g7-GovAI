### **Detailed Summary of the Interest Act (as amended and restructured)**

The **Interest Act** is a legislative framework that governs the **maximum allowable rate of interest** on loans and financial agreements in Canada, with specific provisions tailored to **mortgages on real property** and **hypothecs on immovables**. The Act establishes both **flexibility for general contracts** and **strict limits on interest rates** in certain high-risk or long-term secured transactions, particularly those involving real estate.

This summary breaks down the key provisions of the Act, including its structure, substantive rules, exceptions, and amendments, particularly focusing on the **revisions introduced in 1992 and subsequent regulatory updates**.

---

## 🔹 **1. General Principle: Freedom to Agree on Interest Rates (Section 1)**

> *"Except as otherwise provided by this Act or any other Act of Parliament, any person may stipulate for, allow and exact, on any contract or agreement whatever, any rate of interest or discount that is agreed on."*

- **Key Point**: The Act begins with a broad principle — parties are free to agree upon any interest rate or discount in any contract, **unless restricted by this Act or another law**.
- This reflects the principle of **contractual freedom**, allowing flexibility in commercial and personal lending agreements.
- However, this freedom is **not absolute** — it is subject to **specific limitations** introduced in later sections.

---

## 🔹 **2. Default Interest Rate (Section 4 – Original Version)**

> *"Whenever any interest is payable by the agreement of parties or by law, and no rate is fixed by the agreement or by law, the rate of interest shall be five per cent per annum."*

- **Default Rate**: If no interest rate is specified in a contract or by law, the **default interest rate is 5% per annum**.
- Applies to all contracts unless otherwise governed by a specific exception (e.g., real estate mortgages).

> ⚠️ **Note**: This provision was **replaced in 1992** (see below), reflecting a shift from a fixed default rate to a **regulatory-based rate**.

---

## 🔹 **3. Limitation on Daily/Periodic Interest Rates (Section 5 – Original Version)**

> *"Except as to mortgages on real property or hypothecs on immovables, whenever any interest is made payable at a rate or percentage per day, week, month, or for any period less than a year, no interest exceeding five per cent per annum shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable... unless the contract contains an express statement of the yearly rate equivalent."*

- **Core Limitation**: For most contracts (excluding real estate mortgages), **interest cannot exceed 5% per year**, even if the contract states a daily or weekly rate.
- **Requirement**: Any such periodic rate must be accompanied by an **explicit statement of the equivalent annual rate**.
- Purpose: Prevents **unfairly high interest charges** disguised as short-term rates (e.g., "1% per month" = 12% annually — which exceeds the 5% cap).

> ✅ Example: A loan with 1% per month would be invalid unless it clearly states that the **annual rate is 12%**, which exceeds the 5% cap — thus, the interest would be capped at **5% per annum**.

> ❌ Exception: **Mortgages on real property or hypothecs on immovables** are **exempt** from this restriction — meaning they can have higher interest rates under certain conditions.

---

## 🔹 **4. Interest on Sinking Fund or Blended Payment Plans (Section 6 – Original Version)**

> *"Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage on real property or hypothec on immovables is made payable on a sinking fund plan, blended plan, or involving stipulated repayments, no interest shall be chargeable unless the mortgage or hypothec contains a statement showing the principal amount and the yearly rate of interest (calculated yearly or half-yearly), not in advance."*

- **Applies only to secured loans** (mortgages/hypothecs on real property).
- **Prohibits interest** on the principal unless a **clear, written statement** of:
  - The **principal amount**,
  - The **annual interest rate** (calculated yearly or half-yearly),
  - And that rate is **not in advance** (i.e., not precomputed as a lump sum),
  is included in the mortgage or hypothec.

> ⚠️ If the stated rate is **lower** than what would otherwise be calculated under other terms, **that lower rate prevails**.

> ✅ Purpose: Ensures **transparency and fairness** in complex repayment plans (e.g., sinking funds or blended amortization), preventing hidden or excessive interest.

---

## 🔹 **5. Prohibition of Excessive Penalties or Fines (Section 7)**

> *"No fine, penalty or rate of interest shall be stipulated for, taken, reserved or exacted on any arrears of principal or interest secured by mortgage on real property or hypothec on immovables that has the effect of increasing the charge on the arrears beyond the rate of interest payable on principal money not in arrears."*

- **No punitive interest** on overdue payments (arrears) can exceed the rate of interest on **current (non-arrears) principal**.
- Prevents **interest stacking** or **excessive penalties** that could effectively increase the cost of borrowing beyond what is allowed on the original loan.

> ✅ Example: If the original loan has 5% interest, a penalty on overdue interest cannot be 10% — it must not exceed 5%.

> ✅ Exception: A party **may agree to pay interest on arrears** at a rate **not greater than** the rate on non-arrears principal — so **interest on overdue interest or principal is allowed**, but capped.

---

## 🔹 **6. Recovery of Overpaid Interest or Penalties (Section 8)**

> *"If any sum is paid on account of any interest, fine or penalty not chargeable, payable or recoverable under sections 6, 7 or 8, the sum may be recovered back or deducted from any other interest, fine or penalty chargeable, payable or recoverable on the principal."*

- Allows **recoupment** of overpayments.
- If someone pays interest or a penalty that is **not legally valid or recoverable**, they can **recover that amount** from future interest or penalties.
- Ensures **financial fairness** and prevents unjust enrichment.

---

## 🔹 **7. Time-Limited Interest After Five-Year Delay (Section 9)**

> *"Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage on real property or hypothec on immovables is not payable until more than five years after the date of the mortgage or hypothec, then, if at any time after the expiration of five years, a person liable to pay or entitled to pay to redeem the mortgage or extinguish the hypothec tenders or pays the amount due... together with three months' interest in lieu of notice, no further interest shall be chargeable after that payment."*

- **Post-5-year grace period**: If the loan is not due for more than 5 years, and after that time a party pays the full amount due (principal + interest), **no further interest** is allowed.
- The payment must include **three months' interest in lieu of notice** — a form of notice that avoids the need for formal legal process.
- Prevents **unlimited interest accumulation** on long-term loans.

> ✅ Purpose: Protects borrowers from **unfairly long-term interest burdens** on delayed repayment.

---

## 🔹 **8. Exemptions from the Above Rules (Section 9 – Exceptions)**

> *"Subsection (1) does not apply to:*
> - *Any mortgage on real property or hypothec on immovables given by a joint stock company or any other corporation, nor to any debenture issued by them for which security has been given by way of mortgage or hypothec on real property or immovables; or*
> - *Any prescribed mortgage or prescribed hypothec given by a prescribed entity, nor to any prescribed debenture issued by it for which security has been given by way of mortgage or hypothec on real property or immovables."*

- **Key Exemption**: The above rules (especially those limiting interest rates and preventing excessive penalties) **do not apply** to:
  - **Corporate mortgages/debentures** (e.g., loans from banks to companies),
  - **Prescribed mortgages or debentures** — those defined by **regulation** (e.g., government or specific financial instruments).

> 🔍 This allows **greater flexibility** in corporate financing and investment instruments.

> 📌 The **Governor in Council** may, by **regulation**, prescribe:
> - Which **entities** are "prescribed" (e.g., specific banks, public institutions),
> - What types of **mortgages/hypothecs or debentures** are considered "prescribed".

> ⚠️ This power enables **tailored interest rules** for specific financial instruments or institutions.

## 🔹 **9. Replacement of Key Provisions (Post-1992 Amendments)**

The Act was **revised in 1992** and further updated to align with modern financial practices and regulatory oversight.

### ➤ **Replacement of Section 4 (Default Rate)**

> *"The Governor in Council may make regulations for the purposes of subsection (1)."*

- The **original 5% default rate** is **replaced** by a **regulatory rate**.
