## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation and Offshore Renewable Energy Management Act**

### 📌 **1. Purpose and Context**
This Act serves as the **legal framework for implementing the Atlantic Accord** between the Government of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), specifically concerning **offshore petroleum resource management and revenue sharing**. It establishes a new regulatory body and sets out the governance, operational, and cooperative principles governing activities in the **offshore area** — including both traditional petroleum and emerging offshore renewable energy projects.

Importantly, while the Atlantic Accord originally focused on **petroleum**, this Act **explicitly excludes it from applying to offshore renewable energy resources**, creating a distinct legal regime for clean energy development.
