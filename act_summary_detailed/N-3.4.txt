### **Detailed Summary of the National Battlefields Act (1908)**

The **National Battlefields Act, 1908**, enacted on **July 15, 1908**, is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to establish and fund the preservation, restoration, and public commemoration of key historic battlefields in Quebec—particularly those associated with the **French and British conflicts** in North America, most notably the **Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759)** and the **Battle of Ste. Foye (1760)**.

This Act reflects a public interest in safeguarding Canada’s military heritage and transforming these historically significant sites into a **national park** that serves both educational and commemorative purposes.
