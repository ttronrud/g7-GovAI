**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act* (the "Act") is a foundational piece of federal legislation enacted by Parliament to give legal effect to the **Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)**, which was signed in 2017 and entered into by the federal government and the governments of all 10 provinces and three territories (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut).

This Act serves as the **legal framework** through which the CFTA is implemented in Canada, ensuring that the agreement’s provisions—particularly those related to the free movement of persons, goods, services, and investments—are effectively enforced, interpreted, and administered within Canadian law.

---

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

#### **1. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Agreement**: Refers to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), as originally signed in 2017 and as amended from time to time.
- **Minister**: The individual designated by the Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet) to act as the Minister responsible for implementing provisions of the Act. This role is established under Section 8.

> *Purpose*: These definitions provide clarity and consistency in interpreting the Act and the Agreement.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Act**
> *"The purpose of this Act is to implement the Agreement."*

This is the central objective. The Act enables the federal government to translate the CFTA’s commitments into enforceable domestic laws, policies, and administrative procedures.

---

#### **3. Legal Authority and Binding Nature**
> *"This Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada."*

- The Act has **full legal force** and applies to all levels of government in Canada.
- It establishes the legal basis for enforcing the CFTA across Canada.

---

#### **4. Limitation on Judicial Enforcement (Section 12 and 14)**
> *"There is no cause of action and no proceedings of any kind are to be taken, without the consent of the Attorney General of Canada, to enforce or determine any right or obligation that is claimed or arises solely under or by virtue of section 12 or 14 or an order made under section 12."*

- This provision **prevents private individuals or entities from bringing lawsuits** directly against the federal government or provinces based on rights or obligations arising solely under **Section 12 or 14** of the CFTA or any orders made under those sections.
- It also applies to **Chapter Ten** of the CFTA (which deals with dispute resolution, penalties, and retaliatory measures), meaning that **no legal action can be initiated without the Attorney General’s consent**.

> *Rationale*: This protects the integrity of the Agreement’s dispute settlement mechanisms and ensures that enforcement remains under centralized, government-controlled authority to avoid judicial overreach or inconsistent interpretations.

---

#### **5. Parliamentary Authority to Enact Implementing Legislation**
> *"For greater certainty, nothing in this Act, by specific mention or omission, limits in any manner the right of Parliament to enact legislation to implement any provision of the Agreement or fulfil any of the obligations of the Government of Canada under the Agreement."*

- This clause **explicitly preserves Parliament’s authority** to pass additional laws as needed to implement the CFTA.
- It ensures that the federal government is not constrained by the scope of this Act alone and can respond flexibly to evolving economic, trade, or regulatory needs.

> *Significance*: This provides **flexibility and adaptability** in implementing the CFTA over time.

---

#### **6. Approval of the Agreement**
> *"The Agreement is approved."*

- A formal declaration that the CFTA has been **officially ratified and approved** by the Canadian Parliament.
- This step is critical for international obligations and domestic legal recognition.

---

#### **7. Appointment of a Minister (Section 8)**
> *"The Governor in Council may, by order, designate any member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada as the Minister for the purposes of any provision of this Act."*

- Allows the federal Cabinet to **assign responsibility** for overseeing CFTA implementation.
- Ensures that there is a designated point of contact and accountability for enforcement, policy coordination, and intergovernmental relations.

---

#### **8. Enforcement of Monetary Penalties and Tariff Costs (Chapter Ten of the Agreement)**
> *"An order to pay a monetary penalty or tariff costs made under Chapter Ten of the Agreement may, for the purpose of its enforcement only, be made an order of the Federal Court."*

- **Key mechanism**: If a party (e.g., a province or a Canadian company) is found in breach of the CFTA and a penalty or tariff cost is imposed under Chapter Ten (which governs enforcement and retaliation), that order can be **formally recognized as a Federal Court order**.

- **Process**:
  1. The party to the Agreement (or the person in favour of whom the order is made) must **file a certified copy** of the order with the Registry of the Federal Court.
  2. Upon filing, the order **automatically becomes a binding order of the Federal Court**.

- **Enforceability**:
  - The order is enforceable **in the same way as any other Federal Court order**.
  - It is **final and binding** and **not subject to appeal**.

> *Purpose*: This ensures that penalties under the CFTA are **enforceable in a court of law**, providing legal certainty and reducing the risk of non-compliance.

> *Limitation*: This enforcement power is **limited to the purpose of enforcing the penalty**—it does not create a general right of action.

---

#### **9. Suspension of Benefits or Retaliatory Measures (Article 1013 of the Agreement)**
> *"For the purpose of suspending benefits of equivalent effect or imposing retaliatory measures of equivalent effect under Article 1013 of the Agreement, the Governor in Council may, by order, do any one or more of the following:"*

- The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may:
  - **Suspend rights or privileges** granted by the federal government to a province under the CFTA or federal law.
  - **Modify or suspend the application** of any federal law with respect to a province.

> **Definition of "federal law"**: Includes any Act of Parliament, regulation, order, or instrument made under a federal law.

> **Conditions and Limitations**:
  - The order must comply with **Chapter Ten of the CFTA**, particularly:
    - **Article 1004.8**: Requirements for standing (i.e., who can challenge or be affected by the order).
    - **Articles 1013.3, 1013.4, and 1013.10**: Specific conditions, limitations, and procedural safeguards governing retaliatory actions.

> *Rationale*: This allows the federal government to **respond to non-compliance** by a province with targeted, proportionate actions—such as suspending funding or regulatory benefits—while ensuring that such actions are **proportionate, transparent, and subject to legal safeguards**.

> *Note*: This power is **not unlimited** and is strictly governed by the CFTA’s rules on retaliation and dispute resolution.

#### **10. Appointment of a Minister to the Committee on Internal Trade**
> *"The Governor in Council may appoint a Minister to be a representative on the Committee on Internal Trade continued under Article 1100 of the Agreement."*

- The Committee on Internal Trade (CIT) is a key body established under the CFTA to promote and coordinate internal trade across Canada.
- This provision ensures that **a senior federal official (a Minister)** participates in the CIT, providing government-level oversight and strategic direction.

---

#### **11. Funding of the Internal Trade Secretariat**
> *"The Government of Canada must pay its portion of the Internal Trade Secretariat’s annual operating budget referred to in Article 1102.3 of the Agreement."*

- The Internal Trade Secretariat is a central body responsible for:
  - Monitoring and reporting on internal trade performance.
  - Supporting policy development and implementation.
  - Facilitating cooperation between provinces and federal government.

- This provision **mandates federal financial contribution** to the Secretariat, ensuring that it has the resources to carry out its mandate.

#### **12. Appointment to Rosters (Article 1005.2)**
> *"The Governor in Council may appoint any person who meets the requirements set out in Annex 1005.2 of the Agreement to be on the rosters referred to in Article 1005.2 of the Agreement."*

- These **rosters** likely include lists of experts, officials, or representatives who may be called upon to:
  - Participate in working groups.
  - Serve as advisors or observers.
  - Provide technical or policy input.

- The appointments are made based on **specific criteria outlined in Annex 1005.2**, ensuring that only qualified individuals are selected.

---

#### **13. Appointment of Representatives to Committees and Working Groups**
> *"The Minister may appoint any person to be a representative of Canada on any committee or working group referred to in the Agreement, other than the Committee on Internal Trade continued under Article 1100 of the Agreement."*

- Allows the Minister to **assign Canadian representatives** to various working groups or technical committees established under the CFTA.
- **Excludes** the Committee on Internal Trade, which is covered separately under Section 10.

> *Purpose*: Promotes active participation of Canada in intergovernmental coordination and policy
