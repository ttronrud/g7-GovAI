Below is a **detailed, organized summary** of each act, including its purpose, key features, and context:

### 📌 General Purpose of the Acts

All of these acts serve the **same fundamental purpose**: to implement bilateral or multilateral tax conventions between Canada and other countries to prevent double taxation of income and to provide clarity on tax obligations, tax residency, source of income, and tax treatment of specific types of income (e.g., employment, dividends, capital gains, pensions).

These acts are typically passed by the Canadian Parliament to give domestic legal effect to international agreements negotiated between Canada and a foreign country. They establish rules that align with the terms of the convention or agreement and are administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
