### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Hong Kong Tax Agreement Act, 2013**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Citation**
- The Act is titled the **Canada–Hong Kong Tax Agreement Act, 2013**.
- It provides the legal framework in Canada for implementing the **Canada–Hong Kong Tax Agreement**, which aims to:
  - Avoid **double taxation** of income.
  - Prevent **fiscal evasion** related to income taxation.
- The Agreement is formally established in **Schedule 1**, and any amendments are made through the **Protocol** in **Schedule 2**.

---

#### **2. Legal Force and Precedence**
- The Agreement is **approved and has full legal force in Canada** during the period it is in force as stipulated by its own terms.
- **In case of conflict** between:
  - This Act or the Agreement and any other Canadian law,
  - The Agreement and the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*,
  
  → The provisions of **this Act and the Agreement prevail** to the extent of inconsistency.
- However, if there is a conflict between the Agreement and the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*, **that Act prevails**.

> This establishes a hierarchy: the Agreement and this Act take priority over other domestic tax laws, but the Interpretation Act supersedes the Agreement where it directly conflicts.

---

#### **3. Definition of "Country" or "State"**
- For the purposes of applying Canadian tax laws (Income Tax Act, Interpretation Act, Application Rules, Regulations), references to a **"country" or "state"** are interpreted **broadly** to include:
  - The **Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)** of the People’s Republic of China.
- This ensures that tax rules under the Agreement apply consistently to Hong Kong, despite its status as a SAR under Chinese sovereignty.

---

#### **4. Regulatory Authority**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** may issue **regulations** necessary to:
  - Implement the Agreement.
  - Give effect to its provisions.
- The **Minister of Finance** must publish in the *Canada Gazette*:
  - The date the Agreement **enters into force**.
  - The date it **ceases to have effect**.
- Publication must occur within **60 days** of the Agreement’s entry into or termination from force.

> This ensures transparency and public awareness of the Agreement’s operational timeline.

---

#### **5. Background and Objectives of the Agreement**
The Agreement was concluded by:
- The Government of Canada.
- The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).

It is based on **Article 151 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong**, which recognizes the right of Hong Kong to conclude international tax agreements.

**Objective**: To avoid double taxation and prevent tax avoidance regarding income taxes.

---

#### **6. Scope of Application**
- The Agreement applies to **residents of either or both Parties** (Canada and HKSAR).
- Applies to:
  - **Existing taxes**:
    - In HKSAR: Taxes under the **Inland Revenue Ordinance**.
    - In Canada: Taxes under the **Income Tax Act**.
  - **Any new or substantially similar taxes** introduced **after the signing date** of the Agreement.
- The **competent authorities** of both Parties must **notify each other** of significant changes in tax laws.

> Ensures ongoing alignment and adaptability to evolving tax regimes.

#### **8. Residency Rules**
Residency determines which country has taxing rights over income.

##### **A. Hong Kong Residency**
- An individual is a resident if:
  1. They **ordinarily reside** in HKSAR.
  2. They stay in HKSAR for **over 180 days in a year of assessment** or **over 300 days in two consecutive years** (one being the relevant year).
  3. A **company** incorporated in HKSAR, or outside HKSAR but **centrally managed and controlled** in HKSAR.
  4. Any other person constituted under HKSAR law, or outside HKSAR but centrally managed and controlled in HKSAR.
  5. The **Government of HKSAR**.

##### **B. Canadian Residency**
- A person is a resident if they are liable to tax in Canada due to:
  - Domicile, residence, place of management, place of incorporation, or similar criteria.
- Includes:
  - The Government of Canada.
  - Political subdivisions or local authorities.
  - Agencies or instrumentalities of the government.
- **Exclusion**: A person not liable to tax in Canada **only on income from sources within Canada**.

##### **C. Double Residency – Resolution Rules**
If an individual is a resident of both Canada and HKSAR, residency is determined by the **"centre of vital interests"** principle:

1. **Permanent home**:
   - If the individual has a permanent home in one Party → deemed resident only in that Party.
   - If in both → resident in the Party where personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests).

2. **No permanent home**:
   - Resident in the Party where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **No habitual abode**:
   - Resident in the Party where the individual has **right of abode** (HKSAR) or **nationality** (Canada).

4. **Ambiguous cases**:
   - If the individual has:
     - Right of abode in HKSAR and is a Canadian national → mutual agreement required.
     - No right of abode in HKSAR and not a Canadian national → mutual agreement required.

> This ensures a fair and principled method for resolving dual residency, prioritizing personal ties and economic activity.

##### **D. Non-Individual Entities**
If a **company** (not an individual) is a resident of both Parties:
- The competent authorities must **resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.
- In the absence of agreement, the company **cannot claim tax relief or exemptions** under the Agreement.

> Prevents ambiguity and ensures tax compliance in corporate cases.

#### **9. Permanent Establishment (PE)**
A **permanent establishment** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

##### **Included in PE**:
- Place of management.
- Branch, office, factory, workshop.
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other natural resource exploration/extraction site.
- Building site, construction, assembly, installation project, or supervisory activities — **only if lasting more than 6 months**.

##### **Excluded from PE**:
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of stock for **storage, display, or delivery**.
- Maintenance of stock solely for **processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place of business for **purchasing goods or collecting information**.
- Fixed place of business for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**.
- Any combination of above — if overall activity is **preparatory or auxiliary**.

> These exclusions prevent over-taxation of routine or ancillary operations.

##### **Exception: Authorized Representatives**
- If a person (not an independent agent) has **authority to conclude contracts** on behalf of an enterprise in a Party:
  - The enterprise is deemed to have a **permanent establishment** in that Party for activities conducted by that person.
  - **Exception**: If such activities are limited to those excluded above (e.g., purchasing, information gathering), then no PE is created.

> Balances operational flexibility with tax accountability.

##### **Exclusion of Agents**
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE simply because it uses:
  - Brokers, general commission agents, or independent agents.
- This applies **unless** the agent is acting outside ordinary business practices.

> Protects legitimate business intermediaries from being treated as permanent establishments.

##### **No PE due to Control**
- The fact that one company controls or is controlled by another (even if it operates in the other Party) **does not** create a PE.

> Prevents tax avoidance through corporate control.

#### **10. Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**
- Income from **immovable property** (including agriculture/forestry) located in the other Party may be taxed in that other Party.
- **Imm
