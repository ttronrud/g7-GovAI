### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Water Act**

The **Canada Water Act** is a foundational piece of federal legislation enacted to address the growing challenges related to the **management, conservation, and protection of Canada’s water resources**. It establishes a comprehensive legal framework for **water quality management**, emphasizing **intergovernmental cooperation**, **scientific research**, **pollution control**, and **sustainable utilization** of water resources across Canada. The Act responds to both the increasing demand on water supplies and the escalating threat of water pollution to public health, ecosystems, and economic prosperity.

## **I. Background and Purpose (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with three key "whereas" clauses that establish the rationale and urgency behind its enactment:

1. **Growing Demand on Water Resources**  
   - Canada's water demands are rising rapidly due to population growth, industrial development, agriculture, and climate change.
   - There is an urgent need for better knowledge about the **nature, extent, distribution**, and **future use** of water resources.
   - The Act mandates research and planning to ensure the **optimum use** of water for all Canadians.

2. **Rising Threat of Water Pollution**  
   - Water pollution is a serious and rapidly worsening problem affecting human health, environmental quality, and ecosystem integrity.
   - It is declared a **matter of urgent national concern**, necessitating immediate action to establish **effective water quality management systems** in the most affected areas.

3. **Need for Federal-Provincial Collaboration**  
   - Parliament recognizes that water resource management is a shared responsibility between the **federal government** and **provincial governments**.
   - The Act establishes a framework for **cooperative programs** in research, planning, conservation, development, and utilization of water resources.

## **III. Core Provisions and Key Functions**

### **1. Intergovernmental Coordination and Committees (Section 4)**

To ensure effective policy development and implementation, the **Minister of the Environment** (Minister) may, with **Governor in Council (GiC) approval**, enter into arrangements with one or more provincial governments to establish:

- **Intergovernmental committees or bodies** that:
  - Maintain **ongoing consultation** on water resource matters.
  - Advise on **priorities for research, planning, conservation, development, and utilization**.
  - Assist in **formulating water policies and programs**.
  - Facilitate **coordination and implementation** of those programs.

This promotes transparency, shared responsibility, and collaborative decision-making across jurisdictions.

---

### **2. Water Quality Management Programs (Section 5)**

The Minister may, with GiC approval, enter into **agreements with provincial governments** for programs in areas where there is a **significant national interest** in water resource management. These programs may include:

- Establishing and maintaining **inventories** of waters.
- Collecting, processing, and providing data on **water quality, quantity, distribution, and use**.
- Conducting **research** on water resources.
- Formulating **comprehensive water resource management plans** that:
  - Consider all reasonable alternatives.
  - Incorporate public input through **public hearings**.
  - Include detailed **cost estimates** and **benefit projections**.
- Designing projects for **efficient conservation, development, and utilization**.
- Implementing the plans and projects.

These programs may be carried out jointly by federal and provincial governments, with clear division of responsibilities, costs, and timelines.

> **Key Requirement**: The Minister must have made **reasonable efforts** to reach an agreement with provincial governments before initiating a program. If those efforts fail, the GiC may approve the program.

> **Cost Allocation**: Agreements must specify:
- Who pays for each part of the program (Minister vs. provincial governments).
- When payments are due.
- Supply of labor, land, and materials.
- Compensation for losses caused by the program.
- Terms of any loans or grants.
- Responsibilities for project operations and maintenance.
- Revenue sharing.

> **Reporting Obligations**: The program body must submit:

### **3. Designation of Water Quality Management Areas (Section 11)**

The Minister may, with GiC approval, enter into agreements to designate specific waters as **Water Quality Management Areas (WQMA)** — areas where water quality is a matter of national concern.

These areas may include:
- Federal waters.
- Non-federal waters where water quality is a matter of **urgent national concern**.

Each such designation includes:
- A clear **program for water quality management**.
- Authorization for the Minister to **procure or name a water quality management agency** (a non-share capital corporation) to plan and implement programs under Section 15.

The agreement must specify:
- Responsibilities of the Minister and provincial governments.
- Capital cost sharing.
- Funding for agency establishment and operations.
- Supply of labor, land, materials.
