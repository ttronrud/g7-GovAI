## **3. Scope and Application of the CISG in Canada**

### **3.1 When Does the CISG Apply?**
- The CISG applies to **sales of goods** between parties whose **places of business are in different countries**:
  - If both countries are **Contracting States** to the CISG; or
  - If private international law leads to the application of the law of a **Contracting State**.

> This means the CISG governs international trade where parties are from different countries, regardless of nationality or legal system.

### **3.2 Disregard of Place of Business**
- The fact that parties have different places of business **does not matter** if:
  - It is not evident from the contract, or
  - It is not disclosed during negotiations or at the time of contract formation.

> This promotes flexibility and avoids arbitrary jurisdictional barriers.

### **3.3 Exclusions from Application**
The CISG **does not apply** to:
- Sales for **personal, family, or household use** (unless the seller did not know or should not have known of such use).
- Sales by **auction**.
- Sales **by execution or legal authority**.
- Sales of:
  - Stocks, shares, investment securities, negotiable instruments, or money.
  - Ships, vessels, hovercraft, or aircraft.
  - Electricity.
- Contracts where the **preponderant obligation** of the seller is to provide **labor or services**, not goods.

> These exclusions protect areas of law where the CISG is not designed to operate.

### **3.4 Scope of Coverage**
The CISG governs:
- The **formation** of a contract of sale.
- The **rights and obligations** of the seller and buyer arising from the contract.

> It **does not cover**:
- The **validity** of the contract or its terms.
- The **effect on property rights** in goods.
- **Liability for death or personal injury** caused by the goods.

---

## **4. Parties’ Right to Exclude or Modify the CISG**

- Parties may **exclude** the application of the CISG **in accordance with its terms**.
- Specifically, they can include a clause in the contract stating that **another law applies**.
- However, **Article 12 of the CISG** limits this right — parties cannot derogate from or vary the effect of certain core provisions (e.g., those relating to formation of contract, delivery, or remedies).

> This ensures that fundamental principles of fairness and uniformity in international trade are preserved.

---

## **5. Interpretation and Application of the CISG**

### **5.1 Interpretation Principles**
- The CISG is interpreted with due regard to:
  - Its **international character**.
  - The need for **uniformity** in application.
  - The **observance of good faith** in international trade.

> This ensures consistent, fair, and predictable outcomes across jurisdictions.

### **5.2 Resolving Ambiguities**
- If a matter is not settled in the Convention:
  - It is resolved based on **general principles** underlying the Convention.
  - If no such principles exist, it is governed by **private international law** (conflict of laws).

### **5.3 Intent and Understanding**
- Statements and conduct of a party are interpreted based on:
  - The **intent** of the party (if known or apparent to the other party).
  - If intent is unclear, the interpretation is based on what a **reasonable person of the same type** would have understood in similar circumstances.

> This includes consideration of:
  - Negotiations.
  - Established practices.
  - Usages in the relevant trade.
  - Subsequent conduct.

### **5.4 Implied Usages**
- Unless otherwise agreed, parties are **impliedly bound** by:
  - A **usage of trade** known and widely observed in the relevant industry.
  - Practices established between the parties.

> This ensures that commercial expectations are respected, even if not explicitly stated.

---

## **6. Determination of Place of Business**

- If a party has **multiple places of business**, the relevant one is the one with the **closest relationship** to the contract and its performance.
- If a party has **no place of business**, reference is made to their **habitual residence**.

> This ensures clarity in determining jurisdiction and contractual obligations.

---

## **7. Form of Contracts**

- A contract of sale **does not need to be in writing**.
- It may be formed orally or by conduct.
- It may be proved by **any means**, including witnesses.

> This aligns with the principle of freedom of contract.

### **Exception – Writing Requirements**
- In cases where a party has a place of business in a **Contracting State that has declared under Article 96** of the CISG (a state that has opted out of certain provisions), **the requirement for written form applies**:
  - Offers, acceptances, or modifications **must be in writing**.
  - This provision **cannot be derogated from** by the parties.

> This is a safeguard against ambiguity in high-risk international transactions.

> **Note**: "Writing" includes telegrams and telex messages.

## **8. Formation of a Contract: Offers and Acceptances**

### **8.1 What Constitutes an Offer**
- An offer is a **sufficiently definite** statement that:
  - Identifies the **goods**.
  - Fixes or provides for determining the **quantity and price**.
- An offer is **effective when it reaches the offeree**.

> An offer may be **withdrawn** if the withdrawal reaches the offeree **before or at the same time** as the offer.

### **8.2 Revocation of Offers**
- An offer **can be revoked** if:
  - The revocation reaches the offeree **before** the offeree sends an acceptance.
- However, it **cannot be revoked** if:
  - It is **irrevocable** (e.g., fixed time for acceptance).
  - The offeree **reasonably relied** on the offer being irrevocable.

### **8.3 Termination of Offers**
- An offer is **terminated** when a **rejection** reaches the offeror.

### **8.4 Acceptance**
- Acceptance is a **clear indication of assent** to the offer.
- **Silence or inactivity does not constitute acceptance**.
- Acceptance becomes effective when it **reaches the offeror**.
- If no time is fixed, it must be within a **reasonable time**, considering:
  - The nature of the transaction.
  - The speed of communication.

> **Exception**: If the parties have established a practice (e.g., delivery of goods = acceptance), acceptance is effective when the act is performed (e.g., dispatch of goods or payment), **provided it is within the time limit**.

### **8.5 Counter-Offer vs. Acceptance with Modifications**
- A reply with **additions, limitations, or modifications** is a **rejection** and constitutes a **counter-offer**.
- However, if the modifications are **not material** (e.g., not affecting price, quality, delivery, or dispute settlement), and the offeror **does not object within a reasonable time**, the contract is formed with the **offer’s terms plus the modifications**.

> Material changes include:
> - Price
> - Payment terms
> - Quality or quantity of goods
> - Delivery time/place
> - Liability or dispute resolution

### **8.6 Time for Acceptance**
- Time for acceptance starts:
  - From the **date the telegram is handed in** or **date shown on the letter** (if no date, from envelope date).
  - From the **moment the offer reaches the offeree** (in case of phone, telex, or instant communication).
- **Official holidays or non-business days are included** in the period.
- If acceptance is **late** and cannot be delivered on the last day due to holiday, the period is **extended to the next business day**.
- A late acceptance is **effective
