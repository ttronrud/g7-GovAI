### 🔹 **Role and Powers of the Corporation (CMHC)**

The Corporation (CMHC) has broad powers under the Act to support the housing market:

#### 1. **Designation of Approved Lenders**
- The Corporation may **designate any person** (e.g., banks, credit unions, non-profits) as an **approved lender**.
- Designations are valid for a period specified by the Corporation.
- The Corporation may impose **conditions, restrictions, or fees** on approved lenders.
- It may **suspend or cancel** a designation at any time.

> This allows CMHC to maintain oversight and ensure that lenders adhere to standards of affordability, transparency, and fairness.

#### 2. **Insurance of Housing Loans**
- The Corporation may **insure housing loans** to protect lenders from borrower default.
- Insurance does **not release borrowers from their obligations** — default still occurs, and borrowers remain liable.
- The **Minister of Finance**, after consulting the **Governor of the Bank of Canada** and the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions**, may create **regulations** defining:
  - Classes of housing loans eligible for insurance.
  - Criteria (e.g., loan-to-value ratio, borrower income, credit history) required for insurance eligibility.
- These regulations apply to **existing loans** if they involve a guarantee of payment.

> This mechanism reduces lender risk, encourages lending to underserved or high-risk borrowers, and promotes financial inclusion.

#### 3. **Guarantee of Housing Loan Payments**
- The Corporation may **guarantee** payments on principal or interest of securities issued based on housing loans.
- Guarantees can be issued **with Minister of Finance approval**, and terms may include:
  - Amount and price of guarantee.
  - Characteristics of the securities (e.g., maturity, interest rate).
  - Issuance process and eligibility.
- The **Minister of Finance** may also regulate the **eligibility of borrowers or lenders** and set fees for guarantees.

> This enables the creation of **mortgage-backed securities** (MBS), which can be sold to investors, providing capital for housing finance.

#### 4. **Prohibition on Guaranteeing Covered Bonds**
- The Corporation is **prohibited from guaranteeing** any "covered bond" as defined in section 21.5 of the Act.
> This prevents overlap with other financial instruments and ensures risk focus remains on housing loans.

#### 5. **Limits on Total Exposure**
- The **total outstanding insured amounts** of all loans may not exceed:
  - **$800 billion**, plus
  - Any additional amounts authorized by **Parliament** through appropriation acts (e.g., after the 2024 Budget Implementation Act).
- Similarly, the **total outstanding guaranteed principal amounts** must not exceed:
  - The amount authorized by Parliament.
  - The total amount of guaranteed principal under section 11.

> These caps ensure fiscal responsibility and prevent systemic overexposure to housing-related risks.

#### 6. **Interest Rate Protection**
- The Corporation may provide **protection against interest rate fluctuations** for housing loans.
- This helps stabilize housing financing and protects borrowers from sudden increases in mortgage costs.

#### 7. **Acquisition and Administration of Loans**
- The Corporation may:
  - Acquire housing loans or interests in them.
  - Make loans to holders of housing loans.
  - Sell obligations (e.g., mortgage insurance policies) and continue administering them under agreement.
  - Issue securities based on housing loans.

> This enables CMHC to act as both a **lender and a financial intermediary**, helping to stabilize the housing finance system.

#### 8. **Mortgage Insurance and Reinsurance**
- The Corporation may:
  - Provide **mortgage insurance** to lenders (protecting against default).
  - Acquire or reinsure mortgage insurance policies from other insurers.
  - Provide services to the **liquidator** of a company involved in mortgage insurance.

> This strengthens the resilience of the mortgage insurance market.

#### 9. **Reinsurance**
- The Corporation may obtain **reinsurance** to manage its own risk exposure in housing-related insurance and guarantees.

> This ensures that CMHC is not exposed to catastrophic losses from defaults.

#### 10. **Payment of Risk-Based Fees**
- The **Minister of Finance** may set a fee paid by the Corporation to the **Receiver General** to compensate Her Majesty for risks arising from:
  - Insurance of housing loans.
  - Guarantees of loan payments.
- These fees are part of the Corporation’s operational costs and are **recognized as legitimate business expenses**.

> This ensures accountability and transparency in risk management.

#### 11. **Administrative Powers**
- The Corporation may:
  - Administer a housing loan directly with the holder.
  - Make loans in circumstances where:
    - The loan would otherwise not be available.
    - The Corporation intends to contribute to the borrower, make another loan, or forgive debt.
    - The Corporation is a party to an agreement governing the housing project.
- It may **waive subrogation rights** in certain cases (e.g., to avoid disputes or protect borrower interests).

> This gives CMHC flexibility in crisis situations, such as defaults or construction delays.
