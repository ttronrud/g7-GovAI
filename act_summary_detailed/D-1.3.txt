**Detailed Summary of the *Defence Services Pension Continuation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Defence Services Pension Continuation Act* is a legislative framework that establishes the conditions under which officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and men of the Canadian permanent militia (commonly referred to as the "force") are entitled to pensions upon retirement, resignation, or death. It outlines specific rules for calculating pension amounts, eligibility criteria, service credit, deductions from pay, and special provisions for secondment, wartime service, and disability.

This Act is primarily focused on ensuring fair and consistent pension entitlements for military personnel, particularly those who serve in the permanent force or militia, with provisions that recognize both continuous service and periods of service in other governmental or military roles.

## **Key Definitions**

The Act begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Child**: A child or stepchild of an officer who was dependent on them at the time of death, or an individual legally or factually adopted by such an officer.
- **Force**: Includes commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers, privates, and permanent staff of the militia.
- **Militiaman**: A non-commissioned officer or private in the force.
- **Minister**: Initially the Minister of National Defence, but can be replaced by the Governor in Council as needed.
- **Officer**: Includes commissioned officers, warrant officers, and subordinate officers; excludes temporary or honorary ranks (except temporary brigadiers).
- **Permanent Staff**: Officers in headquarters, district staff, or military stores.
- **Rank**: Refers to substantive rank; honorary ranks (e.g., quartermasters) are treated as having equivalent substantive rank.
- **Service**: Service rendered in the force.
- **Survivor**: A spouse at the time of death or someone referred to under subsection 32(1).

## **Pension Entitlements for Officers**

### **1. Compulsory Retirement After 20 Years of Service**
An officer who retires compulsorily after **20 years of service** (due to reasons other than misconduct or inefficiency) is entitled to a **lifetime pension** equal to:
- **One-fiftieth of the pay and allowances** of their rank or permanent appointment **at the time of retirement**, for each year of service, **if appointed before May 1, 1929**.
- **One-fiftieth of the average annual pay and allowances** received over the **three years prior to retirement**, for each year of service, **if appointed on or after May 1, 1929**.

> *Example*: An officer with 20 years of service appointed before 1929 would receive 20 × (1/50) = 40% of their rank pay annually.

---

### **2. Voluntary Retirement After 25 Years of Service**
An officer retiring voluntarily after **25 years** receives a pension that is **20% less** than what would be granted under compulsory retirement.

> *Purpose*: To incentivize long-term service while still offering a meaningful pension.

---

### **3. Voluntary Retirement After 20 Years of Service**
An officer retiring voluntarily after **20 years** is entitled to a pension equal to the **greater of two amounts**:
1. The compulsory retirement pension **reduced by 5% per year** for each complete year below the prescribed retirement age for their rank.
2. The pension available under subsection (2) (i.e., the 20-year voluntary retirement pension).

> **Important Condition**: This pension is only payable **if**:
- The Minister makes a recommendation and the Treasury Board approves that the retirement was in the **public interest**.
- The public interest justifies the pension payment.

> *Note*: This provision ensures that retirements are not automatic and must be justified by policy or public benefit.

---

### **4. Special Case: Warrant Officers**
A warrant officer who retires voluntarily after **20 years of service** (at the end of engagement or re-engagement) receives the **same pension as if retired compulsorily**.

> *Rationale*: To provide parity in pension treatment between warrant officers and commissioned officers.

---

### **5. Retirement After 35 Years of Service**
An officer retiring after **35 years** of service receives the **same pension as if retired compulsorily**.

> *No additional pension is granted beyond 35 years of service* — meaning no "bonus" for exceeding 35 years.

---

### **6. Non-Continuous Service**
Any period of **discontinued service** is **not counted** toward the total service period for pension purposes.

> *Example*: If an officer served 10 years, took a break, then served 10 more years, only 20 years count.

---

## **Service Credit for Time in Other Forces**

### **Time in His Majesty’s Regular Forces**
Service in the **regular forces** (e.g., British or Canadian regular army, navy) may be counted toward pension eligibility **when an officer is transferred to the permanent force** during the government's takeover of Halifax and Esquimalt garrisons.

> *Conditions*:
- Deductions from pension will apply if the officer's pension is based on a period during which the deduction was not made.
- Deductions are **5% per year** of service during which the deduction was not applied.

> *Purpose*: To account for service rendered before joining the permanent force.

---

## **Secondment and Public Service Service**

### **Secondment to Public Service or Foreign Forces**
If an officer is seconded to:
- A position in the **public service of Canada**, or
- The **Canadian Expeditionary Force**, or
- Any other military force raised in Canada for service **outside Canada** and paid/maintained by the Government of Canada,

Then:
- The officer **continues to contribute** to the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the rate of **5% per annum** of what would have been deducted from their pay had they remained in the force.
- Upon retirement, the pension is **based on the average annual salary or pay** received during the **three years immediately before retirement** from the public service or foreign military.

> *Exception*: If the officer becomes subject to **Part I of the Civil Service Superannuation Act**, the required deductions under that Act are treated as **equivalent to deductions under this Act**.

> *Pension Calculation*: Based on average pay/allowances during the three years prior to retirement.

---

### **Death During Secondment**
If an officer dies after a period when a pension might have been granted and has made required contributions, they are **deemed to be on full pay** for the purposes of section 25 (pension eligibility).

## **Pension Calculation for Defence Council Members**

An officer who served as a **member or associate member of the Defence Council** for **at least three continuous years** and is later employed elsewhere in the military (naval, army, air force) or seconded, may receive a pension based on:
- The **average annual pay and allowances** earned during the **last three years** of Defence Council service — **if this results in a more beneficial pension** than standard calculation.

> *Purpose*: To reward long-term strategic involvement in national defense planning.

---

## **Inclusion of Preceding Service in Service Calculations**

The Act allows time served in various roles to be **included in service for pension purposes**, including:

### ✅ **Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) or Private Service**
- Time served as an NCO or private may be counted toward total service.
- The **5% annual pension deduction** is reduced by the average yearly deduction made in the Civil Service (if applicable).

### ✅ **Public Service of Canada**
- Time served in the public service (under Part I of the Civil Service Superannuation Act) may be included in service, **if it would have counted toward a superannuation allowance**.
- The **5% annual deduction** from pension is reduced by the average deduction made in the public service.

### ✅ **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**
- Time as a police officer or constable may be included.
- The 5% pension deduction is reduced by the average deduction made under:
  - Part II of the RCMP Act (1927), or
  - Civil Service Superannuation Act (1886), or
  - Part I of the Civil Service Superannuation and Retirement Act.

## **Wartime Service Credits**

The following wartime service may be included in pension calculations:

| Service Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **World War I (1914–1918)** | Time served on active service during the war between Great Britain and Germany starting August 4, 1914. |
| **Royal Canadian Navy & Permanent Active Air Force** | Service in these forces. |
| **Active service during wartime in Canadian-raised forces** | During any war. |
| **Active service in foreign forces during wartime** | Except for those who joined or enlisted in Canadian forces **after September 10, 1939**, and did so **on or before March 31, 1946**. |

> *Note*: This excludes certain individuals who joined post-1939, suggesting a policy to avoid retroactive inclusion for those who entered later.

- If an officer is forced to leave service due to **infirmity of body or mind**, the Minister may grant a **gratuity**:
