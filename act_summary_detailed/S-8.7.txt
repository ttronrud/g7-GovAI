### **Detailed Summary of the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act***  

---

#### **1. Purpose of the Act**  
The *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (SOIRA) establishes a legal framework to **enhance public safety by enabling police services to prevent and investigate sexual offences**. Its primary goal is to ensure that law enforcement has **timely, accurate, and reliable information** about individuals who have committed or are subject to orders for sexual offences, particularly those involving children.

This information is collected and maintained in a centralized database to support effective crime prevention, monitoring, and investigative capabilities.

---

#### **2. Guiding Principles**  
The Act operates under three core principles:

1. **Public Safety and Prevention**  
   Police must have **rapid access** to current and accurate information about sex offenders to prevent further crimes of a sexual nature.

2. **Accuracy and Ongoing Data Collection**  
   Continuous and systematic collection of information ensures that the data remains **current, reliable, and actionable** over time.

3. **Privacy and Rehabilitation**  
   The Act balances public safety with individual rights:
   - Information is collected **only for the purpose of preventing or investigating sexual offences**.
   - Access to, use of, and disclosure of the information are **strictly restricted** to protect the privacy of sex offenders and promote their rehabilitation and reintegration into society as law-abiding citizens.
