### **Detailed Summary of the *Petro-Canada Public Participation Act***

---

#### **Overview**
The *Petro-Canada Public Participation Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada that restructures the corporate governance, ownership, and operational framework of **Petro-Canada** and its related entities. The Act is primarily concerned with:

- Changing the corporate names of Petro-Canada and Petro-Canada Limited;
- Transferring ownership of Petro-Canada shares to the federal government;
- Imposing strict ownership and transfer constraints on voting shares to prevent concentration of control;
- Ensuring public access to services in both official languages;
- Establishing governance and procedural rules for the corporation;
- Facilitating the dissolution of certain associated corporations;
- Providing transitional provisions for employees’ retirement benefits.

This Act effectively transforms Petro-Canada from a publicly owned corporation into a government-owned entity under direct federal control, with significant regulatory and structural safeguards to ensure transparency, public accountability, and equitable access.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Name Changes**
- **Petro-Canada Inc.** (the original corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*) is renamed **Petro-Canada** in both English and French.
- **Petro-Canada** (the corporation established under the *Petro-Canada Act*, Chapter P-11 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985) is renamed **Petro-Canada Limited** in both languages.

> **Purpose**: Clarifies the legal identity of the entities and aligns them with the federal government’s naming conventions for Crown corporations.

> **Important Note**: These name changes do **not** affect existing legal claims, liabilities, or ongoing litigation involving the corporation or its officers or directors.

---

### **2. Transfer of Shares to the Minister**
- All shares of **Petro-Canada** held by **Petro-Canada Limited** are transferred to the **Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs)** (or, if not designated, the Minister of State for Privatization and Regulatory Affairs).
- The Minister is authorized to:
  - Acquire, hold, dispose of, and otherwise deal with shares and debt obligations of Petro-Canada;
  - Enter into agreements or arrangements necessary for such activities.

> **Trust Status**: Shares acquired by the Minister are held **in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada** — meaning they are not privately owned but remain under federal Crown ownership.

> **Legal Basis**: This transfer ensures full federal control over Petro-Canada’s equity structure and prevents private or foreign entities from gaining influence.

---

### **3. Authorization to Issue Shares**
- Petro-Canada is authorized to issue and sell shares, including through public offerings.

> **Important Condition**: The issuance of shares must be approved by the Minister. The first issuance date (after the Act comes into force) is a key milestone for governance and public participation.

---

### **4. Articles of Amendment – Corporate Governance and Ownership Constraints**
Petro-Canada must submit articles of amendment to the Minister for approval, which include **mandatory provisions** to prevent concentration of control. These provisions are designed to promote **public interest**, **diversity of ownership**, and **prevent monopolistic or foreign control**.

#### **Key Provisions in the Articles of Amendment:**

| Provision | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a) Voting Share Ownership Limits** | Prevents any one person (or group of associates) from holding, beneficially owning, or controlling **more than 20% of the voting shares** (i.e., shares with voting rights) of Petro-Canada, **except** through security interests. This applies to voting shares that would otherwise allow more than 20% of the voting power. |
| **(b) Asset Sales Restrictions** | Petro-Canada cannot sell, transfer, or dispose of **all or substantially all of its assets** to any single person or group of associated persons — **unless** the transaction is conducted **by way of security only** (e.g., as part of financing). This prevents asset stripping or foreign takeover. |
| **(c) Public Access in Official Languages** | Petro-Canada must ensure that the public can access its services and communicate with it in **both English and French**, at its head office and any other office where there is significant public demand. This supports bilingualism and public participation. |
| **(d) Enforcement Mechanisms** | Provides tools for enforcement, such as: <br> - Filing declarations of compliance; <br> - Suspension of voting rights; <br> - Forfeiture of dividends; <br> - Refusal to issue or register shares; <br> - Sale of shares in violation of constraints, with proceeds going to the person entitled to them. |
| **(e) Head Office Location** | The head office of Petro-Canada is designated to be in **Calgary, Alberta**. |

> **Exclusions from Ownership Constraints**:
> - Shares held by the **Minister in trust**;
> - Shares held by **underwriters** solely for distribution to the public;
> - Shares held by **centralized clearing intermediaries** (e.g., brokers or clearing houses) acting only as intermediaries in trade settlements.

> **Definition of "Associate"**:
> A person is considered an associate of another if:
> - One is a director or officer of the other’s corporation;
> - One controls the other or is controlled by a group of which the other is a member;
> - They are partners in a partnership;
> - They are trustees of a trust;
> - Both are controlled by the same person;
> - Both are members of a voting trust related to Petro-Canada;
> - Both are acting in concert (via agreement or arrangement) with respect to their interests in Petro-Canada.

> **Exception for "Statutory Declaration"**:
> If a person submits a **statutory declaration** stating:
> - That their voting shares are not held for or on behalf of any associate;
> - That they are not acting in concert with any such associate;
> Then, **the directors may accept that the person is not an associate**, provided the declaration is compliant and there are no other reasonable grounds to disregard it.

> **Control Definition**:
> - A body corporate is deemed controlled by a person if **more than 50% of the voting rights** are held by that person (not as security), and those votes are sufficient to elect a majority of directors.
> - A partnership or unincorporated organization is deemed controlled if **more than 50% of its assets** are held by that person (not as security).
