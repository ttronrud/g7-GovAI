**Detailed Summary of the *Hazardous Materials Information Review Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Hazardous Materials Information Review Act* (HMIRA) is a legislative framework in Canada designed to **balance public safety and environmental protection with the protection of sensitive business information** related to hazardous materials. It establishes a formal process by which suppliers and employers can **claim exemptions from mandatory disclosures** of certain chemical and product-related information — particularly chemical names, CAS numbers, impurities, and toxicological data — when such information is deemed **confidential business information (CBI)**.

Despite being a relatively recent and specialized piece of legislation, it operates within the broader regulatory ecosystem of hazardous products and occupational health and safety laws, primarily referencing the *Hazardous Products Act*, the *Canada Labour Code*, and the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord* and *Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord*.

However, **important context must be noted**: several key institutions and definitions referenced in the Act — including the *Commission*, *Chief Appeals Officer*, *Chief Screening Officer*, *President*, and *rule* — have been **repealed as of 2012 or 2019**. This suggests that the Act may be **outdated, incomplete, or superseded** by other legislation or administrative reforms. The current version appears to be a **draft, transitional, or partially enacted document**, with many structural elements missing or deleted.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definitions**

The Act begins with a list of definitions that clarify key terms used throughout:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **CAS Registry Number** | A unique identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) to a chemical substance. |
| **Chemical Name** | A scientifically accurate name following IUPAC or CAS nomenclature rules; must clearly identify the material. |
| **Hazardous Product** | As defined in *Section 2 of the Hazardous Products Act* — a product posing a health, safety, or environmental risk. |
| **Label / Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** | As defined in the *Hazardous Products Act*, must meet regulatory requirements. |
| **Confidential Business Information (CBI)** | Business information that is: (1) not publicly available; (2) protected by reasonable measures; and (3) has actual or potential economic value because its disclosure would cause material financial loss to the business or gain to competitors. |
| **Supplier / Employer** | Defined under the *Hazardous Products Act* and *Canada Labour Code*, respectively. |
| **Prescribed** | Means as set out in regulations. |

> **Note**: The Act explicitly excludes certain provisions of regulations made under specific sections of the *Hazardous Products Act* (e.g., section 15(1)(j)) and the *Canada Labour Code* (e.g., section 125.2 and section 157), indicating a deliberate limitation on scope.

### **2. Exemption Claims for Suppliers and Employers**

#### **Who Can Claim Exemption?**

Any **supplier** or **employer** required by law (under the *Hazardous Products Act*, *Canada Labour Code*, or *Accord Act*) to disclose specific information may **claim exemption** if they believe the information constitutes **confidential business information**.

#### **Types of Information Protected**

The Act outlines **three categories** of information that may be claimed as CBI:

---

#### **A. For Hazardous Products (Substances or Mixtures)**

- Chemical name of the material/substance  
- CAS registry number or any other unique identifier  
- Chemical name of **impurities, stabilizing solvents, or additives** that:
  - Are present in the product  
  - Contribute to its classification under a health hazard class (e.g., carcinogenic, toxic, corrosive)  
- Name of any **toxicological study** used to assess the material or ingredient  

> *Note*: This applies whether the substance is pure or part of a mixture.

---

#### **B. For Ingredients in Mixtures**

- Chemical name of the ingredient  
- CAS number or unique identifier  
- **Concentration or concentration range** of the ingredient  

> *Important*: This protects the exact formulation details of hazardous mixtures.

---

#### **C. For Identification Information**

- Product identifier (chemical name, common name, generic name, trade name, brand name)  
- Other information that constitutes a **means of identification**  
- Information that could **identify the supplier** of the hazardous product  

> *Purpose*: Prevents disclosure of proprietary or competitive identity details.

---

### **3. Requirements for Filing a Claim**

A claim for exemption must:

- Be submitted in **prescribed form**  
- Be filed in **prescribed manner**  
- Be accompanied by a **prescribed fee** or a fee calculated according to prescribed rules  
- Include the following elements:
  - The **information** for which exemption is claimed  
  - A **declaration** stating:
    - That the information is CBI meeting the legal criteria  
    - That **substantiating evidence** is in the claimant’s possession or available upon request  
  - A **summary of the substantiating information**  
  - Any **other prescribed information**

> *Note*: The claimant must provide the **safety data sheet (SDS)** or **label** associated with the information being claimed.

---

### **4. Review and Determination by the Minister**

- The **Minister of Health** (the sole authority under this Act) must review each claim **as soon as feasible**, based on **prescribed criteria**.
- If additional information is needed, the claimant must provide it in the manner and timeframe specified by the Minister.
- The Minister must **notify the claimant in writing** of the decision and the **reasons** for it within a reasonable time.

---

### **5. Consequences of an Invalid Claim**

If the Minister determines that a claim (or part of it) is **not valid**, they may issue an **order requiring** the claimant to:

- Comply with the relevant provisions of:
  - The *Hazardous Products Act*  
  - The *Canada Labour Code*  
  - The *Accord Act*  
  (in the case of employers or suppliers)
- Or **remove specific information** from the SDS or label

> The claimant is **legally obligated** to comply with the order.

> **Crucially**: If the claimant complies with the order, they are **deemed to have complied** with the relevant legal provisions **from the date the order is issued**.

---

### **6. Valid Claims and Exemption Periods**

- If a claim is **valid after all judicial reviews and appeals are exhausted**, the claimant is **exempt** from disclosure for:
  - **Three years**, beginning on the day **after** all appeals are exhausted.
- This exemption applies **only to the specific information** claimed and **only during the exemption period**.

> *Exception*: If the claim is invalid, the claimant **cannot file a new claim** regarding the same information.

---

### **7. Suspension or Cancellation of Exemptions**

The Minister may **suspend or cancel** an exemption if:

#### **For claims under subsection 19(1)** (exemption based on valid CBI):
- The claim is found invalid  
- The SDS or label does not comply with regulations  
- The claimant violates the terms of the order (e.g., fails to comply with disclosure requirements)  
- The claimant violates any provision of the relevant Act or order  
- Prescribed circumstances apply  

#### **For claims under subsection 19(2)** (exemption based on valid CBI, but with false/misleading information):
- There is reasonable ground to believe the claim contained **false or misleading information**  
- The claimant violates any provision of the Act or order  

> **Effect of Suspension/Cancellation**:
- Takes effect **on the day of written notification** to the claimant  
- Claimant has **10 days** to provide reasons why the suspension/cancellation is unfounded  
- If the reasons are valid, the Minister **must reinstate** the exemption

> *Reinstatement applies only if the grounds for suspension/cancellation no longer exist or are proven unfounded.*
