**Detailed Summary of the *Online News Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Online News Act* is a landmark piece of Canadian legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada to regulate **digital news intermediaries**—online platforms such as search engines, social media services, and content aggregators—and to ensure **fairness, sustainability, and journalistic independence** in the Canadian digital news marketplace. The Act is designed to address growing concerns about the **power imbalance** between large tech platforms and independent, local news outlets, particularly in terms of how news content is accessed, monetized, and distributed.

Its primary objective is to **enhance the financial sustainability of Canadian news businesses**, especially small, independent, and local ones—including Indigenous and official language minority community news outlets—by establishing a structured, transparent, and equitable framework for compensation and access to digital news content.

### **2. Scope and Application**

The Act applies to a **digital news intermediary** if there is a **significant bargaining power imbalance** between its operator and news businesses, based on three key factors:

1. **Size of the intermediary or operator**
2. **Market advantage** (e.g., dominance in search or social media)
3. **Prominent market position**

> If such imbalance exists, the operator must **notify the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)**.

**Exclusions:**
