**Detailed Summary of the *Civilian War-related Benefits Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Civilian War-related Benefits Act* (CWB Act) is a legislative framework that establishes entitlements to pensions, allowances, and compensation for certain **civilian individuals who served or were injured during World War II** (1939–1947), despite not being members of the Canadian armed forces. It recognizes the contributions and sacrifices of civilians—such as fishermen, support staff, volunteers, and medical personnel—who functioned under wartime conditions and suffered injuries or disabilities as a result of enemy action or duty-related activities.

While the Act is largely **repealed or superseded** by later legislation (e.g., the *Pension Act*, *Veterans’ Affairs Act*, and *Veterans’ Benefits Act*), its provisions provide a detailed historical and legal foundation for recognizing civilian wartime service and related benefits.

This summary focuses on the **content, structure, and key provisions** of the Act as it existed in its original form, particularly in Parts I to X, which address various categories of civilians and their entitlements.

### 2. **Minister**
