### **7. Determination of Residency Status**

This section defines how residency is determined for individuals and companies.

#### **For Individuals:**
An individual is deemed a resident of **only one** State under these rules:

1. **Permanent Home**:  
   → Resides only in the State where they have a permanent home available.  
   → If available in both, the State with **closer personal and economic ties** ("centre of vital interests") prevails.

2. **No Permanent Home / Centre of Vital Interests Undetermined**:  
   → Resides only in the State where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **No Habitual Abode in Either State**:  
   → Resides only in the State of which the individual is a **national**.

4. **National of Both or Neither States**:  
   → The **competent authorities** of both countries must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

> 📌 This rule prevents double taxation by establishing a clear hierarchy for residency determination.

#### **For Companies:**
1. If a company is a national of one State → it is deemed a resident **only of that State**.  
2. If not a national of either → it is deemed a resident of the State where its **place of effective management** is located.

> 🚩 This ensures that company residency is not based solely on incorporation or ownership but on operational control.
