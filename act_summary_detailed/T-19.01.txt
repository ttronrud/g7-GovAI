**Detailed Summary of the *Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992* (TDGA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to ensure the safe import, offering for transport, handling, and transportation of **dangerous goods** across all modes of transport (road, rail, air, sea, pipeline). The Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework focused on **public safety**, **environmental protection**, and **compliance with safety and security standards**. It is administered by the **Minister of Transport** and operates in conjunction with detailed regulations made under the Act.

The TDGA was significantly amended in 2009 (notably through *Bill C-9*) to modernize and streamline provisions, including the **repeal of outdated or redundant sections** (e.g., "accidental release," "import," "ship," "vessel," "security requirement") that were either obsolete or redundant. This summary reflects the current, effective version of the Act as it stands post-2009 amendments.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Dangerous Goods** | Any product, substance, or organism included in one of the classes listed in the Schedule (e.g., flammables, explosives, toxic substances, corrosives, oxidizers, etc.). Classification is based on inherent properties or regulatory designations. |
| **Means of Containment** | Any container or packaging used to hold dangerous goods, including parts of a vehicle (e.g., tanks, drums, casks). |
| **Means of Transport** | Vehicles such as trucks, trains, aircraft, vessels, or pipelines used to move dangerous goods. |
| **Handling** | Activities including loading, unloading, packing, unpacking, and storing dangerous goods during transport. |
| **Safety Requirement** | Mandatory obligations for individuals or organizations involved in transporting dangerous goods, including design, manufacturing, testing, reporting, training, or registration. |
| **Safety Standard** | Technical specifications governing the design, manufacture, repair, testing, performance, or use of means of containment to ensure safety. |
| **Compliance Mark** | A symbol or label indicating that a means of containment has met a required safety standard (e.g., DOT, UN, or Canadian standards). |
| **Dangerous Goods Mark** | A label or symbol indicating the presence or nature of danger (e.g., flammability, toxicity). |
| **Safety Mark** | A combined term covering both compliance marks and dangerous goods marks. |
| **Emergency Response Assistance Plan (ERAP)** | A documented plan outlining how a release of dangerous goods will be managed to protect public safety. |
| **Security Requirement** | Measures to prevent theft or unlawful interference with dangerous goods (established under regulations under section 27.1). |
| **Standardized Means of Containment** | A container to which a safety standard applies (e.g., UN-approved tanks or drums). |
| **Public Safety** | The safety of human life, health, property, and the environment. |

> **Note:** Several definitions have been repealed (e.g., "accidental release," "import," "ship") due to redundancy or replacement by more precise regulatory language.
