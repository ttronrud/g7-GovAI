### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Madagascar Tax Convention Act, 2018**

The **Canada–Madagascar Tax Convention Act, 2018** is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada to give legal force and effect to the **Canada–Madagascar Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income**. This Act ensures that the tax treaty between Canada and Madagascar is fully integrated into Canadian law, thereby facilitating tax compliance, reducing double taxation, and promoting fair and transparent international tax treatment for individuals and enterprises.

## **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The primary objective of this Act is to **implement and operationalize the Canada–Madagascar Tax Convention**, which aims to:
- Prevent **double taxation** of income earned by residents of either country.
- Prevent **fiscal evasion** (tax avoidance or fraud) through the use of international tax structures.
- Establish clear rules on **tax residency, permanent establishments, income taxation, dividends, and profit attribution** between the two countries.

The Act provides the legal framework under which the Convention can be applied in Canada, ensuring that its provisions are enforceable and consistent with Canadian tax law.

## **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

To ensure clarity and consistency in the application of the Convention, the Act defines several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Convention** | Refers to the bilateral tax treaty between Canada and the Republic of Madagascar, as set out in **Schedule 1**, amended by the **Protocol in Schedule 2**. |
| **In force** | The Convention has legal effect in Canada during the period it is valid under its own terms. |
| **Prevalence of Convention** | In case of inconsistency between the Convention, this Act, or any other Canadian law, the Convention and this Act prevail. However, if there is a conflict with the **Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act**, that Act takes precedence. |
| **Minister of National Revenue (MNR)** | May issue regulations necessary to implement the Convention or give effect to its provisions. |
| **Minister of Finance** | Must publish in the *Canada Gazette* within 60 days of the Convention’s entry into force or termination: <br> - The date of entry into force; <br> - The date and nature of any event causing the Convention to cease to be in force. |

## **5. Determination of Tax Residency**

This is a critical provision to determine which country has taxing rights over an individual or company.

### **For Individuals:**
An individual is deemed a resident **only in one state**, based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home (Centre of Vital Interests)**  
   - If the individual has a permanent home in one country, they are a resident only of that country.  
   - If they have a permanent home in both, the individual is a resident only in the country where their **personal and economic relations are closer** (centre of vital interests).

2. **Habitual Abode**  
   - If no permanent home exists in either country, the individual is a resident only in the country where they have an **habitual abode**.

3. **Nationality**  
   - If the individual has an habitual abode in both or neither, they are a resident only of the country of **nationality**.

4. **Dual Nationality or No Nationality**  
   - If the individual is a national of both or neither, the competent authorities must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

> This rule prevents double taxation by ensuring that a person is taxed in only one country based on a clear, objective criterion.

---

### **For Companies:**
- A company is a resident **only in the country of its nationality**.
- If it has no nationality, it is a resident only in the country where its **place of effective management** is located.

> This avoids ambiguity in determining where corporate profits are taxed.

---

### **For Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships):**
- If such a person is a resident of both countries, the competent authorities must **mutually agree** on residency status.
- In the absence of agreement, the person **cannot claim tax relief or exemptions** under the Convention.

---

## **6. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise conducts business.

### **Examples of Permanent Establishments:**
- Place of management  
- Branch  
- Office  
- Factory  
- Workshop  
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any site for exploration or exploitation of natural resources

> **Note**: A building site or construction project **only constitutes a PE if it lasts more than six months**.

### **Exclusions from PE Status (Prevent Over-Taxation):**
The following activities **do not constitute a PE**, even if carried out at a fixed location:
- Use of facilities for storage, display, or delivery of goods  
- Maintenance of stock for storage, display, or delivery  
- Stock for processing by another enterprise  
- Fixed place used solely for purchasing goods or collecting information  
- Fixed place used solely for preparatory or auxiliary activities  

> This ensures that businesses are not taxed on incidental or administrative activities.

### **Insurance Exception:**
- An insurance enterprise of one country is deemed to have a PE in the other country **if it collects premiums or insures risks located there**, except in the case of reinsurance.

### **Agents and Representatives:**
- A person acting on behalf of an enterprise with **authority to conclude contracts** is treated as having a PE in the country where they operate — **unless** their activities are limited to those excluded above (e.g., purchasing, information gathering).

> However, **brokers, general agents, or independent agents** acting in the ordinary course of business **do not create a PE**.

### **No PE Due to Control or Ownership:**
- Merely owning or being controlled by a company in the other country **does not create a PE**.

## **7. Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**

### **General Rule:**
- Income derived from **immovable property** (land, buildings, agricultural land, forests, etc.) located in the other country **may be taxed in that country**.

### **Definition of Immovable Property:**
- Includes:
  - Property accessory to immovable property  
  - Livestock and equipment used in agriculture or forestry  
  - Rights to variable or fixed payments for working mineral deposits or natural resources  
  - Usu
