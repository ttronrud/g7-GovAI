### **Detailed Summary of the Rental Housing Benefit Act**

---

#### **Overview**
The *Rental Housing Benefit Act* is a Canadian legislative measure enacted by His Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to provide a one-time financial assistance benefit to eligible individuals who face financial hardship due to high rental costs. The Act establishes eligibility criteria, administrative procedures, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure equitable and transparent access to the benefit, while also protecting the integrity of the program and safeguarding recipients’ rights.

The benefit is designed to support individuals living in Canada who rent their principal residence and have limited income, particularly those who may be vulnerable due to economic or personal circumstances.
