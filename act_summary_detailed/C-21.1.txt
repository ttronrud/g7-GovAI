- **"Minister"** refers to the **Minister of National Defence**. This individual plays a central role in the nomination and administration of the Medal, particularly for members of the Canadian Forces.

---

### **4. Purpose and Eligibility of the Medal**
- The **Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal** is awarded to recognize **peacekeeping service rendered by a Canadian citizen**:
