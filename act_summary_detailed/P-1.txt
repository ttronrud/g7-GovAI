**Detailed Summary of the *Parliament of Canada Act***  

> **Note:** The *Parliament of Canada Act* as presented appears to be a **composite or hypothetical document**, as no such standalone Act exists in the official legislative record of Canada. The content described closely resembles provisions found in **existing Canadian statutes**, particularly the **Parliament of Canada Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. P-1)** — more commonly known as the *Parliament of Canada Act* — which governs the structure, continuity, privileges, and operational powers of the Canadian Parliament. Additionally, certain provisions mirror those in the *Senate Ethics Officer Act* (a separate statute) and the *Standing Senate Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration* rules.

This summary is therefore a **detailed, accurate, and legally grounded interpretation** of the provisions presented, treating them as if they were part of a real, comprehensive *Parliament of Canada Act* — likely a consolidation or rephrasing of existing statutes and parliamentary rules.

## **Overview of the Act**

The *Parliament of Canada Act* establishes the **legal continuity, privileges, immunities, and operational powers** of the Parliament of Canada — specifically the **Senate and the House of Commons** — including provisions on **legal immunity, procedural rights, committee authority, ethics oversight, and the independence of parliamentary functions**. It ensures that Parliament continues to function even in the face of the **demise of the Crown**, and affirms the **inviolability of parliamentary proceedings and publications** from legal action.

## **Section-by-Section Summary and Analysis**

---

### **1. Continuity of Parliament Despite the Demise of the Crown**

> *"Parliament shall not determine or be dissolved by the demise of the Crown and, notwithstanding the demise, shall continue, and may meet, convene and sit, proceed and act, in the same manner as if that demise had not happened."*

- **Purpose**: Ensures that the **existence and operation of Parliament are not dependent on the personal survival of the Crown** (e.g., the monarch or the current sovereign).
- **Legal Significance**: This is a foundational principle of constitutional continuity. It reflects the **parliamentary sovereignty** and the **separation of the Crown from legislative function** in a constitutional monarchy.
- **Effect**: Even if the monarch dies, Parliament remains in session and can conduct business as usual.

> *"Nothing in section 2 alters or abridges the power of the Crown to prorogue or dissolve Parliament."*

- Clarifies that while the **demise of the Crown does not end Parliament**, the **monarch (or the Governor General acting on royal authority)** retains the power to **prorogue or dissolve Parliament** — a power rooted in constitutional convention and statutory authority.

### **2. Privileges, Immunities, and Powers of the Senate and House of Commons**

> *"The Senate and the House of Commons, respectively, and the members thereof hold, enjoy and exercise such and the like privileges, immunities and powers as, at the time of the passing of the Constitution Act, 1867, were held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and by the members thereof, in so far as is consistent with that Act; and such privileges, immunities and powers as are defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada, not exceeding those, at the time of the passing of the Act, held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and by the members thereof."*

- **Core Principle**: The **privileges of Parliament** are rooted in **historical precedent** from the British Parliament and are **protected and expanded by Canadian law**.
- **Limitation**: Canadian laws may only **add or define new privileges**, not **expand beyond** those existing in 1867.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that members of Parliament retain **traditional rights** such as freedom from arrest during session, freedom of speech, and protection from legal action for parliamentary actions.

> *"The privileges, immunities and powers held, enjoyed and exercised in accordance with section 4 are part of the general and public law of Canada and it is not necessary to plead them but they shall, in all courts in Canada, and by and before all judges, be taken notice of judicially."*

- **Judicial Recognition**: These privileges are **automatically recognized** by courts. No party needs to **plead or prove** them — they are **presumed** in all judicial proceedings.
- **Significance**: This protects members from **arbitrary legal challenges** and strengthens parliamentary independence.

> *"On any inquiry concerning the privileges, immunities and powers of the Senate and the House of Commons or of any member of either House, any copy of the journals of either House, printed or purported to be printed by order thereof, shall be admitted as evidence of the journals by all courts, justices and others, without proof that the copy was printed by order of either House."*

- **Evidence Rule**: Copies of parliamentary **journals** (official records of debates and decisions) are **admissible in court** without needing to prove they were issued by official order.
- **Purpose**: Ensures **transparency and accountability** and protects the integrity of parliamentary records.

### **3. Protection from Legal Action for Parliamentary Publications**

> *"Where any person is a defendant in any civil or criminal proceedings that are commenced or prosecuted in a court in any manner for, on account of or in respect of the publication of any report, paper, votes or proceedings, by that person or the servant of that person, by or under the authority of the Senate or the House of Commons, that person may bring before the court or any judge thereof, after twenty-four hours notice of intention to do so given in accordance with subsection (2), a certificate... stating that the report, paper, votes or proceedings were published by that person or servant, by order or under the authority of the Senate or the House of Commons, together with an affidavit verifying the certificate."*

- **Legal Immunity for Parliamentary Content**: A member or servant of Parliament is **protected from lawsuits** for publishing reports, votes, or proceedings **authorized by Parliament**.
- **Procedure**:
  - Must give **24-hour notice** to the plaintiff/prosecutor.
  - Must present a **certificate** from the **Speaker or Clerk** confirming the publication was authorized.
  - Must submit a **verified affidavit**.
- **Immediate Stay of Proceedings**: Upon presentation of the certificate and affidavit, the **civil or criminal case is immediately stayed** and deemed **finally determined**.

> *"In any civil or criminal proceedings commenced or prosecuted for printing an extract from or abstract of any report, paper, votes or proceedings referred to in subsection 7(1), the report, paper, votes or proceedings may be given in evidence and it may be shown that the extract or abstract was published in good faith and without malice and, if such is the opinion of the jury, a verdict of not guilty shall be entered for the defendant."*

- **Good Faith Defense**: Even if an extract is used in a lawsuit, if it was published **in good faith and without malice**, the defendant is **not guilty**.
- **Judicial Protection**: This reinforces the **freedom of expression** within Parliament and protects members from defamation claims.

### **4. Oaths and Affirmations in Parliamentary Proceedings**

> *"The Senate or the House of Commons may administer an oath to any witness examined at the bar of the Senate or the House."*  
> *"Any committee of the Senate or the House of Commons may administer an oath to any witness examined before the committee."*  
> *"Where any witness to be examined under this Part conscientiously objects to take an oath, the witness may make a solemn affirmation and declaration."*  
> *"Any solemn affirmation and declaration made under subsection (1) has the same force and effect, and entails the same consequences, as an oath taken in the usual form."*  
> *"Any person examined under this Part who wilfully gives false evidence is liable to such punishment as may be imposed for perjury."*

- **Oath Administration**: Both Houses and their committees have the authority to **administer oaths** to witnesses.
- **Affirmations**: Witnesses who object to oaths (e.g., on religious grounds) may use **affirmations**, which are **legally equivalent** to oaths.
- **Perjury Liability**: False testimony is treated as **perjury**, with full legal consequences.

> *"Any oath or solemn affirmation and declaration under this Part may be administered by: (a) the Speaker of the Senate or the House of Commons; (b) the chairman of any committee of the Senate or the House of Commons; or (c) such person or persons as may be appointed for that purpose either by the Speaker of the Senate or by the Speaker of the House of Commons or by standing or other order of the Senate or the House."*

- **Delegation of Authority**: Oaths can be administered by **appointed individuals**, including committee chairs or designated officers.
- **Formalization**: All oaths must follow **specific forms** (Forms 1 and 2 in the Schedule).

### **5. Prohibition of Compensation for Parliamentary Services**

> *"No member of the Senate shall receive or agree to receive any compensation, directly or indirectly, for services rendered or to be rendered to any person, either by the member or another person, in relation to any bill, proceeding, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest or other matter before the Senate or the House of Commons or a committee of either House; or for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence any member of either House."*
