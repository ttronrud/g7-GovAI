### **Detailed Summary of the *Air Canada Public Participation Act***

The *Air Canada Public Participation Act* (the "Act") is a legislative instrument that governs the corporate structure, operations, governance, and regulatory obligations of **Air Canada**, transitioning it from a government-owned entity under the *Air Canada Act* to a fully incorporated corporation under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA). It establishes a framework for public participation, ensures continuity of operations, and preserves key policy objectives—particularly related to aircraft maintenance, official languages, and competition—while modernizing Air Canada’s legal status.

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The primary purpose of the Act is to:
- **Modernize Air Canada’s legal structure** by transitioning it from a special-purpose corporation governed by the *Air Canada Act* to a standard business corporation under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*.
- **Ensure continuity of operations** and key service obligations, especially in aircraft maintenance and air services.
- **Preserve public interest and accountability** through provisions on governance, official languages, and competition.
- **Facilitate public participation** in decision-making and ensure transparency in corporate activities.

The Act is **not a standalone regulatory statute** but rather a transitional and enabling law that allows Air Canada to operate as a corporation while preserving its national significance and operational requirements.

---

## **2. Key Definitions**

- **Corporation**: Refers to Air Canada or any corporation continued by the *Air Canada Act*.
- **Minister**: Initially the President of the Queen’s Privy Council, but may be designated by the Governor in Council as the Minister for the purposes of this Act. This role grants the Minister authority over key decisions regarding the Corporation.
- **Words and expressions** used in the Act have the same meaning as in the *Canada Business Corporations Act*, unless otherwise defined.
- **Inconsistency with CBCA**: If there is a conflict between this Act and the CBCA, **this Act prevails** to the extent of the inconsistency.
- **Competition Act**: This Act does **not affect** the operation of the *Competition Act* in relation to any acquisition of interest in Air Canada.

---

## **3. Transfer of Shares to the Minister**

A key provision of the Act is the **transfer of shares** held by the **Minister of Transport in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada** to the **Minister personally**.

- The shares are transferred **notwithstanding subsection 13(3) of the Air Canada Act**.
- The shares are **registered in the name of the Minister** and are **held in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This ensures continuity of ownership and government oversight while allowing the Minister to manage and act on behalf of the Crown.

---

## **4. Continuance of the Corporation under CBCA**

The Corporation must submit an application for a **certificate of continuance** under **section 187 of the CBCA** to the **Minister for approval**.

Once approved:
- The Corporation must submit the approved application to the **Director of Corporations**.
- The application is **deemed to have been made under section 187(1) of the CBCA**, giving it legal standing.

This process ensures that Air Canada’s legal status as a corporation is formally recognized and maintained under federal corporate law.

## **5. Articles of Continuance – Key Provisions**

The articles of continuance (the governing bylaws of the corporation) must include the following:

> ✅ **Mandatory Aircraft Maintenance Activities**  
> The Corporation must carry out or cause to be carried out aircraft maintenance activities—including airframe, engine, components, equipment, or parts—**in Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba**.

> ✅ **Head Office Location**

> While maintaining the required maintenance in Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba, the Corporation may:

> - Adjust the **level of employment** in those activities.
>  
> This allows operational flexibility without compromising the core requirement of maintaining maintenance capacity in these provinces.

> 🔍 **Definition of "Aircraft"**  
> The term "aircraft" has the same meaning as in subsection 3(1) of the *Aeronautics Act*.

> ❌ **Prohibition on Inconsistent Amendments**  
> The Corporation, its shareholders, and directors **shall not**:
> - Apply for continuance in another jurisdiction.
> - Adopt any articles or by-laws inconsistent with the provisions in the articles of continuance.

The Minister is authorized to:
- Acquire, hold, dispose of, or otherwise deal with **shares or debt obligations** of the Corporation.

## **7. Authority to Issue Shares**

The Corporation is authorized to **issue and sell shares** or otherwise dispose of them, enabling it to raise capital as a fully incorporated entity.

## **8. Use of the Name "Air Canada"**
