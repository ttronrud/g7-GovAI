**Detailed Summary of the *Highway 30 Completion Bridges Act***

---

### **1. Purpose and Citation**
The *Highway 30 Completion Bridges Act* is an Act of Parliament of Canada enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It is formally cited as the **Highway 30 Completion Bridges Act**, and its primary purpose is to authorize the Province of Quebec to complete key transportation infrastructure by constructing and maintaining two major bridges and associated works along Highway 30.

---

### **2. Authorized Projects**
The Act authorizes the **Province of Quebec** to undertake the following construction and maintenance activities:

#### **(a) Bridge over the St. Lawrence River**
- Construction and maintenance of a bridge to facilitate the movement of persons and vehicles **between the municipality of Les Cèdres and the city of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield (specifically the Saint-Timothée sector)**.
- This bridge will cross the **St. Lawrence River**, a major waterway in eastern Canada.

#### **(b) Bridge over the Beauharnois Canal**
- Construction and maintenance of a bridge to connect **Salaberry-de-Valleyfield (Saint-Timothée sector)** with the city of **Beauharnois**.
- This bridge will span the **Beauharnois Canal**, which is part of the larger St. Lawrence River system and serves both transportation and navigation purposes.

#### **(c) Approaches and Ancillary Works**
- The Province is also authorized to construct and maintain **approaches** (such as ramps, embankments, and landings) and **other ancillary works** necessary to support the operation and safety of the bridges.

### **3. Pre-Construction Requirements**
Before any construction can begin, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Submission of Documents to the Minister of Transport**  
   The Province must submit the following documents for examination by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet):
   - **Plans and specifications** for the bridges and ancillary works, including:
     - Vertical clearance (height of clearance for vessels or boats)
     - Geodesic reference (precise geographic coordinates for alignment)
   - A **map** showing the proposed location of the bridges and ancillary works.
   - A **bathymetric chart** of the waterways (depth measurements) at the proposed bridge sites.
   - **Any other documents or information** deemed necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed construction.

2. **Approval by the Governor in Council**  
   The **location** of the bridges and ancillary works, as well as the **plans and specifications**, must be formally **approved by the Governor in Council** before construction can commence.

---

### **4. Restrictions on Modifications**
To ensure consistency, safety, and regulatory compliance, the Act imposes strict limitations on changes to the project:

- **No change in location** of the bridges may be made without **new approval from the Governor in Council**.
- **No substantial change** to the plans or specifications (e.g., structural design, materials, dimensions) may be made without **new approval from the Governor in Council**.

These provisions ensure that any modifications to the project are subject to rigorous federal oversight and do not compromise navigation, safety, or environmental considerations.

---

### **5. Regulatory Authority**
The **Governor in Council** has the authority to:
- Make **regulations** concerning:
  - The **construction** of the bridges and ancillary works
  - The **maintenance** of the bridges and associated infrastructure
- These regulations may address technical, safety, environmental, or operational aspects necessary for effective and safe operation.

---

### **6. Legal Limitations and Compatibility**
To avoid conflicts or overlaps with existing laws, the Act explicitly states:

> *"For greater certainty, nothing in this Act limits the application of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act or any other Act of Parliament in respect of the construction and maintenance of the bridges and ancillary works authorized by this Act."*

This means:
- The projects are **not exempt** from the **Canadian Navigable Waters Act (CNWA)** or other federal laws.
- The **CNWA** (which governs navigation, waterway use, and environmental protection on navigable waters) **remains fully applicable** to these bridge projects.
- The Act does not override federal environmental, navigational, or maritime regulations.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Context**
- **Transportation Development**: This Act completes the Highway 30 corridor, improving regional connectivity between Les Cèdres, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, and Beauharnois — supporting economic development, emergency response, and public access.
- **Navigation Considerations**: The requirement for bathymetric charts and vertical clearance plans shows that the project must accommodate **maritime traffic**, including commercial and recreational vessels.
- **Federal Oversight**: Despite being a provincial project, the Act reflects a **federal role in approving major infrastructure** affecting navigable waters, emphasizing intergovernmental coordination.
- **Environmental and Safety Compliance**: The detailed documentation and approval process ensures that environmental impacts, structural integrity, and navigational safety are thoroughly assessed.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Highway 30 Completion Bridges Act* is a targeted piece of legislation that authorizes the Province of Quebec to build two critical bridges and associated infrastructure to complete Highway 30. It establishes a clear, transparent, and federally supervised process for project approval and implementation, with strong safeguards to protect navigation rights, environmental standards, and public safety. The Act underscores the balance between provincial transportation needs and federal regulatory oversight—particularly in relation to navigable waters.

This legislation is a key step in modernizing regional transportation while ensuring compliance with national laws governing waterways and infrastructure development.
