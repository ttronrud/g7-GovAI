**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act***  
*(Cited as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act* (CMHC Act) establishes the **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** as a federal Crown corporation tasked with promoting affordable housing and supporting the mortgage and housing finance sector in Canada. It outlines the structure, governance, powers, financial mechanisms, and operational responsibilities of the Corporation, with a focus on enabling it to act as a key agent in implementing national housing policy through lending, research, and financial innovation.

The Act was originally enacted in 1944 and has undergone several amendments over time, most notably in 2006, 2010, and 2012, which have modernized governance and removed outdated provisions (e.g., the Chairman role, restrictions on public service appointments).
