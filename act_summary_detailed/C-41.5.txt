**Detailed Summary of the *Cooperative Energy Act* (Canada, 1982)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Cooperative Energy Act* (1982) is a federal statute enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. The Act establishes two distinct cooperative corporations — the **Cooperative Energy Corporation (CEC)** and the **Cooperative Energy Development Corporation (CEDC)** — with the primary objective of promoting energy development through cooperative ownership and investment. It was introduced in response to the need for structured, cooperative-led energy projects, particularly in the oil and gas sectors, and is rooted in the broader policy framework of supporting cooperative enterprises in Canada.

The Act is notable for its unique blend of corporate governance, cooperative principles, and regulatory flexibility, especially in relation to share ownership, restrictions on transfers, and the role of the federal government in financing and oversight.
