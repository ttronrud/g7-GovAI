### **Detailed Summary of the *Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada Act***

---

#### **Overview**
The *Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada Act* (ATSSA) establishes a centralized federal support service to provide administrative, operational, and logistical support to various **administrative tribunals** in Canada. This Act consolidates and streamlines the functions previously scattered across different departments and agencies by creating a single, dedicated entity—the **Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada (Service)**—to ensure efficient, consistent, and effective support for tribunals in carrying out their statutory duties.

The Act is designed to improve the performance, transparency, and accountability of administrative tribunals while preserving their independence and jurisdiction. It also ensures continuity of employment, financial resources, and service delivery during the transition from decentralized support structures to a unified federal service.
