**Detailed Summary of the *Motor Vehicle Transport Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Motor Vehicle Transport Act* (MVT Act) is a federal law in Canada that establishes a **national regulatory framework for extra-provincial motor carrier undertakings**, including **buses and trucks** that operate across provincial borders. The Act aims to ensure **safety, consistency, and fairness** in the regulation of interprovincial transportation services by aligning provincial and federal oversight under a unified, performance-based system.

This Act was significantly amended and restructured in 2001, with several provisions (particularly those related to truck transport and local undertakings) being **repealed or modified**. The current version focuses primarily on **extra-provincial bus and truck operations**, with strong emphasis on **safety performance standards**, **certification**, and **cooperation between federal and provincial authorities**.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Extra-provincial bus transport** | Transport of passengers or passengers and goods by a bus that connects provinces or extends beyond provincial boundaries. |
| **Extra-provincial bus undertaking** | A business or operation that transports passengers or goods by bus across provincial lines. |
| **Extra-provincial truck transport/undertaking** | Repealed in 2001; previously defined as motor vehicle transport of goods outside a province. Now excluded. |
| **Local bus transport/undertaking** | Transport of passengers or goods by bus within a single province only. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Transport, responsible for implementing and overseeing the Act. |
| **Provincial authority** | A body (e.g., provincial transportation ministry or board) that has jurisdiction over local motor carrier operations under provincial law. |
| **Safety fitness certificate** | A federal-style certification issued by a provincial authority to allow an extra-provincial carrier to operate safely across Canada. |

> **Note:** The Act defines an "extra-provincial undertaking" as one that operates **into, in, across, or out of a province**, regardless of where the primary operations are based.

## **Primary Objectives**

The core goals of the Act are:

1. **Ensure compliance with the National Transportation Policy** (as set out in Section 5 of the *Canada Transportation Act*).
2. **Establish a safety-focused regulatory regime** based on the **National Safety Code for Motor Carriers**.
3. **Ensure consistent operating standards** are applied uniformly across all Canadian provinces.

These objectives emphasize **safety performance assessments** over rigid compliance with static rules, promoting a results-based approach to regulation.

## **Federal-Provincial Cooperation Mechanisms**

### 1. **Transportation Policy Statements**
- The **Minister of Transport**, after consultation with provinces, may issue **transportation policy statements** consistent with the Act’s objectives.
- These statements guide how provincial authorities regulate extra-provincial carriers.
- **Provincial authorities must take these policy statements into account** when issuing safety certificates or regulating operations.

### 2. **Research and Agreements**
- The Minister may conduct **research, studies, and evaluations** to support the Act’s goals.
- The Minister may enter into **agreements with provincial governments** or other entities to support safety, efficiency, and interoperability.
- The Minister may also enter into **international arrangements** with foreign states to:
  - Recognize **safety fitness certificates** issued by foreign states (or vice versa).
  - Promote mutual recognition of safety standards.

> Example: A Canadian carrier operating in the U.S. may have its safety certificate recognized by Canada, and vice versa, facilitating cross-border operations.

## **Regulatory Framework for Extra-Provincial Carriers**

### 1. **Licensing Requirements**
- In provinces where **local bus undertakings require a licence**, an **extra-provincial bus undertaking must operate under a licence issued under this Act**, not under provincial law.
- Provincial authorities may issue such licences **on the same terms and conditions** as if the undertaking were a local one.

### 2. **Tariff and Toll Regulation**
- If a provincial authority regulates **local bus tariffs**, it may do so **equally for extra-provincial bus transport**, ensuring fair pricing and market access.

### 3. **Safety Fitness Certificates**
- **Mandatory Requirement**: No extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking may operate without a **safety fitness certificate** issued by a provincial authority under this Act or an **analogous document** prescribed by regulation.
- The certificate:
  - Does **not need a specific form**.
  - Is **valid throughout Canada**.
- Provincial authorities may:
  - Issue certificates based on safety criteria.
  - **Revoke** certificates if safety standards are breached.

### 4. **Review of Certificate Decisions**
- Provincial authorities must follow:
  - Their **existing rules for review** of licensing or certificate decisions.
  - If no such rules exist, they must follow the **procedures used for reviewing motor carrier licences** in the province.

### 5. **Ministerial Intervention: Withdrawal of Certificate-Issuing Powers**
- If the Minister determines, after consultation with provinces, that a provincial authority is **not issuing certificates in accordance with this Act**, the Minister may **withdraw its power** to issue certificates.
- This order takes effect upon **publication in the Canada Gazette**.
- Upon withdrawal, the affected carrier must:
  - **File a declaration within 60 days** with **another provincial authority** indicating it will be supervised by that body.

### 6. **Reinstatement of Authority**
- If a provincial authority **remedies its failure** and submits a **recovery plan**, the Minister may **revoke the withdrawal order** by regulation.

## **Exemptions and Flexibility**

- The Minister may **exempt** any extra-provincial carrier from certain provisions of the Act or regulations **if**:
  - The exemption is in the **public interest**.
  - It does **not compromise motor carrier safety**.
- Exemptions may be **temporary, limited in area, or specific to certain classes** of carriers.
- Any exemption must include **specific terms and conditions**.

## **Regulatory Powers of the Minister**

The Governor in Council (on recommendation of the Minister) may make **regulations** to achieve the Act’s objectives, including:

| Regulation Type | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|
| Classifying extra-provincial undertakings | To define which types of carriers fall under the Act. |
| Criteria for issuing safety fitness certificates | Ensures consistent, transparent, and safe evaluation processes. |
| Prescribing analogous foreign documents | Enables mutual recognition of safety certificates abroad. |
| Safe operation rules | Covers audits, inspections, access to premises, and information sharing. |
| Fitness criteria for certificates | Defines what makes a carrier "fit" to operate. |
| Insurance and bonding requirements | Mandates minimum coverage (e.g., liability, property damage). |
| Information reporting requirements | Requires carriers and authorities to provide data to the Minister or foreign bodies. |
| Conditions of carriage and liability limits | Standardizes terms and limits for passenger/goods transport. |
| Environmental regulations | Restricts or governs emissions and pollutants from vehicles. |

> **Note:** Regulations may **incorporate by reference**:
> - National safety standards.
> - Provincial laws on motor vehicle undertakings (where not inconsistent).

## **International Relations and Fair Trade**

- If a foreign government engages in **unfair, discriminatory, or restrictive practices** toward Canadian carriers:
  - The Minister (with **Minister of Foreign Affairs**) may initiate consultations to eliminate such practices.
  - If consultations fail, the **Governor in Council** may issue an **order** (even overriding other laws) to:
    - Prohibit or restrict the issuance of safety certificates to foreign carriers.
    - Suspend existing certificates.
    - Reinstatement of suspended certificates.

> This provision protects Canadian carriers from **foreign barriers** to entry or unfair competition.
