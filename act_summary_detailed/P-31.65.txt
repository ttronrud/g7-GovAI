**Detailed Summary of the *Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act* (PSeca) is a landmark piece of legislation enacted by Parliament to ensure **equal pay for work of equal value** in Canada’s federal public sector. It establishes a proactive, gender-equity-based framework to address disparities in compensation between male and female employees—particularly in jobs where women are disproportionately represented.

The Act operates within the existing structure of federal public sector labour relations, leveraging mechanisms such as collective bargaining, assessments, reporting, and dispute resolution to promote equitable compensation without relying solely on traditional pay equity laws or retroactive adjustments.

## **Key Objectives and Principles**

1. **Equal Pay for Equal Value of Work**  
   The Act affirms that women in the federal public sector should receive equal pay for work of equal value. This goes beyond simple salary parity and focuses on assessing the **true value of work** based on skills, effort, responsibility, and market conditions.

2. **Proactive Approach**  
   Rather than waiting for complaints or legal challenges, the Act mandates **proactive steps** by employers to identify and correct compensation inequities—especially in female-preponderant job groups.

3. **Market-Driven Context**  
   Recognizing that public sector employers operate in a market-driven economy, the Act incorporates **market forces and recruitment needs** into its assessment framework, ensuring that compensation decisions are both fair and realistic.

## **Key Provisions and Mechanisms**

### **1. Employer Obligations for Non-Unionized Employees**

Every employer must take **measures to provide equitable compensation** to its non-unionized employees. This obligation applies directly to all employees not covered by a collective agreement.

#### **Mandatory Posting of Notices**
- Employers must post a public notice (in a prescribed manner) stating:
  - The text of the Act’s key provision on equitable compensation.
  - The rights employees have under the Act.

> This ensures transparency and awareness among employees.

---

### **2. Equitable Compensation Assessment**

An **equitable compensation assessment** is a formal, gender-neutral evaluation of the value of work performed in a job group or job class.

#### **Assessment Criteria**
The assessment must consider:
- The **composite of skill, effort, and responsibility** required in performing the work, and the conditions under which it is carried out.
- The **employer’s recruitment and retention needs**, including:
  - Qualifications required for the role.
  - Market forces affecting supply and demand for those qualifications.

> The goal is to determine whether employees are being compensated fairly relative to the value of their work—regardless of gender.

#### **Scope Restrictions (Who Can Be Assessed?)**
- **Departments/Agencies (Schedule I/IV):** Only job groups/classes *other than* those described in a specific exception (e.g., certain administrative roles) can be assessed.
- **Separate Agencies (Schedule V):** Only within the specific agency.
- **Canadian Forces:** Only among officers and non-commissioned members.
- **RCMP:** Only among members of the RCMP.

> These limitations ensure focused, manageable assessments and avoid overreach.

### **3. Determining Female Predominance**

Every employer must determine whether any job group contains **at least 70% female employees** (female predominant).

#### **If No Female Predominant Groups Exist**
- The employer must post a notice stating that no such groups exist.
- The notice must remain posted for **at least 90 days**.

#### **If a Female Predominant Group Exists**

### **4. Employee Rights and Requests**

Non-unionized employees have specific rights to challenge or request equitable compensation:

#### **Request to Address Compensation Inequity**
- An employee may request that their employer take steps to provide equitable compensation **within a reasonable time** if:

#### **Employer Response Requirement**
- Within a prescribed period, the employer must:
  - Consider the request.

### **6. Collective Bargaining and Unionized Employees**

For unionized employees, the Act integrates equitable compensation into the collective bargaining process.

#### **Pre-Bargaining Preparation**
- Before collective bargaining begins, both the employer and the bargaining agent must conduct preparatory work to ensure equitable compensation issues are raised or addressed.

#### **Notice of Female Predominant Job Groups**
- Any party intending to negotiate on equitable compensation must **immediately notify** the other party of the specific female predominant job group involved.

#### **Reporting During Bargaining**
- If a compensation issue arises during negotiations, the party raising it must provide:
  - Identification of the job group.
  - Description of the assessment methodology.
  - Proposed resolution.

> This ensures transparency and fairness in negotiations.

### **7. Collective Agreement Requirements**

- Any provision in a collective agreement on equitable compensation **must not contradict** sections 113 and 238.19 of the *Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act* (FPLRA).

- The collective agreement must include:
  - A report on how assessments were conducted.
