**Detailed Summary of the Act:**

This document is a formal legislative enactment passed by the Parliament of Canada—specifically, by the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons—declaring the ownership and appropriation of a specific parcel of land known as the **Ontario Government House site** in Toronto. The act serves to legally confirm and solidify the provincial government’s control over this land under the authority granted by the *British North America Act, 1867* (now known as the *Constitution Act, 1867*).

### **Key Elements of the Act:**

#### 1. **Description of the Land**
- The land in question is located in the city of **Toronto**.
- It is bounded by four streets:
  - **Wellington Street**
  - **John Street**
  - **King Street**
  - **Simcoe Street**
- The total area of the land is approximately **266,151 square feet** (measured in English units), with the phrase "more or less" indicating that the measurement is approximate.

> This precise boundary description ensures that the land in question is clearly defined and legally identifiable, which is essential for property rights and governmental use.

#### 2. **Appropriation for Provincial Use**
- The site is **appropriated** (i.e., formally designated and assigned) for the use of the **Government of the Province of Ontario**.
- The term *“appropriated”* is used in accordance with the legal definition provided in **Section 92(1) of the British North America Act, 1867**, which grants provinces the power to appropriate land for public purposes, including government buildings and institutions.

> This appropriation is not merely a transfer of ownership but a formal legal act recognizing the land as belonging to the provincial government for administrative, legislative, or executive purposes—specifically, the operation of government institutions.

#### 3. **Legal Basis and Authority**
- The act cites the *British North America Act, 1867* and its associated schedules as the legal foundation for the appropriation.
- This demonstrates that the action is constitutionally valid and falls within the jurisdiction of the provinces under the division of powers in the Canadian Constitution.

> The reference to the Act and its schedules provides constitutional legitimacy, ensuring that the transfer and use of the land are consistent with federal-provincial constitutional arrangements.

#### 4. **Reference to Prior Orders and Letters Patent**
- The act references two key historical instruments:
  - **An Order in Council dated February 14, 1871**: This document formally appropriated and transferred the land to the Government of Ontario.
  - **Letters Patent dated January 15, 1908**: These documents officially declared the transfer of the land to the province.

> The act declares that **these earlier instruments constitute a valid appropriation** under the *British North America Act, 1867*. It retroactively affirms their legal effect, stating that from the date of the 1871 Order in Council onward, the land has been and remains the property of the Province of Ontario.

#### 5. **Legal Effect and Ownership**
- The land is **declared to have been and to be now the property of the Province of Ontario**.
- This declaration establishes a permanent and binding legal status: the land is no longer under federal or private control but is fully owned and managed by the provincial government.

> This reaffirms the province’s sovereign authority over the site and ensures continuity in governance, particularly in relation to the operation of the **Government House**, which historically has served as the official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.

### **Significance and Implications:**

- **Historical Continuity**: The act formalizes a long-standing transfer of land from federal to provincial control, reinforcing the constitutional principle that provinces have authority over land use and government infrastructure within their boundaries.
  
- **Legal Clarity**: By citing specific historical documents (the 1871 Order and 1908 Letters Patent), the act provides a clear chain of title and legal history, reducing ambiguity about ownership and use.

- **Provincial Sovereignty**: It underscores the provincial government’s right to manage its own administrative and ceremonial spaces, such as the official residence of the provincial executive.

- **Public Purpose**: The land is designated for government use, not private development or commercial purposes, aligning with public service and administrative functions.

### **Conclusion:**

This act is a **constitutional and legal affirmation** that the land bounded by Wellington, John, King, and Simcoe Streets in Toronto—measuring approximately 266,151 square feet—is the **property of the Province of Ontario**. It confirms the validity of prior federal transfers through the 1871 Order in Council and the 1908 Letters Patent, and formally designates the site for the use of the provincial government under the authority of the *British North America Act, 1867*. The act serves as a foundational legal instrument in establishing the status of Ontario Government House as a provincial government asset, ensuring its continued use for official and administrative purposes.
