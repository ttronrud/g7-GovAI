The provided text appears to be a **summary or excerpt from a Canadian statute**, specifically an enactment (an Act of Parliament) that has been **fully repealed**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Text Analysis:**

The passage begins with the standard legal preamble:

> *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*

This is the formal opening of a Canadian Act of Parliament, indicating that the legislation was passed by the federal government through the legislative process (with the monarch acting on the advice of the elected government).

However, **the body of the enactment is entirely composed of repeated lines** such as:

> `[Repealed, 2014, c. 39, s. 169]`  
> `[Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 181]`  
> etc.

These are **repeal annotations**, meaning that the provisions or sections of the original Act have been **officially removed or canceled** by subsequent legislation.

### Key Facts:

1. **The Act is Repealed**  
   The entire document indicates that the Act (or its provisions) has been **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force.  
   - It was **repealed in 2014** by **Bill C-39**, specifically **section 169** of that Act.  
   - One section was also repealed in **2012** by **Bill C-19**, section 181.

2. **No Enactments or Provisions Are Present**  
   There is **no substantive law** (no definitions, rights, obligations, penalties, or rules) listed in the text.  
   The entire content consists of **repeal notices**, suggesting that this document was likely a **former section or provision** of a prior Act that has since been removed.

3. **Likely Historical or Transitional Text**  
   This may be a **historical footnote**, a **draft or obsolete version** of a law, or a **section reference** from a larger Act that has since been replaced or removed.

4. **C-39 (2014)** and **C-19 (2012)**  
   - **Bill C-39 (2014)**: Known as the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2014*, which included several amendments and repeals to the *Criminal Code*.  
   - **Bill C-19 (2012)**: The *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2012*, which also included various legislative changes and repeals.

   The repeated references to section 169 of C-39 and section 181 of C-19 suggest that the original Act (which is now obsolete) had specific provisions that were removed by these later amendments.

### Conclusion:

✅ **Summary**:

> This document is **not an active law**. It is a **repealed section** of a former Canadian Act, indicating that the legislation was formally removed from the legal framework in **2012 and 2014** through amendments to the *Criminal Code*.  
>  
> The text contains **no substantive legal provisions**, only repeated **repeal notices**.  
>  
> The original Act (or its specific sections) was **fully repealed** by:  
> - **Section 169 of Bill C-39 (2014)**  
> - **Section 181 of Bill C-19 (2012)**  
>  
> As such, **this provision is no longer in force** and has no current legal effect in Canadian law.
