**Detailed Summary of the *Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994***

---

### **Overview**

The *Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994* (MBCA) is a federal law of Canada that implements the **Convention on Migratory Birds** — an international treaty signed by Canada and other countries to protect migratory bird species and their habitats. This Act establishes a legal framework to conserve and protect migratory birds and their nests within Canada and in Canada’s **exclusive economic zone (EEZ)**, ensuring compliance with international obligations.

It is a key piece of environmental legislation designed to prevent harm to migratory bird populations through prohibitions on trade, harm to birds or their nests, and pollution of habitats. The Act also includes enforcement mechanisms, including powers for game officers, and protections for employees who report violations.
