**Detailed Summary of the Aeronautics Act**

---

### **Overview**

The **Aeronautics Act** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the legal framework for the regulation, development, and oversight of all aspects of aeronautics within Canada. It grants broad powers to the federal government—primarily through the **Minister of Transport** and, where applicable, the **Minister of National Defence**—to manage civil and military aviation activities, ensure safety, promote efficiency, and regulate air traffic and related services.

The Act is binding on **Her Majesty in right of Canada** and on **provincial governments**, meaning it applies uniformly across Canada and governs both federal and provincial responsibilities in aviation matters.

## **Key Definitions and Key Terms**

The Act begins with a comprehensive list of definitions that clarify core concepts used throughout the legislation:
