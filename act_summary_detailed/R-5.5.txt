The **Representation Act, 1974** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that fundamentally restructured the electoral representation of provinces in the House of Commons, particularly in response to population shifts and the need for fairer representation following the 1971 census. Below is a **detailed summary** of the key provisions and their significance:

---

### **1. Citation and Legal Framework**
- The Act is titled **"The Representation Act, 1974"**.
- A **"Part"** within the Act is cited as the **"Constitution Act, 1974"**, indicating its constitutional importance. This reflects the Act’s role in altering the constitutional framework governing representation in Canada.

---

### **2. Commencement and Suspension of Prior Laws**
Upon coming into force on **December 31, 1974**, the following changes occur:
- **Sections 20 to 27 of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act (EBRA)** are **no longer suspended**.  
  → This means these provisions (which relate to the legal basis and procedures for adjusting electoral boundaries) become active and enforceable again.
- **Sections 5 to 7 of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act (EBRSA)** are **repealed**.  
  → This removes the legal mechanism that had previously suspended the application of the EBRA, effectively ending the suspension of boundary adjustments that had been in place since earlier years.

> This change ensures that electoral boundary adjustments can now proceed without legal impediments.

---

### **3. Application of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act (EBRA)**
A major constitutional shift is introduced:

> The EBRA shall be applied **as if subsection 51(1) of the British North America Act, 1867 (as amended by Part I of this Act)** had been in force **immediately after the 1971 decennial census**.

#### Key Implications:
- **Factual Timeline Adjustment**: The Act treats the 1971 census as if it had been followed by the immediate application of the new representation rules (under subsection 51(1))—even though in reality, those rules had not been implemented until later.
- **New Boundaries Based on 1971 Census**: Electoral boundaries commissions are established and operate **as though nothing had been done under the EBRA since 1971**. This means:
  - The process starts from a clean slate.
  - All boundary adjustments are based on the 1971 population data.
  - The commissions have full authority to redraw boundaries to reflect population changes and ensure equitable representation.

#### Notable Provision:
> The **certified return of the Chief Statistician of Canada** (from the 1971 census) is deemed to have been **sent to and received by the Secretary of State of Canada and the Representation Commissioner on the date this Act comes into force** (December 31, 1974).

→ This legal fiction ensures that the 1971 census data is treated as if it were received immediately upon the Act’s commencement, allowing the boundary adjustment process to begin legally and without delay.

---

### **4. Stability of Representation Until Adjustment**
- The **number of members in the House of Commons** and the **provincial representation** (i.e., how many seats each province holds) **remain unchanged** until the next readjustment under subsection 51(1) of the British North America Act.
- This provides **stability** during the transition period, preventing sudden changes in representation that could disrupt government operations or political balance.

---

### **5. Future Review of Representation Rules (Subsection 51(1))**
This is a forward-looking provision designed to ensure ongoing accountability and adaptability of representation rules.

> The **President of the Privy Council** is required to:
> - **Propose to the House of Commons** (on or before the **20th sitting day after June 30, 1979**, if Parliament is in session; or the **25th sitting day after Parliament is summoned**, if not)  
>   → An **order** to be made and referred to the **appropriate committee of the House of Commons** for review.

#### Purpose of the Review:
- The committee is to examine the **rules provided by subsection 51(1)** of the British North America Act (as amended by this Act), which governs how seats are apportioned among provinces.
- The committee must consider whether **amendments, alterations, or modifications** to these rules are **necessary or desirable** in light of:
  - Population changes.
  - Regional disparities.
  - Fairness and equity in representation.

#### Outcome:
- The committee must **report its recommendations** to the House of Commons on the matter.

> This establishes a **formal, periodic review mechanism** for representation rules, ensuring that they remain responsive to demographic and political realities.

---

### **6. Commencement Date**
- The Act **comes into force on December 31, 1974**.

> This date marks the official start of the new electoral boundary adjustment process based on the 1971 census and the constitutional amendments introduced by this Act.
