### **Overview**

The *Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act* (FPASA) is a Canadian statute enacted to protect Canadian advertisers and the Canadian market from foreign publishers who supply advertising services—specifically, advertising space or opportunities in periodicals—that are directed at Canadian consumers.

### **3. Core Prohibition (Section 3)**

> **No foreign publisher may supply advertising services directed at the Canadian market to a Canadian advertiser or a person acting on their behalf.**

This is the **central prohibition** of the Act.

#### Exceptions:
- **Deemed exceptions** apply only to certain types of foreign publishers or situations:
  - **Investment in Canadian cultural heritage**: A foreign publisher who invests in periodical publishing that:
    - Is prescribed under **paragraph 15(a) of the Investment Canada Act** as a cultural or national identity-related business;
    - Has been reviewed under **Part IV of the Investment Canada Act**;
    - Is approved or deemed approved by the relevant Minister as likely to benefit Canada.
    → This investment is **exempt** from the Act’s restrictions.

- **Low revenue thresholds (transition phase)**:
  - If, during the 18 months following the Act’s coming into force:
    - Revenues from advertising directed at Canada ≤ **12%** of total advertising revenues → exempt;
    - During the next 18 months → ≤ **15%**;
    - After that → ≤ **18%**.
  → This allows a **gradual transition** for foreign publishers whose Canadian market exposure is minimal.

- **Pre-existing lawful activity**:
  - Foreign publishers who lawfully supplied advertising services directed at Canada **during the year before the Act was introduced in Parliament** may continue such activities.
