**Detailed Summary of the War Veterans Allowance Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *War Veterans Allowance Act* is a Canadian federal statute designed to provide financial support to **veterans, their survivors, and certain dependents** who have served in armed forces or were affected by military service. The Act establishes eligibility criteria, calculation methods for allowances, and specific provisions for dependents, orphans, and survivors, with a strong emphasis on **equity, compassion, and the fulfillment of the Government’s recognized obligation** to those who have served the nation.

The Act has undergone several amendments and repeals over time, particularly in relation to definitions and transitional provisions (e.g., the repeal of outdated terms such as "current fiscal year" or "widow/widower" definitions), but its core structure remains focused on providing **long-term, needs-based financial assistance** to eligible individuals.

## **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Liberal Construction**  
   The Act is to be **liberally construed and interpreted** to ensure that the Government’s moral and legal duty to veterans and their dependents is fully fulfilled. This principle ensures flexibility in application and supports broader access to benefits when appropriate.

2. **Equality of Status and Rights**  
   Male and female veterans enjoy **equal status and rights** under the Act. This reflects a commitment to gender equality in the recognition and treatment of veterans.

3. **Focus on Vulnerable Groups**  
   Special attention is given to:
   - Veterans with disabilities
   - Survivors (spouses, common-law partners)
   - Orphans
   - Dependent children
   - Individuals who are physically or mentally incapacitated

4. **Residency Requirement**  
   All allowances are payable only to individuals who are **resident in Canada**, emphasizing that the benefits are intended for those living within the country.

## **Eligibility for Allowance**

An allowance is payable to:

### 1. **Veterans and Survivors**
- **Male veterans or survivors** aged **60 years or older**
- **Female veterans or survivors** aged **55 years or older**

### 2. **Veterans or Survivors with Disabilities**
The Minister may authorize an allowance if the individual:
- Is **permanently unemployable** due to physical or mental disability
- Is **incapable of maintaining themselves** due to disability or economic hardship
- Is **unable to maintain themselves** due to the need to care for a **dependent child residing at home**

### 3. **Orphans**
An orphan is eligible if:
- The child is bereft of both parents or one parent (with abandonment or desertion)
- The surviving parent is deemed to have abandoned the child
- The child is a child of divorced or separated parents
- The child is under 18, under 25 and making satisfactory progress in approved education, or under 21 with physical/mental incapacity preventing employment
- The incapacity occurred before age 21 or after age 21 but before age 25 while in approved education

## **Calculation of Monthly Allowance**

The monthly allowance is calculated as follows:

1. **Determine the Applicable Monthly Income Factor**  
   Found in **Column II of the Schedule** based on the veteran’s or survivor’s category (e.g., veteran, survivor, orphan).

2. **Determine the Monthly Allowance Ceiling**  
   Subtract from the income factor:
   - One-twelfth of the **income for the base calendar year** of the veteran (or survivor/orphan), including spouse or common-law partner, if applicable.

3. **Subtract Existing Benefits**  
   Deduct any benefits already received, such as:
   - Old Age Security (OAS) benefits
   - Benefits deemed payable under regulations (e.g., under paragraph 25(p))
   - Benefits under the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
   - Other similar or equivalent benefits from the country where the veteran served

> This ensures that allowances do not duplicate existing government support.

## **Special Provisions**

### 1. **Allowance for Absentees (Post-July 31, 1960)**
A veteran or survivor who leaves Canada after July 31, 1960, may still receive the allowance **if**:
- They were a recipient at the time of departure
- They had resided in Canada for the **12 months immediately before departure**

This provision recognizes the possibility of relocation or migration while maintaining entitlement.

---

### 2. **Allowance for Survivors Residing Outside Canada**
- If a **survivor** resides outside Canada and was living with or being maintained by the deceased recipient at the time of death, they may still receive an allowance.
- If an **orphan** resides outside Canada and the recipient was receiving or would have been eligible for an additional allowance, the orphan may receive support.

> This reflects a recognition of international family ties and the need to maintain support for dependents abroad.

---

### 3. **Joint Allowance for Spouses or Common-Law Partners (Both Veterans)**
- If both spouses or common-law partners are veterans, **each may receive the allowance** that would apply if each were a veteran without a spouse or partner.
- If one veteran is not entitled to an allowance, **each receives half of the combined income and benefits** of both.

> This promotes fairness and avoids benefit reduction due to marital status.

---

### 4. **Treatment in Care or Treatment Facilities**
If a veteran or recipient and their spouse/common-law partner are **not residing together** due to:
- Residing in a treatment or care facility
- Other prescribed circumstances (as defined by regulations)

The Minister may treat them as if they were in a joint household, applying **half of the combined income and benefits** to each.

> The Minister may then **apportion the allowance** based on individual circumstances and dependent children involved.

---

### 5. **Survivor Allowances on Death of a Veteran**

On the death of a veteran who was receiving an allowance:
- The Minister may, within **12 months**, award a monthly allowance to the **survivor** (spouse or common-law partner).

#### How the Survivor’s Allowance is Calculated:
- Same method as a veteran’s allowance, but:
  - The **monthly income factor** is taken from **Column II of the Schedule** under the appropriate veteran category (e.g., paragraph 2(a), (b), or (c))
- If the veteran had **dependent children**, the allowance includes an
