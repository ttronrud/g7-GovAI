#### **4. Residency Rules**

Residency is a critical concept in determining where income is taxable. The Act defines residency in both countries:

##### **Residency in Canada**:

  - Their **personal and economic relations** are closer to Kuwait than to any third country.
- A **company incorporated in Kuwait** is also considered a resident.

##### **Double Residency (Individuals)**:
If an individual is deemed a resident of both countries, the following rules determine residency:

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **a)** | Resident only in the country where the individual has a **permanent home available**. |
| **b)** | If permanent home is in both countries, resident only in the country where the individual’s **centre of vital interests** (personal and economic ties) lies. |
| **c)** | If centre of vital interests cannot be determined, resident only in the country with the **habitual abode**. |
| **d)** | If habitual abode is in both or neither, resident only in the country where the individual is a **national**. |
| **e)** | If none of the above apply, the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**. |

#### **5. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise conducts business. This concept is crucial for determining where profits are taxable.

##### **What Constitutes a PE**:
- A place of management;
- A branch, office, factory, workshop;
- A mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any site related to natural resource exploration/exploitation.

##### **Duration Requirements**:
- A building site, construction project, or supervisory activity constitutes a PE **only if it continues for more than six months**.
- **Services** (e.g., consultancy) provided through employees or personnel constitute a PE **if such activities continue for more than six months within any 12-month period**.
- **Substantial equipment** used or installed for more than **three months** in a 12-month period also constitutes a PE.

##### **Exclusions from PE**:
The following do **not** constitute a PE:
- Use of facilities solely for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods;
- Maintenance of stock for **storage, display, or delivery**;
- Maintenance of stock for **processing by another enterprise**;
- Fixed place for **purchasing goods or collecting information**;
- Fixed place for **advertising, scientific research, or preparatory/auxiliary activities**;
- Any combination of the above, **if the overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**.

##### **Agent of Independent Status**:
- An enterprise has a PE in a Contracting State if a person acting on its behalf:
  - Has **general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts**;
  - Maintains a **stock of goods** from which it regularly delivers goods;
  - Habitually **secures orders** exclusively or almost exclusively for the enterprise;
  - **Manufactures goods** in that country for the enterprise.

> **Exception**: An enterprise does **not** have a PE simply because it uses a **broker, general agent, or independent agent** acting in the ordinary course of business. However, if the agent’s activities are **wholly or almost wholly devoted** to the enterprise, they are **not** considered independent agents.

> **Important**: Control or ownership of a company in one country by a company in the other **does not** create a PE.
