**Detailed Summary of the St. Regis Islands Act**

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *St. Regis Islands Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted to address the legal status and future management of certain islands in the St. Lawrence River belonging to the St. Regis Band of Indians. The Act responds to historical disputes over land tenure, specifically concerning alleged long-term leases granted by Indigenous leaders to non-Indigenous parties, and establishes a framework for the Crown to manage these lands in the best interests of the St. Regis band—particularly in preserving their ecological and economic value.

The Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons and may be cited as the *St. Regis Islands Act*.

### **Background and Context**

1. **Ownership and Reserve Status**  
   The St. Regis Band of Indians, located in the township of Dundee, county of Huntingdon, in the province of Quebec, holds certain islands in the St. Lawrence River between the town of Prescott and the village of Lancaster as part of their reserve.

2. **Historical Alleged Leases**  
   Over a century ago, the chiefs and headmen of the St. Regis Band purported to grant leases of various islands or portions of islands to individuals or entities. These leases were reportedly made for a nominal rental and were structured on a 99-year term, with covenants allowing for renewal for additional 99-year periods.

3. **Legal Challenge by the Crown**  
   The Canadian Crown initiated legal proceedings to have these leases declared null and void. This action was taken in the interest of protecting Indigenous rights and ensuring that the land remains under the stewardship of the St. Regis Band.

4. **Court Outcomes So Far**  
   - The Crown has already succeeded in having **Lewis Island**, **Snyder Island**, and **Thompson or Macmaster Island** declared null and void.
   - Legal actions remain pending regarding:
     - **Thomas or Hamilton Island**
     - The **Easterbrook farm on Cornwall Island**

5. **Economic and Environmental Considerations**  
   The Act recognizes that the revenue generated from leasing these islands for purposes such as **summer resorts** or **agricultural use** would provide significant economic benefit to the St. Regis Band.  
   In contrast, unrestricted access to the islands—particularly by band members—has historically led to the **clearing of timber groves** for firewood, resulting in environmental degradation and the loss of the islands' potential as productive, scenic summer destinations.

### **Key Provisions of the Act**

#### **1. Authority of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs**
> *Notwithstanding the provisions of the Indian Act to the contrary*, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs is granted **exclusive authority** to manage the following lands:
- Thompson or Macmaster Island
- Lewis Island
- Snyder Island
- Thomas or Hamilton Island
- The Easterbrook farm on Cornwall Island
- Any other island or parcel of land belonging to the St. Regis Band that is **not held under a location ticket** or under a **recognized individual interest** by a member of the band.

**Scope of Authority**:  
The Superintendent may:
- Grant **leases**
- Issue **licenses**
- Provide **other concessions**

**Condition**:  
All such actions must be taken in the **best interests of the St. Regis Band**.

**Significance**:  
This provision effectively bypasses the usual requirements under the *Indian Act*, which typically governs land use and access by Indigenous bands. It grants the federal government a special power to manage reserve lands that are not individually owned, ensuring that these lands are not subject to uncontrolled or potentially damaging use.

#### **2. Prohibition on Unauthorized Use or Removal of Natural Resources**
No Indian or non-Indian individual or entity may:
- Use or occupy any part of the islands
- Cut, carry away, or remove from the islands:
  - Trees
  - Saplings
  - Shrubs
  - Underwood
  - Any other plant or natural material

**Purpose**:  
To prevent deforestation and environmental degradation, which has historically occurred on similar reserves, undermining the islands’ ecological value and potential for sustainable economic development.

#### **3. Penalties for Violations**
Any person who violates the above provisions is liable upon **summary conviction** to:
- A **term of imprisonment of not more than six months**, and **not less than one month**, OR
- A **fine of not exceeding $200**, plus **costs of prosecution**

**In default of immediate payment** of the fine:
- A further term of imprisonment of **not more than three months**

**Nature of Enforcement**:  
The penalties are relatively modest but serve as a deterrent against unauthorized exploitation of the islands’ natural resources.

### **Objectives and Intent of the Act**

1. **Legal Clarification**  
   To formally declare the historical leases as invalid, reinforcing the St. Regis Band’s ownership and control over the islands.

2. **Preservation of Ecological Value**  
   To prevent the destruction of forest cover and natural landscapes that would otherwise be lost to unregulated timber harvesting.

3. **Economic Development for the Band**  
   To generate sustainable income through the leasing of islands for tourism (e.g., summer resorts) or agriculture, benefiting the community economically.

4. **Stewardship and Governance**  
   To place the management of these lands under a centralized, accountable federal authority (the Superintendent General) that prioritizes the long-term well-being of the St. Regis Band.

5. **Prevention of Misuse**  
   To ensure that land use does not lead to the same patterns of environmental degradation seen on other reserves where Indigenous communities have lost access to natural resources due to overuse or neglect.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Legal Precedent**: The Act sets a precedent for federal intervention in Indigenous land disputes where historical leases are challenged and declared invalid.
- **Federal Oversight**: It reflects a shift in policy where the federal government assumes responsibility for managing reserve lands not held by individuals, especially when environmental or economic outcomes are at stake.
- **Cultural and Environmental Protection**: The Act emphasizes the importance of preserving Indigenous cultural landscapes and natural heritage.
- **Potential for Revenue Generation**: By leasing the islands, the St. Regis Band could gain financial benefits without requiring direct involvement in resource extraction or land sales.

---

### **Limitations and Criticisms (Implied)**

- **Lack of Band Consultation**: The Act grants broad powers to the Superintendent General without explicit consultation or consent from the St. Regis Band, raising concerns about democratic governance and Indigenous self-determination.
- **Bypassing the Indian Act**: By overriding the Indian Act, the Act may be seen as undermining traditional Indigenous land rights frameworks.
- **Potential for Misuse**: While intended for the band’s benefit, the centralized control could lead to decisions that do not fully reflect community values or input.

### **Conclusion**

The *St. Regis Islands Act* is a targeted legislative intervention designed to protect and develop the natural and economic potential of key islands within the St. Regis reserve. By invalidating historical leases, preventing deforestation, and empowering federal authorities to manage the land in the band’s best interest, the Act seeks to ensure that the islands remain viable, sustainable, and beneficial to the St. Regis people. However, its success will depend on ongoing collaboration with the band, transparency in management decisions, and the enforcement of environmental protections.

Ultimately, the Act represents a balance between legal enforcement, environmental preservation, and economic development—while acknowledging the historical injustices associated with Indigenous land tenure in Canada.
