This threshold ensures that only significant, actionable defaults trigger winding-up proceedings.

- The **winding-up process begins upon service of the notice of petition** for winding-up.
- This marks the official start of the legal process, regardless of whether the court has yet issued an order.

1. **When a company is insolvent.**
2. **When a company is in liquidation or winding-up** and:
   - A shareholder, creditor, assignee, or liquidator petitions to bring it under the Act.
   - In the case of a **federal credit union**, a member, shareholder, creditor, assignee, or liquidator may petition.
3. **When a financial institution is under the control of the Superintendent** (e.g., due to regulatory intervention) and an application is made under **section 10.1**.

> **Sector-Specific Application:**
> - For **authorized foreign banks**: Only applies to their **business in Canada** and **liquidation of assets**.
> - For **insurance companies**: Provisions are subject to **Part III** of the Act.
> - For **financial institutions**: Provisions are subject to **Part II**.
