**Detailed Summary of the *Statutory Instruments Act***  
*(Cited as the Statutory Instruments Act)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Statutory Instruments Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that governs the creation, examination, publication, and enforcement of **statutory instruments (SIs)**—commonly known as regulations. It establishes a formal, transparent, and accountable framework for how federal regulations are developed, reviewed, and disseminated, ensuring they are lawful, consistent with constitutional rights, and accessible to the public.

This Act applies to all statutory instruments made under powers conferred by Acts of Parliament, including rules, orders, regulations, tariffs, directions, and other instruments issued in the exercise of legislative authority. Its primary purpose is to ensure **legal accountability, public transparency, and consistency** in the regulation-making process.

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

1. **"Prescribed"**  
   - Means prescribed by regulations made under this Act.  
   - Used to define specific procedures or requirements that may be set by subordinate regulations.

2. **"Regulation"**  
   - A statutory instrument made in the exercise of a legislative power granted by or under an Act of Parliament.  
   - Includes:
     - Rules, orders, regulations, ordinances, directions, forms, tariffs, letters patent, commissions, warrants, proclamations, by-laws, resolutions, or other instruments issued under such powers.
     - Instruments governing the practice or procedure in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.
     - Instruments described as "regulations" in other Acts of Parliament.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - Instruments made by corporations incorporated under an Act of Parliament unless:
       - The corporation is ultimately accountable to Parliament through a Minister, or
       - The instrument carries a penalty (fine, imprisonment).
     - Instruments made by judicial or quasi-judicial bodies unless they govern procedural matters.
     - Instruments involving legal privileges (e.g., advice or confidential information).
     - Laws made by provincial legislatures (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut), or rules made under their respective Acts.

3. **"Regulation-Making Authority"**  
   - Any body or entity authorized to make regulations.  
   - For a specific regulation, it refers to the authority that made or proposes to make it.

4. **"Statutory Instrument"**  
   - A broad term encompassing all instruments issued under parliamentary authority, excluding those listed in the exclusions above.

> **Important Provision**:  
> If an instrument is *deemed* to be a regulation under section 4 (for example, because it governs procedure), it is treated as a regulation **for all purposes** of this Act, including examination and registration.

## **Regulatory Process and Oversight**

### **1. Proposal and Pre-Examination (Section 3)**  
- Before making a regulation, the **regulation-making authority must forward three copies** (in both official languages) to the **Clerk of the Privy Council**.

#### **Examination by Clerk of the Privy Council**  
Upon receipt, the Clerk, in consultation with the **Deputy Minister of Justice**, examines the proposed regulation for:
- **Legal authorization**: Is it authorized by the enabling statute?
- **Proportionality**: Does it represent an unusual or unexpected use of the power?
- **Constitutional compliance**: Does it infringe on rights protected by:
  - The *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*  
  - The *Canadian Bill of Rights*?
- **Drafting quality**: Is the form and language in line with established standards?

> **Exception**:  
> This examination **does not apply** to rules, orders, or regulations governing procedural matters in the following bodies:
> - Supreme Court of Canada  
> - Federal Court of Appeal  
> - Federal Court  
> - Tax Court of Canada  
> - Court Martial Appeal Court  

### **2. Determination of Whether an Instrument is a Regulation**  
- If an authority is uncertain whether a proposed instrument qualifies as a regulation, it must send a copy to the **Deputy Minister of Justice**, who will determine its status.

## **Registration and Publication Requirements**

### **3. Registration (Section 5 & 6)**  
- Within **seven days of making** a regulation, the authority must transmit **copies in both official languages** to the Clerk of the Privy Council for **registration**.
- One copy of each version must be **certified** by the authority as a true and accurate copy.

> **Exemption**:  
> Regulations made or approved by the **Governor in Council** are not subject to this requirement.

### **4. Registration by the Clerk of the Privy Council**  
The Clerk registers:
- Every regulation transmitted under section 5(1);
- Every statutory instrument required by law to be published in the *Canada Gazette*;
- Any instrument directed by the Clerk to be published in the *Canada Gazette* under regulation.

> **Refusal to Register**  
> The Clerk may **refuse registration** if:
> - The instrument was not examined under section 3(2); and  
> - In the Clerk’s opinion, it was a proposed regulation that should have been examined but wasn’t.

> If refused, the instrument is sent to the **Deputy Minister of Justice** for determination on whether it is a regulation.

### **5. Effect of Non-Examination**  
- A regulation is **not invalid** simply because it wasn’t examined under section 3(2).
- However, if:
  - It was determined *before issuance* by the Deputy Minister of Justice to be a regulation, **or**
  - It was later determined *after issuance* to be a regulation,
> Then the **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Minister of Justice) may **revoke** the regulation **in whole or in part**.

## **Effective Date and Publication**

### **6. Effective Date of Regulation**  
A regulation **cannot come into force earlier than the day it is registered**, unless:
- It explicitly states it will take effect earlier **and** is registered within **seven days** of being made, **or**
- It falls under a **specific exemption** (e.g., certain classes of regulations under paragraph 20(b)).

> If a regulation comes into force earlier than registration, the authority must **advise in writing** the Clerk of the Privy Council of the **reasons** why registration is not practical.

### **7. Publication in the Canada Gazette**  
- Every regulation must be **published in the Canada Gazette within 23 days** of registration (subject to any exemptions).
- **No regulation is invalid** solely for failing to be published.

> **Exception**:  
> A person **cannot be convicted** of violating a regulation that was not published in the Gazette **unless**:
> - The regulation was exempted under paragraph 20(c), or  
> - It expressly states it applies before publication, **and**
> - It is proven that **reasonable steps** were taken to notify those likely to be affected.

> **Additional Authority**:  
> The Governor in Council may by regulation direct that **any statutory instrument** (or class) be published in the *Canada Gazette*, and the Clerk may authorize publication if it serves the **public interest**.

- The Clerk of the Privy Council prepares and publishes a **quarterly consolidated index** of:
  - All regulations and amendments in force after the end of each calendar year.

---

## **Judicial Notice and Evidence**

### **11. Judicial Notice**  
- Any statutory instrument published in the *Canada Gazette* is **judicially noticed**—meaning it is presumed to be true and valid in court proceedings.

> Evidence of a regulation’s existence or content may be established by:
> - A copy of the *Canada Gazette* containing the regulation’s text.

> **Deemed Publication**:
> - A regulation included in the *Consolidated Regulations of Canada, 1978* (printed by the Queen’s Printer) is **deemed to have been published** in the *Canada Gazette*.
> - A regulation included in a **revision of regulations** (published by the Queen’s Printer) is also **deemed published**.
