**Detailed Summary of the Employment Support Act (1971–72)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Employment Support Act* is a Canadian statute enacted in 1971 (effective during the fiscal year 1971–72) to protect employment levels in Canadian industries when foreign countries impose **temporary import surtaxes** or take other trade measures that have a similar adverse effect on Canadian industry. The Act establishes a mechanism through which manufacturers can receive **employment support grants** to maintain workforce levels during periods of foreign trade-related economic pressure.

This legislation was designed as a **temporary, targeted response** to international trade disruptions, aiming to prevent job losses in Canada by providing financial assistance to manufacturers whose operations are negatively impacted by foreign trade policies.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Assistance Period**: A defined time frame during which a grant may be authorized. The exact duration and conditions are set by regulations.
  
- **Board (Employment Support Board)**: A regulatory body established under the Act to administer and approve employment support grants. It consists of up to seven members.

- **Grant**: A financial payment authorized by the Board to a manufacturer to support employment during an assistance period.

- **Manufacturer**: A person, firm, or corporation engaged in the production, fabrication, refinement, or transformation of goods via chemical, biochemical, or physical changes (excluding natural growth or decay).

- **Plant**: The physical premises where manufacturing activities occur, including machinery, fixtures, and equipment.

- **Prescribed**: Refers to provisions set by regulations made under this Act.

- **Minister**: The Minister of Industry, responsible for overseeing the Act and directing the Board.

---

### **Primary Purpose**

To **protect Canadian employment** in industrial sectors when other countries impose **temporary import surtaxes** or similar trade actions that reduce demand for Canadian goods, thereby threatening job stability in Canadian manufacturing.

The Act is not intended to compensate for general economic downturns or market fluctuations but specifically targets **foreign trade-related disruptions**.

---

### **Funding and Financial Limits**

- All grant payments are funded from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- **Total grants** for the fiscal year 1971–72 are capped at **$80 million**.
- Administrative costs (e.g., staffing, operations) are capped at **$300,000**.

These limits ensure fiscal responsibility and prevent uncontrolled spending.

---

### **Establishment of the Employment Support Board**

- The Board is established by the Governor in Council (federal executive authority).
- It consists of **up to seven members**, appointed by the Governor in Council.
- **No more than two-thirds** of the Board members may be public servants (as defined under the *Public Service Employment Act*).
  - However, if a vacancy reduces the number of non-public servants below one-third, the Board remains valid and functional — as long as a **quorum** (three members) is maintained.

#### **Chairmanship**
- The Chairman is appointed from among non-public servant members.
- If a public servant is on the Board, the Minister overseeing their department may designate one or more senior officials as **alternate members** who can step in during absence or temporary incapacity.

#### **Compensation and Expenses**
- The Governor in Council determines:
  - Emoluments (salaries)
  - Expenses (travel, office costs)
  for non-public servant members.

#### **Meetings and Quorum**
- The Board may meet at times and in ways deemed convenient for efficiency.
- A **quorum is three members**.
- The Chairman presides when present; otherwise, he designates another member to preside.

---

### **Duties and Powers of the Board**

- Administers grants under the Act.
- Performs any additional duties assigned by the Minister.
- May use staff and facilities of the **Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce**.
- May, at the direction of the Governor in Council, access **other government services** as needed.
- May make **internal rules** for meetings, operations, and duties (subject to regulations).
- Must maintain records and provide reports to the Minister as required.

---

### **Grant Authorization Process**

#### **Eligibility**
A manufacturer may apply for a grant if:
- The manufacturer's workforce at a plant is **or is likely to be significantly reduced** due to:
  - Foreign import surtaxes
  - Other foreign trade actions having a similar effect

#### **Application and Review**
- The manufacturer must submit an application to the Board.
- The Board evaluates the application and may authorize a grant **only if**:
  - The circumstances meet the purpose of the Act (protecting employment due to foreign trade actions)
  - The grant is necessary and proportionate

#### **Grant Amount**
- The maximum grant amount is set by **regulations**.
- Alternatively, the Board may determine an amount **adequate to maintain employment** at specified or prescribed levels during the assistance period.

> The grant must be sufficient to maintain employment at levels **as prescribed or specified by the Board**, or at levels that are reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

#### **Employment Maintenance Requirement**
- A grant **will not be paid** unless, at the end of the assistance period:
  - The manufacturer has maintained employment **at or above the levels specified** by the Board (or at prescribed levels, if none were specified).
  - This ensures accountability and prevents misuse of funds.

### **Special Provisions for Non-Compliance**

If a manufacturer fails to comply with applicable regulations (e.g., reporting requirements, employment standards), but the Board believes that granting support would still serve the **purpose of the Act** (i.e., protecting employment due to foreign trade actions), the Board may:

1. **Recommend** to the Governor in Council that a grant be authorized.
2. If the Governor in Council approves, the Board may authorize a grant **in an amount appropriate** to maintain employment, subject to any conditions set by the Governor.

This provision allows flexibility in cases where compliance is difficult but the broader economic purpose of the Act is still valid.

---

### **Timing of Grant Payments**

- **Standard Rule**: Payments are **not made until after the end of the assistance period**.
- **Exception**: The Board may, in its judgment, authorize **interim payments** during the assistance period (on account of the future grant), if circumstances warrant it.

> This exception allows immediate financial relief in cases of urgent employment threats, though it remains subject to Board discretion.

---

### **Payment and Disbursement**

- Once a grant is authorized, the amount is paid by the **Receiver General** upon requisition by the Minister.

---

### **Regulatory Authority**

The Governor in Council may make **regulations** covering:

1. Duration or periods of assistance periods.
2. Required levels of employment during an assistance period.
3. Required information in grant applications (e.g., employment data, cost of inputs).
4. Methods for calculating grant amounts — **must be related to the extent of foreign trade-related harm** (e.g., reduced demand due to surtaxes).
5. Factors to be considered in determining eligibility (e.g., employment trends, supplier pricing).
6. Any other matter necessary to achieve the Act’s purpose.

> These regulations are critical in operationalizing the Act and ensuring consistency in decision-making.

---

### **Tax Implications**

- Any grant paid to a manufacturer is **included in the manufacturer’s taxable income** for the year in which it is received.
- This ensures that the financial support is treated as revenue for tax purposes, aligning with income tax principles.

---

### **Recovery of Misused Funds**

- If a manufacturer is found to be **unentitled** to a grant (e.g., no valid foreign trade disruption or false application), the payment must be **repaid to the Receiver General**.
- Repayment may be enforced at any time as a **debt owed to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> This creates a strong accountability mechanism to prevent fraud or misuse.

---

### **Reporting Requirements**

- The **Minister of Industry** must prepare a quarterly report on the administration of the Act.
- The report is submitted to **Parliament**:
  - As soon as possible after each quarter ends.
  - If Parliament is not in session, it is laid before Parliament within **15 days of the next session**.

> This ensures transparency and parliamentary oversight of the Act’s implementation.

### **Historical and Contextual Notes**

- Enacted during a period of **increased international trade tensions**, particularly during the 1970s when countries began imposing import duties or quotas on Canadian exports (e.g., in the automotive, steel, or agricultural sectors).
- Reflects a **pro-employment, protectionist policy** in response to foreign trade barriers.
- The Act is **temporary and narrowly scoped**, not intended as a permanent industrial policy tool.
- It represents an early example of Canada using targeted government intervention to protect domestic jobs in the face of external economic pressures.
