### **Overview**

The *Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Act* is a federal statute enacted by the Government of Canada to formalize and support the legal recognition of the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation** as a distinct Indigenous band under the *Indian Act*. This Act provides the legal framework for amending the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order**, enabling the inclusion or exclusion of individuals from the official list of members of the band—based on the terms of a landmark agreement between the Government of Canada and the Federation of Newfoundland Indians.

The Act is rooted in a process of self-determination, reconciliation, and respect for Mi’kmaq identity, culture, and community ties, and it reflects the collaborative efforts of Indigenous and federal authorities to establish a fair, transparent, and equitable enrolment process.

### **Background and Key Events Leading to the Act**

1. **June 23, 2008 – Agreement for the Recognition of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq Band**  
   - The Government of Canada and the Federation of Newfoundland Indians (FNI) entered into a formal agreement to recognize the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq Band** as a distinct group of Mi’kmaq people in Newfoundland.
   - This agreement established a process for **enrolment** of individuals who:
     - Self-identified as members of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq Group;
     - Had a current and substantial connection to one or more Mi’kmaq communities on the island of Newfoundland.
   - The goal was to ensure that only those with genuine historical, cultural, and community ties to the Mi’kmaq people in Newfoundland would be recognized as members.

2. **September 22, 2011 – Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order**  
   - The Governor in Council issued the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order**, officially recognizing the Qalipu Mi’kmaq as a band under the *Indian Act*.
   - This Order created a legal list (schedule) of members of the band, forming the foundation for governance, rights, and benefits under the *Indian Act*.

3. **June 30, 2013 – Supplemental Agreement**  
   - To clarify and improve the application of the original 2008 Agreement, the parties entered into a **Supplemental Agreement**.
   - Key provisions of the Supplemental Agreement:
     - Established a **neutral and independent Enrolment Committee** composed of representatives from both the Government of Canada and the Federation of Newfoundland Indians, with an independent chair jointly selected by both parties.
     - Set out clear, consistent, and fair criteria for assessing enrolment applications.
     - Mandated the Committee to produce a **new and final Founding Members List**—a definitive list of individuals who meet the enrolment criteria.
     - This list would serve as the basis for a recommendation to the Governor in Council to **amend the Band Order** to reflect the agreed-upon membership.

### **Key Provisions of the Act**

#### 1. **Title and Scope**
- The Act is titled the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Act**.
- It applies to the recognition and governance of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation as a band under the *Indian Act*.

#### 2. **Definitions**
- The term **"band"** is defined in the same way as in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*, meaning a group of Indigenous individuals recognized under the Act as a distinct community.
- The term **"council of a band"** is defined as the governing body of the band, as defined in the *Indian Act*.

#### 3. **Power to Amend the Band Order**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government) is granted the authority to issue an order amending the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order**.
- Specifically, the power allows for:
  - Adding a person’s name to the schedule (i.e., recognizing them as a member);
  - Removing a person’s name from the schedule (i.e., excluding them from membership);
  - Including the **date of birth** of the individual in the amended schedule.
- This power is essential to reflect the findings of the Enrolment Committee and ensure the band list accurately reflects the agreed-upon membership.

#### 4. **No Compensation or Damages for Omission or Removal**
- The Act explicitly **prohibits** any individual or entity from claiming:
  - Compensation;
  - Damages;
  - Indemnity
- From the Government of Canada, its employees, agents, or the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation **solely because their name was omitted or removed** from the schedule.
- This provision protects the government and the band from legal liability arising from decisions made during the enrolment process, emphasizing that the process is based on legal and equitable criteria, not financial or personal compensation.

#### 5. **No Abrogation of Existing Agreements**
- The Act **does not override or undermine** any existing agreements between:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada;
  - The Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation;
  - The Federation of Newfoundland Indians.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Act serves several important purposes:

1. **Legal Recognition**  
   - Provides formal legal recognition of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq as a distinct band under Canadian law, enhancing their ability to access services, benefits, and rights under the *Indian Act*.

2. **Equity and Fairness in Enrolment**  
   - Establishes a transparent, fair, and community-based process for determining membership through the Enrolment Committee and the Supplemental Agreement.

   - Respects the Mi’kmaq people’s right to define their own membership and community identity, in alignment with Indigenous values and cultural continuity.

4. **Legal Clarity and Stability**  
   - Gives the federal government a clear legal mechanism to update the band list when new findings emerge from the enrolment process, ensuring the band list remains current and accurate.

5. **Reconciliation and Trust-Building**  
   - Demonstrates a commitment to reconciliation by engaging Indigenous leaders in the process and ensuring that decisions are made collaboratively and with mutual respect.

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No Financial Compensation**: The Act prevents individuals from seeking compensation for being excluded from the band list, which may be seen as a limitation for those who feel they were wrongfully excluded. However, it is justified by the intent to avoid litigation and ensure the process remains focused on legal and cultural criteria.
- **Governor in Council Authority**: While the federal government has the power to amend the Band Order, the process is guided by the **Supplemental Agreement** and the **Enrolment Committee**, ensuring that decisions are informed by both Indigenous and government perspectives.
- **Ongoing Process**: The Act is not a static document. It enables a dynamic, evolving process of membership determination that can be updated as new information becomes available.

### **Conclusion**

The *Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Act* is a significant piece of legislation that formalizes the legal status of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation under Canadian law. It reflects a collaborative, respectful, and culturally grounded approach to Indigenous self-determination and band recognition. By empowering the federal government to update the band list based on a transparent and equitable process—while protecting against claims of compensation and preserving existing agreements—the Act supports both legal stability and the long-term well-being of the Mi’kmaq community in Newfoundland.

This Act is a milestone in Canada’s broader journey toward reconciliation, affirming the importance of Indigenous voices in shaping the legal and political framework of Indigenous peoples’ rights and identities.
