**Detailed Summary of the *Nuclear Fuel Waste Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Nuclear Fuel Waste Act* is a comprehensive legislative framework enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. The Act establishes a structured, transparent, and economically sound system for the long-term management of **nuclear fuel waste**—specifically, irradiated fuel bundles removed from commercial or research nuclear fission reactors.

Its primary objective is to ensure that decisions about the management of nuclear fuel waste are based on **scientific rigor, economic feasibility, and social equity**, while respecting environmental, cultural, and community concerns. The Act creates a centralized, non-profit entity—the **Waste Management Organization (WMO)**—to propose, evaluate, and implement approaches to managing nuclear fuel waste, with oversight by the federal government and independent advisory bodies.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Economic Region** | As defined by Statistics Canada in its *Guide to the Labour Force Survey* (published January 31, 2000). Used to identify geographic areas affected by waste management decisions. |
| **Management (of nuclear fuel waste)** | Long-term handling, treatment, conditioning, storage, or disposal—including transport—of irradiated fuel. |
| **Minister** | Initially the Minister of Natural Resources; may be designated by the Governor in Council as the Minister responsible for nuclear fuel waste. |

## **Core Objectives and Principles**

1. **Comprehensive, Integrated, and Economically Sound Approach**  
   The Act mandates that the federal government (Governor in Council) make decisions on nuclear fuel waste management based on a **comprehensive, integrated, and economically viable framework**, developed through proposals from the WMO.

2. **Non-Profit and Independent Role of the WMO**  
   The WMO is not an agent of the Crown. It operates independently to propose and implement management strategies, free from direct government control.

3. **Equity and Inclusivity**  
   The Act emphasizes **social, ethical, and economic considerations**, including:
   - Public consultation
   - Involvement of Indigenous peoples and traditional knowledge
   - Consideration of socio-economic impacts on communities
   - Representation of regional and local government interests

4. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   Regular reporting, audits, and public disclosure ensure accountability to Parliament and the public.

5. **Long-Term Financial Responsibility**  
   Nuclear energy corporations and AECL are required to establish trust funds to finance the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste, with interest accruing on delayed deposits.

---

## **Establishment of the Waste Management Organization (WMO)**

- Each nuclear energy corporation must establish the WMO as a **non-profit corporation**.
- The WMO’s purpose is to:
  - Propose approaches to manage nuclear fuel waste;
  - Implement the approach selected or approved by the Governor in Council.

- **Membership**: All nuclear energy corporations and AECL become members or shareholders of the WMO.

- **Ownership**: The WMO is not an agent of Her Majesty in Right of Canada.

---

## **Services Offered by the WMO**

The WMO must offer its **nuclear fuel waste management services**—such as storage, treatment, transport, and disposal—to:
- Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)
- All other Canadian owners of nuclear fuel waste who are **not members or shareholders** of the WMO

These services must be offered:
- Without discrimination
- At a **reasonable fee** based on actual costs

---

## **Advisory Council**

The WMO must establish an **Advisory Council** composed of experts in:
- Scientific and technical fields (nuclear engineering, geology, environmental science)
- Public affairs
- Social sciences
- Traditional Aboriginal knowledge
- Local and regional government representatives

**Mandate**:
- Examine the WMO’s study (Section 12) and triennial reports (Section 18)
- Provide **written comments** on these documents

**Appointment**: By the WMO’s governing body, with efforts to ensure diversity, expertise, and regional representation.

---

## **Trust Fund System**

To ensure long-term financial sustainability, each nuclear energy corporation and AECL must establish and maintain a **trust fund** in a Canadian financial institution (subject to ownership limits: no more than 10% indirect ownership).

### **Initial Deposits (on Act’s coming into force)**

| Entity | Initial Deposit |
|-------|-----------------|
| Ontario Power Generation Inc. | $500,000,000 |
| Hydro-Québec | $20,000,000 |
| New Brunswick Power Corporation | $20,000,000 |
| Atomic Energy of Canada Limited | $10,000,000 |

### **Annual Deposits (anniversary of Act’s coming into force)**

| Entity | Annual Deposit |
|-------|----------------|
| Ontario Power Generation Inc. | $100,000,000 |
| Hydro-Québec | $4,000,000 |
| New Brunswick Power Corporation | $4,000,000 |
| Atomic Energy of Canada Limited | $2,000,000 |

> **Note**: Subsection (2) ceases to apply once the Minister approves the deposit amount under paragraph 16(3)(a).

### **Interest Accrual**

- Interest accumulates daily at **prime rate + 2%** from the due date until the deposit is made.
- Interest is added to the deposit amount when it is finally paid.

### **Withdrawals from Trust Funds**

- **Only the WMO** may withdraw funds.
- Withdrawals are **only permitted** for:
  - Implementing the selected approach (Section 15 or 20(5))
  - Avoiding or minimizing significant socio-economic impacts on communities
- The **first withdrawal** may only occur after a **construction or operating licence** is issued under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (Section 24).
- If the Minister believes the WMO has misused funds, they may require **prior ministerial approval** for future withdrawals.
