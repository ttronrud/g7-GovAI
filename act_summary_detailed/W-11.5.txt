   - Employers are **not required** to close businesses, shut down operations, or grant employees time off to observe the day.  
   - The day does not carry any statutory obligations related to work, public events, or government operations.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Human-Centered Approach**: The Act centers on human dignity and respect for workers’ lives, emphasizing that workplace safety is not just a regulatory concern but a moral and social responsibility.

Instead, it encourages voluntary participation—such as memorial services, educational campaigns, workplace safety discussions, or community events.
- **National Unity**: By establishing a common day of remembrance, the Act fosters national unity and shared awareness, allowing Canadians to collectively acknowledge the risks faced by workers in various industries (e.g., construction, manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, mining, etc.).
