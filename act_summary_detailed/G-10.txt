**Detailed Summary of the Canada Grain Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Grain Act* is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that governs the quality, handling, grading, storage, and marketing of grain. It establishes a regulatory framework to ensure that Canadian grain is of consistent, high quality—both for domestic consumption and international export. The Act provides for standardized procedures in grain handling, sets quality standards, and establishes the **Canadian Grain Commission (Commission)** as the central authority responsible for overseeing grain quality and trade practices.

While several definitions, provisions, and terms have been repealed or amended over time (notably in 2012, 2019, and 2020), the core structure and intent of the Act remain intact, particularly in its role in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the Canadian grain industry.
