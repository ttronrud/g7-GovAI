## 📜 **Overview of the Act**

This act, enacted by **Her Majesty in Council** (i.e., the Canadian government) with the advice and consent of the **Senate and House of Commons**, introduces and amends key legislation governing **retirement benefits** for federal employees and members of the armed forces and police.

The primary purpose of the act is to:

- **Ensure consistency in the timing and interpretation of when certain pension provisions take effect**.

## 🔍 Key Provisions and Amendments

### 1. **Enactment of New Legislation (Schedules I and II)**

> *"The Special Retirement Arrangements Act, as set out in Schedule I, is hereby enacted.  
> The Pension Benefits Division Act, as set out in Schedule II, is hereby enacted."*

- **Special Retirement Arrangements Act (SRAA)** – This act establishes special retirement plans for certain federal employees, likely including those in specific occupations, early retirees, or individuals with unique service conditions.
- **Pension Benefits Division Act (PBD Act)** – This act creates or strengthens the legal framework for the **Pension Benefits Division (PBD)** of the Department of Public Service and Procurement (or its successor). The PBD is responsible for administering, managing, and overseeing federal pension and retirement benefits.

👉 These two acts form the **core administrative and structural foundation** for federal retirement systems, enabling better governance, transparency, and service delivery.

### 2. **Deemed Transfer of Retirement Payments to New Accounts**

> *"Payments made to the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Account on or after April 1, 1991, pursuant to Part III of the Public Service Superannuation Act, Part III of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, or Part III of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, as those Parts read immediately prior to the day on which this Act is assented to, are deemed to have been made to the Superannuation Account, the Canadian Forces Superannuation Account or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Account, as the case may be."*

#### What this means:
- Before April 1, 1991, certain retirement benefits were paid into a **Supplementary Retirement Benefits Account (SRBA)**.
- After April 1, 1991, these same payments are **treated as having been made directly into the official retirement accounts**:
  - **Superannuation Account** (for Public Service employees),
  - **Canadian Forces Superannuation Account** (for military personnel),
  - **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Account** (for RCMP members).

✅ This provision **eliminates ambiguity** about where pension funds were actually held. It ensures that records, accounting, and benefit calculations reflect the correct account structure going forward.

> This change simplifies financial tracking and improves the accuracy of pension calculations and benefit entitlements.

### 3. **Effective Dates for Provisions of the Act**

> *"Subject to subsections (2) and (3), this Act or any provision thereof, or any provision of an Act amended or enacted by this Act, shall come into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council."*

- Most of the provisions of the act **do not take effect immediately**.
- Instead, the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has the authority to **set specific effective dates** through a **statutory order**.
- This allows for **practical implementation**, such as ensuring systems, staff, and financial institutions are ready before new rules are applied.

### 4. **Provisions Deemed to Come into Force on April 1, 1991**

> *"Sections 23, 50 and 78, subsection 98(2), section 99, subsection 100(2) and sections 102 to 104 are deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1991."*

These specific sections (which relate to pension entitlements, benefit calculations, and administrative procedures) are **treated as effective from April 1, 1991**, even if they were not formally enacted until later. This ensures continuity and consistency with the new retirement framework introduced on that date.

Additionally:

> *"Part III of the Public Service Superannuation Act, as enacted by section 30 of this Act, Part III of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, as enacted by section 58 of this Act, and Part III of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, as enacted by section 80 of this Act, are deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1991."*

- This confirms that the **entire retirement benefit framework** for the three major federal services (Public Service, Forces, RCMP) **entered into force on April 1, 1991**.
- This date marks a **major policy shift**, aligning retirement benefits across services and introducing a more standardized system.
