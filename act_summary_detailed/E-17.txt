### **Detailed Summary of the *Explosives Act***

---

#### **1. General Overview**
The *Explosives Act* is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation designed to regulate the **manufacture, sale, storage, transportation, and use of explosives** in order to ensure **public safety, prevent illicit trafficking, and maintain national security**. The Act applies to all explosives—except those under the direction or control of the Minister of National Defence—through a strict licensing and monitoring regime.

It establishes a framework for:
- Defining what constitutes an explosive,
- Controlling access to sensitive materials (e.g., restricted components),
- Regulating manufacturing and storage in licensed facilities,
- Preventing the illicit production and movement of explosives,
- Ensuring traceability and accountability through record-keeping and inspections,
- Addressing the specific risks posed by **plastic explosives**, particularly unmarked ones.

## **Key Definitions and Key Concepts**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Explosive** | Any substance designed to produce an explosion or pyrotechnic effect; includes any substance prescribed by regulation. Excludes gases, organic peroxides, and items explicitly excluded. |
| **Authorized Explosive** | An explosive declared safe and acceptable under regulations for public use. Requires formal declaration and testing. |
| **Plastic Explosive** | A high-explosive formulation that is malleable/flexible at room temperature and contains a binder. Often used in military or construction applications. |
| **Unmarked Plastic Explosive** | A plastic explosive lacking a detectable agent (detection agent) or below the required concentration of such agent. High risk due to evasion of detection. |
| **Detection Agent** | Substances included in plastic explosives (as per the Montreal Convention) to allow detection via X-ray or other methods. |
| **Convention** | The *Montreal Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for Detection* (1991), amended over time. Requires marking of plastic explosives to prevent smuggling. |
| **Factory** | Any location where explosives are manufactured or processed, including associated land and structures. |
| **Magazine** | A place where explosives are stored. Excludes private storage for personal use or small-scale sales. |
| **Licensed Factory/Magazine** | Facilities operating under a license issued by the Minister. Must meet strict safety and security standards. |
| **Restricted Component** | Components of explosives (e.g., nitrocellulose) whose acquisition or sale is restricted due to their potential for misuse. |
| **Illicit Manufacturing/Trafficking** | Unauthorized production or movement of explosives across borders or within Canada without proper authorization. |
| **Transit** | Movement of explosives through Canada that is neither origin nor destination. Requires authorization. |
| **Operator** | Owner, manager, or person in charge of a facility or activity involving explosives. |
| **Military Device** | Defined by regulation; refers to weapons or equipment using explosives, often for defense purposes. |

> ⚠️ **Exemption**: The Act does **not apply** to explosives under the direction or control of the **Minister of National Defence** (e.g., for military use).

## **Scope and Application**

- The Act applies **to all explosives** except those under the control of the Minister of National Defence.
- It is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or any province**.
- The **Governor in Council** (federal Cabinet) may make detailed regulations to implement the Act, including:
  - Classifying explosives and defining their composition.
  - Exempting certain explosives from regulation.
  - Restricting who can acquire, possess, or sell explosives.
  - Prohibiting unsafe explosives based on their name or class.
  - Regulating marking, packaging, safety instructions, and testing.
  - Setting safety, security, and record-keeping standards.
  - Establishing procedures for destruction of unmarked plastic explosives.
  - Defining the duration, conditions, and fees for licenses and permits.

## **Prohibited Activities (General Prohibitions)**

Unless authorized, **no person may**:

1. **Manufacture or make any explosive** — except in a **licensed factory**.
2. **Sell any authorized explosive** — unless the seller is the **operator of a licensed factory or licensed magazine** and has been authorized to do so.
3. **Store any explosive** — in a **magazine that is not licensed**.
4. **Possess any explosive** — without proper authorization.
5. **Perform certain processes** outside a licensed factory, including:
   - Dividing or breaking up explosives,
   - Repairing, remaking, or altering explosives,
   - Making damaged explosives fit for use.

> These prohibitions ensure that only authorized, regulated entities handle explosives at any stage of the lifecycle.

## **Regulations on Unmarked Plastic Explosives**

This section addresses the **highest security concern** — unmarked plastic explosives, which are difficult to detect and commonly used in terrorist activities.

### **Manufacture of Unmarked Plastic Explosives**
- **Only allowed** for the following **authorized purposes**, in **limited quantities**:
  1. Research, development, or testing of new or modified explosives.
  2. Training in explosives detection or development of detection equipment.
  3. Forensic science activities.
- **Or**, if destined to be incorporated into a **military device in Canada within three years** of the Act coming into force.

> ⚠️ Manufacturing for other purposes (e.g., commercial use) is **strictly prohibited**.

---

### **Transportation and Possession of Unmarked Plastic Explosives**

- Only allowed if:
  1. Used for the same **authorized purposes** as above (research, training, forensics), or
  2. Destined to become part of a **military device in Canada within three years**.

> This ensures that unmarked plastic explosives are not used for illicit purposes.

---

### **Legacy Provisions (Pre-Act Manufacturing)**

Unmarked plastic explosives **imported or manufactured before the Act came into force** may be:
- Transported or possessed by **military or police personnel** for up to **15 years** after the Act’s commencement.
- Possessed by **any other person** for up to **3 years** after the Act’s commencement.

> This provides a **transition period** for existing stockpiles.

---

### **Import/Export of Unmarked Plastic Explosives**

- **Prohibited entirely** unless the explosives are **incorporated as an integral part of a military device**.

> This prevents the smuggling of unmarked plastic explosives into or out of Canada.

---

### **Illicit Trafficking and Possession**

- **Prohibited** to knowingly:
  - Engage in **illicit trafficking** (import, export, or transit without authorization),
  - Acquire, possess, sell, offer for sale, transport, or deliver **illicitly trafficked explosives**.

> Violations are serious offenses and may result in criminal penalties.

## **Licensing and Permits**

The **Minister of Natural Resources** (or designated Minister) may issue:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Licence for Factory/Magazine** | Grants permission to operate a facility for manufacturing or storing explosives. Requires compliance with safety, security, and environmental standards. |
| **Permit for Vehicle** | Allows transport of explosives via land vehicles (trucks, cars). Vehicles must meet safety and security requirements. |
| **Certificate** | For temporary, occasional activities (e.g., testing, storage, fireworks training). |

> All licenses, permits, and certificates:
- May be **subject to additional terms or conditions** (e.g., security, safety) as deemed necessary by the Minister.
