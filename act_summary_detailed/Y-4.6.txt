The provided text appears to be a **blank or placeholder enactment** from a Canadian statute, specifically a section of an act that has been **fully repealed**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Text Content**: The passage begins with the standard formal opening of a Canadian Act of Parliament:  
  *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*  
  This is the traditional legal form used to introduce a legislative enactment.

- **Repeal Notices**: Immediately following the opening, there are **36 repeated lines** stating:  
  *"[Repealed, 2002, c. 7, s. 284]"*  
  This indicates that the provisions or sections previously contained in the act have been **repealed (officially cancelled or abolished)** by **Section 284 of Chapter 7 of the Statutes of Canada in 2002** (i.e., *The Canada Revenue Agency Act* or another act, depending on context).

- **Interpretation**:  
  The repeated "repealed" entries suggest that the original content of the act (which is not actually shown in the text) was **fully removed** from the law by the 2002 amendment. The act itself does not contain any substantive provisions — only a list of repeals.

- **Legal Significance**:  
  Since the act is entirely marked as repealed, **no new law or legal obligation is currently in effect** from this enactment. It is **not active** and serves only as a historical or archival record.

- **Contextual Background**:  
  Chapter 7 of the Statutes of Canada in 2002 (c. 7) is commonly known as *The Canada Revenue Agency Act* (or a related financial or administrative reform bill). Section 284 of that act likely contained provisions that were deemed obsolete or redundant, and thus were formally removed. The repeated references to this section suggest that multiple provisions or subsections from a prior act were repealed under that authority.

- **Why the Repetition?**  
  The repetition of the same repeal notice may be due to:
  - A formatting error or copy-paste mistake in the original document.
  - A historical record where multiple sections of a prior law were repealed by the same clause.
  - A technical artifact in legislative databases where a list of repeals is generated for multiple subsections.
