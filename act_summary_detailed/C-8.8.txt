### **4. Residency Rules**

Residency determines which country has the right to tax an individual’s or company’s income.

#### **Individuals**:
- A person is a resident if they are liable to tax in a country due to **domicile, residence, place of management**, or similar criteria.
- **Exclusion**: Not a resident if taxed only on income from sources within that country.

> **Determining Residency When Dual Residency Exists**:
1. **Permanent Home**: If the individual has a permanent home in one country, they are deemed a resident only of that country.
2. **If home is in both countries**: Residency is determined by the **"centre of vital interests"** — the country where personal and economic ties are stronger.
3. **If centre of vital interests cannot be determined** or no permanent home exists: Residency is determined by **habitual abode**.
4. **If habitual abode is in both or neither**: Residency is with the **nationality** of the individual.
5. **If national of both or neither**: The competent authorities must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

#### **Companies**:
- If a company is a national of one country and is a resident of both, it is deemed a resident only of the **first-mentioned country** (i.e., the one listed first in the treaty).

#### **Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships)**:
- If such a person is a resident of both countries, the competent authorities shall **attempt to resolve** residency based on:
  - Place of effective management,
  - Place of constitution,
  - Other relevant factors.
- **If no agreement is reached**, the person is **not entitled to any tax relief or exemption** under the Convention.

> **Purpose**: To prevent double taxation and ensure clarity in determining where income is attributable.

- Place of management,
- Branch,
- Office,
- Factory,
- Workshop,
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other natural resource extraction site.

> **Exception**: A building site, construction, assembly, or installation project **only constitutes a PE if it lasts more than 12 months**.

> **No PE for Agents**:
- An enterprise does **not** have a PE merely because it uses a **broker, general commission agent, or independent agent** acting in the ordinary course of business.

> **No PE due to Ownership or Control**:
- Merely controlling or being controlled by a company in the other country **does not create a PE**.
