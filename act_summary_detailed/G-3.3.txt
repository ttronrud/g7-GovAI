**Detailed Summary of the Global Minimum Tax Act**

---

### **Overview**

The **Global Minimum Tax Act (GloBE Act)** is a comprehensive piece of legislation designed to implement the **Global Minimum Tax (GloBE) framework** established by the **OECD’s Inclusive Framework on Tax Cooperation**. Its primary objective is to **prevent multinational enterprises (MNEs) from shifting profits to low- or no-tax jurisdictions** to reduce their global tax burdens. The Act introduces a **global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%**, applies to **all MNEs with significant cross-border operations**, and ensures that **taxes are based on economic substance and real profits**, not just book profits or transfer pricing.

This summary provides a detailed breakdown of the key definitions, concepts, and structural elements of the Act, focusing on the **legal, financial, and tax mechanisms** that underpin the GloBE regime.

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

### 1. **Acceptable Financial Accounting Standard (AFAS)**
- Refers to widely recognized accounting standards that are **recognized internationally** and used in tax compliance.
- Includes:
  - **Canadian GAAP**
  - **IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)**
  - GAAP from the following jurisdictions:
    - Australia, Brazil, European Economic Area (EEA), EU, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, People’s Republic of China, India, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, UK, and the United States.
- Ensures **consistency and comparability** in financial reporting across jurisdictions.

> *Purpose:* To provide a standardized basis for measuring financial performance and determining taxable income under the GloBE rules.

---

### 2. **Adjusted Covered Taxes**
- Defined as in **subsection 22(1)**.
- Refers to **taxes on income** that are **adjusted** to reflect the actual tax burden of an MNE group in a given jurisdiction.
- Used to calculate **taxes owed under the GloBE regime** and to determine **tax credit or top-up amounts**.

> *Purpose:* To ensure that tax liabilities reflect the true economic impact of cross-border activities and avoid double taxation or tax avoidance.

---

### 3. **Adjustment Year**
- A fiscal year in which an **adjustment is made** to:
  - GloBE income or loss
  - Adjusted covered taxes
  - Jurisdictional adjusted covered taxes
- Adjustments are triggered by **ETR (Effective Tax Rate) adjustment provisions** (e.g., under paragraphs 18(23)(c), 25(6), 27(1)(b), 27(4), 37(4)(b), or (5)(b)).

> *Purpose:* To correct distortions caused by **low tax rates in certain jurisdictions**, ensuring that the tax burden reflects a minimum global rate of 15%.

---

### 4. **Aggregate Asset Gain/Loss**
- In the context of **election under subsection 18(23)**, refers to:
  - **Net gain or loss** from the **disposition of local tangible assets** (e.g., property, equipment) by all constituent entities in a jurisdiction.
  - Excludes **inter-group asset transfers** (i.e., internal reorganizations).
- Used to assess **profitability of local asset sales** and to determine whether a group has generated or lost value in a jurisdiction.

> *Purpose:* To prevent MNEs from shifting profits through **local asset sales** to reduce taxable income in high-tax jurisdictions.

---

### 5. **Allocable Share**
- Same meaning as in **subsection 15(2)**.
- Refers to the **proportion of income, expenses, or gains/losses** attributable to a particular constituent entity within an MNE group.
- Used in **profit allocation**, **tax apportionment**, and **top-up calculations**.

> *Purpose:* To fairly distribute tax obligations and benefits across group entities.

---

### 6. **Allocated Adjustment Top-Up Amount**
- Defined in **subsection 30(5)**.
- A **top-up payment** made to a jurisdiction to ensure that the effective tax rate (ETR) on a group’s income is **at least 15%**.
- Allocated based on the **proportion of income** or **taxable profits** of each entity.

> *Purpose:* To ensure that **low-tax jurisdictions do not receive undue tax benefits** due to profit shifting.

---

### 7. **Ancillary International Shipping Activity / Costs / Income / Revenue**
- Refers to **supporting or secondary activities** related to international shipping.
- Distinct from **core** shipping activities.
- Excludes **core operations** and is treated separately in tax calculations.
- Used to **prevent double counting** of shipping-related income and expenses.

---

### 8. **Blended Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) Tax Regime**
- A tax regime where:
  - The **tax liability of a domestic owner** is based on the **combined income, losses, and credits** of foreign entities in which they hold an interest.
  - The **lowest effective tax rate** in those foreign jurisdictions is **less than the 15% minimum rate**.
  - **Income from the domestic jurisdiction is not included** in the calculation.
- This regime is **potentially abusive** under GloBE because it allows owners to avoid tax on foreign profits due to low rates in other jurisdictions.

> *Purpose:* To **eliminate tax avoidance** through blended CFC regimes that allow owners to avoid tax on foreign earnings.

---

### 9. **Consolidated Financial Statements**
- Financial statements that present the **combined financial position** of:
