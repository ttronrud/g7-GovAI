**Detailed Summary of the *High Risk Child Sex Offender Database Act***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is titled the **High Risk Child Sex Offender Database Act** and may be cited accordingly. This legislation establishes a centralized, publicly accessible database designed to enhance public safety by identifying and providing information about individuals convicted of sexual offences against children who are deemed to pose a high risk of reoffending.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **Sexual Offence Against a Child**
This term is defined broadly and includes two categories:

- **Designated Offences under the Criminal Code (Section 490.011(1))**:  
  Any offence listed as a "designated offence" in subsection 490.011(1) of the *Criminal Code* that involves a person under 18 years of age, **excluding**:
  - Secondary offences (as defined in subsection 490.011(1)) where the prosecutor has **not established beyond a reasonable doubt** that the offender committed the act with the intent to commit a primary sexual offence.

- **Offences Committed Outside Canada**:  
  Any offence committed abroad against a person under 18 years of age, for which the offender is or was required to comply with the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA)*.

> *Note*: This definition ensures that only serious, intentional sexual offences involving minors are included, excluding minor or non-intentional acts.

#### **Commissioner**
Refers to the **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, who is responsible for administering the database under this Act.

#### **Crime of a Sexual Nature**
A crime is considered of a sexual nature if:
- It involves one or more acts that are **sexually motivated** or **intended to result in a sexually motivated act**, or
- It constitutes a criminal offence.

> This broad definition ensures that the Act captures both overtly sexual acts and those with a clear sexual intent.

#### **Exclusions from "Found Guilty"**
The Act explicitly excludes certain individuals from being included in the database:
- **Young persons** (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Youth Criminal Justice Act*) who have been found guilty of a sexual offence against a child **unless** they are sentenced as an adult (i.e., given an adult sentence).
- **Young persons** under the *Young Offenders Act* (Y-1) who have been found guilty of such an offence **unless** they were found guilty in an ordinary court (i.e., not through a youth court process).

> This provision respects the rehabilitative and age-sensitive principles of youth justice and prevents the inclusion of young offenders who may benefit from diversionary or restorative measures.

---

### **3. Purpose of the Act**
The primary objective is to **enhance public safety** by creating a **publicly accessible database** that contains information on individuals who:
- Have been found guilty of a sexual offence against a child, and  
- Are assessed as posing a **high risk** of committing future crimes of a sexual nature.

The database aims to assist law enforcement, the public, and other stakeholders in identifying potential threats to children.

---

### **4. Establishment and Administration of the Database**

- The **Commissioner of the RCMP** is responsible for:
  - Establishing and administering the database.
  - Ensuring it is **publicly accessible** (i.e., available to the general public, law enforcement, and authorized entities).

- The duties of the Commissioner may be **delegated** to any individual or body authorized by the Commissioner.

---

### **5. Information Included in the Database**

The database must contain only information that has **already been made publicly available** by a police service or other public authority. Specifically, the following details must be included:

1. **Given name and surname**, and any **aliases** used.
2. **Date of birth**.
3. **Gender**.
4. **Physical description**, including any **distinctive physical features or marks** (e.g., scars, tattoos, birthmarks).
5. **Photograph** of the individual.
6. **Description of offences committed** (e.g., nature, location, date).
7. **Any conditions to which the individual is subject** (e.g., probation, community orders, restrictions).
8. **Residence location** (city, town, municipality, or other organized district).

> This ensures that the database contains only data that is already in the public domain and avoids creating new or unauthorized disclosures.

---

### **6. Notification and Consent Requirements**

Before including a person’s **full name and surname** in the database, the Commissioner must:
- Take **reasonable steps to notify** the individual.
- Allow them to **make representations** (i.e., express concerns, request removal, or object) regarding the inclusion of their information.

> This respects individual rights and provides a mechanism for individuals to challenge or object to inclusion.

---

### **7. Right to Request Removal of Information**

- Any person found guilty of a sexual offence against a child (as defined) may submit a **written application** to the Commissioner requesting that information about them be **removed** from the database.
- The Commissioner must **review the application** and determine whether there are **reasonable grounds** to remove the information.
- If no decision is made within the time period prescribed by regulation, the Commissioner is **deemed to have decided not to remove** the information.
- The Commissioner must **notify the applicant promptly** of any decision (made or deemed).
- The applicant has **60 days** from receiving the notice to apply to the **Federal Court** for a **judicial review** of the decision.

> This establishes a clear, accessible, and legally enforceable process for challenging inclusion or removal of data.

---

### **8. Periodic Review of Database Content**

- The Commissioner must conduct **periodic reviews** of the information in the database:
  - Within 60 days of the database’s establishment.
  - At regular intervals thereafter.
- These reviews assess whether the information should **still be maintained** in the database.
- Importantly, **this review does not affect the validity or legal standing** of the database itself.

> This ensures the database remains current and relevant, and prevents outdated or irrelevant entries from persisting.

---

### **9. Legal Immunity and Limitations**

- **No interference with existing authorities**: Nothing in this Act limits or overrides the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (or any provincial authority’s) existing powers under other laws or at common law to disclose information.
- **Immunity from liability**: No criminal or civil action may be brought against the Commissioner or any person acting under their direction for anything done or omitted in **good faith** under this Act.

> This provides legal protection for public officials performing duties under the Act, encouraging transparency and compliance.

---

### **10. Regulatory Powers**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government) may make **regulations** to:
- **Establish criteria** for determining whether a person convicted of a sexual offence against a child poses a **high risk** of reoffending.
- **Prescribe specific details** required by this Act (e.g., notification timelines, review intervals, procedures for appeals).

> These regulations provide flexibility to adapt the Act to evolving practices, evidence, and public safety needs.

### **Criticisms and Considerations (Not in the Act, but Contextual)**

While the Act aims to improve public safety, it has raised concerns in civil liberties and privacy circles:
- **Potential for stigmatization** of individuals, especially those with past convictions.
- **Risk of misuse** of data by employers, schools, or private entities.
- **Lack of clarity on "high risk" criteria**—which are left to regulation, raising concerns about subjectivity.
- **No provision for data anonymization or redaction** in certain cases.

These issues highlight the need for strong oversight, clear standards, and public engagement in how the database is used and governed.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *High Risk Child Sex Offender Database Act* is a targeted legislative measure designed to improve public safety by creating a transparent, accessible, and legally protected database of individuals convicted of sexual offences against children who are assessed as high-risk. It balances the need for public protection with respect for individual rights, including notification, appeal rights, and judicial review. However, its success will depend on the clarity and fairness of the regulatory criteria for "high risk," the consistency of enforcement, and ongoing public oversight to prevent misuse or overreach.

This Act represents a significant step in the modernization of child protection systems in Canada, though its implementation must be carefully monitored to ensure it serves its intended purpose without compromising fundamental rights.
