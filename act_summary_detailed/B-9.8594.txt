### **6. Reform of the Social Security Tribunal (Division 17)**
This section restructures the **Social Security Tribunal** under the *Department of Employment and Social Development Act* (DESDA), replacing the former "General Division" and "Appeal Division" with updated procedural rules.

#### Key Reforms:
- **New Act** comes into force on the day the Division is enacted (with transitional rules).
- **Ongoing applications and appeals** are governed by the **former Act** (as it existed immediately before the new Act came into force), for greater certainty.

#### Appeal Procedures:
- Appeals of decisions made under **section 53** of the former Act must be filed with the **Appeal Division within 90 days** of the Division’s coming into force.
- **No leave is required** for such appeals — a significant change enhancing access to justice.
- Appeals that were ongoing or referred to at the time of implementation are handled under **former Act subsections 58(1) and 59(1)**.
- **Section 58.3 of the new Act does not apply** — it is excluded in all cases involving these appeals.

#### Judicial Review:
- The **Federal Court** has jurisdiction to hear **applications for judicial review** of decisions from the Appeal Division.
- If the Federal Court refers the matter back to the Appeal Division, it must be handled under the **former Act’s rules** (58(1) and 59(1)).
- The Federal Court of Appeal also has jurisdiction; if it refers a matter back, the Appeal Division applies the former Act rules.

#### Applications under Section 66 (Appeals from Income Security Section):
- Ongoing applications under section 66 are processed under the **former Act**.
- If the Appeal Division refers a matter back to the General Division, it is handled under **section 66 of the former Act**.
- Appeals for leave to appeal are processed under **former Act subsections 58(1) and (2)**.
- If leave is granted:
  - The appeal is processed under **58(1) and 59(1)** of the former Act.
  - If the Appeal Division decides to give the decision that the General Division should have made, the matter is **also processed under section 66 of the former Act**.
- Again, **section 58.3 of the new Act does not apply**.

#### Appeals from the Income Security Section:
- Applications for leave to appeal decisions from the Income Security Section are handled under
