**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act**

The *Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act* is a historical legislative instrument that provides foundational legal provisions for the governance, land policy, and legal framework of the Province of Manitoba within the Canadian Confederation. Below is a detailed and structured summary of the key elements of the Act:

---

### **1. Citation and Applicable Definitions**

- **Citation**: The Act is formally titled the *Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act*.
- **Definitions**:
  - **"Commissioners"**: In cases where a commission is issued to a single individual (rather than a group), the term "Commissioners" refers to that individual. This clarifies the use of the plural form in legal contexts when only one person is involved.
  - **"Minister"**: Refers specifically to the **Minister of the Interior** of the Dominion Government (i.e., the federal government at the time). This role was central to administering provincial affairs, including land, natural resources, and internal governance.
  - **"Province"**: Clearly defined as the **Province of Manitoba**, establishing jurisdictional boundaries for the Act’s application.

### **2. Land Endowment for the University of Manitoba**

A key provision of the Act establishes a significant land grant to support the University of Manitoba:

- **Land Grant**: The Dominion Government (federal government) shall select and grant an **allotment of land not exceeding 150,000 acres** (approximately 607 square kilometers).
- **Land Quality**: The land must be of **"fair average quality"**, ensuring it is suitable for agricultural or educational use, but not necessarily of the highest fertility or value.
- **Purpose**: The land is granted as an **endowment** specifically for:
  - The **maintenance** of the University of Manitoba as a university.
  - Providing **proper training in higher branches of education** (i.e., advanced academic disciplines such as science, engineering, law, medicine, etc.).
- **Trust Status**: The land is to be held in **trust** for the educational purpose.
- **Governance of the Trust**:
  - The **University of Manitoba** is responsible for framing a **scheme or basis** for the use and management of the land.
  - This scheme must be **approved by the Dominion Government** (federal authorities) before implementation.

> This provision reflects early federal recognition of the importance of higher education and institutional support through land endowments, a common practice in Canadian provinces during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

### **3. Legal Framework: Application of English Common Law**

The Act establishes the legal foundation for the Province of Manitoba by referencing the laws of England:

- **Source of Law**: The laws of England relating to matters within the jurisdiction of the **Parliament of Canada** are to be applied in Manitoba.
- **Effective Date**: These laws are to take effect from **July 15, 1870**, the date specified in the Act.
- **Scope of Application**:
  - The laws are to apply **to the Province of Manitoba**.
  - They apply **only to matters within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada**, meaning those areas over which federal authority prevails (e.g., criminal law, trade, and interprovincial matters).
- **Exclusions**:
  - The laws are **not applicable** where they have been:
    - Repealed (abolished),
    - Altered, varied, modified, or affected by:
      - Any Act of the **Parliament of Great Britain** (pre-Confederation) that applied to Manitoba, or
      - Any Act of the **Parliament of Canada** (post-Confederation) that specifically applies to Manitoba.

> This provision was critical in the transition from British colonial rule to Canadian Confederation. It ensured continuity in legal frameworks while allowing for future federal legislative amendments or overrides.

### **4. Repeal Provisions (Historical Note)**

- Two sections of the Act (originally included) were **repealed in 1992** under **Section 146 of the Statutes of Canada, Chapter 1 (c. 1)**, specifically in **Schedule IX, item 35**.
- These sections were **not substantive** and were likely outdated or redundant, possibly related to obsolete administrative or procedural provisions.
- The repeal indicates that the Act has been **modernized or superseded** by later legislation, and its current relevance is limited to historical or archival significance.

### **Overall Purpose and Significance**

The *Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act* serves as a foundational piece of legislation in the early development of Manitoba’s legal and educational institutions. Its key contributions include:

1. **Educational Endowment**: Establishing a federal land grant to support the University of Manitoba, ensuring its long-term sustainability and academic capacity.
2. **Legal Continuity**: Providing a clear legal basis for the application of English common law in Manitoba, especially during the formative years of Canadian Confederation.
3. **Federal-Province Relationship**: Demonstrating the role of the Dominion Government (federal government) in supporting provincial institutions and governance.

### **Status and Current Relevance**

- While the **land endowment provision** may have had lasting effects on the University of Manitoba’s development, the **legal framework** it establishes has been replaced or superseded by modern statutes.
- The **repeal in 1992** confirms that the Act is no longer in active force.
