### **Detailed Summary of the Spending Control Act**

The **Spending Control Act** is a Canadian federal law enacted to establish strict fiscal discipline and limit government program spending during a defined period—specifically, from the **1991–92 fiscal year through the 1995–96 fiscal year**. The Act was designed as a response to concerns about rising public debt and unsustainable budget deficits, aiming to ensure that government spending remains within pre-determined financial limits.

This summary provides a comprehensive, structured breakdown of the key provisions, definitions, mechanisms, and implications of the Act.

---

## **1. Title and Purpose**
- **Title:** The Act may be cited as the *Spending Control Act*.
- **Purpose:** To impose spending caps on the Government of Canada’s program expenditures for specific fiscal years, ensuring fiscal responsibility and preventing excessive spending growth without parliamentary oversight.

## **2. Key Definitions**

## **3. Spending Limit Framework (by Fiscal Year)**

The spending limit is not fixed—it is defined differently for each fiscal year, with a clear upward trend:

| Fiscal Year | Spending Limit (CAD) | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| **1991–92** | $97,200 million | Base limit; no adjustments unless certified under section 4(1). |
| **1992–93** | $100,900 million | + increases under subsections 3(2), (3)(b), or 6(4); minus reductions under (6)(b) or 6(3). |
| **1993–94** | $104,100 million | + increases under (3)(b), (6)(a), or 6(4); minus reductions under (3)(a), (6)(b), or 6(3). |
| **1994–95** | $107,400 million | Same formula as 1993–94, with same adjustments. |
| **1995–96** | $111,250 million | Higher base; includes increases under 3(2), (4), (6)(a), or 6(4); minus reductions under (3)(a), (6)(b), or 6(3). |

> These figures reflect a gradual increase in the fiscal ceiling, reflecting economic growth and inflation expectations.

## **4. Rules on Budget Proposals and Spending Excesses**

### **Rule 1: No Excess Spending Without Exception**
> **Subsection (1):** Generally, the Minister **cannot propose program spending** in a controlled fiscal year that exceeds the spending limit for that year.

### **Rule 2: Forward Allocation of Excess Spending (from Previous Year)**
> If, based on prior-year expenditure data, it appears that the *actual spending* in the prior year exceeded the spending limit (without this rule), the Minister may **allocate all or part of that excess** to the current fiscal year.  
> → The **spending limit for the current year is increased** by the amount allocated.

### **Rule 3: Backward Allocation of Excess Spending (to Future Years)**
> If the Minister proposes spending **exceeding** the limit for a particular year, they may **allocate the excess to the next two fiscal years** in proportions they determine and announce in the budget.  
> → The **spending limit of each of the two following years is reduced** by the portion allocated.  
> → The **spending limit of the current year is increased** by the total of the allocations.

### **Rule 4: Special Provision for 1995–96**
> For the 1995–96 fiscal year, the Minister may propose spending above the limit **if they indicate specific restraint measures** (e.g., spending cuts) to be implemented in **1996–97 or 1997–98** to offset the excess.  
> → The spending limit for 1995–96 is **increased by the amount of the excess**.

### **Rule 5: Amendments to Increase the Limit**
> The Minister may propose spending above the limit **if they simultaneously announce proposed amendments** to this Act to raise the spending limit.  
> → The proposed spending is allowed **only if it does not exceed the adjusted limit** under the proposed changes.

### **Rule 6: Allocating Surpluses (Spending Below Limit)**
> If the actual program spending is **less than the spending limit**, the Minister may **allocate the difference** to future fiscal years.  
> → The **spending limit of those future years is increased** by the amount allocated.  
> → The **spending limit of the current year is reduced** by the total of the allocations.

## **5. Certification of Specific Program Increases**

### **Authority: President of the Treasury Board**
The President of the Treasury Board can **certify** that a proposed increase in spending for a specific program is justified **if**:
- The increase will generate **equal or greater revenue** than the cost increase in the same year, and that revenue would not occur without the increase; **OR**
- Over a series of consecutive years including the current one, similar increases would result in **total government revenue** equal to or exceeding total expenditures, and that revenue would not occur without those increases.

> This is a mechanism to allow **targeted spending increases** if they are economically justified through revenue generation.

### **Disclosure Requirement**
- A copy of any such certification must be **included in the main or supplementary estimates** for the fiscal year in which the program is funded.

---

## **6. Spending Excess Calculation (Section 5)**

A **spending excess** is defined as the **greater of zero and**:

> **Spending Excess = max(0, [Program Spending – Spending Limit])**

But the Act defines a more complex formula involving **asset sales and wind-ups**:

> **Spending Excess = max(0, (A + B) – C)**  
> Where:
> - **A** = Total amount by which the **net value of shares sold** in a Crown corporation exceeds **net proceeds of disposal** (as of March 31 before sale).  
> - **B** = Total amount by which the **net value of shares in a wound-up Crown corporation** exceeds the **total value of financial assets received** by the government from the winding-up.  
> - **C** = The spending limit for the year.

> This means that **any loss on the disposal of Crown corporation assets** (e.g., selling shares below market value) counts as an excess, even if the government didn’t spend more.

> This provision ensures that **asset sales are not used to "hide" fiscal overspending**—any shortfall in proceeds is treated as a fiscal burden.

## **7. Public Accountability and Reporting**

### **Public Accounts Requirement**
- The **Public Accounts** for each controlled fiscal year must include a **statement by the Minister** on compliance with the Act.
- The statement must identify:
  - All amounts included in **B** (asset disposal losses);
  - All amounts **certified under section 4(1)**;
  - All expenditures falling under the **eight categories of program spending** listed in section 2.

### **Reporting on Excess Spending**
- If a spending excess is found:
  - The Minister must **allocate it to the next two fiscal years** within the next budget.
  - Each of those years’ spending limits is **reduced** by the allocated amount.
- If the spending limit exceeds actual program spending:
  - The Minister may **allocate the excess to future years** (not previously allocated), increasing those years’ spending limits.

---

## **8. Budget Transparency and Adjustments**

- In every budget presented **after the Act comes into force**, the Minister must:
  - **State the adjusted spending limit** for each fiscal year.
  - Provide a **clear explanation** for each adjustment (e.g., due to proposed spending, allocations, or amendments).

> This ensures **transparency and accountability** in fiscal planning.

---

## **9. Auditor General Oversight**

- The **Auditor General of Canada** must audit the Minister’s statement in the Public Accounts.
- The Auditor General shall issue an **opinion** on whether the statement:
  -
