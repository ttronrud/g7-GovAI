**Detailed Summary of the *Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act***  

---

### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act* (commonly referred to as the **PEASRA**) is a specialized piece of legislation designed to establish **collective bargaining rights and employment protections** for certain employees working within key institutions of the Parliament of Canada. Its primary purpose is to ensure that employees in parliamentary service — particularly those in non-managerial, non-confidential roles — have the right to engage in **collective bargaining**, file **grievances**, and enjoy **fair labor practices**, all while respecting the unique constitutional and institutional nature of Parliament.

This Act operates as a **distinct legal framework** that **excludes** or **overrides** other federal labor laws (such as the *Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act*) in specific contexts, ensuring that the governance and employment relationships within Parliament are governed by rules tailored to its structure, privileges, and public accountability.

## **2. Key Definitions and Concepts**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Employee** | A person employed by a parliamentary employer, excluding those in managerial/confidential roles, casual/temporary workers, or those under specific exclusions. A person does **not lose employment status** merely due to termination under this Act. |
| **Managerial or Confidential Capacity** | Includes individuals with executive duties, personnel responsibilities, legal roles, or positions confidential to senior parliamentary officers (e.g., Speakers, Clerks, Counsel).

| **Bargaining Agent** | An employee organization certified by the Board to represent a bargaining unit. Certification is revocable only under strict conditions. |
| **Grievance** | A formal written complaint by an employee (or group) about employment issues. Special provisions allow former employees or those in managerial roles to file grievances related to termination or suspension. |
| **Dispute** | A disagreement arising during the negotiation, renewal, or revision of a collective agreement, leading to arbitration. |
| **Strike** | Includes work stoppages, refusals to work, slowdowns, or concerted actions designed to restrict output. |
| **Board** | The **Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board (FPLREB)**, which administers the Act and resolves disputes. |

## **3. Core Rights and Protections**

### **A. Right to Collective Bargaining**
- Employees may form or join **employee organizations** (syndicates or unions) to negotiate terms and conditions of employment.
- The Board can certify **bargaining agents** (i.e., unions) for specific units of employees.
- Certification requires that the employee organizations have **appropriate authority** to act as representatives.

> *Example:* A group of parliamentary researchers may form a union and apply to the Board for certification to negotiate wages, working hours, and job security.

### **B. Right to File Grievances**
- Employees may file formal grievances regarding employment issues (e.g., unfair treatment, discrimination, poor working conditions).
- Grievances can be referred to an **adjudicator** (Board member) or an **arbitrator** (in disputes involving collective agreements).

> Special rule: For grievances involving termination or suspension, even former employees or those in managerial roles may be included, provided they were employed in such a role at the time of the incident.

### **C. Protection Against Discrimination**
- **No employer may discriminate** against employees because they:
  - Are members of an employee organization
  - Are exercising rights under this Act (e.g., filing a grievance)
- Employers **cannot impose conditions** on employment that would restrict an employee from joining a union or exercising rights.
- Employers **cannot intimidate** employees into joining or leaving unions.

> *Note:* These protections apply **even to employees in managerial or confidential roles**, though such individuals are excluded from collective bargaining.

### **D. Prohibition on Interference**
- No person in a **managerial or confidential capacity** may:
  - Participate in or interfere with the formation or administration of an employee organization
  - Represent or influence employees in union activities
- However, they may **receive representations** from union representatives — as long as it does not involve direct interference.

> This protects the independence of unions while acknowledging that senior officials have unique responsibilities.

- Rules of procedure for adjudication hearings

> These regulations are published in the *Canada Gazette* and have immediate effect upon publication.

### **C. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The Board can investigate complaints that:
  - An employer or employee organization has violated prohibitions in sections 6–8
  - A provision of an arbitral award or adjudicator decision has not been implemented
  - A regulation on grievances has not been followed
- If a violation is found, the Board may issue an **order** requiring compliance, with a specified time limit.

### **D. Review and Reversal of Decisions**

### **A. No Abrogation of Parliamentary Privileges**
- The Act **does not override** the **privileges, immunities, or powers** granted to Parliament under **section 4 of the *Parliament of Canada Act***.

### **B. Accessible Canada Act – Complaint Pathway**
- If a person suffers **physical, psychological harm, property damage, or economic loss** due to a violation of a regulation under the *Accessible Canada Act* (e.g., failure to provide accessible facilities), and that violation is related to a contravention of a regulation under this Act, the person may file a **complaint under subsection 94(1)** of the *Accessible Canada Act*.

> This provides a legal avenue for redress when employment-related barriers cause harm.
