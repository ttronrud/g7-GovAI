**Detailed Summary of the Tax-back Guarantee Act**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The Act is officially titled the *Tax-back Guarantee Act* and may be cited as such. This name suggests a policy mechanism aimed at returning or guaranteeing tax relief to individuals, likely in the form of direct or indirect financial benefits derived from government savings.

---

**2. Core Objective**  
The central purpose of the Act is to **channel imputed interest savings from federal debt reductions into tax relief for individuals**. In essence, when the Government of Canada reduces its federal debt, it saves money on the interest it would otherwise have to pay. These savings are not simply retained by the government; instead, they are redirected to provide tangible tax relief to Canadian individuals—such as lower tax burdens, rebates, or other forms of fiscal support.

**3. Definition of "Federal Debt"**  
- *Federal debt* is defined as the **accumulated deficit** of the Government of Canada for a given fiscal year.  
- This deficit is determined based on the official Public Accounts of Canada, specifically in accordance with **sections 63 and 64 of the Financial Administration Act**.  
- These sections provide the legal framework for how federal deficits and debt are calculated and reported annually.  
- Therefore, the Act relies on publicly available, audited financial data to establish the baseline for debt reduction.

**4. Calculation of Imputed Interest Savings**  
The *imputed interest savings* for a fiscal year are calculated using the following formula:

> **Imputed Interest Savings = (Total Reduction in Federal Debt for the Year) × (Effective Interest Rate for the Year)**

- **Reduction in federal debt**: The total amount by which the government reduced its accumulated deficit (i.e., the difference between the beginning and ending debt levels for the year).
- **Effective interest rate**: A key metric that reflects the cost of holding public debt, calculated as follows:

> **Effective Interest Rate = (Public Debt Charges on Unmatured Debt for the Year) ÷ (Average Unmatured Debt for the Year)**

Where:
- **Public debt charges on unmatured debt** are the interest payments (as reported in the Public Accounts) related to debt that has not yet matured.
- **Average unmatured debt** is the average of the debt levels at the beginning and end of the fiscal year:
  - Calculated as: (Beginning Debt + Ending Debt) ÷ 2

This ensures that the interest rate reflects the actual financial cost of the debt over the year, rather than a static or arbitrary rate.

**5. Reporting Requirements**  
The Minister of Finance is required to **report annually** (at least once per fiscal year) on the following:

1. **Finalized Determination of Imputed Interest Savings**  
   - A clear, publicly disclosed figure showing the total amount of imputed interest savings realized in the previous fiscal year.  
   - This report must be submitted in the form of a **statement tabled in the House of Commons** (i.e., formally presented to Parliament), ensuring transparency and accountability to elected officials and the public.

2. **Accounting of How Savings Are Applied**  
   - A detailed breakdown of **how the imputed interest savings have been allocated** to specific tax relief measures.  
   - This includes identifying which programs, initiatives, or individual tax benefits (e.g., child benefits, tax credits, income tax reductions) have received funding or support from these savings.  
   - The goal is to demonstrate that the savings are being used to directly benefit individuals and reduce their tax burden.

**6. Key Implications and Policy Significance**  
- **Transparency and Accountability**: By requiring public reporting to Parliament, the Act ensures that the use of debt-related savings is not hidden or mismanaged.
- **Equity and Social Benefit**: The mechanism prioritizes individual tax relief over general government spending, suggesting a policy commitment to redistributing fiscal savings to support lower- and middle-income Canadians.
- **Fiscal Responsibility with Social Outcomes**: It links debt reduction (a fiscal discipline measure) directly to social outcomes (tax relief), creating a more visible and socially beneficial return on sound fiscal management.
- **Predictability and Planning**: The use of a defined, transparent formula for calculating imputed interest savings allows for consistent and predictable annual reporting, enabling long-term planning by both government and the public.

---

**7. Limitations and Considerations**  
- The Act does **not guarantee** that all imputed interest savings will be used for tax relief—only that they *shall be applied* to such measures. The actual allocation may depend on budgetary priorities, political decisions, or economic conditions.
- The effectiveness of the mechanism depends on the accuracy of Public Accounts data and the timely implementation of tax relief measures.
- The "effective interest rate" is based on unmatured debt, which may not fully capture all debt-related costs (e.g., refinancing, currency risk, or long-term liabilities), though it provides a reasonable proxy.

**Conclusion**  
The *Tax-back Guarantee Act* establishes a transparent, accountable, and socially oriented mechanism to convert fiscal savings from reduced federal debt into direct tax relief for individuals. By clearly defining how imputed interest savings are calculated and mandating public reporting of their use, the Act strengthens public trust in government financial management and ensures that fiscal discipline translates into tangible benefits for citizens. It represents a unique fusion of fiscal policy and social policy, where economic efficiency is directly linked to individual welfare.
