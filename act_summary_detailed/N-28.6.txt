### **Detailed Summary of the Nunavut Act**

The **Nunavut Act** (R.S.C. 1985, c. N-11) is the foundational legislation that establishes **Nunavut** as a new territory of Canada. Enacted in 1999, it came into force on **April 1, 1999**, following the creation of Nunavut as Canada’s newest territory. This Act provides a comprehensive legal framework for the governance, administration, legislative authority, financial structure, judicial system, and land rights of Nunavut — a territory located in northern Canada, primarily in the Arctic regions.

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the key provisions of the Act:

---

## **1. Purpose and Citation**
- The Act is titled **"The Nunavut Act"** and is a constitutional statute that formally creates Nunavut as a self-governing territory.
- It is enacted by **Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada**, reflecting its status as a federal law.

## **2. Key Definitions**
The Act establishes several key terms used throughout:
