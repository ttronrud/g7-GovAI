The **Customs and Excise Offshore Application Act** is a Canadian legislative instrument designed to extend the application of federal customs and excise laws to certain goods and vessels located on or within the **continental shelf of Canada**, particularly those used for exploration, development, or transportation of mineral and non-living natural resources. This Act provides specific exemptions and special rules to ensure that goods and ships used in offshore operations are not subject to customs duties and taxes upon arrival or use in these offshore zones — especially when such use is tied to Canadian interests, such as through lease arrangements or prior agreements.

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the Act, including definitions, key provisions, and their implications.

## 🔹 **Act Title and Citation**
- **Title:** *Customs and Excise Offshore Application Act*
- **Citation:** The Act may be cited as the *Customs and Excise Offshore Application Act*.

## 🔹 **Key Definitions (In Scope)**

| Term | Definition and Notes |
|------|------------------------|
| **Canadian lessee** | A person (individual, corporation, or group) that is Canadian-owned and carries on business in Canada. |
| **Canadian-owned** | A person who is: <br> - A resident of Canada (under section 250 of the Income Tax Act), <br> - A corporation incorporated in Canada (federal or provincial), or <br> - A group where at least one member is one of the above. |
| **Canadian ship** | Defined under the *Canada Shipping Act* — essentially, a vessel registered or operating in Canada. |
| **Designated goods** | Includes: <br> - Artificial islands, drilling rigs, platforms, pipelines, storage tanks, docks, etc., permanently or temporarily attached to or on the continental shelf for exploration, development, production, or transport of natural resources; <br> - Equipment used in construction or servicing of such structures; <br> - Goods used on or transported between such structures and Canada. |
| **Federal customs laws** | Includes Acts, regulations, and rules related to customs and excise (e.g., *Excise Act*, *Customs Act*, *Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act*, *Customs Tariff*, *Excise Act, 2001*, *Select Luxury Items Tax Act*), regardless of when they came into force — applies even before or after June 30, 1983. |
| **Lease** | Includes charter agreements. |
| **Renewal** | Includes extension of lease or exercise of an option to continue it. |
| **Warehouse** | Same meaning as in the *Customs Act*. |
| **Continental shelf** | The seabed and subsoil of Canada beyond its territorial waters, extending from the coast to the edge of the continental margin. *Note: This term was repealed in 1996 (c. 31, s. 76), suggesting the Act may now be outdated or superseded.* |

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** Several geographical terms (e.g., *continental shelf*, *internal waters*, *territorial sea*) have been **repealed** by amendments in 1996 (c. 31, s. 76). This indicates that the Act may no longer be actively in force or has been replaced by newer legislation (e.g., *Canada Shipping Act*, *Oceans Act*, or *Marine and Coastal Area Act*). The continued use of these terms in the text suggests a historical or transitional nature of the Act.

## 🔹 **Core Provisions and Legal Effects**

### 1. **Application of Federal Customs Laws to Designated Goods on the Continental Shelf**

> **Section (subject to sections 5–8):**  
> Federal customs laws apply to designated goods **as if they were being imported into Canada** for use or consumption in Canada.

#### Key Implications:
- Goods used on the continental shelf (e.g., oil rigs, pipelines, platforms) are treated **as if they are imported into Canada**.
- References in customs laws to "importation into Canada" are **deemed to include** bringing goods within the continental shelf for use as designated goods.

> ✅ This allows Canadian offshore operations to function under familiar customs and excise frameworks, avoiding the need for full importation procedures.

---

### 2. **Treatment of Movement of Goods Within the Continental Shelf or Between Canada and Shelf**

> **Movement within continental shelf or from Canada to shelf:**
- If goods are moved **directly**:
  - From one place to another **within** the continental shelf, or
  - From a place in Canada to a place on the shelf,
- And all duties and taxes are paid under federal customs laws,
- Then they are **treated as if moved between locations in Canada**.

> ✅ This avoids double taxation or reclassification of goods during internal movement.

> **Movement from shelf to Canada:**
- If goods are moved **from the continental shelf to Canada**, they are treated as if moved between locations in Canada.

> ✅ This ensures continuity of treatment and avoids triggering new import duties upon return.

---

### 3. **Presumption of Canadian Ownership for Leased Goods**

> **Designated goods held under lease by a Canadian-owned entity are deemed Canadian-owned**, even if the original owner was not Canadian-owned.

#### Conditions:
- The lessee must be a Canadian-owned individual, corporation, or group.
- The goods must have been **wholly owned by the lessee immediately before the lease began**.

> ✅ This encourages investment by Canadian entities in offshore projects by allowing them to benefit from customs exemptions under the "Canadian ownership" framework.

---

### 4. **Exemptions from Section 3 (Duty and Tax Application)**

> **Section 3** normally applies to goods imported into Canada and imposes duties and taxes.

#### Exemptions apply under specific conditions to **designated goods**:

##### a) Goods that were already in Canada on June 30, 1983
- If, on June 30, 1983:
  - The goods were **within the continental shelf**,
  - Were **ship stores**,
  - Were in **warehouse or storage in Canada**, or
  - Were **imported temporarily** for use in Canada,
- Then, **Section 3 does not apply** when they are used or consumed on the shelf.

> ✅ Provides continuity for goods already present in offshore operations before a key date (June 30, 1983).

##### b) Goods under lease (entered into before January 6, 1983)
- If:
  - The goods were **not Canadian-owned** on June 30, 1983,
  - Were within the shelf, in storage, or were temporary imports,
- And the lease was entered into **before January 6, 1983**,
- Then **Section 3 does not apply** throughout the lease term to the **first Canadian lessee** or any renewal.
- If the lease has no fixed term, the exemption lasts for **12 months after June 30, 1983**.

> ✅ Allows non-Canadian-owned goods to be used offshore under Canadian lease arrangements without immediate duty imposition.

##### c) Goods brought after June 30, 1983, under pre-January 6, 1983 contracts
- If goods are brought to the shelf **after June 30, 1983** under a contract entered before January 6, 1983,
- And are used on the shelf,
- Then **Section 3 does not apply**.

> ✅ Extends the benefit of exemption to new arrivals under pre-existing agreements.

##### d) Lease with no fixed term and goods brought after June 30, 1983
- If the lease was entered before January 6, 1983,
- The goods are not Canadian-owned,
- And are brought to the shelf after June 30, 1983,
- Then exemption applies for:
  - The term of the lease to the first Canadian lessee, or
  - 12 months after the goods are brought to the shelf (if no fixed term),
- **Excludes renewals entered on or after January 6, 1983**.

> ✅ Limits the exemption period to prevent indefinite avoidance of duties.

##### e) Time Limit for Exemption
- If the exemption period ends (e.g., after 12 months or lease expiry), **Section 3 applies** as if the goods were imported into Canada.

> ✅ Ensures eventual compliance with customs duties after the exemption window closes.

##### f) Subsection (1) and (2) do not apply unless goods are brought within 12 months of possession
- If goods are acquired under a pre-January 6, 1983 contract, the exemption **only applies if brought to the shelf within 12 months** of the acquirers taking possession.

> ✅ Prevents abuse by delaying the use of offshore goods beyond a reasonable time.

---

### 5. **Successor in Title and Duty Status**

> **Subsection (1):**  
> A successor in title to designated goods is treated as if the original goods were used within the continental shelf.

> ✅ Ensures that even if ownership changes (e.g., through sale or transfer), the exemption continues as long as the goods remain in offshore use.

---

### 6. **Duty and Tax Paid Status After Five Years of Exclusive Use**

> **If goods (from sections 5 or 6) are used exclusively
