**Detailed Summary of the *Visiting Forces Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Visiting Forces Act* is a Canadian law that establishes the legal framework governing the presence, jurisdiction, rights, and responsibilities of **armed forces of foreign states ("designated states")** when they are temporarily stationed in Canada for official duties. The Act ensures that these visiting forces and their personnel are treated under a clear and balanced system of legal jurisdiction, immunity, taxation, and operational rights—while preserving Canada’s sovereignty and the rule of law.

It applies only to designated foreign states, and its scope is strictly defined and subject to the authority of the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet), which may designate countries and determine the extent of the Act’s application.

## **Scope and Application**

- The Act **only applies to designated states**, and only to the extent declared by the Governor in Council.
- The Governor in Council may:
  - Designate a foreign country as a "designated state";
  - Declare the scope of the Act’s application to that state;
  - Designate civilian personnel as part of a visiting force;
  - Revoke or amend any such designation or declaration.

> This means Canada retains full discretion over when and how the Act is invoked, ensuring flexibility and diplomatic sensitivity.

## **Jurisdiction: Civil Courts vs. Service Courts**

### **1. Primary Jurisdiction in Most Cases**
- **Civil courts have primary jurisdiction** over offences committed by members of a visiting force or their dependants **unless** the offence falls under specific categories where service courts have priority.

> *Exception: Offences involving official duties or specific sensitive areas (see below).*

### **2. Service Courts Have Primary Jurisdiction in These Cases**
The service courts (military tribunals) have primary jurisdiction when:
- The offence involves:
  - The **property or security of the designated state**;
  - The **person or property of another member of the visiting force or a dependant**;
  - An **act or omission in the performance of official duty**.

> This ensures that military forces can handle internal discipline and matters of national security without interference from Canadian civil courts.

### **3. No Double Trials**
- **No retrial**:
  - A person tried and convicted or acquitted by a **civil court** cannot be retried by a **service court** for the same offence.
  - A person tried and convicted or acquitted by a **service court** cannot be retried by a **civil court** for the same offence.
- **Exception**: Service courts **can** try members for **disciplinary violations** (e.g., breaches of military rules) even if a civil trial occurred—this preserves internal military discipline.

> This protects against double jeopardy while allowing for distinct legal processes based on the nature of the offence.

### **4. Waiver of Primary Jurisdiction**
- The primary right of jurisdiction (civil or service) **may be waived** by regulation, allowing either court to take the first instance in certain circumstances.

## **Evidence and Immunity**

### **Certificate of Official Duty**
- A certificate signed by the officer in command stating that an act was or was not performed in the course of official duty is **admissible in civil court** and **deemed true in the absence of contrary evidence**.

### **Immunities and Privileges**
- Members of a visiting force’s service court and witnesses before it enjoy the **same immunities and privileges** as members of a Canadian court martial under the *National Defence Act*.

> This includes protection from legal proceedings and immunity from civil liability during the course of military proceedings.

---

## **Legal Effect of Service Court Proceedings**

For the purposes of **Canadian legal proceedings**, the following are deemed valid:
- The service court is **properly constituted**;
- Proceedings were **regularly conducted**;
- The sentence is **within the jurisdiction** of the service court and in accordance with the laws of the designated state;
- If the sentence is executed, it is **lawfully executed**.

> This ensures that Canadian courts accept the legitimacy of foreign military tribunals, even if they operate under different legal systems.

---

## **Detention and Custody**

- A member or dependant of a visiting force is **deemed to be in lawful custody** if:
  - They are detained **under a valid sentence** from a service court; or
  - They are detained **pending a service court trial**.

> This protects the individual from being challenged on the legality of detention in Canadian courts.

---

## **Arrest and Enforcement Powers**

- The **Minister of National Defence** may issue orders (by general or special directives) to Canadian Forces personnel to:
  - Arrest members of a visiting force or dependants **alleged to have committed offences** against the law of the designated state;
  - Hand over the arrested person to the appropriate authorities of the visiting force.

> This allows for swift enforcement of foreign laws when necessary, with Canadian forces acting as enablers under clear instructions.

---

## **Place of Incarceration**

- Members sentenced to incarceration may serve their punishment in:
  - A **penitentiary** (for long sentences);
  - A **civil prison** (for less than two years);
  - A **service prison**;
  - A **detention barrack**.

> The **Minister of National Defence** determines the location and extent (whole or partial) of incarceration based on:
  - The nature of the sentence;
  - The laws of the designated state;
  - Practical and security considerations.

> The relevant provisions of the *National Defence Act* apply with necessary modifications.

---

## **Police Powers and Firearms**

- Members of a visiting force **may possess and carry explosives, ammunition, and firearms** if authorized by service authorities.
- They are **not subject to Criminal Code provisions** on:
  - Unlawful drilling;
  - Possession or making of explosives.

> **Exception**: Nothing prevents a visiting force member from exercising the **power of arrest** under *Criminal Code* subsections 494(1) and (2), which relate to general arrest powers.

> Police powers are **limited** to members of the visiting force or their dependants.

---

## **Liability and Tort Law (Crown Liability and Proceedings Act)**

### **In Quebec and Other Provinces**
- A tort (wrongful act) committed by a visiting force member while acting within their duties is **deemed to have been committed by a servant of the Crown**.
- Property and service vehicles of the visiting force are **deemed to be owned or controlled by the Crown**.

> This ensures that Canadian legal systems can treat visiting force members as **employees of the Crown**, simplifying liability and insurance issues.

### **No Liability for Claims Arising from Injury or Death**
- **No proceedings** may be brought against the Crown or against a visiting force member for:
  - Death or injury to a member or dependant;
  - Claims arising from funds administered by the designated state;
- **Only if compensation has been paid or is payable** by the designated state.

> This provides strong protection to both the state and the individual, ensuring that the state bears responsibility for harm caused by its own personnel.

### **No Enforcement of Judgments**
- A member of a visiting force is **not subject to enforcement of judgments** in Canada arising from duties performed during service.

> This prevents legal actions from being used to extract compensation or penalties after service ends.

## **Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act (FISIA)**

- The **FISIA applies to designated states** as though:
  - "Office under Her Majesty" includes **any government office** of the designated state;
  - "Prohibited place" includes:
    - Defence facilities (arsenals, ships, aircraft, etc.);
    - Places used for manufacturing, storing, or developing weapons or war materials;
    - Contracted sites used by the designated state for such purposes;
  - "Safety or interests of the state" = safety and security interests of the designated state;
  - "Contract made on behalf of Her Majesty" = contract made on behalf of the designated state;
  - "Member of Her Majesty’s forces" = member of the visiting force.

> This ensures that Canada can protect national security interests from foreign interference, even when foreign forces are present.

### **Exemption**
- **Section 26 of FISIA does not apply** to designated states.

> This removes a specific restriction on liability or penalties related to foreign interference, allowing broader enforcement.

## **Taxation Provisions**

### **Residence and Domicile**
- Time spent in Canada due to service with a visiting force is **not counted
