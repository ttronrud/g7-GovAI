The provided text consists entirely of repealing notices—repeated references to sections of legislation being repealed by statutory amendments. Specifically, the entries indicate that multiple sections of a prior act (or acts) were **repealed** in:

- **2004, Chapter 11, Section 55** (and several other sections without specific numbers),
- And one section repealed in **1995, Chapter 29, Section 49**.

However, **no actual content, provisions, or substantive details of the original act** are included in the text. There is no description of what the act originally governed, its key provisions, objectives, or legal significance—only that it has been formally repealed.

### Summary:

**There is no detailed summary of an act** because:

- The text provided does **not contain the actual content or provisions** of any act.
- It only lists **repeal notices**, indicating that various sections of a prior law were removed or canceled.
- The repeals occurred under:
  - **1995, c. 29, s. 49** (one section repealed),
  - **2004, c. 11, s. 55** and various unspecified sections (multiple repeals).

### Interpretation:

This appears to be a **list of repeals**, likely from a legislative register or index, showing that certain provisions of a previous statute were formally removed from the law. Without knowing the original name or subject matter of the act (e.g., "The Public Health Act," "The Municipal Government Act," etc.), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of its content or purpose.

### Conclusion:

❌ **No detailed summary of an act can be provided** based solely on this input.  
✅ The information available only confirms that **several sections of a prior act were repealed in 1995 and 2004**, but the **original act’s content, scope, or purpose is missing**.

To generate a detailed summary, the actual text of the original act or its provisions would be required.
