## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Bill of Rights Act, 1960**

### 🔹 **1. Purpose and Foundational Principles**

The Act begins with a **moral and philosophical affirmation** of core values that underpin Canadian society:

- **Supremacy of God**: Acknowledges the spiritual foundation of the Canadian nation.
- **Dignity and Worth of the Human Person**: Emphasizes the inherent value of every individual.
- **Position of the Family**: Recognizes the family as a cornerstone of a free and just society.
- **Freedom Rooted in Moral and Spiritual Values and the Rule of Law**: Asserts that true freedom is only possible when it is grounded in ethical principles and legal accountability.

These affirmations reflect a **moral vision** of society, emphasizing that freedom cannot exist without respect for human dignity, justice, and the rule of law.

> **Note**: While these principles are deeply rooted in Canadian identity, they are not legally binding in the same way as constitutional rights. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) later replaced the Bill of Rights as the primary source of fundamental rights in Canada.

### 🔹 **2. Enactment and Legal Framework**

- The Act was passed by **Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada**.
- It is formally enacted as a **Bill of Rights**, intended to **enshrine fundamental human rights and freedoms** in Canadian law.
- The Act is designed to:
  - Reflect **Parliament’s constitutional authority**.
  - Ensure **protection of rights and freedoms** in practice.
  - Provide a **legal safeguard** against arbitrary government actions.

### 🔹 **3. Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms**

The Act declares the following rights and freedoms as existing in Canada **without discrimination** based on:

- Race  
- National origin  
- Colour  
- Religion  
- Sex  

These rights are **universal and non-discriminatory** and include:

| Right/Freedom | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Right to Life, Liberty, Security of Person, and Property** | Every individual has the right to life, liberty, and security of the person. Property rights are protected, and deprivation of these can only occur through due process of law. |
| **Equality Before the Law and Protection of the Law** | All persons are equal before the law and entitled to legal protection. |
| **Freedom of Religion** | Individuals have the right to practice their religion freely. |
| **Freedom of Speech** | Protection of expression, including opinions and ideas. |
| **Freedom of Assembly and Association** | The right to gather peacefully and to join organizations (e.g., unions, political parties). |
| **Freedom of the Press** | The press is free to publish information and report on matters of public interest. |

> These rights are **not absolute** — they are subject to reasonable limits and can be restricted under certain conditions (e.g., public safety, national security), but such restrictions must be **justified and proportionate**.

### 🔹 **4. Prohibition of Infringement by Law**

A central provision of the Act is that **all laws of Canada must be interpreted and applied in a way that does not infringe upon the rights and freedoms listed**.

#### Key Prohibitions:
No law may be construed or applied to:
- **Arbitrary detention, imprisonment, or exile** of any person.
- **Cruel or unusual treatment or punishment**.
- **Failure to inform a person promptly of the reason for arrest or detention**.
- **Denial of the right to retain and instruct legal counsel without delay**.
- **Denial of the right to a habeas corpus hearing** (a legal remedy to challenge the legality of detention).
- **Forcing a person to give evidence without counsel, protection against self-incrimination, or other constitutional safeguards**.
- **Denying a person a fair hearing** in accordance with the principles of **fundamental justice**.
- **Denying the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty** in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.
- **Denying the right to reasonable bail without just cause**.
- **Denying the right to an interpreter** in legal proceedings if the person does not understand or speak the language used in the proceedings.

> These provisions are designed to **protect individuals from abuse of power** by government institutions, especially in criminal justice contexts.

### 🔹 **5. Review Mechanism for Government Legislation**

To ensure that laws and regulations do not violate the rights protected in the Bill of Rights, the **Minister of Justice** is mandated to:

- **Examine all regulations** transmitted to the Clerk of the Privy Council for registration under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.
- **Examine all Bills introduced by Ministers of the Crown** in the House of Commons.
- Determine whether any provisions are **inconsistent with the purposes and provisions** of this Part (i.e., the Bill of Rights).
- **Report any such inconsistencies** to the House of Commons at the first convenient opportunity.

> This creates a **formal review process** to prevent legislative overreach.

#### Exception:
If a regulation was previously examined as a **proposed regulation** under **Section 3 of the Statutory Instruments Act** (to ensure compliance with the Bill of Rights), it **does not need to be re-examined** under this section.

---

### 🔹 **6. Scope and Limitations of the Bill of Rights**

#### (a) **Name of the Part**
The provisions of this Part are known as the **Canadian Bill of Rights**.

#### (b) **No Abrogation of Pre-existing Rights**
> *"Nothing in Part I shall be construed to abrogate or abridge any human right or fundamental freedom not enumerated therein that may have existed in Canada at the commencement of this Act."*

- This means that **rights not listed in the Bill of Rights** (such as those derived from common law, Indigenous rights, or other historical protections) **remain valid**.
- The Bill of Rights does **not erase or replace** pre-existing rights — it only enshrines specific ones.

#### (c) **Definition of "Law of Canada"**
The term **"law of Canada"** includes:
- Acts of Parliament passed before or after the Act’s coming into force.
- Orders, rules, or regulations made under those Acts.
- Any law in force in Canada or any part of Canada at the time the Act came into effect that is subject to repeal, abolition, or alteration by Parliament.

#### (d) **Scope of Application**
> *"The provisions of Part I shall be construed as extending only to matters coming within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada."*

- The Bill of Rights applies **only to federal laws**.
- It **does not apply to provincial or municipal laws**.
- This limits its reach and power compared to the **Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, which applies to both federal and provincial jurisdictions.
