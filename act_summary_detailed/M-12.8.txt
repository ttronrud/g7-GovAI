### **Detailed Summary of the *Multilateral Instrument in Respect of Tax Conventions Act***  
*(Act No. C-82)*

---

## **Overview**

The **Multilateral Instrument in Respect of Tax Conventions Act** (the "Act") is a key piece of Canadian legislation that implements the **Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty-Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)** — commonly referred to as the **OECD/G20 BEPS Multilateral Instrument (MLI)** — into Canadian law.

This Act establishes the legal framework through which Canada incorporates and enforces the MLI, a multilateral treaty designed to combat aggressive international tax planning that shifts profits to low- or no-tax jurisdictions. The Act ensures that profits are taxed where economic activity occurs and value is created, preventing tax avoidance and "treaty shopping" — a practice where companies exploit tax treaties to reduce or eliminate their tax liabilities.

## **Key Definitions and Core Concepts**

### 1. **Multilateral Instrument (MLI)**
- Refers to the **Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty-Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting**, as set out in the **Schedule** of the Act.
- This instrument is a binding international agreement adopted by over 100 countries to harmonize tax treaties and address issues related to **base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)**.

### 2. **Force of Law in Canada**
- The MLI is **approved and has the force of law in Canada** during the period it is in force for Canada.
- This means that Canadian tax authorities must apply the MLI’s provisions as if they were domestic law, unless overridden by other provisions.

### 3. **Hierarchy of Legal Provisions**
- **Precedence Rule**: In cases of inconsistency:
  - The **provisions of this Act and the MLI prevail** over any conflicting domestic law.
  - However, **if there is inconsistency between the MLI and the Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act (ITCIA)**, the **ITCIA prevails** to the extent of the inconsistency.
- This establishes a clear hierarchy to ensure consistency with existing tax treaty interpretation rules.

### 4. **Regulatory Authority**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** may make **regulations** necessary to:
  - Implement the MLI.
  - Give effect to its provisions.
- These regulations may include administrative, procedural, or interpretative measures to ensure practical enforcement.

### 5. **Public Notification Requirements**
- The **Minister of Finance** must publish in the *Canada Gazette*:
  - **Within 60 days** of the MLI entering into force for Canada: a notice stating the date of entry into force.
  - **Within 60 days** of Canada withdrawing from the MLI: a notice of withdrawal and the effective date.
- *Note*: The MLI entered into force for Canada on **December 1, 2019** (as published in Canada Gazette Part I, Vol. 154, p. 124).

## **Purpose and Background of the MLI**

The MLI was developed under the **OECD/G20 BEPS project**, which identified several critical tax avoidance practices, including:

- **Hybrid mismatches** (e.g., artificial tax treatments that allow profits to be shifted between jurisdictions).
- **Treaty abuse** (e.g., using tax treaties to avoid taxation in high-tax jurisdictions).
- **Artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status**.
- **Lack of effective dispute resolution mechanisms**.

The MLI addresses these issues by:
- Ensuring that **profits are taxed where economic activity occurs**.
- Preventing **double taxation** while eliminating opportunities for **non-taxation or reduced taxation** through tax avoidance.
- Providing a **coordinated, multilateral mechanism** to apply treaty changes without requiring bilateral renegotiations.

## **Core Provisions of the MLI in Canada**

### **1. Definition of "Covered Tax Agreement"**
A Covered Tax Agreement is:
- An agreement for the avoidance of double taxation on income (whether or not other taxes are covered).
- In force between **two or more Parties** (States or jurisdictions).
- Where each Party has **notified the Depositary** (a neutral administrative body) of the agreement, including:
  - Title
  - Names of the Parties
  - Date of signature
  - Date of entry into force (if applicable)

> *Note:* The MLI applies to all such existing tax treaties that meet these criteria.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Party** | A State or jurisdiction for which the MLI is in force under Article 34, or a jurisdiction that has signed the MLI but is not yet in force. |
| **Contracting Jurisdiction** | A Party to a Covered Tax Agreement. |
| **Signatory** | A State or jurisdiction that has signed the MLI but the MLI is not yet in force for it. |

> All terms not defined in the MLI are interpreted according to their meaning under the relevant Covered Tax Agreement.

---

### **3. Fiscally Transparent Entities (Paragraph 1)**

- **Fiscally transparent entities** (e.g., partnerships, trusts) are treated as if their income is that of a resident of a jurisdiction where they are taxed.
- **Rule**: Income derived by or through such entities is considered income of a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction **only to the extent** it is treated as such for tax purposes in that jurisdiction.
- **Prohibition**: Provisions in tax treaties that exempt income from tax or provide deductions/credits solely because the income is also derived by a resident of another jurisdiction **shall not apply**.

> This prevents tax treaties from being used to shift profits to jurisdictions with no real economic activity.

#### **Reservations**
A Party may reserve the right to:
- Not apply this paragraph to certain Covered Tax Agreements.
- Exclude agreements that already contain similar provisions.
- Exclude agreements that deny treaty benefits for income derived through third jurisdictions.
- Exclude agreements that specify detailed treatment of specific entities or arrangements.

> If all Contracting Jurisdictions make such notifications, the MLI provisions will **replace** the conflicting treaty rules.

---

### **4. Determining Residence of Non-Individuals (Paragraph 2)**

- When a person (e.g., a corporation) is a resident of **more than one Contracting Jurisdiction**, the competent authorities must **mutually agree** on which jurisdiction has the right to tax the individual.
- Factors to consider:
  - Place of effective management
  - Place of incorporation
  - Other relevant factors

> **In the absence of agreement**, the person is **not entitled to any treaty relief or exemption** from tax.

#### **Exclusion**
- This rule **does not apply** to provisions in treaties specifically addressing **dual-listed company arrangements** (e.g., companies listed on multiple stock exchanges).

#### **Reservations**
A Party may reserve the right to:
- Not apply the rule requiring mutual agreement.
- Deny treaty benefits without requiring mutual agreement.
- Set out a default treatment if no agreement is reached.
- Exclude treaties with Parties that have made specific reservations.

> If all Parties notify the Depositary of relevant provisions, the MLI rule replaces the treaty provision. Otherwise, only incompatible provisions are superseded.

### **5. Tax Relief and Deductions (Paragraphs 3–6)**

#### **Paragraph 3 (Tax Deduction on Income)**
- If income derived by a resident of one Contracting Jurisdiction may be taxed in another, the first jurisdiction **must allow a deduction** from its tax:
  - Equal to the **income tax paid** in the other jurisdiction.
- This deduction **cannot exceed** the portion of the tax attributable to income that may be taxed in the other jurisdiction.

#### **Paragraph 4 (Tax Deduction on Capital)**
- Similarly, if capital owned by a resident may be taxed in another jurisdiction, the first jurisdiction allows a **capital tax deduction** equal to the tax paid in the other jurisdiction.
- Again, the deduction is limited to the portion attributable to capital subject to taxation elsewhere.

> This ensures that **double taxation is avoided**, while preventing tax avoidance through treaty shopping.

#### **Paragraph 5 (Dividend Rule)**
- If income is treated as a **dividend** in one jurisdiction and gives rise to a **tax deduction** in the other, the first jurisdiction must allow a deduction equal to the tax paid in the other jurisdiction.
- The deduction is limited to the portion attributable to income that may be taxed in the other jurisdiction.

> This prevents tax treaties from being used to avoid corporate tax through dividend structures.

#### **Paragraph 6 (Replacement of Treaty Provisions)**
- Where a treaty would otherwise exempt income or capital from tax in one jurisdiction (to eliminate double taxation), the MLI **replaces that exemption**.
- Instead, the jurisdiction **allows a deduction** for the tax paid in the other jurisdiction.
- This ensures that **tax is not avoided**, even if the treaty previously allowed exemption.

> The MLI applies **in place of or in the absence of** such treaty provisions.

### **6. Option System (Paragraphs 7–9)**

A Party may choose to apply **one of three options** (A, B, or C), or **none**:

| Option | Applies To | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Option A** | Provisions in treaties that allow tax exemption due to "fiscal transparency" (paragraph 3) | Ensures income from transparent entities is taxed where economic activity occurs |
| **Option B** | Provisions in treaties that allow tax exemption due to "residence of non
