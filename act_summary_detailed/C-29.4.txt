### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Establishment of the Department**
- The Act establishes the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration** as a distinct department of the Government of Canada.
- This department is created to provide a centralized, coherent administrative body responsible for all aspects of citizenship and immigration policy and administration.

#### **2. Appointment of the Minister**
- The **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** is appointed by commission under the Great Seal of Canada.
- The Minister holds office at the **pleasure of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet), meaning they can be removed or replaced at any time by the government.

- The Governor in Council may appoint a **Deputy Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**.
- The Deputy Minister serves at the pleasure of the Governor in Council and acts as the **deputy head** of the Department, supporting the Minister in day-to-day operations and administrative leadership.

- The Minister has **broad powers and duties** covering all matters relating to **citizenship and immigration** that fall within the jurisdiction of Parliament.
- These powers include matters not otherwise assigned to another department, board, or agency of the Government of Canada.
- This ensures that the Department of Citizenship and Immigration has **exclusive responsibility** for core immigration and citizenship functions.

#### **5. Agreements with Provinces and International Entities**
- The Minister (with **Governor in Council approval**) may enter into **agreements** with:
  - Any province or group of provinces
  - Any foreign government or international organization
- Purpose of these agreements:
  - To **formulate, coordinate, and implement** policies and programs
  - To facilitate the **collection, use, and disclosure of information**
- These agreements are designed to enhance collaboration, especially in areas requiring shared data or joint policy development.

> **Note**: The use of "agreement" (requiring Cabinet approval) vs. "arrangement" (without Cabinet approval) reflects a hierarchy of authority and oversight.

#### **6. Agreements with Foreign Governments on Biometric and Immigration Services**
- The Minister may enter into **agreements with foreign governments** to:
  - Provide services related to the **collection, use, and disclosure of biometric information**
  - Provide **immigration application services** and other related services
- These services are provided **on behalf of the foreign government** for the purpose of administering and enforcing their own immigration laws.
- This provision enables Canada to **collaborate internationally** in areas such as visa processing, biometric data sharing, and applicant services — particularly in bilateral or multilateral immigration frameworks.

#### **7. Use of Service Revenue to Offset Expenditures**
- The Minister may use **revenue received** from services provided under an agreement or arrangement:
  - In the **fiscal year in which the service is received**, or
  - In the **following fiscal year**
- This revenue can be used to **offset** the costs incurred by the Department in providing those services.
- This provision allows for **financial efficiency and cost recovery**, helping to manage budgetary impacts of international service delivery.

#### **8. Service Provision to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**
- The Department of Citizenship and Immigration may **provide services to the Canada Border Services Agency**.
- This reflects the integration of citizenship and immigration functions with border enforcement, enabling coordination between immigration policy and border management.

#### **9. Continuity of Public Service Employees**
- The Act includes a **provision for employee continuity**.
- Employees who were working in the following positions **immediately before the Act came into force**:

  - In any portion of the public service described in **paragraph (b) of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1901** (November 4, 1993)
- These employees **retain their positions** and are transferred to the **new Department of Citizenship and Immigration**.
- However, they will now serve under the **deputy head** of the new Department (i.e., the Deputy Minister).
- This ensures **minimal disruption** in staffing and institutional knowledge during the transition.

> *Definition*: "Employee" is defined in the same way as in subsection 2(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act*, ensuring consistency with public service employment standards.

#### **10. Appropriation of Funds**
- Any amount **appropriated in the fiscal year when the Act comes into force** for the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada (specifically for public service expenses) that remains **unexpended** on the date the Act takes effect is **automatically deemed appropriated** for the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration**.
- This provision ensures **financial continuity** and avoids a funding gap during the transition from the old department to the new one.
