The Act is officially titled the **Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929** and may be cited as such. It was enacted by His Majesty the King, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada, establishing a comprehensive framework for the development of railway infrastructure in and around Montreal, Quebec.

---

#### **2. Scope and Purpose of the Act**
The primary objective of the Act is to authorize the **Canadian National Railway Company (CN)** to construct, expand, and manage a large-scale network of terminal facilities, tracks, stations, and related infrastructure in and adjacent to the **Island of Montreal** and the **mainland adjacent to it**.

This includes:
- Terminal stations and offices
- Local stations and station grounds
- Yards, tracks, and rail lines
- Power houses, conduits, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and subways
- Buildings and structures for handling all types of traffic (passengers, freight, mail, express)

- Approaches, lanes, alleyways, and other access routes

All these developments are collectively referred to as the **“said works”**.

#### **3. Authority to Acquire Land**
The Company is granted the **right to acquire or take land** (including interests in land) for the said works through:
- The provisions of **Section 9 of this Act** (expropriation powers)
- Or by other legal means

This authority applies to land on the **Island of Montreal** and the **mainland adjacent to it**, as shown in plans approved by the Governor in Council.

#### **4. Financing Mechanism: Issuance of Securities**
To fund the construction of the said works, the Company may issue **securities** (such as notes, bonds, or obligations). These securities are intended to finance:
- Construction
- Completion
- Ongoing operations related to the said works

##### Key Provisions:
- The **Governor in Council** may authorize a **guarantee** of the principal and interest of such securities up to a maximum of **$50 million (CAD)**.

- The Governor in Council has broad discretion to determine:
  - The **type and form** of securities issued
  - The **terms and conditions** of issuance
  - The **timing and amount** of issuance
  - The **sale, pledge, or disposal** of securities
  - Whether to secure the securities via **mortgage, deed of trust**, or other instruments
  - The **trustee(s)** responsible for managing the securities

##### Guarantee and Legal Effect:
- The guarantee may be signed by the **Minister of Finance** or any other person designated by the Governor in Council.
- Such signature is **conclusive evidence** of the validity of the guarantee and compliance with the Act.

---

#### **5. Competitive Bidding and Negotiation**
The Company is required to follow **competitive bidding procedures** in two key areas:
1. **Construction and completion** of works not carried out by the Company’s own workforce.
2. **Sale of securities**

However:
- The Company is **not bound** to accept the highest or lowest bid.
- It is **free to negotiate** for better prices or terms.
- This rule applies **except** in cases of **temporary financing**, which may be approved by the Governor in Council and does not require competitive bidding.

> This provision ensures flexibility while maintaining transparency and accountability.

---

#### **6. Use of Proceeds from Securities and Land Sales**
All proceeds from:
- Sales of securities
- Pledges of securities
- Sales of lands acquired or taken under expropriation (not abandoned or required for other purposes)
- Contributions toward the cost of the works

...must be **deposited into a trust fund** held in a bank, credited to the **Minister of Finance**, and released **at the Minister’s discretion** to the Company for use in:
- Meeting expenditures
- Paying off debts incurred in connection with the said works

> **Important:** The cost of financing (including interest and discounts) is **deemed part of the total cost of the works** and must be accounted for.

---

#### **7. Use of Existing and Acquired Property**
The said works may be constructed on:
- Property currently owned by the Company
- Property acquired or taken by the Company
- Property of other companies within the **Canadian National Railways system**, including:
  - Canadian Northern Railway Company
  - Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Company
  - Canadian Northern Quebec Railway Company
  - Mount Royal Tunnel and Terminal Company, Limited
  - Canadian National Realties, Limited

Additionally, with **Governor in Council approval** (evidenced by plan approval under Section 7), the works may use property owned or taken by the **Dominion of Canada** (i.e., Crown property).

> This provision allows for consolidation and integration of existing rail assets across the CN network.

---

#### **8. Approval of Plans and Design**
- The **general plan** (or plans) of the said works, and any amendments or additions, must be submitted to and **approved by the Governor in Council**.
- **Detail plans** affecting:
  - Canals or property under the control of the **Department of Railways and Canals** → must be approved by the **Minister of Railways and Canals**
  - Property of the **Harbour Commissioners of Montreal** → must be approved by the **Minister of Marine and Fisheries**

> This ensures inter-agency coordination and oversight of infrastructure that affects public utilities and transportation corridors.

---

#### **9. Street and Highway Agreements**
Where the said works affect streets or highways:
- And where the **Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada** has **no jurisdiction** (because the tracks do not cross or divert the street)
- The Company may, with **Governor in Council approval**, enter into agreements with:
  - The **City of Montreal**
  - Any other municipality

Agreements may cover:
- Opening or closing of streets
- Making diversions or widenings
- Constructing substreets, subways, or overhead facilities
- Apportioning the cost of such modifications

> This allows the Company to collaborate with municipal authorities on urban infrastructure without needing full regulatory authority.

---

#### **10. Expropriation and Land Transfer**
- Certain expropriation plans previously filed under the **Expropriation Act** for Government Railways have already resulted in land being vested in the Crown (His Majesty).
- New expropriation plans showing lands required or taken for the said works may be submitted by the **Minister of Railways and Canals** under the Expropriation Act.
- Compensation for such takings may be paid **from the trust fund** established under Section 6.
- Upon payment, the land or interest taken is **transferred to the Company** upon request.

> This streamlines land acquisition and ensures financial accountability.

---

#### **11. Aerial Rights and Leasing**
The Company may:
- Lease or enter into agreements for **aerial rights** (rights to build structures above or over railway tracks or facilities)
- Lease or contract for use of **areas above or below track level** where viaducts or overhead tracks are constructed

This enables the development of overpasses, skybridges, or other structures without requiring full ownership of land.

---

#### **12. Reporting Requirements**
To ensure transparency and accountability:
- The **Minister of Railways and Canals** must present to **Parliament** within the **first 30 days of each session** (before completion of the works) a detailed report covering:
  - Nature and extent of work completed in the previous calendar year
  - Expenditures incurred
  - Estimated expenditures for the current year
  - Any additional information deemed relevant

> This reporting requirement strengthens parliamentary oversight.

---

#### **13. Accounting and Financial Oversight**
- The Company must maintain **separate, detailed accounts** of:
  - All credits to the trust fund
  - All expenditures related to the said works

This enables the Minister of Railways and Canals to verify compliance with the Act and ensure that funds are used appropriately.
