**Detailed Summary of the *Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act* establishes the **Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)** as a federal corporation in Canada, tasked with promoting and supporting research and scholarship in the social sciences and humanities. The Act defines the structure, governance, functions, financial operations, and reporting obligations of the Council, ensuring it operates independently while remaining accountable to the Government of Canada.

This legislation was originally enacted to strengthen Canada’s capacity for high-quality research in the social sciences and humanities—fields critical to understanding Canadian society, culture, and policy. The Act has undergone amendments over time, including a notable repeal of certain provisions in 2012 (specifically section 178), which is noted in the final clause.
