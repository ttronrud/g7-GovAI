## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Cooperatives Act**

### **1. Purpose and Legislative Background**
The *Canada Cooperatives Act* (CCA) was enacted to:
- **Modernize and unify** the legal framework governing cooperatives across Canada.
- Establish a **clear, consistent, and democratic** legal regime that reflects internationally recognized cooperative principles.
- Provide a **distinct legal identity** for cooperatives separate from traditional corporate or non-profit entities.

This Act replaces the outdated *Canada Cooperative Associations Act* (prior legislation), which was last amended in 1970–72. The new Act aims to support the **social and economic development of communities** through cooperative enterprise by enabling democratic participation, equitable ownership, and community-focused business models.

| **Shareholder** | A person who owns an **investment share** (a share not tied to membership). |
| **Membership Share** | A share in a cooperative that reflects ownership in the cooperative’s membership structure (e.g., voting rights). |
