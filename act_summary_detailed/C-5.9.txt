This Act ensures that:
- Income and capital gains earned by individuals and businesses in one country are not taxed twice in both Canada and Greece.

- The Convention is properly implemented and interpreted in Canadian law.

## 🏠 **Residency Rules (Determining Tax Status)**

### 7. **Residency Determination for Individuals**
An individual is deemed a resident of only **one** of the two countries based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home**:
   - If the individual has a permanent home in one country → resident only in that country.
   - If permanent home in both → resident in the country where **personal and economic relations are closer** ("centre of vital interests").

2. **If centre of vital interests cannot be determined**:
   - Resident in the country where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **If habitual abode in both or neither**:
   - Resident in the country of **nationality**.

4. **If individual is a national of both or neither**:
   - The **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

> 🔍 *This rule prevents double taxation by clearly defining where a person is "taxable" based on personal ties.*

---

### 8. **Residency Determination for Companies**
- A company is deemed a resident only in:
  - The country of its **nationality**; or
  - The country where its **place of effective management** is located (if not a national of either country).

> 📌 *This ensures companies are taxed in the country where they are truly operating or managed.*

---

### 9. **Other Persons (Non-Individuals, Non-Companies)**
- If such a person is a resident of both countries:
  - The competent authorities must **resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.
  - In the absence of agreement, **no tax relief or exemption under the Convention applies**.

> ⚠️ *This protects against ambiguity in tax treatment for complex entities.*

## 🏢 **Permanent Establishment (PE) – Key Concept**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

### 10. **What Constitutes a Permanent Establishment?**
Includes:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any site for exploration/exploitation of natural resources

> ✅ **A building site or construction project** counts as a PE **only if it lasts more than 9 months**.

### 11. **Services as a PE**
- The furnishing of **technical assistance or consultancy services** via employees or personnel:
  - Counts as a PE **if activities total or exceed 183 days in any 12-month period**.

> 🔍 *This prevents companies from avoiding tax through short-term or temporary service contracts.*

---

### 12. **Exclusions from Permanent Establishment**
The following **do not** constitute a PE:
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of **stock** for storage, display, or delivery.
- Maintenance of stock **for processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place for **purchasing goods or collecting information**.
- Fixed place for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**.
- Any combination of the above if the overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary.

> 🚫 *These exclusions prevent tax avoidance through minor or non-core business activities.*

---

### 13. **Special Rule for Agents (Independent Status)**
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE simply because it uses a **broker, general agent, or independent agent**.
- **Exception**: If the agent has **authority to conclude contracts** on behalf of the enterprise, then the enterprise is deemed to have a PE in that country **unless** the activities are limited to those excluded in paragraph 12.

> 📝 *This protects legitimate business relationships between independent agents and clients.*

---

### 14. **Special Rule for Natural Resource Activities**
- A resident of one country carrying out **preliminary surveys, exploration, extraction, or exploitation** of natural resources in the other country:
  - Is deemed to be carrying on a business **through a PE or fixed base** in that country.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: If activities last **120 days or less** in any 12-month period → no PE is created.

> 📌 *Note: Activities related to an "associated enterprise" (see Article 9) are treated as if carried out by the related enterprise.*

---

### 15. **Insurance Enterprises**
- An insurance company in one country is deemed to have a PE in the other country **if it collects premiums or insures risks** on the territory of the other country.
- **Exception**: This rule **does not apply to reinsurance**.
