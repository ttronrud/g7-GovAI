**Detailed Summary of the *Sports Pool and Loto Canada Winding-Up Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Sports Pool and Loto Canada Winding-Up Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. This Act formally dissolves two key Canadian Crown-owned corporations — the **Canadian Sports Pool Corporation** and **Loto Canada Inc.** — and transfers all their rights, obligations, and assets to the Crown (Her Majesty). It also provides procedural mechanisms for the orderly winding up of their affairs and ensures continuity in legal proceedings.

This Act serves as a formal closure mechanism, effectively ending the corporate existence of both entities and transferring their legal and financial responsibilities to the federal government.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. Citation of the Act**
- The Act is officially titled:  
  **"The Sports Pool and Loto Canada Winding-Up Act"**  
  This name reflects its purpose: to manage the winding-up (dissolution and closure) of the operations of two major lottery and pool-related corporations.

---

#### **2. Definitions**
The Act establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **"Corporation"**  
  Refers specifically to the **Canadian Sports Pool Corporation**, established under Section 3 of the *Athletic Contests and Events Pools Act*.  
  → This entity was responsible for managing sports pools (e.g., betting on athletic events) in Canada.

- **"Her Majesty"**  
  Refers to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, representing the federal Crown.  
  → This is the legal entity that will assume ownership and liability after the dissolution.

- **"Minister"**  
  Refers to the **Minister of Health**.  
  → This minister is granted broad authority to manage the closure process.

> *Note: The Minister of Health is assigned this role, likely due to historical oversight of gambling and public health-related activities in Canada, though this may reflect a legacy or transitional arrangement.*

---

#### **3. Cessation of the Corporation**
- **The Corporation hereby ceases to exist.**  
  → The Canadian Sports Pool Corporation is formally dissolved and no longer operates as a legal entity.

---

#### **4. Transfer of Rights, Property, Obligations, and Liabilities**
- All rights, property, obligations, and liabilities previously held by or in trust for the Corporation are **deemed to belong to Her Majesty**.  
  → This means that any financial assets, contracts, debts, intellectual property, and legal claims associated with the Corporation are now the property of the federal government.

> *This transfer ensures that the Crown assumes full responsibility for all outstanding obligations and claims, allowing for a clean administrative handover.*

---

#### **5. Authority of the Minister**
- The **Minister of Health** is empowered to:
  - Do and perform **all acts and things necessary** for or incidental to:
    - Closing out the affairs of the Corporation.
    - Managing the winding-up process (including asset realization, debt settlement, and final reporting).
  
> *This grants the Minister broad discretion to manage the dissolution process, including making decisions about asset sales, settling debts, and fulfilling contractual obligations.*

---

#### **6. Repeal of the *Athletic Contests and Events Pools Act***
- The *Athletic Contests and Events Pools Act* is **repealed** (officially abolished).  
  → This removes the legal framework that previously governed the Canadian Sports Pool Corporation.

> *This is a significant step, as it signals the end of the legal basis for sports pool operations in Canada. The Act was likely outdated or redundant given the transition to Loto Canada as the dominant lottery operator.*

---

#### **7. Transfer of Loto Canada Inc. Assets and Liabilities**
- All rights, property, obligations, and liabilities of **Loto Canada Inc.** are also **deemed to belong to Her Majesty**.  
  → This includes all assets (e.g., brand, infrastructure, technology), customer data, revenue streams, and outstanding debts or liabilities.

> *This ensures that Loto Canada, too, is fully integrated into the Crown’s portfolio, with no residual corporate existence.*

---

#### **8. Minister’s Authority Over Loto Canada Inc.**
- The Minister is also empowered to:
  - Do and perform **all acts and things necessary** for or incidental to:
    - Procuring the **dissolution** of Loto Canada Inc.
    - Closing out its affairs.

> *This gives the Minister full authority over the final phase of Loto Canada’s operations — including winding down operations, settling debts, and distributing assets.*

---

#### **9. Legal Proceedings Against the Crown**
- Any **action, suit, or legal proceeding** arising from:
  - Obligations or liabilities incurred by the Corporation or Loto Canada Inc., or
  - Actions taken by the Minister in closing out their affairs,
  may be brought **against Her Majesty** in any court that would have had jurisdiction had the case been brought against the original corporations.

> *This provision ensures that creditors, claimants, or litigants can pursue legal remedies against the Crown, which now bears all liabilities. It maintains legal continuity and provides certainty for parties involved in existing disputes.*

---

#### **10. Continuation of Pending Legal Proceedings**
- Any **pending legal action or proceeding** against the Corporation or Loto Canada Inc. may be **continued against Her Majesty** to the **same extent** as it could have been continued against the original entities, **but for the coming into force of this Act**.

> *This is a critical provision for legal certainty. It prevents the automatic dismissal of ongoing lawsuits due to the dissolution of the corporations. Instead, the lawsuits are transferred to the Crown, preserving the rights of plaintiffs and ensuring that justice is not disrupted.*

### **Purpose and Implications**

This Act serves several key purposes:

1. **Corporate Dissolution**  
   Formally ends the legal existence of two government-owned corporations that were once central to Canada’s sports betting and lottery operations.

2. **Transfer of Assets and Liabilities to the Crown**  
   Ensures that all property, rights, and obligations are consolidated under Her Majesty, enabling the federal government to manage them directly.

3. **Legal Continuity**  
   Maintains the ability of courts and claimants to pursue legal remedies against the Crown, preventing the collapse of existing litigation.

4. **Administrative Closure**  
   Grants the Minister of Health full authority to manage the winding-up process efficiently and transparently.

5. **Repeal of Outdated Legislation**  
   Removes the *Athletic Contests and Events Pools Act*, signaling the end of an older system of sports pool regulation, likely in favor of a more centralized and modernized lottery system under Loto Canada.

---

### **Historical and Policy Context**

- The *Canadian Sports Pool Corporation* was established in the mid-20th century to manage public pools (e.g., betting on sports events) and was eventually phased out as public interest shifted toward regulated lotteries.
- Loto Canada, established in 1976, became the dominant state-run lottery operator in Canada.
- This Act likely reflects a **transition or consolidation** of functions — where sports pools were either discontinued or absorbed into Loto Canada’s operations.
- The dissolution of both entities may have been driven by:
  - Declining interest in sports pools.
  - A desire to centralize lottery operations under one entity.
  - Regulatory modernization and cost-efficiency.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Sports Pool and Loto Canada Winding-Up Act* is a comprehensive and legally sound instrument that:

- Officially dissolves the Canadian Sports Pool Corporation and Loto Canada Inc.
- Transfers all rights, assets, and liabilities to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- Grants the Minister of Health broad authority to manage the closure process.
- Ensures legal continuity by allowing ongoing litigation to proceed against the Crown.
- Repeals outdated legislation, marking the end of an era in Canadian sports betting and lottery governance.

This Act represents a final administrative step in the evolution of Canada’s public gaming sector, transitioning from a fragmented, multi-entity model to a centralized, Crown-managed system under Loto Canada.

**Final Note**: While the Act appears to be a technical winding-up measure, it carries significant implications for public accountability, financial responsibility, and legal rights — all of which are now vested in the federal government.
