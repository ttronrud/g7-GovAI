**Detailed Summary of the *Boards of Trade Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Boards of Trade Act* is a foundational piece of legislation in Canada that establishes the legal framework for the formation, governance, and operation of **boards of trade** and **chambers of commerce** at the provincial level. The Act provides a structured process for incorporating such organizations, defines their powers and responsibilities, regulates the use of names associated with trade bodies, and establishes mechanisms for dispute resolution and oversight—particularly in relation to grain weighing and commercial arbitration.

It is designed to promote local economic development by enabling merchant and business communities to organize themselves into formal bodies that support trade, commerce, and industry through advocacy, regulation, and dispute settlement.
