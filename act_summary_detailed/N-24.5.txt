## **Core Provisions and Legal Framework**

### **1. Authority for Disposal of Territorial Lands**
- The **Minister of Northern Affairs** may, by order approved by the **Governor in Council**, dispose of **territorial lands** currently under the control, management, or administration of the Minister to the **Yukon Power Corporation**.
- This disposal is subject to specific conditions:
  - The lands must be under the Minister’s control.
  - The disposal may include **sales, leases, or granting of licenses/easements**.
- **Exemption from Applicable Laws**: 
  - Sections 4, 7, 9, and 10 of the *Territorial Lands Act* and the *Territorial Lands Regulations* **do not apply** to lands disposed of under this provision.
  - This ensures streamlined administrative handling without being bound by standard land-use or disposal procedures.

> **Purpose**: To remove regulatory and procedural barriers that might delay or complicate the transfer of land to the Corporation.

### **2. Commission’s Authority to Dispose of Assets**
- The Minister may also issue an order directing the **Commission** to dispose of:
  - Territorial lands under its control,
  - Any other assets in the Yukon Territory.
- The Commission is **authorized and required to comply** with such orders.
- **Exemption from Financial Administration Rules**:
  - Subsections 108(2) to (5) of the *Financial Administration Act* (which normally govern procurement, valuation, and disclosure requirements) **do not apply** to these asset dispositions.
- This allows for faster, more flexible decision-making without strict financial reporting or procurement rules.

> **Purpose**: To enable swift and efficient transfer of assets from the Commission to the Corporation, especially in a complex or time-sensitive infrastructure context.

### **3. Exemption from Water Use Fees (Yukon Waters Act)**
- Despite the *Yukon Waters Act*, which normally requires fees for using water or disposing of waste via a license, the **Minister may, with Governor in Council approval**, issue an order **exempting the Corporation** from these fees.
- This exemption is critical for enabling the Corporation to operate without initial financial burden related to water rights.

> **Purpose**: To facilitate the Corporation’s operational launch in the Yukon without being burdened by licensing costs.

- The **regulations under subsection 18(1) of the Financial Administration Act** (which govern debt and obligation reporting) **do not apply** to any debt, obligation, or claim written off under Sections 6 or 7.
