**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* (CFSAA) is a key piece of federal legislation governing the superannuation (pension) system for members of the **Canadian Forces**, including both the **regular force** and the **reserve force**. It establishes the structure, contribution obligations, eligibility for pensions, and the treatment of service periods for members and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

This Act replaced the older *Defence Services Pension Act* (the "former Act") and introduced a modernized, equitable, and transparent pension framework. It emphasizes **equality between male and female contributors**, **flexibility in service recognition**, and **integration with broader federal pension systems**.

## **Core Provisions and Structure**

### **1. Continuity of the Former Pension System**

- The **Permanent Services Pension Account** (established under the former *Defence Services Pension Act*) is **continued** under the name **Canadian Forces Superannuation Account**.
- This ensures continuity of benefits for members who served under the old system.

> **Purpose**: To maintain stability and avoid disruption in pension entitlements for long-serving members.

---

### **2. Contribution Obligations (Sections 5–7)**

#### **(a) General Contribution Requirement (Section 5(1))**
- All members of the **regular force** are required to contribute to the **Canadian Forces Pension Fund** (CFPF) from **January 1, 2013**, onward.
- Contributions are made **by reservation from salary** or otherwise, at rates determined by the **Treasury Board** on the **joint recommendation** of:
  - The President of the Treasury Board
  - The Minister of National Defence

> **Rationale**: Ensures consistent, fair, and administratively manageable funding of the pension system.

#### **(b) Exemption for 35 Years of Pensionable Service (Section 5(2))**
- A person with **at least 35 years of pensionable service** (including pensionable and other pensionable service) **is not required to contribute** after January 1, 2013 — **but must contribute** from the **later of**:
  - January 1, 2013
  - The date when they reach 35 years of pensionable service
- This applies **in addition** to any other contributions required under the Act.

> **Purpose**: Recognizes long-serving members and provides a threshold for exemption from ongoing contributions.

#### **(c) Contribution Rate Cap (Section 5(3))**
- Contribution rates **must not exceed** those paid by **Group 1 contributors** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSA).
- This ensures **fairness and comparability** with public service pension contributions.

> **Exception**: No contribution may be made for any portion of an annual rate of pay **in excess of what is fixed or determined by regulations**.

> **Purpose**: Prevents excessive or disproportionate contributions, especially for high-ranking or high-paid members.

> **Purpose**: Provides transitional fairness and protects individuals with prior or alternative pension arrangements.

### **3. Pensionable Service (Section 6)**

Pensionable service is the basis for calculating retirement pensions. It is divided into two types:

---

#### **(a) Non-Elective Service**
- **For members who were contributors under Part V of the former Act before March 1, 1960**:
  - Any period of service they would have been entitled to count for pension/gratuity **if they had retired** — **except** periods for which they **elected to pay**.
- **For all contributors**:
  - Any period during which they were required to contribute to the **Superannuation Account** or **CFPF** (as per sections 5(1) and (1.01) as of December 31, 2012).
  - Any period of service counted under **Section 41** (specific service types).

> **Purpose**: Recognizes service that was automatically counted under the old system and ensures continuity.

---

#### **(b) Elective Service**
This allows contributors to **voluntarily include** certain service periods in their pensionable service — **if they elect** within one year of becoming a contributor.

##### **Eligible Periods Include**:
| Service Type | Conditions |
|------------|-----------|
| **Public Service (full-time)** | Must be full-time, on salary; must elect within one year of becoming a contributor. |
| **Federal Boards/Commissions/Corporations** | Added to Schedule I of the Public Service Superannuation Act after March 1, 1960. Must elect within one year of addition. |
| **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** | Must elect within one year of becoming a contributor. |

| **Full-time service during war (non-Canadian forces)** | Must elect within one year. |
| **Full-time service in permanent forces (non-Canadian)** | Except where already counted under clause (E); must elect within one year. |
| **Periods of training/duty (3 months or more)** | One-fourth of any period where called out for periodic training (not emergencies); must elect within one year. |
| **Service under Section 18 (C-9, 1970)** or Sections 42–48 | Service recognized under prior legislation. |
| **Return of contributions/lump sums** | If the person previously received a return and elects to pay for that service. |
| **Service for which election was missed** | If the person failed to elect under prior laws (e.g., Part V of former Act) but now elects before leaving the force. |
| **Election under subsection 6.1(1)** | Any service for which a formal election is made. |

> **Purpose**: Expands pension eligibility to include diverse service experiences and provides flexibility for individuals with varied career paths.

---

### **4. Election Rights and Flexibility (Section 6(1))**

- A contributor may **elect not to count** a period of service as pensionable **if it exceeds three months**, even if regulations require it.
- This election must be made **at the time and in the manner prescribed by regulations** under paragraph 50.1(1)(b).

> **Purpose**: Offers control over pensionable service counts, allowing individuals to manage their retirement benefits.

---

### **5. Exemption from Contributions (Section 6(2))**

- If a contributor **makes an election** under subsection (1) (i.e., to exclude a period from pensionable service), they are **not required to contribute** to the Superannuation Account or CFPF for that period.
- However, **only if**:
  - The service period ended **before** the subsection came into force.
  -
