### **Detailed Summary of the *Foreign Influence Transparency and Accountability Act***  

The **Foreign Influence Transparency and Accountability Act (FITAA)** is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation introduced to address the growing threat of foreign interference in Canada’s political and governmental processes. It establishes a transparent, accountable, and publicly accessible system to monitor and regulate activities by foreign entities—referred to as "foreign principals"—that seek to influence Canadian politics in non-transparent ways. The Act is designed to protect democratic institutions, national security, and core Canadian values by ensuring openness, accountability, and public awareness of foreign influence.

## **I. Context and Purpose**

### **Background (Whereas Clauses):**
The Act begins with a series of "whereas" clauses that outline the increasing threats posed by foreign states or powers and their proxies (e.g., intelligence agencies, political actors, non-governmental organizations, or private entities) to Canada’s:

- **National security**
- **International relations and foreign policy**
- **Democratic processes** (e.g., elections, policy development, legislative decisions)
- **Sovereignty and core democratic values**

These threats are not limited to one level of government; they can have **systemic effects across federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal levels**, and may disproportionately affect **Indigenous communities**, whose rights are recognized under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*.

There is a growing international consensus—particularly among Canada’s allies—that **foreign influence registries** are essential tools for safeguarding democratic integrity. The Act responds to this global trend by establishing a **public registry of foreign influence activities**.
