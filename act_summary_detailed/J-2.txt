- **Review of Regulations and Bills**:
  - The Minister must examine **every regulation** transmitted to the Clerk of the Privy Council for registration under the **Statutory Instruments Act**, to determine whether any provision is inconsistent with the Charter.
  - If inconsistency is found, the Minister must report it to the **House of Commons at the first convenient opportunity**.
  - **Exception**: A regulation is **not required** to undergo this review if it was previously examined as a **proposed regulation** under **section 3 of the Statutory Instruments Act**, which already ensured Charter compliance.

- **Charter Impact Statements for Bills**:
  - For every Bill introduced in either House of Parliament (by a minister or representative of the Crown), the Minister must cause a **statement to be tabled** in the originating House.
  - This statement must outline the **potential effects of the Bill on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter**.
  - Purpose:
    - To inform Members of Parliament (in both the Senate and House of Commons).
    - To inform the public about how proposed laws may affect fundamental rights (e.g., freedom of expression, equality, privacy).
  - This provision promotes **transparency, accountability, and democratic scrutiny** of legislation.

> **Note**: Section 4.2 (which governs these Charter impact statements) applies **only to Bills introduced on or after the date that Section 73 of the Act comes into force**. This ensures a phased implementation, allowing time for legislative and institutional readiness.

#### **6. Powers and Duties of the Attorney General of Canada**
