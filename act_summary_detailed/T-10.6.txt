### **Detailed Summary of the Thunder Bay Grain Handling Operations Act**

The **Thunder Bay Grain Handling Operations Act** is a Canadian legislative measure enacted on **October 11, 1991**, to resolve a labor dispute in the grain handling industry in **Thunder Bay, Ontario**, following a strike that had disrupted operations. The Act was designed to restore normal grain handling operations, protect the rights of employees and unions, and establish a structured process for resolving ongoing disputes over the terms of a collective agreement.

---

## **1. Purpose and Context**
The primary purpose of the Act is to:
- **Immediately resume grain handling operations** at Thunder Bay, Ontario, after a period of industrial disruption due to a strike.
- **Ensure that employees return to work** without fear of retaliation or disciplinary action.
- **Provide a clear legal framework** for the continuation and modification of the existing collective agreement.
- **Establish a neutral dispute resolution mechanism** (a mediator-arbitrator) to resolve disagreements between the employer and union over the terms of the agreement.

This Act was passed in the aftermath of a significant labor dispute involving the **Transportation – Communications International Union (TCIU)** and several major grain handling employers in Thunder Bay.

---

## **2. Key Definitions**
The Act defines key terms used throughout:
- **Collective Agreement**: Refers specifically to the collective agreement between the employer and the union that **expired on January 31, 1991**.
- **Employee**: A person employed by one of the named employers and bound by the collective agreement.
- **Employer**: Any of the employers listed in the Schedule (e.g., Cargill Limited, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, etc.).
- **Mediator-Arbitrator**: A neutral third party appointed by the Minister to mediate disputes and, if necessary, arbitrate them.
- **Union**: The **Transportation – Communications International Union (TCIU)** and its **Lodge 650**.

---

## **3. Immediate Effect Upon Coming Into Force**
The Act comes into force **on the day immediately after October 11, 1991**, but **not before 12 hours after assent** (i.e., no earlier than October 12, 1991 at 12:00 p.m.).

Upon coming into force:
- **All employers must immediately resume grain handling operations** at Thunder Bay.
- **All employees must immediately resume their duties**, when required by the employer.

> **Note**: This ensures a swift return to normal operations without delay.

---

## **4. Protection Against Retaliation**
To prevent retaliation and ensure compliance with the resumption of work:
- **No employer, officer, or representative** may:
  - Impede an employee from complying with the resumption of duties.
  - Discharge, discipline, or authorize the discharge or discipline of any employee **because** they participated in a strike before the Act came into force.
- **The union and its officers or representatives** must:
  - Give clear notice to employees about the resumption of operations.
  - Take reasonable steps to ensure employees comply with resumption of work.
  - Refrain from any conduct that might discourage employees from returning to work.

> This provision protects both employees and union members from being penalized for past strike actions, reinforcing labor rights and workplace stability.

---

## **5. Extension of the Collective Agreement**
The term of the original collective agreement is **extended** to cover:
- The period from **February 1, 1991**, to a date **to be determined by the mediator-arbitrator**.
- The final date of the extension **shall not be earlier than January 31, 1993**, nor later than **January 31, 1994**.

> This extension ensures that the agreement remains in effect during the critical period of operational recovery and negotiation.

---

## **6. Binding Effect of the Extended Agreement**
- The extended collective agreement is **effective and binding** on all parties (employers and union) for the extended period.
- **Part I of the Canada Labour Code applies** to the agreement as amended, as if the extended period were the original term of the agreement.
- This ensures that the agreement is legally enforceable and consistent with federal labor standards.

---

## **7. Prohibition of Strikes and Lockouts During the Extended Term**
During the extended term of the agreement:
- **No employer** may declare or cause a **lockout** against the union.
- **No union officer or representative** may declare or authorize a **strike** against an employer.
- **No employee** may participate in a strike against an employer.

> This creates a **"no-strike, no-lockout" period**, promoting peaceful and stable operations during the transition phase.

---

## **8. Appointment and Role of the Mediator-Arbitrator**
- The **Minister of Labour** is required to appoint a **mediator-arbitrator** after the Act comes into force.
- The mediator-arbitrator is tasked with:
  - **Mediating** all outstanding disputes related to the amendment or revision of the collective agreement.
  - If mediation fails, **arbitrating** the matter and rendering a decision.
  - **Reporting** to the Minister on the resolution of all matters.

> This establishes a neutral, legally empowered body to resolve disputes and ensure fair outcomes.

---

## **9. Powers of the Mediator-Arbitrator**
The mediator-arbitrator is granted powers equivalent to those of:
- A **conciliation commissioner** under **Section 84 of the Canada Labour Code** for mediation purposes.
- An **arbitrator** under **Sections 60 and 61 of the Canada Labour Code** for arbitration purposes.

> This ensures the mediator-arbitrator has sufficient authority to conduct both mediation and binding arbitration in accordance with federal labor law.

---

## **10. Incorporation of Decisions into the Agreement**
- Any **agreements reached through mediation** and any **arbitration decisions** are formally incorporated into the collective agreement.
- The amended agreement becomes a **new collective agreement**, effective **on and after February 1, 1991**.
- The decision must be presented in a form that allows it to be legally included in the agreement.

> This ensures that the outcomes of the mediation/arbitration are binding and legally enforceable.

---

## **11. Flexibility in Amending the Agreement**
- The Act **does not restrict** the parties from agreeing to amend any provision of the collective agreement (except the term of the agreement).
- This allows flexibility for future negotiations and adjustments to working conditions, wages, or benefits.

> This clause supports ongoing dialogue and adaptation to changing operational or economic conditions.

---

## **12. Enforcement and Penalties**
The Act includes clear enforcement mechanisms:
- **Individual Offences**:
  - An individual who violates any provision of the Act is guilty of an offence punishable on **summary conviction**.
  - Fine: 
    - **Up to $50,000** if the individual was acting as an officer or representative of an employer or union.
    - **Up to $1,000** in all other cases.

  - Employers or the union that contravene the Act are guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of **up to $100,000 per day or part of a day** the offence continues.
- **Enforcement**:
  - Employers and the union are **deemed to be "persons"** for the purposes of enforcement proceedings.
- **Defence of Due Diligence**:
  - A person may raise a defence of **due diligence** in a prosecution under this Act — meaning that if they took reasonable steps to avoid wrongdoing, they may not be held fully liable.
