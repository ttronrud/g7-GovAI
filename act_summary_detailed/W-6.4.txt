The provided text appears to be a **summary or excerpt from a Canadian Act of Parliament**, specifically indicating that a particular provision or section of a law has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).

### Detailed Summary:

**Text Analysis:**

> *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*

This is the standard opening of a Canadian Act of Parliament. It signifies that the legislation was passed through the normal legislative process — approved by both the Senate and the House of Commons — and is now formally enacted by the monarch (on the advice of the government).

However, immediately following this, the text lists **multiple repeated entries**:

> `[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 67]`  
> (Repeated 20 times)

Each of these entries indicates that **specific sections of a prior law** (or a previous Act) were **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled) by **Bill C-26, 2017**, which is the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017* (or a similar statute).

- **"Repealed"** means the provision or section is no longer in force.
- **"2017"** refers to the year the repeal was enacted.
- **"c. 26"** stands for "Chapter 26" — the official number of the Act passed in 2017.
- **"s. 67"** refers to "Section 67" of that Act — the specific section that repealed the prior provision.

### Interpretation:

The repeated lines suggest that **multiple sections** (possibly several clauses or subsections) of a previous law were **repealed by Section 67 of Bill C-26, 2017**. However, the original text does not specify *which law* or *what the repealed sections were about* — only that they were removed.

Since the content of the repealed sections is missing (the actual provisions are not included), a detailed summary of the *original law* or its *purpose* cannot be provided.

### Conclusion:

This document is **not an active law** but rather a **repeal notice**. It indicates that:

- A previous section(s) of a Canadian statute were **officially removed** from the law.
- The repeal was enacted through **Bill C-26, 2017**, which received royal assent and became law.
- The repeal specifically targeted **Section 67** of that bill (though this appears to be a misstatement — it's more likely that Section 67 of C-26 *repealed* prior sections).
- The original provisions (e.g., specific rules, offenses, or definitions) are now **no longer in force**.

### Important Note:

The repetition of the same repeal notice 20 times may be a formatting or transcription error — it could have been intended to indicate that **multiple provisions** were repealed under Section 67 of C-26, 2017. However, without access to the full text of the original legislation or the specific provisions that were repealed, a detailed summary of the *original content* or *legal impact* cannot be provided.

---

### Final Summary (Concise):

> This document is a legislative notice indicating that multiple provisions of a prior Canadian law were repealed by **Section 67 of Bill C-26, 2017**. The repeal was enacted through the formal process of the Canadian Parliament and approved by both the House of Commons and the Senate. However, the specific content of the repealed sections is not included in this excerpt. As a result, while the *action* (repeal) is clear, the *substance* or *purpose* of the original law is not available from this text alone.

🔍 **To gain further detail**, one would need to consult the full text of **Bill C-26, 2017**, particularly **Section 67**, or the original statute that was repealed.
