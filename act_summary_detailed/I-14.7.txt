### **Enforcement Powers of Designated Officers**

Every designated officer has the **same law enforcement powers** as a member of the RCMP when:

- Participating in an integrated cross-border operation; or  
- Engaging in activities **incidental to the operation**, including:
  - Travel to and from the operation site;
  - Appearances in court related to the operation.

This includes the power to:
- Stop, search, detain, and investigate individuals or vessels;
- Enforce relevant Canadian laws during operations.

> This power is granted under the authority of **Acts of Parliament**, ensuring legal legitimacy.

### **Applicability of Canadian Law**

- **Detention or arrest within Canada**: Any person detained or taken into custody during an integrated operation **within Canadian territory** is subject to **Canadian law**.
- **Vessels or property seized in Canada**: Canadian law applies to any vessel or item seized in Canada during such operations.
- **Removal from Canada**: 
  - Generally, **no vessel or item may be removed from Canada** without following Canadian legal procedures.
  - **Exception**: Removal may occur in **operational or geographical necessity** (see below).

---

### **Exceptions to Removal from Canada (Operational or Geographical Necessity)**

A vessel or item may be removed from Canada **only if** one of the following conditions applies:

1. **Continuing operation or emergency response** in U.S. waters:  
   - Officers must participate in a continuing integrated operation or respond to an emergency in U.S. waters before delivering the vessel or item to Canada.

2. **Poor weather or mechanical failure**:  
   - If the vessel operated by designated officers is unable to proceed due to adverse weather or mechanical issues, it must transit through U.S. waters to reach the nearest safe port.

3. **Navigable shipping routes pass through U.S. waters**:  
   - If the navigable channels between the seizure location and the intended delivery point in Canada pass through U.S. waters, transit is required.

> These exceptions ensure operational feasibility and safety without compromising jurisdictional integrity.

### **Seizure in the United States – Custody and Control**

If a vessel or item is seized in the **United States** and brought into Canada under operational necessity:

- It remains in the **custody and control of the U.S. designated officer** until delivered to its final destination in the U.S.

Similarly, if a vessel or item is seized in **Canada** and brought into the **United States** due to necessity:

- It remains under the **custody and control of the Canadian designated officer** until delivered to its final destination in the U.S.

> This ensures continuity of legal authority and prevents jurisdictional confusion during transit.

### **Exemption from Import/Export Regulations**

- **No Canadian import/export law applies** to the movement of a vessel or item by a designated officer in the circumstances described in:
  - Section 14(3) (operational necessity in Canada); or  
  - Section 15 (operational necessity in the U.S.).

> This exemption ensures that designated officers can move assets freely for operational purposes without being subject to customs or trade regulations, which could otherwise delay or obstruct critical law enforcement actions.
