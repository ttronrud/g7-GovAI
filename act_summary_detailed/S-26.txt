- **Court appealed from**: Any court from which an appeal is directly brought to the Supreme Court — including provincial superior courts or appellate courts.
- **Final judgment**: Any judgment, rule, order, or decision that determines in whole or in part a substantive right of a party in a judicial proceeding.
- **Judge**: A judge of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice.
- **Judgment**: Includes judgments, orders, decrees, sentences, or decisions — with specific meanings depending on context (e.g., of the lower court vs. the Supreme Court).
- **Judicial proceeding**: A proceeding in which the court exercises jurisdiction beyond mere administrative or executive functions.
- **Registrar**: The official responsible for administrative and procedural duties of the Court.
- **Witness**: Any person, whether a party or not, to be examined under the Act.
