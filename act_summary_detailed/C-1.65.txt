### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act**

---

#### **1. Overview and Purpose**

The *Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act* (the "Act") is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada to **implement and operationalize** the **Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA)** and its associated agreements. The Act provides the legal framework through which Canada fulfills its obligations under the FTA and related agreements, ensuring compliance, transparency, and enforceability within Canadian law.

The primary purpose of the Act is to:

- Establish a **free trade area** between Canada and Colombia.
- Promote **reciprocal trade** and the **harmonious development** of economic relations between the two countries.
- Ensure **fair conditions of competition** in trade.
- Increase **investment opportunities** in both nations.
- Contribute to the **expansion of global trade** by removing trade barriers.
- Strengthen **environmental cooperation** and enforce environmental standards.
- Protect and enhance **basic workers’ rights**, promote labor cooperation, and support international labor commitments.
- Advance **sustainable development** through integrated economic and environmental policies.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The Act defines several critical terms used throughout:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the *Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia*, signed on **November 21, 2008**.
- **Federal law**: Includes any Act of Parliament, regulation, order, or other instrument made under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
- **Joint Commission**: The body established under **Article 2001 of the Agreement** to oversee implementation, resolve disputes, and monitor compliance.
- **Minister**: The **Minister for International Trade**, who serves as Canada’s principal representative on the Joint Commission.
- **Related Agreement**: Two specific agreements signed on the same date as the FTA:
  - The *Agreement on the Environment*.
  - The *Agreement on Labour Cooperation*.

These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in interpreting the obligations and mechanisms of the FTA and its related instruments.

---

#### **3. Interpretation Principles**

To ensure consistency with the spirit and intent of the agreements:

- **Interpretation in Accordance with the Agreement**: This Act and any federal law implementing the Agreement or related agreements must be interpreted **in a manner consistent** with the text and objectives of the Agreement or related agreement.
- **Exclusion of Natural Resources**: Nothing in the Act applies to **natural surface or ground water** in any state (liquid, gaseous, or solid). This clarifies that environmental protections under the Act do not extend to groundwater or natural resource extraction.
- **Parliamentary Sovereignty**: The Act **does not limit Parliament’s power** to pass new legislation to implement the Agreement or fulfill Canada’s obligations. This ensures that Parliament retains full legislative authority to adapt laws as needed.

---

#### **4. Legal and Procedural Provisions**

##### **A. No Private Litigation Against the Agreement**
- **No individual or entity may bring legal proceedings** to enforce or determine rights or obligations arising solely from:
  - Part 1 of the Act (which deals with implementation and enforcement mechanisms), or
  - Any order made under that Part.
- Similarly, **no proceedings may be initiated** against the Agreement or related agreements **without the prior consent of the Attorney General of Canada**.
- This provision prevents private lawsuits over trade obligations and ensures that enforcement remains under the control of the federal government, particularly through official channels like the Joint Commission.

> *Exception*: This restriction does **not apply** to provisions under **Section B of Chapter Eight** of the Agreement and **Part Three and Annex 4** of the *Agreement on Labour Cooperation*, which may allow certain labor-related claims to be pursued independently.

---

##### **B. Role of the Joint Commission**

- The **Minister for International Trade** is the **principal representative of Canada** on the Joint Commission.
- The Government of Canada is responsible for **paying its appropriate share** of all expenditures incurred by or on behalf of the Joint Commission.
- The Minister has the authority to:
  - Appoint representatives to **committees or subcommittees** referenced in **Annex 2001** of the Agreement.
  - Appoint **panelists** in accordance with **Article 2108** of the Agreement.
  - Propose candidates for **panel chairs** as specified in that article.
- The Government must designate a specific **agency, division, or branch** to:
  - Facilitate the operation of **Chapter Twenty-One** of the Agreement (which deals with dispute resolution and administrative procedures).
  - Provide **administrative support** to panels established under that chapter.

---

##### **C. Financial Responsibilities**

The Government of Canada bears the cost of:
- Remuneration and expenses for:
  - Panel members, committee members, subcommittee members, working groups, and their assistants.
- General operating expenses of these bodies.

This ensures that the administrative and operational costs of implementing the FTA are fully covered by the federal government.

---

##### **D. Suspension of Benefits (Governor in Council Powers)**

Under **Article 2114 of the Agreement**, the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may issue orders to **suspend benefits** granted under the Agreement or federal laws, including:

- Suspension of rights or privileges granted to Colombia or its goods.
- Modification or suspension of federal laws applicable to Colombia or its goods.
- Extension of federal laws to cover Colombian goods or entities.
- Any other measure deemed necessary by the Governor in Council.

> **Key Condition**:  
> An order under this power **cannot be made unless** the Governor in Council is satisfied that:
> - The Government of Colombia has taken **satisfactory steps** to implement the Agreement and related agreements.
> - Colombia has provided **written notification** to Canada under **Article 3 of the Agreement Concerning Annual Reports on Human Rights and Free Trade**.
> - Colombia has **accepted written notification** from Canada under the same article.

This safeguards the principle of mutual implementation and ensures that suspensions are not used unilaterally or without due diligence.

##### **E. Annual Reporting on Human Rights**

Pursuant to the **Agreement Concerning Annual Reports on Human Rights and Free Trade**, the Minister is required to:

- Prepare and submit an **annual report** to each House of Parliament by **May 15** each year (or within 30 days of the next sitting if Parliament is not in session).
- The report must include:
  - A **general summary** of all actions taken under the Act during the previous calendar year.
  - An **analysis of the impact** of those actions on **human rights in both Canada and Colombia**.

This provision ensures **transparency**, accountability, and a commitment to human rights within the framework of free trade.

#### **5. Enforcement and Implementation**
