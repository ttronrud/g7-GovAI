**Detailed Summary of the *Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act* establishes an independent, specialized tribunal — the **Veterans Review and Appeal Board (Board)** — to provide fair, timely, and accessible review and appeal processes for veterans and their dependants concerning decisions related to pensions, benefits, and compensation under key federal legislation such as the *Pension Act* and the *Veterans Well-being Act*. The Act ensures that veterans who have served Canada are treated with dignity and that their rights to fair review and appeal are protected.

The Board operates independently of the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), with powers and jurisdiction to hear appeals and review decisions on matters of benefit entitlement, including pension amounts, critical injury benefits, death benefits, and compassionate awards. It also includes provisions for internal oversight, member accountability, and equitable treatment of applicants.
