### **Overview**
The *Gender Equality Week Act* is a legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of Canada to formally recognize and promote gender equality in Canadian society.

### **Key Provisions and Objectives**

#### 1. **Official Recognition of Gender Equality Week**
- The Act formally establishes that **the fourth week of September is to be known as "Gender Equality Week"** throughout Canada.
- This designation applies uniformly across all provinces, territories, and communities.
- The week serves as a national platform for education, celebration, advocacy, and action focused on gender equality.

#### 2. **Recognition of Women’s Contributions**
- The Act acknowledges the **significant and substantive contributions** of Canadian women to the nation’s growth, development, character, and identity.
- It emphasizes that these contributions span historical, cultural, economic, political, and social domains and continue to shape Canada’s future.

#### 3. **Commitment to Equality and Compassion**
- The Act affirms that **equality and compassion** are among Canada’s core national values.
- It underscores that **all Canadians share responsibility** for addressing gender-based challenges, recognizing that gender-related issues are fundamentally human issues affecting individuals across all backgrounds.

#### 4. **Inclusion of Gender Identity and Expression**
- The Act explicitly recognizes that many of the challenges faced by Canadian women also affect individuals of **minority gender identity and expression**, including transgender and non-binary people.
- It calls for inclusive approaches that address the intersection of gender, race, disability, age, and immigration status.

#### 5. **Addressing Systemic Inequalities**
The Act identifies and highlights several key areas where Canadian women face disproportionate challenges:

| Challenge Area | Specific Issues |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Poverty and Inequality** | Elderly, disabled, transgender, and visible minority women are disproportionately affected by poverty, leading to isolation and vulnerability. |
| **Affordable Housing and Social Services** | Limited access to affordable housing, child care, and social support programs exacerbates hardship for women and their families. |
| **Healthcare Gaps** | Women are often underserved in healthcare, particularly in mental health, reproductive health, and chronic disease management. |
| **Gender-Based Violence** | Women are more likely than men to be victims of sexual assault and intimate partner violence. Indigenous women are especially vulnerable, facing disproportionate rates of violence and sexual exploitation. |
| **Legal and Social Recourse Barriers** | Women who experience abuse often struggle to access effective legal protection or social support systems. |
| **Education and Career Advancement** | Women face barriers in pursuing and completing post-secondary education, especially in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields. A gender wage gap persists. |
| **Leadership and Representation** | Women are underrepresented in politics, corporate leadership, and board positions. Indigenous women face additional barriers in education, employment, and political representation. |
| **Immigration and Integration** | Newcomer women face obstacles such as lack of language training, employment support, and recognition of prior qualifications. |
| **Prison Population Trends** | There has been a disproportionate rise in female inmates, especially among Indigenous women, highlighting systemic failures in prevention and support. |
| **Participation in Sports** | Women are underrepresented in sports and physical activities, which negatively impacts health and social inclusion. |

#### 6. **Call to Action for Stakeholders**
The Act encourages **all levels of government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector, academic institutions, educators, and individual Canadians** to:
- Organize and participate in events during Gender Equality Week.
- Launch initiatives that address the challenges faced by women and gender-diverse individuals.
- Promote inclusive policies and practices that support equity and inclusion.

#### 7. **Engagement of Men and Non-Identifying Individuals**
- The Act specifically encourages **men and those who do not identify as women** to become actively engaged in gender equality efforts.
- It promotes a shared responsibility model, emphasizing that achieving gender equality is not solely a women’s issue but a collective societal one.

#### 8. **Ongoing Monitoring and Accountability**
- The Government of Canada is encouraged to **monitor progress** across federal departments and agencies in advancing gender equality.
- This includes tracking indicators such as:
  - Wage gaps
  - Representation in leadership
  - Rates of violence and poverty
  - Access to education and employment
  - Health outcomes
- The monitoring framework supports evidence-based policy development and accountability.

#### 9. **Celebration and Commemoration**
- The Act promotes the **celebration and commemoration** of the achievements and advancements of Canadian women.
- This includes honoring trailblazing women in various fields and recognizing the contributions of Indigenous, immigrant, and minority women.

- **Cultural Shift**: It fosters a cultural shift toward gender inclusivity, helping to normalize conversations about gender identity, equity, and intersectionality.
- **Intersectional Approach**: The Act explicitly addresses overlapping forms of discrimination (e.g., racism, disability, poverty, Indigenous status), promoting a more holistic understanding of gender-based challenges.
