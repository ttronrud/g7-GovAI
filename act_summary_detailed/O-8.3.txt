**Detailed Summary of the *Oil Tanker Moratorium Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Oil Tanker Moratorium Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. The Act establishes a **moratorium on oil tankers carrying large volumes of crude oil or "persistent oil"** in specific geographic areas of Canada — particularly in **northern British Columbia** — with the primary objective of **protecting the environment, especially sensitive marine and coastal ecosystems**, and **respecting Indigenous rights**.

This Act is a significant piece of environmental and Indigenous rights legislation, reflecting Canada’s growing emphasis on climate action, environmental stewardship, and the protection of Indigenous lands and waters under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Citation**
- The Act is titled the **Oil Tanker Moratorium Act**.
- It applies to oil tankers carrying **crude oil or persistent oil** in bulk in their holds.
- The moratorium is designed to **prevent environmental harm** from oil spills or accidental discharges in ecologically sensitive regions of northern British Columbia.

---

### **2. Definitions**
The Act defines key terms used throughout:
- **Crude oil**: Any natural liquid hydrocarbon mixture, including those after distillate removal or addition. Includes unrefined petroleum.
- **Persistent oil**: A class of oils listed in a Schedule (not included in the excerpt) that are environmentally harmful and long-lasting (e.g., heavy fuel oil, asphaltenes).
- **Oil**: Broadly includes crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and refined products.
- **Oil tanker**: A vessel constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk in liquid form in its hold.
- **Vessel**: As defined in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*.
- **Master**: As defined in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*.
- **Owner**: The registered owner or, if unregistered, the person with legal rights to possession and use.
- **Indigenous peoples of Canada**: As defined in Section 35(2) of the *Constitution Act, 1982* — includes First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.
- **Marine installation**: Any facility on or connected to land used for loading/unloading oil from vessels.

### **3. Geographic Scope of the Moratorium**
The moratorium applies to:
- **Ports and marine installations** located:
  - **North of 50°53′00′′ N latitude**
  - **West of 126°38′36′′ W longitude**
- This area covers **northern British Columbia**, including parts of the coastal and inland regions near the Pacific Ocean, such as the **Kitimat, Prince Rupert, and northern coastlines** — areas known for ecological sensitivity, biodiversity, and Indigenous communities.

> This region includes critical habitats for wildlife, salmon runs, and traditional Indigenous territories.

### **4. Core Prohibitions (Sections 4–6)**

#### **Section 4 – Prohibition on Mooring, Unloading, and Loading**
The following activities are **strictly prohibited**:
1. **Mooring or anchoring** at a port or marine installation within the restricted area if:
   - The oil tanker is carrying **more than 12,500 metric tons** of crude oil or persistent oil (or a combination) in bulk in its hold.

2. **Unloading** any such oil at a port or marine installation within the area.

3. **Loading** into the hold of an oil tanker:
   - If the tanker is already carrying over 12,500 metric tons of crude or persistent oil; **or**
   - If loading would result in the total amount of such oil in the hold exceeding 12,500 metric tons at any time.

> This prevents the accumulation of high-risk oil volumes in the sensitive region.

#### **Section 5 – Prohibition on Circumvention**
The Act prohibits **any person or vessel** from:
- Transporting crude or persistent oil **from an oil tanker in the restricted area** to a port or installation **within the area**, to help the tanker avoid the moratorium.
- Transporting oil **from a port or installation in the area** to an oil tanker **in the area**, to assist it in circumventing the moratorium.

> These provisions prevent "oil smuggling" or "bypassing" the moratorium through transfer operations.

### **5. Exceptions and Exemptions (Section 6)**

The moratorium **does not apply** in the following circumstances:
- **Emergency safety**:
  - To ensure the safety of the oil tanker.
  - To render assistance to a vessel in distress.
  - To obtain emergency medical assistance for crew.
- **Compliance with legal directions**:
  - Vessels carrying out activities under specific directions in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, such as:
    - Subsection 111(2)
    - Subsection 114(2), paragraph 180(1)(c)
    - Subsection 189(1)(d)
    - Subsection 211(3)

> These allow for flexibility in emergencies or operational requirements.

#### **Exemptions by Minister (Section 7)**
- The **Minister of Transport** may issue an **order** to exempt a specific oil tanker from the moratorium for:
  - Community or industry resupply (e.g., fuel for remote communities).
  - Public interest reasons.
- The exemption must be:
  - For a specific period.
  - On terms considered appropriate by the Minister.
- The Minister may **exempt a vessel** if it is essential for public safety or economic necessity.

> This creates a balance between environmental protection and practical needs.
