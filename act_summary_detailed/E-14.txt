**Detailed Summary of the Excise Act**

---

### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Excise Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation governing the taxation, regulation, and control of certain goods and substances, particularly those containing alcohol or tobacco. The Act establishes duties, administrative procedures, definitions, and enforcement mechanisms related to the manufacture, handling, distribution, and consumption of excisable goods.

However, the Act has undergone significant amendments — most notably with the coming into force of **Parts 3 and 4 of the Excise Act, 2001** — which have fundamentally altered its scope and application.

## **Key Provisions and Summary**

---

### **1. Supersession of the Act (Effective Upon Coming into Force of Excise Act, 2001)**

> *"Despite anything in this Act, on the coming into force of Parts 3 and 4 of the Excise Act, 2001, this Act ceases to apply in respect of:*
> - *the manufacture of any goods or substances other than beer, malt liquor, and any product manufactured in accordance with subsection 169(2); and*
> - *the handling or dealing with anything that is or relates to any goods or substances other than beer, malt liquor, and any product manufactured in accordance with subsection 169(2), to the extent that the Excise Act, 2001 applies to that handling or dealing."*

#### **Interpretation:**
- The **original Excise Act** (the predecessor to the 2001 Act) **ceases to apply** for all excisable goods **except**:
  - **Beer**
  - **Malt liquor**
  - **Products manufactured in accordance with subsection 169(2)** of the Excise Act, 2001 (which may include specific types of alcohol or processed products under strict conditions).
- This means that **all other excisable products** (such as spirits, wine, tobacco, or other alcoholic beverages) are now governed by the **Excise Act, 2001**, not this older Act.
- The transition ensures a modern, unified framework for excise regulation, aligning with updated industry practices and tax policy.

> **Note:** This provision reflects a major legislative reform to streamline excise regulation and reduce regulatory overlap.

| **Beer Concentrate** | A product with >11.9% alcohol by volume, made by dehydrating fermented liquor (without distillation), intended to be diluted into a beverage with ≤11.9% alcohol. Must be approved by the Minister for transformation on-premises. |
| **Alcohol, Ethyl Alcohol, Spirits** | Any material containing absolute ethyl alcohol (C₂H₅OH), whether liquid or solid. |
| **Distiller / Distillery** | Any person or place involved in fermentation, distillation, rectification, or use of stills/worms for spirit production. Includes possession or use of equipment. |

### **3. Special Provisions on Beer Concentrate and Transformation**

> *"This Act does not apply to the transformation, by dilution or hydration, of beer concentrate into beer for consumption as a beverage on the premises where it is transformed if the transformation is done in a manner approved by the Minister."*

#### **Significance:**
- Allows **flexible on-premises rehydration** of beer concentrate (a concentrated form of beer) into ready-to-drink beer.
- The transformation must:
  - Be **approved by the Minister**.
  - Occur **on the premises** where the beverage is consumed.
  - Not involve **distribution or sale** outside the premises.
- This provision supports innovation in beverage manufacturing (e.g., breweries producing concentrated beer for later use) while maintaining control over compliance.

> **Clarification (Section 4):**  
> *“Beer” means a product that would be beer or malt liquor if the definition in section 4 were read without reference to paragraph (b).*  
> This ensures that beer concentrate is treated as beer under the Act if it meets the criteria.

### **4. Association and Related Persons (For Tax and Regulatory Purposes)**

The Act defines how individuals, partnerships, and corporations are considered **related or associated**, which affects compliance, reporting, and regulatory scrutiny.

#### Key Rules:

1. **Related Persons (under Income Tax Act):**
   - Two persons are related if they are related under **sections 251(2)–(6)** of the Income Tax Act.
   - Exceptions:
     - "Corporation" is read as **corporation or partnership**.
     - "Shares" or "shareholders" are read as **rights** or **partners**, respectively, in the context of partnerships.

2. **Association Between Entities:**
   - A **corporation is associated** with another if they are linked under **sections 256(1)–(6)** of the Income Tax Act.
   - A **person (non-corporation)** is associated with a corporation if:
     - The corporation is **controlled** by that person or a group of persons, and
     - Each member of the group is associated with each other.
   - A person is associated with:
     - A **partnership** if they collectively own **more than half** of the partnership’s profits.
     - A **trust** if they collectively hold **more than half** of the trust’s value.

3. **Arm’s Length Exception for Breweries:**
   - If two licensed brewers are controlled by individuals connected by **blood, marriage, common-law partnership, or adoption**, they are **deemed not related** for the purposes of section 170.1 **if** it is proven that they deal with each other at **arm’s length** (i.e., fair market terms, no favoritism).

> This provision prevents regulatory overreach and ensures fair competition among related businesses.
