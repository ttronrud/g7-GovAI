**Detailed Summary of the *Canada School of Public Service Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Canada School of Public Service Act* (CSPSA) establishes and restructures the **Canada School of Public Service (School)** as a key institution within the federal government responsible for leadership development, training, research, and capacity-building in the public sector. The Act was enacted in 1991 and came into force on December 1, 1991 (as noted in the note), and it formally transitions the former **Canadian Centre for Management Development (CCMD)** into the Canada School of Public Service.

This Act provides the legal framework for the School’s structure, governance, mandate, operations, financial autonomy, and reporting obligations. It also ensures continuity of rights, obligations, staff, and assets from the CCMD to the new School.
