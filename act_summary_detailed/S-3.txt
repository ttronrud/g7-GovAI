### **General Overview**

The *Salaries Act* establishes the framework for determining, adjusting, and paying salaries to key federal officials in Canada, including the **Prime Minister**, **ministers**, **lieutenant governors**, and certain other public office-holders. The Act specifies:

- The **source of salary payments** (Consolidated Revenue Fund),
- The **method of salary adjustment** based on economic indicators (Industrial Aggregates),
- **Specific salary amounts** for various positions,
- **Retroactive salary adjustments** for former officials,
- **Salary indexing mechanisms** tied to wage growth in the private sector,
- **Provisions for ministerial support departments**, and
- **Application to members of Parliament** regarding retirement and election choices.

## **1. General Principles of Salary Payment**

- All salaries mentioned in the Act are:
  - **Paid annually**, and
  - **Pro rata** for any partial year (e.g., if a position is held for only six months).
- Payments are made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, the primary source of public funds in Canada.

## **2. Salary of the Lieutenant Governor (Provincial Level)**

### **Period: April 1, 1985 – December 31, 1985**
- The salary of each provincial lieutenant governor for this period is **$69,000 per year**.

### **General Salary Adjustment Mechanism (1984 and After)**
Starting in 1984, the salary of each provincial lieutenant governor is calculated using a formula based on the **Industrial Aggregate** (average weekly wages and salaries in Canada), published by **Statistics Canada** under the *Statistics Act*.

#### Formula:
> Salary = (Previous year’s salary) × **lesser of**  
> - (Industrial Aggregate of first adjustment year / Industrial Aggregate of second adjustment year) × 100%, **or**  
> - 107%

Where:
- **First adjustment year**: The 12-month period immediately before the start of the calendar year for which the salary is being determined, and for which the Industrial Aggregate is available on the first day of that year.
- **Second adjustment year**: The 12-month period immediately before the first adjustment year.

#### Rounding Rule:
- If the calculated salary is **not a multiple of $100**, it is **rounded down** to the nearest lower multiple of $100.

#### Exception: 1993–1996
- For the calendar years **1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996**, the lieutenant governor’s salary remains **fixed at the 1992 level** (i.e., no adjustment based on Industrial Aggregates).

#### Special Provision for 1997
- For the 1997 salary, the **1996 salary** is deemed to be the amount payable under **subsection (5)** (which likely refers to a temporary or special salary adjustment).

> This provision was likely intended to provide stability during transitional periods.
