**Detailed Summary of the Governor General’s Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Governor General’s Act* is a foundational piece of legislation in Canada that establishes the legal status, financial compensation, and post-retirement benefits for the Governor General of Canada — the representative of the Sovereign in Canada. It defines the Governor General as a *corporation sole*, outlines salary structures with periodic adjustments, and provides detailed provisions for retirement and survivor benefits, including annuities and survivor rights.

This Act also includes provisions for retroactive salary increases and ensures that annuities and pensions are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, with specific rules regarding survivorship, cohabitation, and the treatment of financial obligations.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Legal Status of the Governor General**
> *"The Governor General of Canada or other chief executive officer or administrator carrying on the Government of Canada on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign, by whatever title designated, is a corporation sole."*

- **Meaning**: The Governor General is treated as a *corporation sole*, meaning the office exists independently of any individual. Even though the office is held by a person, the office itself is a legal entity that continues to exist upon the death or resignation of the individual.
- This status ensures that the office is not subject to personal liability or inheritance and allows the office to maintain continuity in its functions.

### **2. Instruments and Legal Actions in the Governor General’s Name**
> *"All bonds, recognizances and other instruments by law required to be taken to the Governor General in his public capacity shall be taken to the Governor General by his name of office."*  
> *"The instruments referred to in subsection (1) may be sued for and recovered by the Governor General by his name of office."*  
> *"The instruments referred to in subsection (1) shall in no case go to or vest in the personal representatives of the Governor General, chief executive officer or administrator of the Government in whose name they were taken."*

- **Purpose**: Ensures that any legal instruments (e.g., bonds, recognizances) taken in the Governor General’s official capacity are held solely in the name of the office, not the individual.
- **Protection from personal claims**: These instruments do not pass to the personal estate or successors of the Governor General, protecting the office from being subject to personal debts or claims after the individual’s death.

### **3. Salary Structure and Adjustment Mechanism**

#### **Base Salary (2013)**
> *"There shall be payable to the Governor General for the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2013 a salary of $270,602."*

- Establishes a fixed base salary for the first year of the Act’s application (2013).

#### **Annual Salary Adjustment Formula**
> *"For the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2014 and for each 12-month period after that, the Governor General’s salary shall be the amount obtained by multiplying:  
(a) that salary for the twelve month period immediately preceding the twelve month period in respect of which the salary is to be determined  
by  
(b) the lesser of one hundred and seven per cent and the percentage that the Industrial Aggregate for the first adjustment year is of the Industrial Aggregate for the second adjustment year."*

- **Adjustment Mechanism**:
  - Salary increases are based on changes in the *Industrial Aggregate* (average weekly wages and salaries across Canada).
  - The adjustment factor is capped at **107%**, preventing excessive growth.
  - The formula uses a ratio of the Industrial Aggregate from two years:
    - **First adjustment year**: The most recent 12-month period for which the Industrial Aggregate is available on the first day of the new salary period.
    - **Second adjustment year**: The 12-month period immediately before the first adjustment year.

- **Example**:
  - If the Industrial Aggregate increases by 8%, the salary increases by 8% (up to a maximum of 7% increase, capped at 107%).
  - If the increase is less than 7%, the salary increases by the actual percentage.

#### **Rounding and Proration**
> *"A salary determined pursuant to subsection (1) that is not a multiple of one hundred dollars shall be rounded to the closest multiple of one hundred dollars that is lower than the salary so determined and the salary so determined shall be prorated for any period that is less than one year."*

- **Rounding Rule**: Any non-integer dollar amount is rounded **down** to the nearest $100 (e.g., $270,650 → $270,600).
- **Proration**: If the salary is paid for a partial year (e.g., 6 months), it is prorated accordingly (e.g., half the annual amount).

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was repealed in 2012 (c. 19, s. 17), but the original version appears to be preserved in this summary as part of the provided text.*

### **4. Survivor Benefits (Annuities)**

#### **General Annuity Upon Retirement**
> *"Where a Governor General ceases to hold office as such, there shall be paid to him an annuity equal to the aggregate of:  
(a) one-third of the salary annexed to the office of Governor General on March 1, 1967; and  
(b) such amount, in addition to the amount determined under paragraph (a), as would be paid to him as a supplementary retirement benefit under the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act in the year in which he ceases to hold office if that benefit were calculated on the basis that he had ceased to hold office on January 1, 1952."*

- **Components**:
  - **One-third of the 1967 salary** ($270,602 × 1/3 ≈ $90,200 in 2013 dollars).
  - **Supplementary retirement benefit** (based on a hypothetical retirement on January 1, 1952), calculated under the *Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act*.
- This ensures a meaningful retirement income based on historical salary and pension rules.

#### **Commencement and Duration**
> *"An annuity payable under this section shall commence on the day the annuitant ceases to hold the office of Governor General and shall continue thereafter during his life."*

- The annuity begins immediately upon resignation or retirement and lasts for the lifetime of the former Governor General.

#### **Survivor Annuity Upon Death**
> *"When a former Governor General who is in receipt of an annuity under section 6 dies, an annuity equal to one-half of the annuity shall be paid to his or her survivor."*  
> *"When a Governor General dies while holding office, his or her survivor shall be paid an annuity equal to one-half of the annuity that would have been paid if the Governor General had retired on the day on which he or she died."*

- **Key Points**:
  - If a former Governor General dies while receiving an annuity, their **survivor receives half** of the original annuity.
  - If a Governor General dies *while in office*, the survivor receives **half of what the annuity would have been had they retired on the day of death**.
- This ensures that surviving spouses or partners are financially supported.

#### **Division of Annuity Between Two Survivors**
> *"When an annuity is payable under this section and there are two survivors, the total amount of the annuity shall be apportioned so that:  
(a) the survivor referred to in paragraph 4.2(a) receives an amount, if any, equal to the total amount less any amount determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection; and  
(b) the survivor referred to in paragraph 4.2(b) receives an amount equal to that proportion of the total amount that the number of years that the survivor cohabited with the annuitant while the annuitant was Governor General is of the number of years that the annuitant was Governor General."*

- **Cohabitation Rule**:
  - A person who cohabited with the Governor General for **at least one year** before death may qualify as a survivor.
  - The **proportion of the annuity** is based on the ratio of cohabitation years to total years in office.
  - **Part of a year counts as a full year if ≥6 months**, otherwise ignored.

> Example:  
- Governor General served 10 years.  
- Survivor cohabited for 6 years (6 months = 1 full year).  
- Annuitant receives 6/10 = 60% of the annuity.  
- Survivor receives 60% of the total annuity.

### **5. Election to Enable Cohabiting Partner to Receive Annuity**

> *"If the person to whom a former Governor General is married or with whom he or she is cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature, having so cohabited for a period of at least one year, would not be entitled to an annuity under section 7 in the event of the former Governor General’s death, the former Governor General may make an election, in accordance with the regulations, to reduce the amount of the annuity to which he or she is entitled in order that the person could become entitled to an annuity under subsection (2)."*

- **Purpose**: Allows a cohabiting partner (not married) to qualify for an annuity upon the death of a former Governor General, even if
