**Detailed Summary of the *Seals Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Seals Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that governs the authority, use, and administration of **royal seals** and **royal instruments** in Canada. It establishes the legal framework under which the Canadian Crown (through Her Majesty the Queen) can issue official documents—particularly those bearing the authority of the Crown—using either the **Great Seal of Canada** or other approved royal seals. The Act ensures that such instruments are valid, properly authenticated, and used in accordance with constitutional and legal principles, while also providing flexibility for modern governance needs.

The Act may be cited as the **Seals Act**, and it operates to codify long-standing traditions of royal authority in Canada, adapting them to contemporary administrative and legal requirements.

### **Key Definitions**  

1. **Counter-signature**  
   - Refers to the endorsement of a royal instrument or document under the **sign-manual** (i.e., a document issued in the name of the Queen without a seal) by the **signature of Her Majesty’s responsible Canadian minister**.  
   - This serves as a formal validation or authorization, ensuring that the instrument is not merely issued by the Crown but is also approved by a responsible federal minister.  
   - The counter-signature acts as a constitutional check, ensuring that the exercise of royal authority is aligned with government policy and accountability.

2. **Document under the Sign-Manual**  
   - An instrument issued in the name and under the signature of Her Majesty the Queen **without the use of a physical seal**.  
   - These are common in modern administrative practice (e.g., statutory instruments, orders, or proclamations) where a seal is not required due to the nature of the document.  
   - The term reflects Canada’s continued use of the Queen’s signature as a symbol of Crown authority, even in the absence of a physical seal.

3. **Great Seal of the Realm**  
   - Refers to the **Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**, established under **Article XXIV of the Union Act of 1706 (5 Anne, c. VIII)**.  
   - Includes the **wafer seal**, a component of the Great Seal used historically to authenticate royal documents.  
   - While the Great Seal of the Realm is used in the UK, its use in Canada is limited; the Act recognizes it as a reference point for understanding the historical basis of royal authentication.

4. **Royal Instrument**  
   - A document issued **by and in the name of the Queen** and passed under the **Great Seal of the Realm** or **one of the royal signets**.  
   - These are high-level, legally binding instruments such as proclamations, statutes, or orders that carry the full force of the Crown’s authority.  
   - Examples include royal proclamations, statutory instruments, and orders under the authority of the Crown.

5. **Royal Seals**  
   - Includes the **Great Seal of Canada** and any other seals or signets that may be **authorized by Her Majesty the Queen** under this Act.  
   - This provision allows for the creation of additional seals for specific purposes (e.g., for departments, agencies, or regions), provided they are approved by the Queen.  
   - The Great Seal of Canada is the primary symbol of Crown authority in Canada, while other signets may be used for more specialized or administrative functions.

6. **Signet**  
   - A seal delivered by the Queen to her **Principal Secretaries of State** in the UK, including the **lesser signet** (also known as the second secretarial seal) and the **cachet**.  
   - In Canada, the term is used to describe similar seals used by Canadian officials or departments, particularly in the context of historical or administrative continuity with the UK system.  
   - The signet may be used to authenticate certain documents or instruments in a manner analogous to the UK system.

### **Core Provisions and Legal Authority**  

#### **1. Supremacy of Royal Authority**  
> *“Notwithstanding any law in force in Canada, any royal instrument may be issued by and with the authority of Her Majesty the Queen and passed under the Great Seal of Canada, or under any other royal seal approved by Her Majesty the Queen for the purpose.”*  

- This provision **asserts the supremacy of the Crown** in issuing royal instruments.  
- It explicitly **overrides existing Canadian laws** that might otherwise restrict or prohibit the use of royal seals or instruments.  
- This ensures that the Crown retains the **constitutional power** to issue binding instruments, even if such instruments appear to conflict with existing statutes.  
- The authority is conditional: the seal must be approved by the Queen, and the instrument must serve a legitimate purpose.

#### **2. Power of the Governor in Council**  
> *“The Governor in Council may, subject to the approval of Her Majesty the Queen, make orders and regulations relating to royal seals, the use thereof, royal instruments and documents under the sign-manual…”*  

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has broad powers to **create regulations** governing the use of royal seals and instruments.  
- However, **all such regulations must be approved by Her Majesty the Queen**.  
- This ensures that while the government can manage administrative processes, the ultimate authority to approve the use of seals and instruments rests with the Crown.

#### **3. Scope of Regulatory Authority**  
The Governor in Council may regulate the following matters:  

| Regulatory Area | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Specification of Instruments** | Determines which types of instruments (e.g., proclamations, orders, regulations) are to be issued under royal seals. |
| **Authorization of Seals** | Allows for the creation of new royal seals (e.g., for specific departments or purposes), including naming and defining their intended use. |
| **Custody of Seals** | Specifies who is responsible for the physical or digital custody of royal seals (e.g., the Department of Justice or the Clerk of the Privy Council). |
| **Procedure for Use of Seals** | Outlines the formal process for using a royal seal (e.g., required approvals, authentication steps). |
| **Counter-signature** | Defines how and when a minister must provide a counter-signature to a royal instrument. |
| **Issuance and Counter-signature of Documents under the Sign-Manual** | Governs the process for issuing documents without a seal, including when and how a minister must sign them. |
| **Approval Process for the Queen’s Authority** | Establishes the formal mechanism by which the Queen’s approval is given for the issuance of royal instruments or documents under the sign-manual (e.g., via written directive or formal order). |
| **Authentication and Proof** | Defines what constitutes valid authentication or proof of a royal instrument or document under the sign-manual. This includes: <br> - Certification by an official (e.g., Clerk of the Privy Council or Queen’s Printer) <br> - Publication by the Queen’s Printer as a form of authentication. |

### **Purpose and Significance**  

The *Seals Act* serves several critical functions:  

1. **Constitutional Continuity**  
   - Preserves the **historical and constitutional basis** of Crown authority in Canada, rooted in the British tradition of royal seals and instruments.  
   - Ensures that Canada maintains a formal connection to the Crown, even as it develops a modern, independent legal system.

2. **Legal Validity and Authenticity**  
   - Provides a clear legal framework for the **authentication and validity** of royal instruments and documents under the sign-manual.  
   - Prevents ambiguity in determining whether a document is genuinely issued by the Crown.

3. **Accountability and Oversight**  
   - Requires **ministerial counter-signature**, which introduces a layer of governmental accountability.  
   - Ensures that no royal instrument is issued without ministerial endorsement, preventing arbitrary or unauthorized use of Crown power.

4. **Flexibility and Modernization**  
   - Allows for the creation of new seals and the adaptation of procedures to meet modern administrative needs (e.g., digital authentication, electronic seals).  
   - Recognizes that not all instruments require a physical seal, enabling efficiency in governance.

5. **Separation of Powers and Crown Oversight**  
   - Balances the **executive power** of the Cabinet (via Governor in Council) with the **supreme authority of the Crown** (via the Queen’s approval).  
   - Ensures that the Crown remains the ultimate source of royal authority, even when delegated through ministers.
