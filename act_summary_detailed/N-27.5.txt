**Detailed Summary of the *Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador Additional Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador Additional Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Act* is a federal legislation designed to implement two key fiscal arrangements between the Government of Canada and the provinces of **Nova Scotia** and **Newfoundland and Labrador**. These arrangements—signed on **February 14, 2005**—address the economic impact of offshore petroleum revenues and ensure that provinces with significant offshore resource production do not face disproportionate fiscal burdens due to the federal fiscal equalization system.

The core purpose of the Act is to provide **additional fiscal equalization offset payments** to these provinces, which are intended to:
- Offset the **fiscal benefits** derived from offshore revenues (such as oil and gas royalties and taxes),
- Allow provinces to **reduce outstanding public debt**,
- Ensure **fiscal fairness** by preventing provinces with offshore wealth from receiving undue advantages under the federal equalization framework.

The Act applies separately to **Nova Scotia** and **Newfoundland and Labrador**, with distinct definitions, payment schedules, and eligibility criteria tailored to each province’s unique economic and fiscal circumstances.

- For each fiscal year from **April 1, 2006, to March 31, 2012**, an additional AEOP is made **based on a formula**:
  
  $$
  \text{AEOP} = (\text{FEP}_{\text{no offshore}}) - (\text{FEP}_{\text{with offshore}})
  $$

  Where:
  - **FEP_no offshore** = Equalization payment if the province had **no offshore revenue or petroleum production**
  - **FEP_with offshore** = Equalization payment **with** offshore revenue included

  This formula ensures that the province is not over-reimbursed due to offshore income.
