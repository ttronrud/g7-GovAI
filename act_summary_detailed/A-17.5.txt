**Detailed Summary of the Act:**

This statutory provision, enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons, serves to **clarify and validate the legal status of a land acquisition** carried out by the **Federal District Commission (FDC)**. The key objective of the provision is to **ensure legal certainty and enforceability** regarding a specific land transaction, even though it was not originally approved through the formal process required by law at the time.

### **Key Elements of the Provision:**

1. **Subject Matter of the Acquisition**:
   - The Federal District Commission acquired **portions of lots 3a, 3b, and 4b** within **Range 5** of the **Official Cadastre**.
   - These lots are located in the **Township of Hull**, within the **Registry Division of Gatineau**, in the **Province of Quebec**.

2. **Date and Legal Instrument**:
   - The acquisition was made via **indenture** (a formal legal agreement or deed) on **May 31, 1954**.
   - This indenture was **registered** in the Office of the Registry Division of Gatineau under **registration number 34984**.

3. **Legal Deficiency at the Time**:
   - Under the original **Federal District Commission Act (Chapter 112 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952)**, any acquisition of land by the Commission required the **prior consent of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) under **subsection 16(1)**.
   - However, the 1954 indenture was **not made with such prior Cabinet approval**. This raises a potential legal issue: could the acquisition be challenged on grounds of lack of proper authorization?

4. **The Legal Effect of the Enactment**:
   - The Act **deems** (i.e., legally treats as if) that the 1954 acquisition **was made with the prior consent of the Governor in Council**.
   - This is not a retroactive grant of authority, but rather a **constitutional and legal clarification** that **validates the transaction** for all purposes, including:
     - Title and ownership
     - Enforceability in court
     - Transferability of land
     - Compliance with statutory requirements

5. **Statutory Basis and Repeal Context**:
   - The original Federal District Commission Act was **repealed** by **Section 28 of Chapter 37 of the Statutes of Canada, 1958**.
   - Despite the repeal, this provision **retains the legal effect** of the 1954 acquisition by **recharacterizing it as if it had been properly authorized** under the law that existed at the time.
   - This is a form of **"presumption of validity"** or **"retroactive validation"** to prevent the invalidation of a land transaction due to procedural shortcomings.

### **Purpose and Significance**:

- **Legal Certainty**: The provision removes uncertainty about the legitimacy of the land transfer, ensuring that the Commission’s acquisition is recognized as legally binding and enforceable.
- **Prevention of Disputes**: It prevents future challenges based on the absence of Governor in Council consent, which could otherwise lead to litigation or title disputes.
- **Historical Continuity**: It acknowledges the importance of past land transactions in the development of federal infrastructure and administrative land use, especially in areas like Gatineau and Hull, which are part of the federal district system.
- **Practical Governance**: It allows the Federal District Commission to continue operating and managing land in its jurisdiction without legal impediments arising from outdated procedural requirements.

### **Conclusion**:

This enactment is a **retroactive legal validation** of a land acquisition by the Federal District Commission. By declaring that the 1954 indenture—though not initially approved by the Governor in Council—is to be treated as if it *had* such approval, the Act ensures that the transaction is legally sound, enforceable, and recognized for all future purposes. This serves both as a **practical solution** to a historical procedural gap and as a **formal affirmation** of the Commission’s authority in land management, despite the repeal of the original enabling statute.

> **In essence**: The Act says, *"Even though the 1954 land deal didn't get Cabinet approval at the time, we now treat it as if it did—so it’s valid and binding for all purposes."*
