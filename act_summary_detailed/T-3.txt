**Detailed Summary of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Tax Rebate Discounting Act* is a federal law designed to regulate the practice of **"discounting"** — that is, the sale or transfer of a person’s right to a tax refund by a third party (the "discounter") for a fee. The Act establishes legal safeguards to ensure that such transactions are conducted fairly, transparently, and in a manner that protects the rights of taxpayers (the "clients") and prevents exploitation, fraud, or unfair profit-making.

It applies specifically to the **acquisition and transfer of rights to tax refunds**, including overpayments of income tax, Employment Insurance (EI) premiums, and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, and ensures that the taxpayer (client) retains ultimate entitlement to the refund, even if it is transferred through a discounter.

## **Core Provisions and Key Principles**

### **1. Acquisition of a Right to a Refund (Despite Non-Assignability)**

- A person acquires a right to a refund **even if that right is not normally assignable** under laws like section 67 of the *Financial Administration Act*.  
- This means that even if tax law normally prevents a refund from being transferred, the Act allows the transfer *for the purpose of discounting*, provided it is done in accordance with the rules.

> **Purpose**: To allow legitimate financial arrangements (e.g., tax professionals helping clients manage refunds) without blocking the transfer of rights due to technical legal restrictions.

---

### **2. Enforceability of the Right**

- The right to a refund acquired by a discounter is **enforceable only between the client and the discounter**.
- **No liability** arises between the discounter and Her Majesty (the Crown).
- This protects the taxpayer from being held responsible for the discounter’s actions or financial obligations.

> **Purpose**: To prevent discounter from being personally liable to the government and to ensure accountability remains between client and discounter.

---

### **3. Payment of Refunds by the Minister**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** may pay the refund directly to the discounter **if the discounter has acquired the client’s right to the refund**.
- This payment is **deemed to have been made to the client** at the time it is paid to the discounter.

> **Purpose**: To enable discounter to act as a financial intermediary while maintaining the client’s entitlement to the refund.

---

### **4. Trust for Excess Refund Amounts**

- If the **actual refund amount exceeds**:
  - The interest component of the refund, and  
  - The amount the client was estimated to be entitled to at the time the right was acquired,  
  and the **excess is over $10**, then:
  - That excess is **deemed to be held in trust** by the discounter for the client.
  - The discounter must eventually return this amount to the client or to the **Receiver General**.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that any profit made from the discounting transaction (i.e., the difference between estimated and actual refund) does not go to the discounter, but instead benefits the client.

---

### **5. Trust Amount in Liquidation or Bankruptcy**

- In the event of the **liquidation, assignment, or bankruptcy** of the discounter:
  - The trust amount is **separate from the discounter’s estate**.
  - It is **not included** in the discounter’s assets, even if it was not physically kept apart.

> **Purpose**: To protect the client’s interest in the excess refund, regardless of the discounter’s financial situation.

---

### **6. Minimum Consideration Requirement (Offence if Violated)**

- A discounter who acquires a right to a refund **for less than the minimum consideration** is guilty of an offence.

> **Purpose**: To prevent undercharging and ensure that discounter receives a fair fee for the risk and service involved.

---

### **7. What Constitutes "Consideration"**

- The **discount charged** includes:
  - Any fee or charge levied by the discounter or by a related party (not acting at arm’s length).
  - Fees for preparing the client’s return of income or other services directly tied to the discounting transaction.

> **Purpose**: To prevent hidden or indirect charges from being used to circumvent the minimum consideration rule.

---

### **8. Exception to Minimum Consideration Rule**

- The minimum consideration rule **does not apply** if:
  1. The **consideration paid** at the time of acquisition is **equal to or greater than** the minimum consideration calculated based on the **estimated refund**.
  2. The **actual refund** (excluding interest) exceeds the estimated refund by **$10 or more**.

> In such cases:
- The discounter must **immediately pay** the excess amount to the client **after receiving the refund**.
- If not paid within **30 days**, the discounter must **remit the excess** (plus a true copy of the notice under paragraph 5(b)) to the **Receiver General**, to be held on account of the client’s future tax liability or paid upon request.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that clients are not disadvantaged when the actual refund turns out to be larger than expected.

---

### **9. Mandatory Disclosure and Documentation (Offences if Violated)**

A discounter who fails to meet the following requirements is guilty of an offence:

#### a) **Payment of Minimum Consideration and Disclosure**
- Must pay **cash or cheque** (payable on demand) to the client the difference between:
  - The **full minimum consideration** (based on the estimated refund),
  - And any taxes collected from the client under:
    - The *Excise Tax Act* (Part IX, section 158 — deemed taxable supply),
    - Quebec Sales Tax (Chapter 67 of Quebec Statutes, section 39 — deemed taxable supply).

- Must provide the client with:
  - A **statement in prescribed form** describing the discounting transaction.
  - A **true copy of the client’s return of income** and related information returns (if requested).
  - The client’s **address of record** (for official communications).

> **Purpose**: To ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance with tax obligations.

---

### **10. Filing of Client’s Return of Income (Offence if Violated)**

A discounter who files a client’s return of income without:
- Including a **true copy of the statement** provided to the client (as required under paragraph 9(b)(i)), and  
- Providing that statement to the client **within a period specified by the Minister**,  

is guilty of an offence.

> **Purpose**: To ensure clients are informed and have access to documentation related to their tax returns.

---

### **11. Notice of Assessment and Refund Amount (Offence if Violated)**

A discounter must:
- Send to the client **immediately**:
  - Any **assessment notice** (from the Minister) received regarding the client’s return.
  - A **notice in prescribed form** stating the **actual amount of the refund** received by the discounter (which the client would have otherwise been entitled to).

> **Purpose**: To keep the client informed about tax decisions and refund outcomes.

---

### **12. Access to Records (Offence if Violated)**

Within **three years** of acquiring a right to a refund:
- The discounter must:
  - Maintain at their principal place of business (or designated location) **true copies of**:
    - All documents provided to the client under this Act,
    - All other documents related to the discounting transaction.
  - Allow **reasonable access** to these documents for:
    - Examination by a **peace officer**,
    - Or by a person designated by the Minister or provincial government (for consumer affairs).

> **Purpose**: To ensure accountability, auditability, and consumer protection.

---

### **13. Prohibition of False, Misleading, or Incomplete Information**

Any discounter who knowingly provides to a client or to a person designated under section 6(b):
- False, misleading, or incomplete information, documents, or copies of documents,  

is guilty of an offence.

> **Purpose**: To prevent fraud and misrepresentation in the discounting process.

---

- Any person who commits an offence under this
