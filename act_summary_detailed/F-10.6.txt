### **Detailed Summary of the *Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act***

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
The *Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act* (the "Act") is a comprehensive legislative measure designed to combat **modern slavery**, specifically **forced labour** and **child labour**, in Canada’s supply chains. It aligns Canada with its international obligations under key conventions of the **International Labour Organization (ILO)**:

- **Forced Labour Convention, 1930**  
- **Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957**  
- **Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999**

These conventions define modern slavery as exploitative practices that violate fundamental human rights. The Act reflects Canada’s commitment to uphold these standards and to take concrete domestic action to eliminate forced and child labour across all stages of production, distribution, and importation of goods.
