### **Detailed Summary of the *Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act***

#### **1. Purpose and Citation**
The *Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act* establishes the legal framework governing how **federal real property** (land and buildings) and **federal immovables** (immovable property, including rights associated with it) are granted, transferred, leased, licensed, and managed by the Government of Canada.

#### **3. Authority to Act and Delegation**

- Any Minister may **authorize in writing** an officer in their department, or another department, or a **head of mission abroad**, to exercise any power granted under this Act — including signing instruments.
- This delegation allows for efficient administration, especially in international settings or when dealing with complex or time-sensitive transactions.

---

#### **4. Requirements for Dispositions and Licences**

- **No disposition or lease** of federal real property or immovables may occur **without compliance with this Act**.
- All grants, concessions, leases, or licences must follow the procedures and requirements set out in this Act.

---

#### **5. Methods of Granting or Conceding Property**

Federal property can be granted or immovables conceded in **two primary ways**:

##### **(a) By Letters Patent under the Great Seal**
- The most formal and traditional method.
- Grants or concessions have the **same legal force and effect** as if issued under the Great Seal.

##### **(b) By Instrument or Act (if satisfactory to the Minister of Justice)**
- Any instrument or act that meets the standards set by the **Minister of Justice** may serve as a valid grant or concession.
- These instruments must:
  - Be signed by the **Minister having administration** of the property.
  - Be **countersigned by the Minister of Justice** (except for leases).
- Such instruments have the **same force and effect as letters patent**.

> *Note:* This flexibility allows for tailored legal instruments suited to specific contexts (e.g., land use plans, development agreements), while maintaining the required level of governmental oversight.

---

#### **6. Use of Plans (e.g., for Roads, Utilities, Parks)**

- If a plan (e.g., a municipal or provincial development plan) operates as a transfer or dedication of real property under local law, it **may be used** for federal property **if authorized** by the same authority that would authorize a direct grant or dedication.
- Such plans must:
  - Be signed by the **Minister administering the property**.
  - Be **countersigned by the Minister of Justice**.

---

#### **7. Effect of Grants and Concessions**

- **Rule Abrogated**: The traditional rule that a grant by letters patent takes effect **without delivery** is **overridden**.
- A grant or concession takes effect **only when**:
  - It is delivered **on terms or subject to conditions**: effect occurs upon **satisfaction or removal** of those conditions.
  - Otherwise: effect occurs upon **actual delivery** of the instrument.

> This ensures that property transfers are not automatic and are subject to enforceable conditions, enhancing accountability.

---

#### **8. Absolute Conveyance Without Limitation**

- In provinces other than Quebec, if a transfer instrument lacks limitations (e.g., no restrictions), it operates as an **absolute transfer of all rights** (fee simple).
- Therefore, a grant of federal real property in such provinces **operates as a fee simple or equivalent estate** — even without explicit words of limitation — **if**:
  - Her Majesty has the power to grant a fee simple.
  - No contrary intention is expressed in the instrument.

> This is a significant legal principle that protects the Crown’s ability to convey full ownership in certain circumstances.

---

#### **9. Grants to Her Majesty**

- Her Majesty may **grant federal real property or concede federal immovables to Herself**.
- Any such transfer results in **Her Majesty acquiring administration and control** of the property.
- For transfers outside Canada:
  - The instrument must be signed by the administering Minister and countersigned by the Minister of Justice.
  - Upon acceptance, Her Majesty gains administration and control.

---

#### **10. Restrictions on Covenants or Conditions**

- A lessee, successor, sublessee, assignee, or licensee of federal property **may not** impose any covenant or condition restricting or controlling use of the property **without Governor in Council consent**, except:
  - In favour of **Her Majesty**;
  - A person through whom the interest was derived;
  - In the case of a lessee, a **sublessee or licensee** of that person.

> This protects the Crown’s interest in the property and prevents third parties from imposing undue restrictions.

---

#### **11. Prohibitions on Acquisition**

- **No provincial law** may result in a person acquiring federal real property or immovables.
- **No acquisition by prescription** (long-term possession without title) is allowed.

> Ensures that federal property remains under Crown control and is not subject to private claims based on adverse possession.

---

#### **12. Role of the Minister of Justice**

The Minister of Justice has broad powers to assist in transactions involving federal property:

- **Determine the type and form** of instruments (e.g., deeds, leases).
- **Approve the legal content** of Crown grants or transfers.
- **Effect delivery** of instruments — including conditional delivery.
- **Accept undertakings** from legal professionals (e.g., notaries, solicitors) regarding delivery, payment, or title.

> This ensures legal validity and reduces risk in property transactions.

---

#### **13. Regulatory Powers of the Governor in Council**

The Governor in Council (the Cabinet) may make **regulations** on various matters, including:

- Referral of certain types of transactions to the Minister of Justice for approval.
- Establishment of a **depository** for storing copies of instruments and acts related to federal property (excluding those under the Great Seal).

> These regulations enhance transparency, accountability, and record-keeping.

---

#### **14. Governor in Council’s Authority to Authorize Transactions**

Despite existing laws, the Governor in Council may authorize (on recommendation of the Minister of Justice and Treasury Board) the following:

- **Disposition or lease** of federal property where no other Act provides for it.
- **Acquisition or lease** of real property on behalf of Her Majesty.
- **Grant or transfer of licences** (including between Ministers).
- **Surrender or resiliation** of leases or licences (as lessee or licensor).
- **Transfer of administration** to Her Majesty in any right other than Canada (in perpetuity or for a term).
- **Acceptance** of transfers of administration from Her Majesty abroad.
- **Transfer of administration** between Ministers, agents, or agent corporations.
- **Grant of property** to a corporation that administers the property or to a person designated by that corporation.
- **Grant to Her Majesty** (self-grant).
- **Dedication** of property for public purposes (roads, utilities, parks).
- **Acceptance or release of security** (mortgages, hypothecs) related to transactions.

> This gives the federal government significant flexibility in managing property across diverse scenarios.

---

#### **15. Regulatory Authority (Expanded Scope)**

The Governor in Council may also make regulations on:

- Disposition or lease of property (where no other law applies).
- Acquisition or lease of property
