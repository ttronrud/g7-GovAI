### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act**

---

#### **Overview**

The **Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act** is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation enacted by the Government of Canada to strengthen its climate action framework, enhance transparency, and ensure accountability in achieving **net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050**. It builds upon Canada’s international commitments under the **Paris Agreement** and institutionalizes a structured, science-based, and inclusive process for setting and tracking national emissions targets at key milestones.

This Act establishes clear obligations for the federal government to set progressively more ambitious emissions targets, develop detailed implementation plans, conduct regular assessments, and engage stakeholders—including Indigenous peoples and experts—while ensuring public access to information and democratic oversight.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legislative Context**

- **Primary Objective**: To require the setting of **national greenhouse gas emissions targets** based on the best available scientific evidence and to promote **transparency, accountability, and timely action** toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
- **Scientific Foundation**: The Act acknowledges that climate change is driven by human activities and poses significant risks to health, ecosystems, biodiversity, and economic stability.
- **International Commitment**: Canada ratified the **Paris Agreement (2015)**, which aims to limit global warming to **well below 2°C**, ideally **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that achieving **net-zero emissions by 2050** is essential to meet the 1.5°C goal.
- **Domestic Commitment**: Canada has committed to **exceeding its 2030 nationally determined contribution (NDC)** under the Paris Agreement.

> The Act ensures that Canada’s domestic policy aligns with both international obligations and domestic climate goals.

### **2. Definitions**

Key terms are clearly defined:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Convention** | United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 1992 |
| **Emissions Reduction Plan** | A detailed plan outlining how Canada will achieve a specific emissions target |
| **Indigenous Knowledge** | Traditional, place-based knowledge of Indigenous peoples of Canada |
| **Indigenous Peoples of Canada** | As defined in Section 35(2) of the *Constitution Act, 1982* (i.e., aboriginal peoples) |
| **Milestone Year** | 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045 |
| **Minister** | Initially the Minister of the Environment; may be designated to another federal minister |
| **Net-Zero Emissions** | Anthropogenic GHG emissions are balanced by anthropogenic removals over a specified period |

---

### **3. National Emissions Target: Net-Zero by 2050**

- The **national target for 2050 is net-zero emissions**.
- **Flexibility Clause**: Nothing in the Act prevents Canada from achieving net-zero **before 2050**—allowing for early success.
- The target is progressive: each milestone year (2030–2045) must represent an **ambitious step forward** from the previous one.

---

### **4. Emissions Targets for Milestone Years**

| Year | Deadline for Setting Target |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 2030 | As per Canada’s most recent NDC under the Paris Agreement |
| 2035 | No later than **December 1, 2024** |
| 2040 | No later than **December 1, 2029** |
| 2045 | No later than **December 1, 2034** |

> These deadlines ensure that Canada makes tangible progress toward net-zero, with a clear timeline for accountability.

---

### **5. High-Level Descriptions and Projections**

- Within **one year** of setting a target after 2030, the Minister must publish a **high-level description** of:
  - Key emissions reduction measures the government intends to take
  - Projected annual GHG emissions reductions, considering the combined impact of those measures
- This description mirrors the format of Canada’s **NDC submissions** to the UNFCCC, ensuring consistency with international reporting.

---

### **6. Setting Emissions Targets: Guiding Principles**

When establishing a target, the Minister must consider:
- The **best scientific information** available (including IPCC findings)
- Canada’s **international commitments** (especially under the Paris Agreement)
- **Indigenous Knowledge** (as a vital component of climate understanding and adaptation)
- Submissions and advice from the **Net-Zero Advisory Body** (established under Section 13)

> This ensures that decisions are grounded in science, equity, and inclusivity.

---

### **7. Emissions Reduction Plans (ERPs)**

Each emissions target requires a **detailed emissions reduction plan**.

#### **Mandatory Requirements for an ERP**:
- The **emissions target** for the year it relates to
- Summary of Canada’s **most recent official GHG inventory** and international submissions
- Description of **key measures** (e.g., clean energy transitions, energy efficiency, transportation shifts)
- How **international commitments** are integrated
- **Sectoral strategies** (e.g., transportation, agriculture, buildings)
- **Federal government operations strategies** (e.g., reducing emissions from federal buildings, fleets)
- **Projected timetable** for implementation of each measure
- **Projections of annual emission reductions** by sector
- **Summary of cooperative measures** with provinces, municipalities, and Indigenous governments

#### **Additional Requirements**:
- The plan must explain **how it contributes to net-zero by 2050**
- May include information on **private sector, provincial, or Indigenous initiatives** contributing to emissions reductions

#### **Timeline for Development**:
- **2030 ERP** must be established within **six months** of the Act coming into force
- **Subsequent ERPs** must be developed at least **five years before** the year they relate to
- The Minister may **extend deadlines by up to 90 days** with public justification

#### **Consultation Requirement**:
- The Minister must **consult with other federal ministers** responsible for relevant sectors
- Must provide **opportunities for public and stakeholder submissions**, including:
  - Provinces
  - Indigenous peoples
  - The Net-Zero Advisory Body
  - Experts and interested parties
