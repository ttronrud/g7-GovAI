**Detailed Summary of the *Lobbying Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Lobbying Act* is a Canadian federal law enacted to ensure **transparency, accountability, and public trust** in the relationship between individuals, organizations, and public office holders. It establishes a **mandatory registration and reporting system for paid lobbyists**, while preserving the principle of **free and open access to government**. The Act balances the legitimate right of individuals and groups to influence public policy with the public interest in knowing who is attempting to influence decisions made by government officials.

---

## **Key Principles and Background (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with four foundational principles:

1. **Free and open access to government** is a matter of public interest — ensuring that citizens can engage with public institutions without undue influence.
2. **Lobbying is a legitimate activity** — the Act recognizes that individuals and organizations have a right to advocate for their interests.
3. **Transparency is desirable** — both public office holders and the public should be able to know who is engaging in lobbying activities.
4. **Registration should not impede open access** — the system must not create barriers to public discourse or legitimate advocacy.

These principles guide the design of the Act, ensuring that transparency is achieved without restricting free expression or democratic participation.
