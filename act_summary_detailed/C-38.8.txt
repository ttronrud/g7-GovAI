**Detailed Summary of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA) is a foundational piece of Canadian federal legislation enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. It establishes a comprehensive legal framework for regulating the production, possession, distribution, and use of **controlled substances** — drugs classified into five schedules based on their potential for abuse, medical utility, and risk to public health and safety.

This Act is primarily responsible for preventing illicit drug trafficking, misuse, and diversion from legitimate medical or scientific purposes. It also includes provisions aimed at addressing the social and health dimensions of drug use, emphasizing public health over punitive measures where appropriate.
