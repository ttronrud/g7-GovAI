Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the provided text, focusing on definitions, key principles, and structural elements relevant to the Act as currently drafted and interpreted (with note that several definitions and provisions have been **repealed or updated** over time).

## 🔍 **Overview of the Excise Tax Act**

The Act may be cited as the **Excise Tax Act**, and it establishes the legal framework for the imposition, collection, and administration of excise taxes on specific goods and services in Canada. While the full scope of the Act extends beyond what is provided here (notably including Parts IX to XII and Schedules V to X), the excerpt focuses on **definitions, key tax principles, and special rules** that apply to various categories of goods and persons involved in their manufacture, importation, sale, and distribution.

> ⚠️ **Important Note on Repeals**:  
> Many of the definitions and terms listed (e.g., *cigarette*, *cigar*, *black stock*, *Atlantic manufactured tobacco*, *licensed tobacco manufacturer*) have been **repealed** since 2001–2002 due to changes in tobacco regulation, public health policy, or legislative modernization. These are not currently in force. The current excise regime for tobacco and related products is governed by updated laws, including the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act* and related regulations.

### 14. **Related Persons / Association Rules**  
These rules determine whether entities are treated as part of a single economic unit for tax purposes.

#### Key Principles:
- **Related persons are not deemed to deal at arm’s length** — meaning tax authorities may scrutinize transactions between related parties for fairness.
- Whether a transaction is at arm’s length is a **question of fact**, determined by the circumstances.
- **"Related"** is defined under the *Income Tax Act* (subsections 251(2) to (6)), with modifications:
  - "Corporation" includes **corporations or partnerships**.
  - "Shares" or "shareholders" are read as **rights or partners** in a partnership.
- A **corporation is associated** with another if they are linked under subsections 256(1)–(6) of the Income Tax Act.
- A **person (non-corporate)** is associated with a corporation if the corporation is **controlled** by that person or a group of persons who are mutually associated.
- A person is associated with:
  - A **partnership** if their share of profits exceeds half of total profits.
  - A **trust** if their interest in the trust exceeds half of total value.
- A person is associated with another if both are associated with a **third party**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Prevents tax avoidance through artificial separation of entities and ensures that related parties are taxed fairly.

- **Purpose**: Prevents tax evasion by ensuring that tax is paid on goods that are effectively distributed or used.

---

- A determination by the Minister that a body is a "municipality" may be **retroactive**.
- It comes into force **no more than four years before** the date of the determination.

  - Excise or duty laws,
- Shall **not include** a reference to refunds or reliefs under **Part IX** (which likely deals with special tax regimes such as tax credits or exemptions).
