**Detailed Summary of the *Food and Drugs Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Food and Drugs Act* (Act) is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation that regulates the safety, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, distribution, and use of **food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices**. It establishes legal standards to protect public health by ensuring that these products are safe, properly labeled, and not misleadingly marketed. The Act applies to all goods falling within its definitions and is administered by the **Minister of Health**, with enforcement carried out by the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** through inspectors and analysts.

This Act does **not apply** to certain products such as **tobacco products** or **vaping products** (as defined in the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act*), unless those products are used for medical purposes (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease).

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

The Act begins by defining core terms that determine which products fall under its jurisdiction:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Food** | Any article intended for human consumption, including chewing gum and ingredients mixed with food. Includes foods for special dietary purposes (e.g., for diabetes or allergies). |
| **Drug** | Substances used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, or prevent disease; restore or modify organic functions; or disinfect food preparation areas. |
| **Cosmetic** | Substances used to cleanse, improve, or alter skin, hair, teeth, or complexion (e.g., deodorants, perfumes). |
| **Device** | Instruments or apparatuses used in diagnosing, treating, preventing, or modifying diseases, symptoms, or body functions in humans or animals. Excludes devices that act solely via pharmacological, immunological, or chemical means. |
| **Therapeutic Product** | A drug or device, or a combination of both. |
| **Advanced Therapeutic Product** | A drug or device described in **Schedule G** or belonging to a class defined in that schedule (e.g., gene therapies, cell therapies). |
| **Clinical Trial** | Human studies designed to evaluate the effects of a drug, device, or food for a specific condition. |
| **Confidential Business Information (CBI)** | Non-public business data that has economic value and whose disclosure would cause financial harm to the owner or benefit competitors. Protected under regulations. |
| **Contraceptive Device** | Any instrument (non-drug) used to prevent conception. |
| **Package** | Any container or wrapper in which a food, drug, cosmetic, or device is contained. |
| **Label** | Any legend, word, or mark attached to, included in, or accompanying a product or package. |
| **Unsanitary Conditions** | Conditions that could contaminate food, drugs, or cosmetics or render them injurious to health. |

## **Regulatory Framework and Jurisdiction**

### **1. Classification of Products (Schedule A)**  
The Act uses **Schedule A** to classify products into four categories based on their function:

- **Part 1 of Schedule A** → Falls under **food**  
- **Part 2 of Schedule A** → Falls under **drug**  
- **Part 3 of Schedule A** → Falls under **cosmetic**  
- **Part 4 of Schedule A** → Falls under **device**

> If a product fits into **two or more categories**, the **Minister of Health** may, by **order**, assign it to one of the four parts of Schedule A. This decision is based on several factors:
> - Risk to human health  
> - Public health protection  
> - Potential for deception or misrepresentation  
> - Purpose and history of use  
> - How similar products have been regulated  

> The Minister may also **remove** a product or class from a part of Schedule A if deemed no longer appropriate.

## **Prohibited Advertising and Marketing Practices**

### **1. Prohibition on Misleading Claims (Section 2.1)**  
No person may:
- Advertise any food, drug, cosmetic, or device to the public as a **treatment, prevention, or cure** for any disease, disorder, or abnormal physical state listed in **Schedule A.1**.

> This includes claims like “cures cancer” or “prevents heart disease” without scientific backing.

### **2. Prohibition on Misrepresentation in Labels or Sales**  
No person may sell a product if:
- It is labeled as a treatment, prevention, or cure for a disease listed in Schedule A.1; **or**
- It is advertised to the public in that way.

### **3. Restrictions on Contraceptive Devices and Drugs for Conception Prevention**  
- **No general advertising** of contraceptive devices or drugs intended to prevent conception, **unless authorized by regulation**.

> This prevents misleading or unregulated promotion of reproductive health products.

---

## **Clinical Trials (Section 3.1)**

### **Requirements for Clinical Trials**  
- A person conducting a clinical trial involving a **drug, device, or food for special dietary purposes** must hold a valid **therapeutic product authorization** issued under regulations.

> This authorization includes approval for:
> - Conducting the trial
> - Importing, selling, advertising, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, or testing the product

### **Compliance with Authorization Terms**  
- Holders of such authorizations must comply with **all terms and conditions** set by the Minister under regulations (e.g., safety protocols, data reporting).

### **Public Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information**  
- The holder must make **prescribed information** about the trial publicly available **within a prescribed time** and **in a prescribed manner** (e.g., on a government website).

A drug is prohibited from being sold if:
- It was made, prepared, preserved, packaged, or stored under **unsanitary conditions**

## **Labeling, Packaging, and Advertising Rules**

### **General Rule: No False, Misleading, or Deceptive Claims**

## **Standards for Food and Drug Identification**

### **Prescribed Standards**  
When a standard is prescribed for a food or drug:
- No person may **import, send between provinces, or possess** an article likely to be mistaken for that food/drug **unless it complies with the standard**.

> **Exception**: Operators or carriers of conveyances (e.g., trucks, ships) are exempt **only if they could have reasonably known** the transfer would violate the standard.

- No person may **label, package, sell, or advertise** a product that is:
  - Imported  
  - Sent between provinces  
  - Intended to be sent between provinces  
  in a way that makes it **likely to be mistaken for** the prescribed food or drug — unless it complies with the standard.

> The **Governor in Council** may, by regulation, identify a standard as **necessary to prevent consumer injury**. If so, compliance with that standard becomes mandatory.
