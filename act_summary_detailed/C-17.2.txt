**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Gender Budgeting Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Gender Budgeting Act* is a foundational piece of legislation introduced to ensure that Canada’s fiscal and policy decisions are systematically informed by gender and diversity considerations. It establishes a formal, transparent, and accountable framework for integrating gender and diversity analysis into the federal budget process and public spending decisions. The Act reflects a commitment to building an inclusive, equitable, and economically resilient society where all individuals—regardless of gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, or other identity factors—can contribute to their full potential.

### **Policy Objectives and Principles**

The Act is grounded in four core principles:

1. **Promotion of Gender Equality and Inclusiveness**  
   The Government of Canada commits to advancing gender equality and greater inclusiveness as an integral part of the annual federal budget. This includes ensuring that economic policies and public investments support the full participation of all Canadians in the economy.

2. **Incorporation of Gender and Diversity in Policy and Resource Allocation**  
   All taxation, public spending, and transfer programs (e.g., social benefits, grants, subsidies) must be evaluated for their differential impacts on various groups based on gender and other identity factors. This includes direct spending and financial transfers to individuals and to other levels of government (provincial and territorial).

3. **Transparency and Public Accountability**  
   The Government is required to provide accessible, public information on how its policies and expenditures affect different groups in terms of gender and diversity. This transparency strengthens democratic accountability and enables citizens and stakeholders to understand and engage with government decision-making.

4. **Capacity Building and Expertise**  
   The Act strengthens the institutional capacity of designated federal departments to conduct gender and diversity impact assessments. This is achieved through the provision of guidance, best practices, and expert support from the **Minister for Women and Gender Equality**, ensuring that gender-responsive analysis becomes a standard practice in budget development.
