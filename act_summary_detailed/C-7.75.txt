**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act* (the "Act") is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that governs the incorporation, operation, and regulation of **corporations without share capital**—commonly known as not-for-profit corporations. It provides a legal framework for the formation, governance, and accountability of such entities, particularly those engaged in charitable, educational, cultural, social, or community-based activities.

This Act does **not** apply to profit-seeking businesses or entities governed by other specific statutes (e.g., banks, insurance companies, cooperatives), and it is designed to **support non-profit organizations** by enabling them to operate legally and transparently while imposing reasonable obligations on governance and financial accountability.
