### **1. Background and Purpose**

#### **Key Provisions (Whereas Clauses):**
- **Aboriginal Title Recognition**:  
  The Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area have asserted an **aboriginal title** to their traditional and current lands, waters, and land-fast ice based on their long-standing use, occupation, and customs. This assertion is rooted in Inuit traditions and practices, which have sustained their way of life for generations.

- **Constitutional Recognition**:  
  The *Constitution Act, 1982* (specifically Section 35) recognizes and affirms the existing **aboriginal and treaty rights** of Indigenous peoples in Canada. This Act ensures that the land claims process is constitutionally grounded.

- **Agreement Objectives**:  
  The Agreement was negotiated to achieve several key goals:
  - Provide **certainty and clarity** regarding ownership, use of land and resources, and Inuit participation in decision-making (including offshore areas).
  - Grant Inuit **wildlife harvesting rights** and the right to participate in decisions about wildlife management.
  - Provide **financial compensation** and access to **economic opportunities**.
  - Promote **self-reliance**, **cultural preservation**, and **social well-being** among Inuit communities.

- **Surrender of Claims**:  
  In exchange for these benefits, the Inuit formally **surrender certain claims, rights, title, and interests** in the Nunavut Settlement Area. This is a voluntary and legally binding exchange.

- **Land Claims Agreement Status**:  
  The Agreement is explicitly classified as a **land claims agreement under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, giving it constitutional standing and priority over conflicting laws.

- **Ratification**:  
  The Inuit have ratified the Agreement in accordance with its internal provisions. The ratification by Her Majesty (the Crown) under **Article 36** of the Agreement requires the enactment of this statute by Parliament.
