**Detailed Summary of the *First Nations Elections Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *First Nations Elections Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to establish a clear, transparent, and accountable framework for the democratic election of chiefs and councillors within participating First Nations. The Act aims to strengthen governance, ensure fair electoral processes, and protect the integrity of elections by setting out rules on nominations, voting, conduct, dispute resolution, and the removal of elected officials.

It was introduced to address long-standing concerns about leadership disputes, lack of electoral transparency, and inconsistent governance practices among First Nations. The Act provides a balance between respecting First Nations self-governance and ensuring federal oversight through standardized procedures.

The Act came into force on **April 2, 2015**, and is currently in effect, with some provisions subject to future amendments or repeals (e.g., a 2023 repeal of certain sections noted in the text).

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Definitions**

The Act begins with a comprehensive set of definitions that establish key terms used throughout the legislation:

- **First Nation**: Defined as a "band" under subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*.
- **Council**: Refers to the governing body of a First Nation, consisting of one chief and councillors.
- **Elector**: A registered member of a First Nation (on the Band List) who is 18 years or older on the relevant date (election, nomination, or vote).
- **Electoral Officer**: A person appointed by regulation to oversee elections.
- **Deputy Electoral Officer**: A supporting officer appointed under regulation.
- **Election**: Refers to the election of the chief and councillors, including by-elections.
- **Member**: A person whose name appears or is entitled to appear on the Band List.
- **Minister**: The Minister of Indigenous Services.
- **Nomination Meeting**: A gathering to formally nominate candidates.
- **Participating First Nation**: A First Nation listed in the Schedule; only these are covered by the Act.
- **Reserve**: As defined in the *Indian Act*.

These definitions ensure consistency and clarity in interpreting the Act across different contexts.

### **2. Inclusion of First Nations in the Schedule**

The Minister may add a First Nation to the **Schedule of Participating First Nations** under three conditions:

1. **Request by Council**: The First Nation’s council submits a resolution requesting inclusion.
2. **Protracted Leadership Dispute**: The Minister determines that a leadership dispute has significantly impaired governance.
3. **Governor in Council Intervention**: An election was set aside under *section 79 of the Indian Act* due to corrupt practices.

> **Important Notes**:
> - The order must specify the **date of the first election** for that First Nation.
> - Incumbent chiefs and councillors **continue in office until the first election date**.
> - Subsection 7(1) (which normally requires elections to be held at fixed intervals) **does not apply** to the council in office at the time of the order.

**Change in Name**: If a First Nation changes its name, the Minister may amend the schedule accordingly.

### **3. Timing of Elections**

The Act sets strict timelines for when elections must occur:

#### **For First Nations added under paragraph 3(1)(a)** (request by council):
- Election must occur **on or before**:
  - The day when, **but for the Minister’s order**, the term of office would have expired.
  - **OR**, if the council requests a **common election date** with five or more other First Nations, then **one year after** the earliest expiration date (but for the order).

#### **For First Nations added under paragraphs 3(1)(b) or (c)** (due to leadership disputes or corruption):
- Election must occur **within six months** of the order being made.

#### **Subsequent Elections**:
- Must be held **within 30 days before** the expiration of the incumbent chief and councillors’ term (except for by-elections).

This ensures timely democratic transitions and prevents prolonged vacancies.

  - One **chief**
  - One **councillor for every 100 members** of the First Nation
