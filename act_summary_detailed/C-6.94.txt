**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Mongolia Tax Convention Act, 2002***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–Mongolia Tax Convention Act, 2002* is a legislative instrument that enables Canada to implement the **Canada–Mongolia Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital**, which was signed on December 20, 2002, and entered into force on that date. The Act provides the legal framework in Canada for giving effect to the Convention, ensuring that tax rules are applied in a manner that avoids double taxation and prevents tax evasion between Canada and Mongolia.

This Act is not a standalone tax law but rather a **convention implementation statute**, which grants legal force and authority to the tax treaty between the two countries.
