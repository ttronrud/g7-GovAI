**Detailed Summary of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA)**

---

### **1. Introduction and Citation**
The *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA) is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that governs immigration and refugee protection. It is enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. The Act may be cited as the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.

This comprehensive law establishes the legal framework for how Canada manages immigration, processes refugee claims, and ensures the integrity, fairness, and human rights compliance of its immigration and refugee systems.

### **2. Key Definitions**
The Act defines several key terms used throughout:

- **Board**: Refers to the *Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)*, which consists of four divisions:
  - Refugee Protection Division
  - Refugee Appeal Division
  - Immigration Division
  - Immigration Appeal Division  
  (The IRB is responsible for adjudicating refugee claims and immigration appeals.)

- **Convention Against Torture (CAT)**: Refers to the international treaty adopted in 1984, which prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 1 of the CAT is incorporated into the Act via a schedule.

### **7. Legislative Process and Public Consultation**
- **Proposal and Review**: Before finalizing any regulation under sections 17, 32, 53, 61, 87.2, 102, 116, 150, or 150.1, the Minister must:
  - Lay a copy before **both Houses of Parliament**.
  - Refer the regulation to the relevant parliamentary committee.
- Once laid, the regulation does **not need to be re-laid** even if amended.
- The regulation may be issued **at any time after** it has been laid before Parliament.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and democratic oversight of immigration policy.

### **8. Designation of Officers and Delegation**
- The Minister may designate individuals or classes of persons as **officers** to carry out duties under the Act, specifying their powers and responsibilities.
- The Minister may authorize any person to act on their behalf **without requiring proof of authorization authenticity** (e.g., digital or written authorization).
- **Exception**: The Minister **cannot delegate** certain critical powers, including:
  - Section 20.1(1) (designating foreign nationals)
  - Section 22.1 (refugee claims)
  - Sections 42.1(1) and (2) (security-related decisions)
  - Section 77(1) (removal decisions)

### **9. International Agreements**
- The Minister (with Governor in Council approval) may enter into:
  - Agreements with **foreign governments**.
  - Agreements with **international organizations**.
  - Agreements with **provincial governments**.

> The Minister must publish **annually** a list of all active federal-provincial agreements.

---

### **10. Federal-Provincial Agreements and Immigrant Selection**
Federal-provincial agreements must be consistent with:
- The selection and sponsorship of foreign nationals.
- Regulations governing application examination and financial criteria.

#### Key Provisions:
- If a province has **sole responsibility** for selecting permanent residents:
  - The foreign national is granted status **only if they meet provincial selection criteria**.
  - Status is **denied** if they fail to meet those criteria.
  - The number of permanent residents is limited by provincial laws (e.g., maximum or estimated quotas).
  - Provincial conditions (e.g., language, housing, employment) have the **same legal force** as if established under federal law.

- If a province sets **financial criteria** for sponsorship:
  - A sponsor **cannot appeal** a provincial rejection based on financial failure **except on humanitarian and compassionate grounds**.
  - This prevents duplication of appeals and ensures provincial autonomy in financial assessments.

> This reflects a shared responsibility model where provinces play a key role in regional immigration planning.

---

### **11. Consultation with Provinces**
The Minister must:
- Consult with provincial governments on:
  - Immigration and refugee protection policies.
  - The **annual number** of foreign nationals to become permanent residents.
  - Distribution across regions, based on **economic and demographic needs**.
  - Measures to facilitate integration into Canadian society.
