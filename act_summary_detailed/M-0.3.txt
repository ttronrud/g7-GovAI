The provided text appears to be a **partial or corrupted enactment** of a Canadian Act of Parliament, but it contains **no substantive provisions**—only repeated lines stating:

> "[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 69]"

This indicates that the **entire document has been repealed** by **Bill C-26, 2017**, which received royal assent on **April 27, 2017**, and came into force on **May 28, 2017**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Document**
The text begins with a standard legislative preamble:
> *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*

This is the formal opening of a Canadian Act of Parliament, indicating that the legislation was passed through the normal legislative process—approved by both chambers of Parliament and given royal assent.

However, **no actual laws, sections, or provisions** are included in the body of the text. Instead, there are **36 repeated entries** of:
> "[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 69]"

#### 2. **Meaning of "[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 69]"**
- **Repealed**: The provision or section is no longer in force.
- **2017**: The year the repeal was enacted.
- **c. 26**: Refers to **Bill C-26**, the *Budget Act, 2017* (also known as the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017*).
- **s. 69**: Section 69 of that bill.

This means that **all provisions** previously contained in the original act (which is now missing from the text) were **specifically repealed by Section 69 of Bill C-26, 2017**.

#### 3. **What Was Repealed?**
Although the original act is not visible in the provided text, the fact that it was repealed under **Section 69 of C-26** suggests that it was likely a **previously enacted law**—possibly a statute related to:
- Taxation
- Financial regulation
- Public administration
- Environmental policy
- Or some other area of governance

Since the repeal occurred in **2017**, and C-26 was a major budget-related bill, it is likely that the repealed act was **outdated, redundant, or inconsistent** with new fiscal or administrative priorities.

#### 4. **Context of Bill C-26, 2017**
Bill C-26, 2017, also known as the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017*, was introduced to:
- Implement the federal budget for 2017–2018
- Introduce new tax measures
- Adjust regulations and procedures in response to fiscal policy changes
- Repeal or amend outdated laws

Section 69 of this bill specifically targeted the **repeal of certain outdated or obsolete provisions**, likely to streamline legislation and improve clarity in the legal framework.
