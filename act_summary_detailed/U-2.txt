**Detailed Summary of the United Nations Act**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is titled the *United Nations Act* and may be cited as such. This legislation establishes Canada’s legal framework for implementing decisions made by the United Nations Security Council, particularly those involving non-military measures, in accordance with the UN Charter.

---

### **2. Legal Basis and Triggering Mechanism**
The primary authority under this Act is derived from **Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations**, which empowers the Security Council to decide on measures (not involving the use of armed force) to enforce its resolutions. These measures may include:
- Economic sanctions (e.g., complete or partial interruption of trade)
- Interruption of transport and communication systems (rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, etc.)
- Severance of diplomatic relations

When the **Security Council** determines that such measures are necessary and issues a formal decision calling on member states—including Canada—to apply them, the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) may issue **orders and regulations** to implement those measures in Canada.

> **Key Point**: The Act enables Canada to legally respond to Security Council decisions by creating domestic laws and administrative measures to enforce compliance with international obligations.

---

### **3. Powers of the Governor in Council**
The Governor in Council has broad discretion to:
- Make **orders and regulations** necessary or expedient to ensure the effective application of the Security Council’s measures.
- These orders may include:
  - Prohibiting certain imports or exports
  - Restricting financial transactions
  - Banning travel or communication with designated entities
  - Enforcing restrictions on communication infrastructure

The regulations must be **practical, proportionate, and directly related** to the measure required by the Security Council.

---

### **4. Offences and Penalties for Non-Compliance**
Any individual who **contravenes** an order or regulation made under this Act commits an offence. Penalties are tiered based on the nature of the violation:

#### **(a) Summary Conviction (Less Serious Offences)**
- Fine of **not more than $100,000**
- Or imprisonment for **up to one year**
- Or both

#### **(b) Conviction on Indictment (More Serious Offences)**
- Imprisonment for **up to 10 years**

> This reflects a balance between deterrence and proportionality, recognizing that violations may range from minor breaches to significant acts of non-compliance with international obligations.

---

### **5. Forfeiture of Property**
Any property used or involved in contravening an order or regulation under this Act may be:
- **Seized and detained**
- Subject to **forfeiture** at the instance of the **Minister of Justice**

Forfeiture proceedings may be initiated in:
- The **Federal Court**
- Any **superior court** (i.e., provincial or federal courts with jurisdiction)

Courts may establish **rules of procedure** to govern how these forfeiture actions proceed, ensuring fairness and due process.

> This provision provides a mechanism to remove assets that support or facilitate non-compliance, thereby strengthening enforcement.

---

### **6. Parliamentary Scrutiny and Transparency**
All orders and regulations made under this Act must be:
- **Laid before Parliament forthwith** after being issued
- If Parliament is not sitting at the time, they must be laid before it **as soon as the next session begins**

This ensures **transparency and democratic accountability**, allowing members of Parliament to review and debate the measures before they take effect.

---

### **7. Parliamentary Power to Annul Orders/Regulations**
If, within **forty days** of an order or regulation being laid before Parliament:
- **Both the Senate and the House of Commons** pass a resolution declaring the order or regulation to be **annulled**,  
then the order or regulation **ceases to have effect**.

> **Important Notes**:
- The annulment is **only effective if both chambers vote unanimously** within the 40-day window.
- The annulment **does not affect**:
  - Any prior actions or decisions taken under the measure
  - Any offences committed or punishments already imposed
- This protects the integrity of past conduct and legal consequences while allowing for democratic review.

> This provision balances international obligations with domestic parliamentary sovereignty and checks on executive power.

---

### **8. Interpretation of Article 41 of the UN Charter (Included in Schedule)**
The Act includes a **schedule** that sets out the full text of **Article 41 of the UN Charter**, which outlines:
- The Security Council’s authority to adopt non-military measures
- The power to call upon member states to apply such measures
- Examples of such measures (e.g., economic sanctions, communication disruptions, severance of diplomatic ties)

This inclusion ensures that the domestic law is directly tied to the international legal basis, providing clarity and legal grounding for Canadian implementation.

---

### **Practical Implications**

- It enables swift, coordinated responses to global crises through **domestic legal tools**.
- It reinforces Canada’s role as a responsible and law-abiding member of the United Nations system.

---

### **Limitations and Constraints**

- The Act **does not authorize the use of armed force**—only non-military measures.
- Enforcement is **limited to measures approved by the Security Council** under Article 41.
- The **40-day parliamentary review period** provides a check on executive power but may delay implementation in urgent situations.

It strikes a balance between upholding international obligations and respecting domestic legal and constitutional principles. By providing clear mechanisms for enforcement, penalties, and review, the Act ensures that Canada can act responsibly and effectively within the framework of multilateral international law.

> **In essence**: This Act gives Canada the legal tools to carry out international sanctions as directed by the UN Security Council, with safeguards to ensure accountability, transparency, and democratic oversight.
