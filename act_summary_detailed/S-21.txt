**Detailed Summary of the *Publication of Statutes Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Publication of Statutes Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislative legislation that establishes the official procedures for the **publication, certification, distribution, and preservation of statutes**—both those from historical provincial legislatures and those enacted by the Parliament of Canada. Although the Act has been largely **repealed or superseded** (notably in 1999), its provisions historically provided the legal framework for how laws were officially recorded, authenticated, and disseminated across Canada. This summary provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of its key provisions, context, and significance.

### **Key Definitions and Key Entities**

- **"Minister"** refers to the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**, a role central to overseeing public administration and service delivery, including the implementation of statutory publishing procedures.

- **"Clerk of the Parliaments"** is the official responsible for maintaining and certifying the records of all Acts passed by:
  - The former provincial legislatures of **Upper Canada**, **Lower Canada**, or the **Province of Canada** (before Confederation),
  - And the **Parliament of Canada** after Confederation.

  This office is distinct from the Clerk of the Senate and functions as the **custodian and certifier of official legislative texts**.

### **Core Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Custody and Record-Keeping of Acts**
> *"All original Acts passed by the Legislatures of the former Provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, or of the former Province of Canada, transferred to and deposited of record in the office of the Clerk of the Senate, and all original Acts of the Parliament of Canada assented to by the Governor General, shall be and continue to remain of record in the custody of the Clerk of the Senate of Canada, who shall be known and designated as the Clerk of the Parliaments."*

- This provision establishes the **legal and archival responsibility** of the Clerk of the Parliaments to maintain a complete, official record of all pre-Confederation and post-Confederation Acts.
- Acts from the former provinces (Upper and Lower Canada) were transferred to the Senate Clerk’s office upon Confederation, forming a historical continuity of legislative records.
- The Clerk of the Parliaments becomes the **sole official repository** for these statutes.

> **Significance**: Ensures continuity and legal validity of legislation, especially in cases involving historical interpretation or legal challenges.

#### **2. Certification of Acts by the Clerk of the Parliaments**
> *"The Clerk of the Parliaments shall have a seal of office and shall affix the seal to certified copies of all Acts required to be produced before courts of justice, either within or outside Canada, and in any other case in which the Clerk of the Parliaments considers it expedient."*

- The Clerk is empowered to **certify official copies** of Acts for use in **legal proceedings**, both domestic and international.
- The **seal of office** adds formal legal weight to certified copies, making them **binding and authoritative** in judicial contexts.
- The Clerk may issue certifications beyond court use if deemed necessary (e.g., for historical, administrative, or public access purposes).

> **Significance**: Provides a mechanism for ensuring the authenticity and legal standing of legislative texts in court and other official settings.

#### **3. Legal Effect of Certified Copies**
> *"All copies of the Acts certified by the Clerk of the Parliaments pursuant to section 4 shall be held to be duplicate originals and to be evidence of those Acts and of their contents as if printed under the authority of Parliament by the Queen’s Printer."*

- A certified copy is **treated as legally equivalent to an original printed version** issued by the Queen’s Printer.
- This means that **no distinction is made** between a certified copy and a printed statute in terms of legal validity.
- This provision strengthens the **legal enforceability** of statutes, even when not physically printed.

> **Note**: This clause was **repealed in 1999** (under *c. 31, s. 195*), indicating that modern legislation has moved away from such formalistic certification.

---

#### **4. Provision of Certified Copies to Public and Private Parties**
> *"The Clerk of the Parliaments shall furnish certified copies of any of the Acts mentioned in section 3 to any department of the federal public administration or the public service of any province or to any person applying for a copy..."*

- The Clerk is required to **provide certified copies** to:
  - Federal and provincial government departments,
  - Public service officials,
  - Individuals seeking access to legislation.

> **Fee Structure**:
- A **fee of $2** is charged **in addition to**:
  - The cost of printing a physical copy (if provided), or
  - A fee of **10 cents per 100 words** if the copy is not printed.

> **Significance**: Establishes a **fee-based access model** for public information, balancing accessibility with administrative costs.

#### **5. Certificate of Authenticity on Every Certified Copy**
> *"The Clerk of the Parliaments shall insert at the foot of every copy of an Act required to be certified pursuant to section 7, a written certificate, duly signed and authenticated by him, to the effect that it is a true copy of the Act passed by Parliament, or by the Legislature of the former Province of Canada, or of the former Province of Upper Canada or Lower Canada, as the case may be, in the session thereof held in the year of Her Majesty’s reign, and assented to in Her Majesty’s name by the Governor General or, as the case may be, on the day of [insert date]."*

  - The **year of the session** (in the reign of the monarch),
  - The **legislative body** (Parliament of Canada or one of the former provinces),
  - The **date of royal assent**.

> **Significance**: Provides **legal certainty and transparency** about the origin and authenticity of the statute. This certificate acts as a formal attestation.
