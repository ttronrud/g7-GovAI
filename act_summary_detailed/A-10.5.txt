**Detailed Summary of the *Air Travellers Security Charge Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Air Travellers Security Charge Act* (ATSCA) establishes a **security charge** on air transportation services in Canada, designed to fund airport security and safety improvements. The Act applies to air travel services acquired **on or after March 31, 2002**, with specific transitional rules for services acquired prior to that date. It introduces a **tiered fee structure** based on the destination and whether excise tax is applicable, and it defines who is liable for the charge, when it is due, and how it is collected.

The charge is **not a tax**, but rather a **security fee** paid by passengers or entities acquiring air travel services. The Act is administered by the **Minister of National Revenue** through the **Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)**, and it includes detailed definitions, exemptions, and procedural rules.

  - **Acquired in Canada**:  
    - Any chargeable emplanement made **after March 31, 2002**.  
    - Service must have **consideration paid or payable after March 31, 2002**.

    - Any chargeable emplanement made **after May 31, 2002**.  
    - Service must have **consideration paid or payable after May 31, 2002**.

---

The following are **exempt** from the charge:

2. **Charitable donations**:
   - If a **registered charity** acquires a service for **no consideration** and donates it to an individual **for charitable purposes**.

> These exemptions were designed to protect small businesses and charitable activities from the fee.

---

### **4. When is the Charge Due?**

The charge is payable at one of three times:

| **With consideration paid** | At the time any consideration is first paid or becomes payable |
| **No consideration, ticket issued** | At the time a ticket is issued |

> This ensures timely collection and aligns with the timing of travel arrangements.

---

### **5. Amount of the Charge (Fee Structure)**

The fee is **tiered** based on:

- **Destination** (domestic vs. international, within or outside continental zone)
- **Excise tax requirement** (under Excise Tax Act subsection 165(1))

#### **A. Services Acquired in Canada**

| Destination | Excise Tax Required? | Charge per Emplanement | Max Charge |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Domestic (within Canada) | Yes | $9.46 | $18.92 |
| Domestic (within Canada) | No | $9.94 | $19.87 |
| International (outside Canada, within continental zone) | Yes | $16.08 | $32.16 |
| International (outside Canada, within continental zone) | No | $16.89 | $33.77 |
| International (outside continental zone) | Any | $34.42 | $34.42 |

> **Note:** The maximum is capped at the total for the number of chargeable emplanements (e.g., two emplanements = up to $34.42).

#### **B. Services Acquired Outside Canada**

| Destination | Excise Tax Required? | Charge per Emplanement | Max Charge |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| To destination within continental zone | Yes | $16.08 | $32.16 |
| To destination within continental zone | No | $16.89 | $33.77 |
| To destination outside continental zone | Any | $34.42 | $34.42 |

For certain special services (e.g., charter flights, government contracts), the charge is the **lesser of**:
- The amount calculated under the above rules, and
- A **prescribed amount** or amount determined by regulation.

> This allows flexibility for specific services not covered by standard rules.

### **6. Deemed Acquisition in Canada (Key Provision)**

An air transportation service **acquired outside Canada** is **deemed acquired in Canada** if:

1. Payment is made **from within Canada** to a foreign entity (e.g., via cheque, card, money order) sent to a ticket office, travel agent, or carrier.
2. Payment is delivered **to a Canadian agency** that transmits it to a foreign entity.
3. There is an **arrangement with a person outside Canada** that benefits a **Canadian resident**.

> This ensures that Canadian residents are not unfairly charged when they pay from within Canada.

#### **Charter Operation Exception**

If a service **begins in Canada** and is acquired **outside Canada** in the course of a **charter**, it is **deemed acquired in Canada**.

> This prevents double charging and ensures fairness in charter operations.
