**Detailed Summary of the *Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario)***

The *Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario)* is a historical piece of legislation that establishes the legal framework for the annulment of marriages in the Province of Ontario, based on English common law principles. Below is a comprehensive and detailed summary of the key provisions and their implications:

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The Act is formally titled: **"The Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario)"**.
- It is cited as such and serves as the primary statutory authority governing the annulment of marriages in Ontario under English common law principles.

---

### **2. Legal Basis: English Law as of July 15, 1870**
- The core of the Act is rooted in the **law of England as it existed on July 15, 1870**, specifically concerning the **annulment of marriage**.
- This means that the Act incorporates and applies the **English legal principles** regarding when a marriage may be declared void or voidable (i.e., annulled) — such as:
  - Lack of consent (e.g., due to fraud, duress, or mental incapacity),
  - Impotence or inability to consummate the marriage,
  - Bigamy,
  - Impediments such as consanguinity (close blood relationship),
  - Marriage to a person already legally married,
  - Age of consent,
  - And other grounds recognized under English common law at that time.

---

### **3. Application in Ontario**
- The English law is **applied to Ontario**, but **only insofar as it can be made to apply** and **has not been repealed** by:
  - Acts of the **Parliament of the United Kingdom**,
  - Acts of the **Parliament of Canada**, or
  - This Act itself.
- This means that if any of these higher legislative bodies have passed laws that **repeal or modify** the relevant provisions of English marriage law, those changes **take precedence** in Ontario.
- The Act **does not automatically adopt all English marriage laws**; it only applies the parts that remain in force and are not superseded by Canadian or UK legislation.

---

### **4. Modification and Evolution**
- The Act acknowledges that English law may have been **altered, varied, modified, or affected** by subsequent legislation (either UK or Canadian).
- Therefore, the law in Ontario reflects the **status of English law as of July 15, 1870**, **as interpreted and adjusted** by later laws passed by the UK or Canada — meaning the final version in Ontario is a **hybrid of historical English law and later statutory developments**.

---

### **5. Jurisdiction**
- The **Supreme Court of Ontario** is granted **exclusive jurisdiction** over all matters related to the annulment of marriages under this Act.
- This includes:
  - Determining whether a marriage is void or voidable,
  - Hearing claims for annulment,
  - Interpreting the applicable legal grounds,
  - Making orders for the dissolution or nullification of a marriage.
- This jurisdiction ensures that the process of annulment is centralized and governed by a high court with the authority to apply and interpret the relevant legal principles.

---

### **6. Historical and Legal Context**
- This Act is **historically significant**, as it reflects the colonial legal system in which Ontario (then part of Canada West) inherited English common law.
- It predates modern Canadian family law reforms and was in effect during a period when marriage annulment was governed primarily by common law principles rather than statutory frameworks.
- Over time, **this Act has been superseded or replaced** by more modern legislation, such as the *Family Law Act* (1968), which provides a comprehensive statutory framework for marriage dissolution and annulment in Canada.
- As such, the *Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario)* is **no longer in active force** in contemporary Canadian law. It is now considered **historical or obsolete**.

---

### **7. Key Implications**
- **Limited Scope**: The Act only applies to marriages that fall within the historical English annulment grounds and does not cover modern issues such as cohabitation, separation, or divorce.
- **No Modern Relevance**: In current practice, annulment claims in Ontario are handled under the *Family Law Act*, which provides broader and more equitable remedies.
- **Legal Precedent Value**: Though not currently in force, the Act may still serve as a reference point in legal history or in judicial reasoning about the evolution of marriage law in Canada.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario)* is a **historical statute** that codified the application of English common law on marriage annulment in Ontario as of July 15, 1870. It established the **Supreme Court of Ontario** as the sole authority to adjudicate annulment claims and applied English law **only where not repealed or modified** by subsequent legislation. While it played a foundational role in early Canadian family law, it has been **replaced by modern statutes**, particularly the *Family Law Act*, and is no longer used in current legal practice.

> **Note**: This Act is not currently in force. It is preserved in legal archives and historical records, and its provisions are of academic and historical interest rather than practical application.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The *Annulment of Marriages Act (Ontario)* historically applied English marriage annulment law from July 15, 1870, to Ontario, subject to repeal or modification by UK, Canadian, or provincial legislation, and vested jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Ontario — but it is now obsolete and superseded by modern family law statutes.
