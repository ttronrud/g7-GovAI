**Detailed Summary of the *Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act* (PSDPA)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act* (PSDPA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted to **protect public servants who report wrongdoing** within the federal public sector and to **ensure that such disclosures are made in a safe, confidential, and protected environment**. The Act balances the public servant’s **duty of loyalty to their employer** with their **right to freedom of expression**, as guaranteed under the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

It establishes a comprehensive legal framework for:
- Making protected disclosures of wrongdoing,
- Protecting public servants from reprisals,
- Ensuring accountability through internal procedures and oversight,
- Promoting ethical conduct and transparency in the public service.

The Act came into force in 2006 and was significantly updated in 2010, with key provisions restructured to enhance protections and clarify responsibilities.

## **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Public Confidence in Public Institutions**  
   The federal public administration is recognized as a cornerstone of Canadian parliamentary democracy. Maintaining public trust requires transparency and integrity, especially in how public servants report misconduct.

2. **Protection of Whistleblowers**  
   Public servants are empowered to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. This includes disclosures made in good faith about illegal, unethical, or dangerous practices.

3. **Balance Between Loyalty and Freedom of Expression**  
   The Act acknowledges that public servants owe a duty of loyalty to their government, but also have a right to speak up when they believe misconduct occurs — a balance essential to accountability and democratic governance.

4. **Establishment of a Code of Conduct**  
   The federal government commits to setting a national standard of professional behavior for public servants, promoting ethical practices and a culture of integrity.

5. **Creation of a Charter of Values**  
   The Government of Canada commits to establishing a *Charter of Values of Public Service*, outlining core values that guide public servants’ conduct.
