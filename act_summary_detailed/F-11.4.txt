**Detailed Summary of the *Financial Institutions Depositors Compensation Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Financial Institutions Depositors Compensation Act* (FIDCA) is a Canadian statute enacted on **December 20, 1985**, to provide a mechanism for compensating depositors in the event that certain financial institutions fail or become insolvent, particularly in the context of a historical gap in deposit insurance coverage prior to the establishment of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). The Act serves as a **de facto deposit insurance scheme** for specific financial institutions that were not covered under the CDIC Act at the time of enactment.

It applies specifically to **Canadian Commercial Bank (CCB)**, **CCB Mortgage Investment Corporation (CCBMIC)**, and **Northland Bank**, and provides a **compensation framework** for depositors whose funds were held in these institutions before September 2, 1985 — a period when the CDIC did not cover deposits in these entities.

## **Core Provisions and Purpose**

### **1. Compensation for Depositors (Section 3)**
- The **Minister of Finance** may pay a depositor an amount equal to:
  - The portion of their deposit held by a financial institution **immediately before September 2, 1985**, including any accrued or payable interest.
  - Only the amount that the depositor is **entitled to** and that was **not insured** by the CDIC under the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*.
- Payment is subject to:
  - A formal application submitted in the **prescribed form and manner**.
  - The Minister’s determination — or that of an agent appointed under subsection 12(1) — that the depositor is entitled to the amount and that it was uninsured.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To compensate depositors for uninsured deposits in the targeted institutions prior to the CDIC's full implementation.

---

### **2. Set-Off Rights in Cases of Debt (Section 4)**
- If a depositor is **indebted** to the financial institution, and a **liquidator** has applied to the Minister:
  - The depositor has been **notified** of the liquidator’s application.
  - A **right of set-off** exists between the deposit and the obligation (e.g., a loan or overdraft).
- Then, the Minister may pay the **amount due to the liquidator** (instead of the depositor), **to the extent of the set-off**.
- This payment **discharges the depositor’s obligation** to the financial institution for that amount.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To prevent double recovery and to ensure that debts owed by depositors are settled through set-off, rather than direct compensation.

---

### **3. Security Interests and Set-Off (Section 5)**
- If a deposit was **subject to a security interest** (e.g., a loan secured by the deposit) and a set-off exists:
  - **No payment** can be made under this Act **unless** the Minister or its agent is satisfied that:
    - The deposit (or part of it) has been **applied** to reduce or extinguish the underlying obligation.
    - The amount of the deposit has been **reduced accordingly**.
- The security interest takes priority in the use of the deposit to satisfy the obligation.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To protect creditors with security interests and ensure that such obligations are not compromised by compensation payments.

---

### **4. Dispute Resolution Mechanism (Section 6)**
- In cases of **uncertainty** about:
  - Whether Section 3 applies,
  - The amount of the deposit subject to a security interest,
  - The amount of a set-off,
- Any party (Minister, depositor, or liquidator) may apply to a **court of competent jurisdiction** in Canada for a determination.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To provide a legal avenue for resolving disputes over eligibility and the scope of compensation.

---

### **5. Court Application for Set-Off (Section 7)**
- If a payment cannot be made due to a security interest, a depositor or liquidator may apply to court for an **order** that:
  - The deposit or part of it be applied to reduce or extinguish the security interest.
  - The amount of the deposit be reduced accordingly.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To enforce the priority of security interests in the event of a compensation claim.

---

### **6. Dispute Between Claimants (Section 8)**
- If **two or more claimants** dispute eligibility or the amount of compensation:
  - The Minister may **pay the amount into court** pending resolution of the dispute.
- This ensures that compensation is not delayed due to internal disputes.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To maintain financial stability and prevent prolonged litigation during a crisis.

---

### **7. Payment Timeline (Section 9)**
- **60%** of the compensation is paid **immediately** upon approval.
- The remaining **40%** is paid on **April 1, 1986**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To ensure timely compensation while allowing time for administrative review and verification.

---

### **8. Payment Where Information is Incomplete (Section 10)**
- If there is **insufficient information** to determine eligibility or payment amount:
  - Payment may be made **once the necessary information becomes available**.
- This allows for flexibility in cases where documentation is missing or incomplete.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To avoid denial of compensation due to administrative delays.

---

### **9. Deadline for Applications (Section 11)**
- **No payment may be made** unless the application is received **prior to April 1, 1986**.
- This establishes a clear deadline for claims.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To ensure timely processing and prevent claims from being submitted too late.

---

### **10. Discharge of Liability and Assignment of Rights (Section 12)**
- Once a payment is made:
  - The **Minister and any agent** are **discharged from all liability** regarding that deposit.
  - The **rights and interests** of the depositor (including claims, actions, causes of action, and priority rights under the Bank Act or Canadian Payments Association Act) are **assigned to and vest in Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This assignment:
  - Does **not create a first charge** on the financial institution’s assets under paragraph 277(1)(a) of the *Bank Act*.
  - Does **not affect any subrogation or assignment** of rights under section 13 of the *CDIC Act*.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To transfer ownership of claims to the Crown, enabling the government to manage or pursue rights without creating new liabilities or affecting creditor priorities.

---

### **11. Prohibition on Set-Off After Compensation (Section 13)**
- **No right of set-off** may be asserted with respect to a deposit **after** a payment has been made under this Act.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To prevent depositors from offsetting future liabilities against already-compensated deposits.

---

### **12. Tax Exemption (Section 14)**
- **Subsection 137.1(10) of the Income Tax Act** (which normally applies to interest income) **does not apply** to payments made under this Act.
