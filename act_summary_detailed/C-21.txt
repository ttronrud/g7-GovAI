**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Payments Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Payments Act* establishes the **Canadian Payments Association (CPA)** as a national, non-governmental body responsible for overseeing and promoting the development, efficiency, safety, and soundness of Canada’s payment systems. It is designed to modernize and standardize the clearing and settlement of payments across Canada by fostering interoperability, innovation, and user trust in the financial system.

The Act is **not a regulatory statute** in the traditional sense but rather a **framework for governance and coordination** of payment systems. It grants the CPA significant operational autonomy while ensuring accountability to members, the public, and the federal government.
