### **Detailed Summary of the Yukon Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment Act**

---

#### **1. Overview and Purpose**

The **Yukon Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment Act** (YESA Act) establishes a comprehensive, independent, and equitable framework for assessing the environmental and socio-economic impacts of proposed projects in Yukon. It is specifically designed to ensure that development activities are conducted in a way that protects the environment, respects Indigenous rights, promotes sustainable socio-economic development, and supports the well-being of Yukon residents — particularly First Nations peoples.

Key purposes of the Act include:

- To provide a **neutral, transparent, and comprehensive assessment process** applicable across Yukon.
- To **require evaluation** of environmental and socio-economic effects before any project proceeds.
- To **protect environmental quality and heritage resources**.
- To **promote the well-being** of Yukon First Nations and all residents.
- To ensure that projects support **beneficial socio-economic change** without compromising ecological or social systems.
- To **recognize and enhance** the traditional economies and relationships of First Nations with the land and wilderness.
- To **guarantee meaningful participation** of First Nations in the assessment process, including through the use of traditional knowledge.
- To **facilitate public participation** in project assessments.
- To ensure the process is **timely, efficient, and avoids duplication**.
- To provide **certainty** regarding procedures, timelines, information requirements, and costs.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The *Impact Assessment Act* (federal) **does not apply in Yukon**. This Act governs all environmental and socio-economic assessments within the territory.

#### **4. Structure and Governance of the Board**

#### **5. Role of Decision Bodies**

A **decision body** is the entity responsible for authorizing a project. Depending on where the project is located and its nature, the decision body may be:

- A **First Nation** (if the project is on settlement land and the First Nation has authority to issue authorizations or has financial interest).
- The **Territorial Minister** (if responsible for administering mines/minerals on settlement land or if the project is on non-settlement land).
- A **federal agency** (if it has authority to issue authorizations or is a proponent).
- The **federal minister** (in specific circumstances, e.g., when no territorial minister is involved or when federal agencies are the only decision-makers).

> This structure ensures that decision-making authority is appropriately delegated based on jurisdiction, land use, and Indigenous governance.

#### **6. Public and Indigenous Participation**

The Act emphasizes **inclusive participation**:

- **Public participation** is encouraged throughout the process.
- **First Nations** are guaranteed opportunities to participate, including through:
  - Consultation,
  - Contribution of **traditional knowledge**,
  - Representation on panels or joint panels,
  - Access to information and decision-making processes.

> The Act recognizes that **traditional knowledge** is essential to understanding environmental and socio-economic impacts and should be integrated into assessments.

#### **7. Assessment Process Flow**

The assessment process involves three main stages:

1. **Screening**:
   - Conducted by the **executive committee** of the Board.
   - Determines whether a project requires a full assessment (i.e., if it is likely to have significant environmental or socio-economic effects).

2. **Evaluation**:
   - If screening indicates a need, the project proceeds to a **full assessment**.
   - May involve a **designated office** or a **panel of the Board**.
   - Includes evaluation of environmental and socio-economic effects and proposed **mitigative measures**.

3. **Review and Decision**:
   - A **panel** (either internal or joint) reviews findings.
   - A **decision document** is issued by the decision body (e.g., territorial minister, federal agency), which may include conditions or requirements for project approval.

> The process is designed to be **timely, efficient, and avoid duplication** of efforts across agencies.

#### **8. Financial Assistance and Exemptions**

- **Financial assistance** includes payments, loans, or guarantees but **excludes**:
  - Tax relief (unless specifically named),
  - Assistance for preliminary studies (e.g., feasibility studies),
  - Assistance for environmental or socio-economic studies (unless the study itself is a project).

> This ensures that financial support does not circumvent the assessment process.

- **Exemptions** from assessment are governed under **section 49** and are narrowly defined. Projects that meet specific criteria (e.g., minor
