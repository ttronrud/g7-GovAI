The provided text appears to be a partial or incomplete excerpt of a Canadian Act of Parliament. Specifically, it reads:

> "Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 65]  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 65]  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 65]  
> ... (repeated 13 times)"

### Detailed Summary:

1. **Nature of the Document**:  
   This is a legislative enactment (an Act of Parliament) that was intended to establish or amend certain legal provisions in Canada. However, the content of the actual provisions — the "enacts as follows" section — is entirely missing or blank.

2. **Repeated Repeal Notices**:  
   The text contains 13 identical entries stating:  
   **"[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 65]"**  
   This indicates that the section or provisions previously listed under the Act were **repealed (cancelled or abolished)** by **the Canadian Statutes of 2017, Chapter 26, Section 65**.

3. **Interpretation of "Repealed" Entries**:  
   - "Repealed" means that the specific provisions or sections of a prior law are no longer in force.  
   - "c. 26" refers to *Chapter 26* of the Statutes of Canada in 2017 (likely the *Criminal Code Amendment Act, 2017* or a similar legislation).  
   - "s. 65" refers to Section 65 of that chapter.  
   - Therefore, the original provisions of this Act (which are not visible in the text) were **officially removed from law on January 1, 2017**, or at the time of the coming into force of the 2017 Act.

4. **Absence of Actual Provisions**:  
   The "enacts as follows" section — which normally contains the actual legal text — is entirely blank or missing. This suggests that:
   - The original Act may have been a **draft or placeholder**.
   - Or, the document was **intended to be replaced** by a new or amended version.
   - Alternatively, it may be a **typographical or editorial error**, where the actual content was omitted or deleted during publication.

5. **Legal Significance**:  
   The presence of multiple "repealed" notices implies that this Act (or its sections) was **not enacted as new legislation** but rather **superseded or removed** by a later law. As such, it has **no current legal effect** in Canada.

6. **Contextual Clue – 2017, c. 26**:  
   Chapter 26 of the 2017 Statutes of Canada is known as the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017*, which included several amendments to the *Criminal Code*, such as changes to sentencing, youth justice, and criminal procedure. Section 65 of this Act likely contained provisions that repealed older rules or laws, possibly related to:
   - Sentencing guidelines
   - Offences related to drugs or violence
   - Procedures for court hearings or bail
   - Specific offences or penalties

   However, without knowing the original content of the repealed sections, the exact nature of the repealed provisions cannot be determined.

### Final Summary:

The document presented is **a repealed section of a Canadian Act** that was officially **cancelled on or around January 1, 2017**, under *Section 65 of Chapter 26 of the Statutes of Canada, 2017*. The original provisions of the Act (which were meant to be enacted) are **not included** in the text, and the repeated "repealed" notices confirm that the law was **removed from force**. Therefore, **this Act has no current legal standing** and is of historical or archival interest only. The exact content of the repealed provisions would require consultation with the full text of the original legislation or the 2017 Criminal Code Amendment Act.

> 🔍 **Recommendation for Further Research**:  
> To understand what the original provisions were, consult the *Statutes of Canada, 2017, c. 26* (the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 2017), specifically Section 65, or the official parliamentary database (e.g., Parliament of Canada's website or CanLII).

✅ **Conclusion**: This is a **repealed legislative provision** with **no active legal effect**. The text provided does not contain any new or enforceable law.
