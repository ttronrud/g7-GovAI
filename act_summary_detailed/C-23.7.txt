### **Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Victims Bill of Rights* (CVBR)**

The **Canadian Victims Bill of Rights (CVBR)** is a comprehensive legislative framework enacted by Parliament to formally recognize, protect, and promote the rights of victims of crime throughout the Canadian criminal justice system. It establishes a clear legal foundation for victims' participation, dignity, and protection, while balancing those rights with the need to maintain the integrity and efficiency of justice processes.

## **1. Purpose and Policy Foundations**

The Act is grounded in several key principles:

- **Harm Reduction**: Crime has a profound negative impact on individuals and society, and victims suffer physical, emotional, economic, and psychological harm.
- **Dignity and Respect**: Victims and their families deserve to be treated with **courtesy, compassion, and respect**, including respect for their dignity.
- **Institutional Accountability**: Victims’ rights must be considered at every stage of the criminal justice system — from investigation to prosecution, sentencing, and correctional release.
- **Charter-Based Rights**: The rights of victims are protected under the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, reinforcing their legal standing.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Federal, provincial, and territorial governments share responsibility for ensuring victims’ rights are upheld.
- **Historical Context**: The Act builds upon two foundational documents:
  - The **1988 Canadian Statement of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime**
  - The **2003 Canadian Statement of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime**, which updated and expanded the original principles.

This legislation formalizes these principles into enforceable rights, making it the first comprehensive national bill of rights specifically for victims of crime in Canada.

## **2. Key Definitions**

### **Offence**
An "offence" includes:
- Any offence under the *Criminal Code*, *Youth Criminal Justice Act*, or *Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act*
- Designated substance offences (e.g., under the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*)
- Designated offences under the *Cannabis Act*
- Offences under **Section 91** or **Part 3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act**

> *Note: This broad definition ensures that victims of various types of crimes — including drug-related, youth-related, and immigration-related offences — are covered.*

### **Victim**
A "victim" is defined as an individual who has suffered:
- Physical or emotional harm
- Property damage
- Economic loss  
as a result of the **commission or alleged commission** of an offence.

> *Important: The definition includes both actual and alleged harm, recognizing that victims may experience trauma even before formal charges are laid.*

## **3. Who Can Exercise Victim Rights?**

Victim rights can be exercised by individuals who are **deceased or incapacitated** (e.g., due to mental illness, disability, or death). These individuals include:

1. **Spouse** (current or at time of death)
2. **Cohabiting partner** (who has lived with the victim for at least one year)
3. **Relative or dependant** of the victim
4. **Individual with legal or factual custody or responsibility** for the victim or a dependant

> *This ensures that family members and caregivers can advocate for victims who are unable to act independently.*

### **Exclusion Clause**
An individual is **not** a victim or entitled to rights if:
- They are **charged**, **found guilty**, or **found not criminally responsible** due to mental disorder or unfit to stand trial in relation to the offence.

> *This prevents self-identification as a victim when acting as a suspect or accused.*

## **4. Core Rights of Victims**

The CVBR outlines **13 specific rights** that every victim has on request. These rights are designed to ensure transparency, safety, dignity, and meaningful participation in the justice process.

| Right | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Right to Information** | Victims have the right to be informed about: <br> - The criminal justice system and the role of victims <br> - Available services and programs (including restorative justice) <br> - Their right to file a complaint about rights violations |
| **Right to Status & Progress Updates** | Victims have the right to know: <br> - The status and outcome of investigations <br> - The location, timing, and progress of court proceedings |
| **Right to Review of Conditional Release** | Victims have the right to information about: <br> - Reviews of offender release decisions <br> - Timing and conditions of conditional release |
| **Right to Hearings on Dispositions** | Victims have the right to be informed about hearings for dispositions (e.g., when an accused is found not criminally responsible) and the outcomes of those hearings |
| **Right to Security** | Authorities must consider the victim’s safety and take appropriate measures to protect them |
| **Right to Protection from Intimidation** | Reasonable and necessary measures must be taken to protect victims from retaliation or intimidation |
| **Right to Privacy** | Victims’ privacy must be respected in all interactions with the justice system |
| **Right to Identity Protection** | Victims can request that their identity be protected if they are a complainant or witness |
| **Right to Testimonial Aids** | Victims have the right to request aids (e.g., interpreters, visual aids, written summaries) when testifying |
| **Right to Voice Opinion** | Victims can express their views on decisions affecting their rights, and those views must be considered |
| **Right to Submit a Victim Impact Statement** | Victims can submit a statement describing the harm they suffered, which must be considered by authorities |
| **Right to Restitution** | Victims have the right to request that a court order the offender to pay restitution |
| **Right to Enforceable Civil Judgment** | If restitution is not paid, the victim may have the order entered as a **civil court judgment** enforceable against the offender |

> *These rights are not just symbolic — they are enforceable through the justice system and are intended to empower victims to participate meaningfully in the process.*

---

## **5. Scope of Application**

The Act applies to victims throughout the **entire criminal justice lifecycle**, including:

- **Investigation and prosecution** of offences
- **Corrections process** and **conditional release**
- **Court proceedings** and **Review Board hearings** (for individuals found not criminally responsible or unfit to stand trial)

> *Note: The investigation is deemed to begin at the time the offence is reported to authorities.*

### **Exclusions**
The Act **does not apply** to:
- **Service offences** defined in the *National Defence Act* (e.g., offences related to military or defence personnel)
- Provisions of the **Canadian Bill of Rights**, **Canadian Human Rights Act**, **Official Languages Act**, **Access to Information Act**, and **Privacy Act**
- **Division 1.1 of Part III of the National Defence Act** and related regulations

> *These exclusions reflect the need to preserve the unique nature of military and defence-related operations and avoid overlap with existing human rights legislation.*

---

## **6. Limitations and Safeguards**

To prevent interference with the proper administration of justice, the Act includes important **safeguards**:

- **No interference with police or prosecutorial discretion**
- **No excessive delays** in investigations or prosecutions
- **No interference with ministerial or release decisions**
- **No endangerment of individuals’ lives or safety**
- **No harm to national defence, security, or international relations**

> *These limits ensure that while victims’ rights are protected, they do not undermine the operational independence of law enforcement or the fairness of the justice process.*

---

## **7. Compatibility with Existing Laws**

- Every existing law, regulation, or order **before, on, or after** the Act's coming into force must be **interpreted and applied in a way that is compatible** with the rights in this Act.
- If there is **inconsistency** between this Act and another law, **this Act prevails** to the extent of the inconsistency.

> *This ensures that the CVBR is not just a standalone law but becomes the authoritative standard for victim rights across all areas of criminal justice.*

---

## **8. Complaint Mechanisms and Accountability**

Victims have **clear pathways** to seek redress if their rights are violated:

### **Federal Level**
- Victims can file a complaint with a **federal department, agency, or body** involved in the criminal justice system.
- The agency must have a **complaint mechanism** that includes:
  - Review of alleged rights violations
  - Power to make **remedial recommendations**
  - **Notification of victims** about outcomes and recommendations

> *This establishes a formal accountability structure within federal institutions.*

### **Provincial/Territorial Level**
- Victims may file complaints under **provincial or territorial laws**, which may offer different procedures or remedies.

> *This ensures that victims can access justice at all levels of government.*

### **No Cause of Action or Damages**
- **No legal claim or right to damages** arises from a violation of this Act.
- **No appeal** lies solely on the grounds that a victim’s right was infringed.

> *This prevents victims from pursuing lawsuits over rights violations, which could lead to legal delays or costs, and instead encourages resolution through administrative and systemic processes.*

---

## **9. Provisions on Identity and Legal Status**

- **No adverse inference** is to be drawn against a person charged with an offence simply because they are identified as a victim.
- The Act **does not grant** victims or their representatives the status of:
  - Party
  - Intervenor
  - Observer
  in any legal proceedings

> *This avoids overreach and ensures that victims remain outside the formal legal
