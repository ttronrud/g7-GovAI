**Detailed Summary of the *Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act* is a federal statute that **prohibits non-Canadians from purchasing residential property in Canada**, with certain exceptions and specific provisions for enforcement, exceptions, and judicial remedies. The Act was introduced to address concerns about foreign ownership of real estate in Canada, particularly in the context of speculative investment, capital flight, and potential impacts on housing affordability and national security.

However, it is **important to note** that the final sentence of the Act states:  
> *"The Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act is repealed."*  

This means that **the Act is no longer in force as of the date of repeal**. Therefore, the detailed summary below reflects the **former content and structure of the legislation**, not current law.

- These are to be defined by regulation and may include:

---

### **6. Exclusion of Diplomatic Purchases**

> The Act explicitly states:  
> *"Nothing in subsection (1) is to be construed as hindering a foreign state from purchasing residential property for diplomatic or consular purposes."*

- This means that **foreign governments** can purchase property in Canada for official use (e.g., embassies, consulates) without violating the Act.
- This exception protects Canada’s diplomatic interests.

---

### **7. Liability for Pre-Existing Agreements**

> The prohibition does **not apply** if:
> - A non-Canadian **becomes liable or assumes liability** under a purchase and sale agreement **before the Act comes into force**.

- This provision protects individuals or entities who entered into contracts prior to the law’s implementation.
- It prevents retroactive enforcement of the law on existing transactions.

---

### **8. Validity of Sales Despite Contravention**

> The **contravention of section 4 does not affect the validity of the sale** of the property.

- Even if a non-Canadian purchased the property in violation of the Act, the **sale remains legally valid**.
- This ensures that property rights are not invalidated due to a breach of the law.

---

### **9. Criminal Offences**

#### **Offence for Contravention**
- Any **non-Canadian** who violates section 4 (i.e., purchases residential property) is guilty of an offence.
- Any person or entity who **counsels, induces, aids, or attempts to aid** a non-Canadian in such a purchase is also guilty.

> **Penalty**:  
> - **Summary conviction** (less serious offence)  
> - Fine of **not more than $10,000**

#### **Corporate Liability**
- If a **corporation or entity** commits an offence, the following individuals are **personally liable**:
  - Officers, directors, agents, or mandataries
  - Senior officials
  - Any individual authorized to exercise managerial or supervisory functions

> This ensures that corporate actors cannot avoid responsibility by hiding behind corporate structures.

---

### **10. Judicial Remedies – Section 7**

#### **Power to Order Sale of Property**
- If a non-Canadian is convicted of violating section 4, the **Superior Court** of the province where the property is located may:
  - On application by the **Minister**, order the **sale of the residential property**.
  - The sale must be conducted in a **prescribed manner and under prescribed conditions**.

#### **Court Discretion**
- The court may impose **additional terms** it considers appropriate (e.g., timing, price, auction method, or restrictions on proceeds).

> This provides a legal mechanism to recover or restructure property ownership when a violation occurs.

---

### **11. Regulatory Powers**

The **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Minister and consultation with the Minister of Finance) may make **regulations** under the Act
