**Detailed Summary of the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Cultural Property Export and Import Act* is a Canadian legislative framework designed to **protect Canada’s cultural heritage by regulating the export of culturally significant objects**. The Act establishes a comprehensive system to ensure that objects of national importance—particularly those of archaeological, historical, artistic, or scientific value—are not exported without proper review and justification. It balances the rights of Canadian residents and institutions to export certain items with the duty to preserve Canada’s national heritage.

## **Key Definitions and Terms**

Before diving into the substantive provisions, the Act defines several key terms:

- **Control List**: A list of objects or classes of objects that are subject to export control due to their cultural significance. It is established by the Governor in Council and includes specific categories of heritage items.
  
- **Expert Examiner**: A person or institution designated to assess whether an object is included in the Control List. They are independent assessors with expertise in cultural heritage.

- **Export Permit**: A formal authorization issued by a permit officer to export an object. It is required for most exports of controlled items.

- **General Permit**: A broader, pre-approved permit issued by the Minister for the export of certain types of objects in the Control List, reducing the need for individual applications.

- **Institution**: A publicly owned body established for educational or cultural purposes that conserves and makes cultural objects available to the public (e.g., museums, libraries, archives).

- **Minister**: The designated member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada responsible for overseeing the Act (typically the Minister of Foreign Affairs or Minister of Heritage).

- **Permit Officer**: A designated official (often from the Canada Border Services Agency) who receives export permit applications and makes initial determinations.

- **Public Authority**: Includes federal, provincial, municipal, or corporate bodies performing governmental functions.

- **Resident of Canada**: A natural person who ordinarily resides in Canada or a corporation with a head office or establishment in Canada.

- **Review Board**: An independent body established to review export permit applications, assess national significance, and determine fair market values.

### **2. Designation of Permit Officers and Expert Examiners (Sections 5 & 6)**

- The **Minister**, with approval from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, may designate **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers** as **permit officers** to process export permit applications.
- The **Minister** may designate **residents of Canada or institutions** as **expert examiners** to evaluate whether an object is included in the Control List.

#### **Remuneration**:
- Expert examiners (non-government employees) are paid:
  - A fee approved by the **Treasury Board** for services rendered.
  - Reasonable **travel and living expenses** (within Treasury Board limits) when absent from their ordinary residence.

---

### **3. Permit Issuance Process (Section 7)**

A permit officer must issue an export permit **immediately** if the applicant satisfies **any one** of the following conditions:

1. The object was **imported into Canada within the past 35 years** and was **not previously exported under a permit**.
2. The object was **lent to a Canadian institution or public authority** by a **non-resident** at the time of the loan.
3. The object is being removed for a **prescribed purpose** (e.g., exhibition, research) for a **limited period** (as per regulation).

> If none of these conditions apply, the permit officer must determine whether the object is in the Control List.

---

### **4. Assessment by Expert Examiner (Section 8–11)**

If the object is **in or may be in** the Control List, the permit officer refers it to an **expert examiner**.

#### **Expert Examiner’s Responsibilities**:
- Determine whether the object is **included in the Control List**.
- If **not included**, advise the permit officer to issue the permit and send a copy to the **Review Board and Minister**.
- If **included**, further assess:
  - **Outstanding significance** (e.g., connection to Canadian history, aesthetics, or scientific study).
  - **Degree of national importance** (i.e., would loss significantly diminish Canada’s heritage).

#### **Outcomes**:
- **Not significant or not nationally important** → Permit issued immediately.
- **Significant and nationally important** → Permit **denied**; the permit officer must issue a **written notice of refusal** explaining the reasons.

> This ensures that only objects of exceptional national value are restricted from export.

### **5. Permit Issuance and Refusal (Section 13)**

- A permit is **not issued** for an object in the Control List **unless**:
  - It was issued under **Section 7**, or
  - It is issued **on the direction of the Review Board** (under Sections 29 or 30).
- **No export permit** may be issued for an object in the Control List during a **two-year period** after a **notice of refusal** is sent (Section 14).
- A **deposit requirement** applies: For objects in the Control List, the applicant must **deposit a copy** of the object (e.g., photograph, description) with a designated institution (as directed by the Minister) before a permit is issued.

---

### **6. General Permits (Section 17)**

- The **Minister** may issue **general permits** to residents of Canada to export objects in the Control List, subject to conditions.
- The Minister may also issue **general permits to all persons** for specific classes of objects in the Control List, **with the concurrence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs**.
- These permits can be **amended, suspended, cancelled, or reinstated** at any time.
