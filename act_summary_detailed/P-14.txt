**Detailed Summary of the Pilotage Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Pilotage Act* establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the provision of **pilotage services** in Canada. The primary objective is to ensure **safe, efficient, and cost-effective navigation** of vessels, particularly in areas where specialized local knowledge is essential for safe passage. The Act creates **Pilotage Authorities** — independent, publicly accountable bodies — responsible for managing pilotage services, setting charges, and ensuring compliance with safety and operational standards.

This summary provides a detailed, structured breakdown of the key components of the Act, including definitions, governance, operations, charging mechanisms, and procedural safeguards.

## **2. Purpose and Core Principles**

The Act is guided by **four fundamental principles**:

1. **Safety First**  
   Pilotage services must promote and contribute to the safety of navigation, including the safety of the public, marine personnel, human health, property, and the environment.

2. **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**  
   Services must be delivered in an efficient and economically viable manner.

3. **Risk Management and Technology Use**  
   Authorities must apply effective risk management tools and integrate evolving technologies (e.g., automation, digital navigation systems) into operations.

4. **Financial Sustainability**  
   Pilotage charges must be set at levels that allow the Authority to be **financially self-sufficient**, without being excessive or discriminatory.

These principles form the foundation for all decisions regarding service delivery, staffing, and pricing.

## **3. Establishment and Governance of Pilotage Authorities**

### **Creation of Authorities**
- Each Authority is established as a **body corporate** with a **Chairperson** and **up to six other members**.
- The list of Authorities and their geographic regions is set out in a **schedule** to the Act.

### **Appointment of Members**
- **Chairperson**: Appointed by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, with consultation from Authority members and users. Term is at the Governor’s discretion.
- **Other Members**: Appointed by the Minister with Governor in Council approval. Each term does not exceed **four years**, and no more than **half of the members** may have their terms expire in any one year to ensure continuity and stability.

### **Eligibility Restrictions**
- Individuals **engaged in the business of providing pilotage services** (or employed by such entities) are **ineligible** to serve as Chairperson or member of an Authority.
- This prevents conflicts of interest and ensures independence from commercial pilotage providers.

### **Head Office**
- Each Authority must have a designated **head office**, specified in the schedule.

### **Boundary and Name Changes**
- The Governor in Council may:
  - Expand a region to include additional Canadian waters.
  - Change an Authority’s name.
  - Change its head office location.
  - Establish new Authorities, defining their regions and head offices.

> All new or revised regions are deemed to be part of the official schedule.

---

## **4. Leadership and Operational Structure**

### **Chairperson vs. Vice-Chairperson**
- **Full-time Chairperson**: Has full authority over the Authority’s business and may exercise powers delegated by by-law.
- **Part-time Chairperson**: The Authority appoints a **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)** to manage daily operations.
- If the Chairperson is absent or incapacitated, the **Vice-Chairperson** acts as Chairperson.

### **Remuneration**
- Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson receive **fixed remuneration** set by the Governor in Council.
- Other members receive a **daily allowance** for attending meetings and performing duties.
- Members are entitled to **reasonable travel and other expenses** incurred while performing duties.

---

## **5. Employment and Service Agreements**

### **Employment of Pilots**
- Authorities may hire licensed pilots and apprentice pilots as needed.
- However, **if a majority of licensed pilots** in a region are members or shareholders of a body corporate, the Authority may **contract with that body corporate** instead of hiring directly.

### **Contractual Obligations and Equity**
- The body corporate must allow **non-members or non-shareholders** to become members or shareholders **on the same terms** as existing ones.
- This promotes fairness and access to pilotage services.

### **Dispute Resolution in Contract Renewal**
- If a contract lacks a dispute resolution mechanism, **50 days before expiry**, the parties must jointly select a **mediator and arbitrator**.
- The **mediator** has **30 days** to bring the parties to agreement; if unresolved, the **arbitrator** decides on final offers within **15 days**.
- The arbitrator selects one of the final offers as binding and incorporates it into the new contract.
- **Costs of mediation and arbitration are shared equally** by both parties.

> This ensures transparency, fairness, and predictability in long-term service agreements.

### **Prohibited Contract Subjects**
- Authorities **cannot enter into or amend** contracts related to:
  - Safety standards,
  - Regulatory compliance,
  - Environmental protection,
  - Or any matter listed in **paragraphs 52(1)(a) to (o)** of the Act (e.g., emergency response, environmental impact).

> This protects the integrity of public safety and environmental oversight.

### **Transparency and Access**
- Authorities must provide **copies of all contracts** upon request.
- This promotes accountability and public trust.

---

## **6. Service Provision and Emergency Protocols**

### **Pilot Service Needs**
- If an Authority lacks employees or a contracted body corporate in a compulsory pilotage area, it may **directly contract with licensed pilots** to provide pilotage services.

> This ensures continuity of service even in regions with limited local pilot availability.

---

## **7. Public Service Status and Legal Protections**

- An Authority is deemed a **Public Service Corporation** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*.
- Officers and employees are considered **persons employed in federal public administration** under:
  - The *Government Employees Compensation Act*,
  - And regulations under the *Aeronautics Act*.

> This provides access to benefits, insurance, and employment protections.

---

## **8. By-Laws and Internal Management**

- Authorities may adopt **by-laws** to govern internal affairs, including:
  - Duties of members, officers, and employees.
  - Delegation of powers (e.g., to the Chairperson or CEO).
  - Management of property and assets.
- All by-laws must be **shared with interested parties** upon request.

> This ensures transparency and democratic governance.

---

## **9. Objectives of the Authority**

The primary objectives of each Authority are:
- To **establish, operate, maintain, and administer** a pilotage service that:
  - Promotes safety of navigation,
  - Is efficient and cost-effective,
  - Reflects the principles outlined in section 2.

> These are central to the mission of the Authority.

## **10. Property and Asset Management**

Authorities may:
- Purchase, lease, or acquire:
