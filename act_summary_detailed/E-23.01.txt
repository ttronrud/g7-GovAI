**Detailed Summary of the *Extradition Act* of Canada**

---

### **Overview**

The *Extradition Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the legal framework for the **extradition of individuals from Canada to foreign states or entities** for the purpose of prosecution or enforcement of a sentence. It operates under the principle of mutual legal assistance and ensures that extradition is conducted in a manner consistent with Canadian law, human rights, and international obligations. The Act provides detailed procedural rules, definitions, and safeguards to ensure fairness, transparency, and judicial oversight throughout the extradition process.

It was enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, and may be cited as the *Extradition Act*.

## **Principles Governing Extradition**

### **1. Eligibility for Extradition**

A person may be extradited **only if**:

- The offence in question is punishable in the **extradition partner** by **imprisonment for a minimum of two years or more**, or a **more severe punishment**.
- The conduct in question, **had it occurred in Canada**, would have constituted a criminal offence punishable in Canada.

> **Exception for Specific Agreements**:  
> In cases governed by a *specific agreement*, the minimum sentence required is **five years or more**, or a more severe punishment.

> **Note**: The Act explicitly states that it does **not matter** whether the extradition partner uses the same legal terminology or definitions as Canada. This ensures flexibility and avoids overly restrictive interpretations of the offence.

---

### **2. Minimum Sentence Thresholds**

- For **persons already sentenced** to imprisonment or deprivation of liberty, extradition may only occur if:
  - The **remaining term is at least six months**, or
  - A **more severe punishment remains** to be carried out.

> This ensures that individuals who have served substantial portions of their sentences are not subjected to extradition unless there is a meaningful remaining penalty.

---

### **3. Non-Preclusion of Further Proceedings**

- A person’s discharge under this Act **does not prevent** further extradition proceedings, even if based on the same conduct.
- However, **further proceedings may be barred** if the judge determines they constitute an **abuse of process**.

---

### **4. Jurisdictional Flexibility**

- Extradition may proceed **regardless of where the alleged offence occurred** — even if it occurred outside the jurisdiction of the requesting state.
- Extradition may also proceed **regardless of whether Canada would have had jurisdiction** in similar circumstances.

> This reflects the principle of **universal jurisdiction** and **territorial neutrality** in extradition.

---

### **5. Time Periods (Pre- and Post-Act)**

- Extradition may be granted **regardless of when** the offence occurred — whether before or after the Act or the relevant extradition agreement came into force.

> This ensures continuity and prevents retroactive denial of extradition rights.

---

### **6. Immunity Exception – International Criminal Tribunals**

> Despite any other law, **no person** who is subject to a request from:
> - The **International Criminal Court (ICC)**, or
> - Any international criminal tribunal established by UN Security Council resolution and listed in the schedule  
> may claim **common law or statutory immunity** from arrest or extradition under this Act.

> This ensures that individuals accused of serious international crimes (e.g., war crimes, crimes against humanity) are not shielded from prosecution in Canada.

---

## **Implementation and Administration**

### **Responsibility of the Minister of Justice**

- The **Minister of Justice** is responsible for:
  - Implementing extradition agreements,
  - Administering the Act,
  - Processing and reviewing requests for extradition.

---

### **Publication of Extradition Agreements**

- Any extradition agreement (or multilateral agreement’s extradition provisions) must be:
  - Published in the **Canada Gazette** within **60 days** of coming into force, **unless** it is published in the **Canada Treaty Series**.
- If published in the Canada Treaty Series, it must also be done within 60 days.
- Agreements published in either series are **judicially noticed** — meaning courts must treat them as authentic and binding without requiring further proof.

---

### **Schedule of Extradition Partners**

- The names of states or entities appearing in the schedule are automatically designated as **extradition partners**.
- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, with the agreement of the Minister of Justice, may:
  - Add or remove names from the schedule.
- The Minister may also enter into a **specific agreement** with a state/entity for a **particular case**, allowing for tailored arrangements.

> **Conflict Resolution**: If there is an inconsistency between this Act and a specific agreement, **this Act prevails**.

> **Certificate of Agreement**: A certificate issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with an attached copy of a specific agreement, is **conclusive evidence** of the agreement’s existence and terms — even without verification of signatures or official status.

---

## **Process of Request and Provisional Arrest**

### **1. Request for Provisional Arrest**

- A request for **provisional arrest or extradition** must be submitted to the **Minister of Justice**.
- Alternatively, it may be submitted **through Interpol**.

### **2. Minister’s Authorization**

- The Minister may authorize the **Attorney General** to apply for a **provisional arrest warrant** if:
  - The offence is punishable under paragraph 3(1)(a) (i.e., minimum two years’ imprisonment or more), and
  - The extradition partner will make a formal request for extradition.

### **3. Warrant Issuance by Judge**

- A judge may issue a **provisional arrest warrant ex parte** (without the accused being present) if satisfied that:
  - It is in the **public interest** to arrest the person (to prevent escape or further crime),
  - The person is **ordinarily resident in Canada**, is **in Canada**, or is **on their way to Canada**, and
  - A warrant or conviction exists.

> The warrant must:
> - Clearly identify the person,
> - Briefly state the offence,
> - Order immediate arrest and bringing before the issuing judge or another judge.

> The warrant is **valid anywhere in Canada** and **does not require endorsement**.

## **Release After Provisional Arrest**

A person provisionally arrested must be **discharged** under one of the following circumstances:

| Scenario | Discharge Condition |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Request under extradition agreement with a time limit** | If the period expires and no extradition request is made or documents provided; or if the request is made but the Minister does not issue an "authority to proceed" within 30 days of expiry. |
| **No time limit in agreement** | After **60 days** of arrest, or within 60 days if request is made, but no authority to proceed issued within 30 additional days. |

> **Extension of Time Periods**:
> - On application by the Attorney General, a judge may extend the time period for extradition proceedings.
> - In cases involving the **ICC**, the extension may not exceed **30 days**.
> - The judge may also grant **judicial interim release** or modify conditions during extension.

---

## **Authority to Proceed**

- After receiving a request, the Minister may issue an **"authority to proceed"** if:
  - The conditions in paragraph 3(1)(a) and subsection 3(3) are met,
  - The person is being sought for prosecution or enforcement of a sentence.

> The authority must include:
> - Name or description of the person,
> - Name of the extradition partner,
> - Name(s) of the offence(s) under Canadian law corresponding to the alleged conduct (as long as one would
