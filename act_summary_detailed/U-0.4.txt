**Detailed Summary of the *Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (“Holodomor”) Memorial Day Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (“Holodomor”) Memorial Day Act* is a Canadian legislative measure enacted to formally recognize and commemorate the mass starvation and human rights atrocities that occurred in Ukraine during 1932–1933, known historically as the **Holodomor**. The Act establishes an annual observance in Canada to honor the victims of this genocide, promote remembrance, and uphold principles of democracy, human rights, and historical truth.

While the Act does **not** designate the day as a legal public holiday or a day off work, it establishes a **national day of remembrance** with specific commemorative significance.

### **Key Provisions and Content**

#### **1. Recognition of the Holodomor as a Genocide**  
The Act begins with a series of **"Whereas" clauses**, which provide historical, political, and moral context for the legislation. These clauses affirm that:

- The Holodomor (the 1932–1933 Ukrainian famine) was **deliberately planned and executed** by the Soviet regime under Joseph Stalin as a tool to suppress Ukrainian national identity and aspirations for independence.
- The famine resulted in the **death of millions of Ukrainians**, primarily through forced collectivization, confiscation of food, and denial of basic sustenance.
- The policy of forced collectivization also led to the deaths of millions of ethnic minorities across the former Soviet Union.
- The **75th anniversary** of the Holodomor in 2007–2008 served as a pivotal moment for renewed international recognition.

#### **2. International Recognition of the Holodomor as Genocide**  
The Act highlights that several nations and institutions have officially recognized the Holodomor as genocide:

- **Ukraine (2006)**: The Ukrainian Parliament passed a resolution recognizing the 1932–1933 famine as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people.
- **Canada (2003)**: The Canadian Senate unanimously passed a motion urging the government to recognize the Holodomor as genocide.
- **Other Countries**: Parliaments and senates of **Argentina, Austria, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland**, and the **United States**, as well as the **senates of Australia and Canada**, have also recognized the Holodomor as genocide.
- This international consensus strengthens the moral and legal basis for Canada’s recognition.

#### **3. Designation of the Memorial Day**  
The core provision of the Act is:

> *Throughout Canada, in each and every year, the fourth Saturday in November shall be known as “Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (“Holodomor”) Memorial Day.”*

This day is intended to serve as a **day of remembrance**, not a day of rest or official government activity.

#### **4. Clarification of Legal Status**  
Crucially, the Act explicitly states:

> *Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (“Holodomor”) Memorial Day is not a legal holiday or a non-juridical day.*

This means:
- The day **does not** grant employees a paid day off.
- It is **not** a statutory holiday under Canadian labor or public service law.
- It is a **symbolic, educational, and commemorative** observance.

This distinction is important to avoid misinterpretation and to ensure the day remains focused on remembrance and education rather than economic or administrative convenience.

#### **5. Purpose and Values**  
The Act is grounded in fundamental Canadian values, including:
- **Democracy**
- **Human rights**
- **Multiculturalism**
- **Historical truth and accountability**

It acknowledges that:
- Soviet authorities **suppressed, distorted, or destroyed** information about the Holodomor for decades.
- **Truth and accurate historical records** are now emerging from former Soviet states.
- **Survivors** of the Holodomor have migrated to Canada and have contributed positively to Canadian society—highlighting the importance of honoring their experiences and preserving their testimonies.

### **Significance and Impact**

1. **Educational and Commemorative Role**  
   The Act encourages schools, communities, and public institutions to:
   - Teach about the Holodomor and its historical context.
   - Host events, lectures, exhibitions, or memorial services.
   - Promote dialogue about genocide, human rights, and the dangers of authoritarianism.

2. **Support for Ukrainian Identity and Resilience**  
   By formally recognizing the Holodomor, Canada affirms its support for Ukrainian sovereignty, cultural identity, and the right of nations to self-determination.

3. **Moral and Political Statement**  
   The Act reflects Canada’s commitment to:
   - Condemning all forms of genocide, as affirmed by its ratification of the **1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide**.
   - Upholding historical truth and accountability.

4. **Symbolic Reconciliation**  
   The observance serves as a form of reconciliation with Ukrainian communities, particularly those with historical ties to the region, and strengthens Canada’s role as a global advocate for human rights and justice.

### **Historical and Ethical Context**

The Holodomor is widely recognized by historians, international bodies, and Ukrainian scholars as a **genocidal act**—a systematic campaign of starvation used to eliminate a population and erase national identity. The term *Holodomor* (from the Ukrainian "holod" meaning "famine") reflects the intentional nature of the policy.

The Soviet government:
- Forced Ukrainian peasants into collective farms.
- Seized all grain and food supplies.
- Banned the use of private land and agriculture.
- Used state machinery to suppress dissent and punish resistance.

These actions led to widespread starvation, mass death, and long-term trauma across Ukrainian society.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (“Holodomor”) Memorial Day Act* is a meaningful and principled piece of legislation that:

- **Formally recognizes** the Holodomor as a genocide.
- Establishes a **national day of remembrance** in Canada.
- Emphasizes **historical truth, human rights, and democratic values**.
- Does **not** create a legal holiday, preserving its role as a symbolic and educational observance.

It stands as a testament to Canada’s commitment to justice, memory, and the protection of vulnerable populations—particularly in the face of state-sponsored violence and historical erasure.

### **Final Note**  
This Act is not merely symbolic. It is a vital step in ensuring that future generations understand the dangers of totalitarianism, the importance of protecting cultural and national identities, and the enduring value of human dignity. By honoring the victims of the Holodomor, Canada reaffirms its role as a global leader in human rights and historical accountability.
