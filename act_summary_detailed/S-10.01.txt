### **Detailed Summary of the *Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987***

---

#### **Overview**

The *Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987* (commonly referred to as the **Shipping Conferences Exemption Act**) is a Canadian statute designed to **exempt certain agreements among ocean carriers (shipping conferences)** from the full application of the *Competition Act*, provided that these agreements do not engage in anti-competitive practices. The Act recognizes that **collaborative rate-setting and service coordination among ocean carriers** can promote efficiency, stability, and predictability in international freight transport—particularly in a complex and capital-intensive industry.

However, this exemption is **not absolute**. It applies only under strict conditions and includes significant safeguards to ensure that the exemption does not lead to monopolistic or anti-competitive behavior. The Act also establishes a robust framework for **transparency, accountability, and oversight** by the Canadian Transportation Agency (the "Agency").

## **Main Provisions and Their Significance**

---

### **1. Exemption from the Competition Act (Section 4)**

**Purpose:** To allow ocean carriers to cooperate on pricing and service terms without being subject to full competition law scrutiny—**provided** the agreements meet specific criteria.

#### **Conditions for Exemption:**
The *Competition Act* does **not apply** to a conference agreement or interconference agreement **if** it satisfies **all of the following**:

- Requires members to use a **tariff**.
- Requires members to carry out a **loyalty contract** that:
  - Can be terminated by either party after **90 days’ written notice**;
  - Does **not** impose a dual rate system where the contract rate is **less than 85%** of the non-contract rate;
  - Does **not** require a rebate on transportation charges;
  - Does **not** require shippers to offer all goods to the conference (i.e., no "all goods" exclusivity clause);
- Establishes **terms and conditions** for the use of **service contracts**;
- Allocates **ports** (in Canada or elsewhere) to members for transport;
- Regulates **vessel sailing times** or types of services offered;
- Shares **transportation loads** or **earnings/losses** among members;
- Regulates **admission or expulsion** of ocean carriers from the conference.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This exemption only applies **after** a copy of the agreement is filed with the Agency (Section 6).

#### **Exclusion of Anti-Competitive Conduct**
Even with the exemption, the Act **does not shield** members from the *Competition Act* if they:
- Engage in **anti-competitive pricing** (e.g., selling at unreasonably low prices to eliminate competitors);
- Conspire to **prevent or lessen competition** by refusing to transport goods from shippers using non-conference carriers;
- Refuse to transport goods due to use of non-conference vessels;
- Prevent or limit access to **ports or facilities** by non-member carriers.

> ✅ These practices remain **prohibited under the Competition Act** and are not exempt.

### **2. Filing Requirements (Section 6)**

All members of a conference must file certain documents with the Agency **within strict deadlines**:

| Document | Deadline |
|--------|----------|
| Copy of conference or interconference agreement | Within **one day** of becoming effective |
| Copy of service contract | Within **30 days** of becoming effective |
| Notice of change in membership | Within **30 days** of change |
| Standard form of loyalty contract and amendments | On effectiveness (or within 30 days of amendment) |

> 🔍 **Note:** Oral agreements must be described in writing as required by the Agency.

#### **Certification Requirement**
All filed documents must be **certified as true copies** by a designated person from the conference.

### **3. Notice Requirements for Rate and Tariff Changes (Sections 9 & 10)**

To ensure transparency and allow shippers to plan, members must provide **advance written notice** before changing rates or tariffs:

| Change | Minimum Notice Period |
|-------|------------------------|
| Proposed rate increase | **30 days** before effective date |
| Proposed surcharge or surcharge increase | **14 days** before effective date |
| Amendment to tariff (other than rate increase) | **On or before** the effective date |

> 📌 This gives shippers time to adjust their logistics and pricing strategies.

### **4. Confidentiality and Access to Service Contracts (Section 11)**

- **Strict confidentiality**: No person involved in administering the Act (e.g., Agency staff) may **disclose or allow access** to a **service contract** filed under Section 6.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Other Agency personnel;
  - A person **authorized in writing** by the parties to the service contract.

> 🔐 This protects sensitive commercial terms between shippers and carriers.

### **5. Investigation and Enforcement Powers (Section 13)**

The Agency may investigate complaints if it has reason to believe that:

- A conference agreement or practice:
  - Reduces competition;
  - Causes an **unreasonable reduction in service**;
  - Leads to an **unreasonable increase in transportation costs**.

#### **Investigation Powers Include:**
- Reviewing **service contracts**;
- Holding **public hearings**;
- Deciding matters based on documents alone.

#### **Enforcement Actions:**
If the Agency finds wrongdoing, it may:
- Order removal of the offending clause;
- Require cessation of the practice;
- Issue any other order deemed necessary.

> ⏱️ **Decision Deadline:** 120 days from filing, unless parties agree to an extension.

### **6. Commissioner’s Inquiry Powers (Section 14)**

The **Commissioner of Competition** (under the *Competition Act*) may, on his own initiative or at the Minister of Industry’s direction, conduct an **inquiry into a conference’s operations**.

#### Key Features:
- The inquiry is **deemed an inquiry under Section 10 of the Competition Act**.
- The Commissioner may bring evidence to the Agency for use in investigations under Section 13.
- The Commissioner has broad authority to examine practices that:
  - Limit transportation facilities;
  - Prevent or lessen competition;
  - Restrict trade or commerce.

> 💡 This gives the Competition Commission a proactive role in monitoring potential anti-competitive behavior.
