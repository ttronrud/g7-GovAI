The *Bank for International Settlements (Immunity) Act* was enacted by **Section 140 of Chapter 35 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007**, and came into force on **December 14, 2007**. The Act is officially cited as the *Bank for International Settlements (Immunity) Act*.

**Purpose of the Act**  
The primary purpose of this Act is to confer legal immunities upon the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** — a global financial institution that serves as a forum for central banks to discuss international monetary and financial issues — in accordance with an international treaty to which Canada is a party. Specifically, it grants the BIS and its associated assets immunity from certain legal and enforcement measures, consistent with Canada’s ratification of the Protocol on the Immunities of the Bank for International Settlements on **January 20, 1938**.

**Key Provisions**

1. **Exemption from Measures under Article 1 of the Protocol**  
   The Act provides that the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS), its property, and any property entrusted to it** are exempt from the measures specified in **Article 1 of the Protocol** regarding the immunities of the BIS, which Canada ratified in 1938.  
   - This means that the BIS is protected from certain legal actions, enforcement measures, and judicial proceedings that would otherwise apply to foreign entities or their property.  
   - The exemption is grounded in international obligations and is intended to ensure the BIS can operate freely and without interference in international financial affairs.

2. **Immunity from Jurisdiction in Civil Proceedings**  
   The BIS is **immune from the jurisdiction of any court in Canada** in respect of any **civil proceeding**.  
   - This means that Canadian courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over the BIS in civil matters — such as claims for damages, contracts, or torts — regardless of where the alleged wrongdoing occurred or where the property is located.  
   - This immunity is designed to preserve the BIS’s independence and its ability to conduct international financial operations without legal vulnerability.

3. **Immunity of Property from Attachment and Execution**  
   The BIS’s property, and any property entrusted to it, are **immune from attachment and execution** in any civil proceeding.  
   - This means that Canadian courts cannot seize, freeze, or sell the BIS’s assets to satisfy judgments or claims brought against it.  
   - This protection ensures that the BIS can maintain financial stability and operational continuity, even in the face of potential litigation.

4. **Binding on Her Majesty in Right of Canada**  
   Subsections (1) and (2) — referring to the immunity from jurisdiction and from attachment/execution — are **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada**.  
   - This means that the provisions apply directly to the federal government and are enforceable by the Canadian legal system, regardless of any other domestic or administrative considerations.  
   - The binding nature ensures that the immunities are not subject to discretionary or political override at the federal level.

5. **Conditional Override by the Governor in Council**  
   In exceptional circumstances — specifically, **for reasons of national security** or **to support Canada’s international affairs or the implementation of Canada’s international obligations** — the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may determine that the immunities granted under the Act **do not apply** to the extent specified.  
   - This power allows the government to **temporarily or selectively waive** the BIS’s immunity under the following conditions:  
     - The BIS, its property, and any property entrusted to it are **no longer exempt** from measures under Section 2 (i.e., the international immunity provisions).  
     - The BIS is **no longer immune** from the jurisdiction of Canadian courts in civil proceedings (under subsection 3(1)).  
     - The BIS’s property and entrusted property are **no longer immune** from attachment or execution (under subsection 3(2)).  
   - The waiver must be **specifically determined** by the Governor in Council and must be justified by a clear and compelling reason related to national security or Canada’s international obligations.

**Significance and Implications**

- **International Compliance**: The Act ensures Canada fulfills its international commitments under the 1938 Protocol, which is a cornerstone of international financial cooperation.
- **Operational Independence**: It enables the BIS to function without legal interference, allowing central banks to collaborate freely on global monetary policy and financial stability.
- **Legal Protection**: The immunity shields the BIS and its assets from civil lawsuits or enforcement actions, which is essential for maintaining trust and operational integrity in international financial institutions.
- **Flexibility for National Interests**: The conditional override mechanism provides a critical balance — while preserving the BIS’s immunity, it also allows the Canadian government to intervene in cases where national security or international commitments require it.

**Conclusion**  
The *Bank for International Settlements (Immunity) Act* establishes a robust legal framework that protects the BIS from civil jurisdiction and asset enforcement in Canada, consistent with international treaty obligations. It reflects Canada’s commitment to multilateral financial cooperation while providing a mechanism for the federal government to override these immunities in cases of national security or strategic international interest. This balance between international obligations and domestic sovereignty underscores the Act’s importance in Canada’s financial and diplomatic policy landscape.
