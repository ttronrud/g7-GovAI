The table at the end of the document appears to list **tariff rates** under CIFTA, including:

- **Initial Rate** (possibly the starting point before any adjustments)

- Some products may have **temporary or transitional rates**, with reductions over time.
- The **"Final Rate"** typically reflects the reduced or zero tariff after implementation.
