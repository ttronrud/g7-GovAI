## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the *International Interests in Mobile Equipment (Aircraft Equipment) Act***  
**(An Act to Implement the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment and the Aircraft Protocol with Respect to Aircraft Equipment)**

---

### 🔍 **1. Introduction and Purpose**

This Act, known as the *International Interests in Mobile Equipment (Aircraft Equipment) Act*, is a Canadian law enacted to **implement and give domestic effect** to two international treaties:
- The **Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (the "Convention")**
- The **Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (the "Aircraft Protocol")**

Its primary objective is to **facilitate cross-border financing and leasing of high-value mobile equipment**, particularly **aircraft equipment**, by establishing a clear, predictable, and internationally recognized legal framework for protecting interests in such assets.

By aligning Canadian law with international standards, the Act promotes:
- Asset-based financing
- Leasing and secured transactions
- Mutual recognition of rights across jurisdictions
- Economic efficiency and investor confidence

### ⚖️ **3. Scope and Application**

#### Applicability:

#### Exemptions:
- **Articles 47 to 62 of the Convention** and **Articles XXVI to XXXVII of the Aircraft Protocol** are **excluded** from this Act.

### 🏛️ **4. Legal Effect and Priority Rules**

#### Force of Law:
- Subject to exceptions, the **Convention and Aircraft Protocol have the force of law** in Canada during the period they are in force.
- This means that international interests in aircraft equipment are legally binding and enforceable in Canadian courts.

#### Conflict of Laws:
- If a provision of this Act or the Convention/Aircraft Protocol **conflicts with another Canadian law**, the **international provision prevails**.
- However, **certain federal statutes take precedence** over international provisions, including:
  - *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*
  - *Cannabis Act*
  - *Criminal Code* (Sections 487–490.9, and Part II.1/XII.2)
  - *Export and Import Permits Act*
  - *Special Economic Measures Act*
  - *United Nations Act*
  - Any regulations made under those statutes

> This ensures that national security, public health, and trade controls are not overridden by international interest protections.

### 🚨 **5. Enforcement and Remedies**

#### Remedies Available to a Chargee (Creditor):
When a debtor defaults on obligations under a security agreement, title reservation, or leasing agreement, the creditor (chargee) may:
1. **Take possession or control** of the aircraft object
2. **Sell or lease** the object
3. **Collect income or profits** generated from the object (e.g., operating revenue)

> These remedies are to be exercised in a **commercially reasonable manner**, meaning:
- In line with the terms of the original agreement
- Not manifestly unreasonable
- In accordance with market practices

#### Prior Notice Requirements:
Before selling or leasing the object, the chargee must provide **reasonable prior written notice** to:
- **Interested persons** (defined in Article 1(m) of the Protocol), including:
  - Debtors
  - Surety guarantors
  - Credit insurers
  - Other parties with rights in the object
- **Parties who have previously notified** the chargee of their interest

> This protects third-party rights and ensures transparency.

#### Distribution of Proceeds:
- Any proceeds from the sale or lease are **applied first to the secured obligations**.
- If proceeds **exceed** the secured amount and reasonable costs, the **surplus must be distributed**:
  - First to **subsequently ranking registered interests**
  - Then, any remaining balance is paid to the **original debtor (chargor)**

> This ensures fair treatment among multiple creditors.

#### Transfer of Ownership:
- After default, the chargee and interested parties may agree (or a court may order) that **ownership of the aircraft object vests in the chargee** to satisfy the secured obligation.
- The court will only grant such an order if:
  - The value of the object is **sufficient to cover** the secured obligations
  - After accounting for payments to other interested parties

> This provides a clear path for creditors to realize their claims without needing to go through lengthy litigation.

#### Discharge of Security Interest:
- After default, the **debtor or any interested party** can **discharge** the security interest by paying the full amount secured.
- If payment is made by someone **other than the debtor**, that person becomes **subrogated** to the chargee’s rights.

> This allows third-party financing or restructuring to occur without undermining creditor protection.

### 🌐 **6. International Framework: The Convention and Aircraft Protocol**

#### Background:
The Convention and Aircraft Protocol were developed by the **International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT)** to:
- Create a **global system** for registering and protecting interests in mobile equipment
- Ensure **uniformity and predictability** in cross-border transactions
- Promote **autonomy of parties** in asset-based financing and leasing

#### Key Principles:
- **International interest** applies when:
  - The agreement is in writing
  - The object is uniquely identifiable
  - The debtor has power to dispose of it
  - The secured obligations are determinable (without specifying a sum)

> This allows flexibility while maintaining enforceability.

#### Applicability:
- Applies when the **debtor is located in a Contracting State** (i.e., a country party to the Convention).
- The **creditor’s location** (even outside a Contracting State) does not affect applicability.

> This supports international financing where foreign lenders provide security for Canadian or global aircraft operations.

#### Categories of Mobile Equipment Covered:
1. **Aircraft objects** (airframes, engines, helicopters)
2. **Railway rolling stock**
3. **Space assets**

> This Act focuses specifically on **aircraft equipment**, though the broader Convention covers other categories.

#### Role of the International Registry:
- A centralized, international database where interests in mobile equipment are registered.
- Ensures **visibility and transparency** of claims.
- Prevents fraud and double claims.
- All registered interests are visible to interested parties and courts.

> Registration is mandatory for certain interests (e.g., security interests, non-consensual rights), and failure to register may limit enforceability.
