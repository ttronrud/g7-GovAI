**Detailed Summary of the Act:**

This act, enacted by Her Majesty in Canada with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, establishes a special provision allowing a retired judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario to receive an immediate annuity upon resigning from the judiciary to assume the office of Ombudsman of Ontario. The provision is tailored to a specific individual — Mr. Justice Donald Raymond Morand — and is designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment in the transition from judicial to public service roles, while addressing financial and administrative responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanation:**

#### **1. Eligibility and Grant of Immediate Annuity**
- **Who is eligible?**  
  The provision applies specifically to **Mr. Justice Donald Raymond Morand**, a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario who:
  - Has served in office for **more than fifteen years**.
  - Has **not yet reached the age of sixty-five years**.
  - **Resigns** his judicial office to assume the position of **Ombudsman of Ontario**.

- **Nature of the annuity:**  
  Upon resignation, the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on ministerial authority) may grant Mr. Justice Morand an **immediate annuity**.
  - This annuity is set at the **maximum amount** that could have been granted to him under **Section 23 of the Judges Act** if he had reached the age of sixty-five years **before** he resigned.
  - The key point is that the annuity is **immediate** — it begins upon resignation — and is not deferred until retirement age.

- **Legal equivalence:**  
  The annuity granted under this act is **deemed to be granted under paragraph 23(1)(a) of the Judges Act**. This means that even though the annuity is granted under a separate act, it is treated legally as if it were a direct result of the Judges Act’s provisions. This provides legal certainty and ensures that the judge receives the same rights and benefits as if he had retired under normal judicial retirement rules.

#### **2. Conditions for Granting the Annuity**
The annuity may **only** be granted **if** the following condition is met:

> **Federal-Provincial Agreement on Reimbursement**

- The **Government of Canada** must first enter into an **agreement with the Government of Ontario**.
- Under this agreement, the **Government of Ontario undertakes to reimburse**:
  - The **amount of the annuity**.
  - Any **other related benefits** payable to Mr. Justice Morand or on his behalf (e.g., health benefits, pension contributions, administrative costs, etc.).

- The reimbursement period covers the time from:
  - The **day he resigns** as a judge and assumes the office of Ombudsman.
  - To the **earlier of**:
    1. The day he **reaches the age of sixty-five**,
    2. The day he **resigns** from the office of Ombudsman,
    3. The day he is **removed** from office due to a **permanent infirmity** that prevents him from performing his duties,
    4. The day he **dies**.

> This means that the reimbursement obligation is **time-limited** and ends when one of these events occurs — ensuring that the financial responsibility is not indefinite.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

This act serves several important purposes:

1. **Recognition of Service and Transition:**  
   It acknowledges the long tenure and public service of Mr. Justice Morand (over 15 years), and provides a financial incentive to transition into a new public office (Ombudsman), which is a significant public service role.

2. **Ensuring Financial Fairness:**  
   By allowing an immediate annuity equivalent to what a judge would receive at age 65, the act ensures that Morand is not financially disadvantaged by stepping down early from the judiciary to take on a different public role.

3. **Provincial Responsibility and Fiscal Accountability:**  
   The requirement that Ontario reimburse Canada ensures that the federal government does not bear the full cost of the annuity during the period of transition. It shifts the financial burden to the province, which is more directly responsible for the Ombudsman’s role and the public service system.

4. **Legal Clarity and Consistency:**  
   By deeming the annuity as if granted under Section 23(1)(a) of the Judges Act, the act ensures that the benefits are recognized under the existing legal framework, avoiding ambiguity or potential challenges in court.

5. **Protection of Public Interest:**  
   The condition that the annuity is only granted if Ontario agrees to cover the costs ensures that the transition does not create a financial burden on the federal government or undermine fiscal responsibility.

### **Limitations and Scope**

- This provision is **not general** — it applies **only to Mr. Justice Donald Raymond Morand**.
- It is **not applicable to other judges** or to other individuals transitioning into public office.
- It is **conditional** on a specific agreement between the federal and provincial governments.
- The annuity is **not retroactive** — it begins upon resignation.
- The annuity is **not payable after age 65** — it ends when the individual reaches 65 or resigns or is removed due to disability or death.

### **Conclusion**

This act is a **targeted, transitional measure** designed to support a long-serving judge in transitioning from the judiciary to a new public service role. It ensures financial fairness, respects the legal framework of the Judges Act, and imposes a clear fiscal responsibility on the provincial government through a binding reimbursement agreement. While narrow in scope, it reflects a pragmatic approach to balancing judicial retirement benefits with public service transitions and intergovernmental fiscal accountability.

It is a model of **specific, well-structured legislation** that addresses both individual merit and institutional responsibility.
