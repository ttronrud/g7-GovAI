**Detailed Summary of the *Hibernia Development Project Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Hibernia Development Project Act* (HDP Act) is a federal statute enacted in Canada to provide the legal framework for the development, financing, and operation of the **Hibernia Development Project**, a major offshore oil exploration and production initiative located in the **North Atlantic**, specifically in the **offshore area of Newfoundland**.

The Act was passed on **November 9, 1990** (as referenced in the note), and came into force on a date set by the Governor in Council. It establishes a comprehensive set of rules governing the rights, responsibilities, financial obligations, legal jurisdiction, and regulatory oversight associated with the Hibernia project — one of Canada’s largest offshore oil developments.

This Act operates under a unique **federal-provincial partnership model**, recognizing both the federal government’s role in national resource management and Newfoundland’s distinct legal and economic interests in the offshore area.
