The **Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act** is a comprehensive federal law enacted by the Parliament of Canada to address climate change through a national, market-based mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the Act, covering its background, key provisions, definitions, objectives, and implications.

## 🔍 **Overview of the Act**

**Title:** *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act*  
**Enacted:** By Parliament of Canada  
**Purpose:** To establish a **federal greenhouse gas emissions pricing system** that applies across Canada, ensuring consistent and effective action to reduce GHG emissions in line with international commitments and national climate goals.

This Act is grounded in scientific evidence and international obligations, aiming to create financial incentives for businesses and individuals to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, and transition to cleaner technologies.

## 📚 **Background and Legislative Context**

The Act begins with a series of **"whereas" clauses**, setting out the foundational reasons for its creation. These include:

1. **Scientific Consensus:** There is broad scientific agreement that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are driving global climate change.
2. **Historic Emissions Levels:** Current emissions are at record highs, posing unprecedented risks to ecosystems, human health, food security, and economic stability.
3. **Widespread Impacts in Canada:** Climate change is already affecting Canadians—especially Indigenous communities, low-income populations, northern, coastal, and remote areas—through rising heatwaves, floods, droughts, coastal erosion, and permafrost thaw.
4. **Intergenerational Responsibility:** The current generation has a duty to protect future generations from the harms of climate change.
5. **International Commitments:**
   - Canada ratified the **UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)**, which aims to stabilize GHG concentrations to prevent "dangerous anthropogenic interference."
   - Canada also ratified the **Paris Agreement**, which sets targets to limit global warming to **well below 2°C**, and ideally **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels.
6. **National Strategy:** The **Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change** identifies climate change as a national issue requiring coordinated action across all levels of government, industry, and citizens.
7. **Core Policy Tool:** Greenhouse gas emissions pricing is identified as a central component of this framework.
8. **Need for Federal Action:** Despite some provinces implementing emissions pricing, gaps in coverage or stringency threaten environmental and public health outcomes. A **federal scheme is necessary** to ensure uniform, robust, and equitable emissions pricing nationwide.

## 🏛️ **Key Provisions and Structure**

### 1. **Applicability and Scope**
- The Act applies **across Canada**, including all provinces and territories.
- It creates a **federal emissions pricing system** that will apply **in all provinces** where there is no existing or adequate provincial pricing scheme.
- The system is designed to **complement** existing provincial systems rather than replace them, ensuring consistency and avoiding a patchwork of policies.

> **Note:** The Act defines specific "listed provinces" (in Part 1 of Schedule 1) where the pricing regime applies. These are the provinces that are subject to the federal scheme.

---

### 2. **Core Mechanism: Emissions Pricing**

The Act establishes a **carbon pricing system** based on the principle of **"polluter pays"**—emitters who produce greenhouse gases must pay a fee proportional to the emissions they generate.

#### Key Features:
- **Pricing is time-based and increases over time**, reflecting rising emission reduction targets and climate risks.
- The price starts at a baseline level and is **indexed to inflation and emissions reductions**, with regular increases to ensure long-term effectiveness.
- Pricing applies to **specific fuels and activities** (as defined in the Act), including:
  - Transportation (air, marine, rail)
  - Power generation
  - Industrial processes
  - Residential and commercial energy use

#### Fuel Coverage:
The Act defines which substances are subject to pricing under **Schedule 2**, including:
- Gasoline
- Diesel (heavy fuel oil)
- Natural gas
- Aviation fuels (aviation gasoline, aviation turbo fuel)
- Biogasoline and biodiesel
- Coal (high and low heat value)
- Methanol
- Gas liquids (e.g., ethane, propane, butane)
- Naphtha
- Combustible waste (e.g., tires, asphalt shingles)

> *Note:* Certain uses are **exempt**, such as fuel used as a raw material in industrial processes or as a solvent (non-covered activities).

### 3. **Application to Different Sectors**

#### A. **Transportation**
- **Covered air journeys:** Flights within a listed province or between specific locations (e.g., domestic flights).
- **Covered marine journeys:** Vessels traveling within a listed province.
- **Interjurisdictional carriers** (e.g., airlines or shipping companies operating across provinces or internationally) are subject to pricing on fuels used in **excluded journeys** (e.g., flights starting or ending outside the province).
- **Rail carriers** must pay for fuel used in interprovincial or cross-border rail services.

> This ensures that transportation emissions are priced fairly, regardless of where the journey begins or ends.

#### B. **Farming and Fishing**
- **Eligible farming activities** (e.g., operating tractors, farm trucks) are subject to pricing.
- **Eligible farming machinery** includes farm tractors, farm trucks, and stationary engines—not automobiles or heating/cooling equipment.
- **Fishing vessels** used for fishing are covered, but only when used for active fishing operations.

> These provisions aim to support sustainable agriculture and fisheries while reducing emissions from farm and fishing equipment.

#### C. **Energy and Industry**
- Emissions from burning fuels in boilers, furnaces, and power generation are included.
- The system applies to **marketable natural gas** and other fossil fuels used in energy production.

---

### 4. **Exemptions and Special Rules**

- **Non-covered activities** include:
  - Fuel used as a raw material in industrial processes (e.g., in refining or chemical production).
  - Fuel used as a solvent or diluent in transporting crude bitumen.
  - Fuel not burned or flared in energy systems.

> These exemptions recognize that some fuel use is essential for industrial operations and may not be directly linked to emissions.

- **Combustible waste** (like tires or shingles) is excluded from pricing **only if** it is not burned or used in a fuel system.

---

### 5. **Pricing and Financial Administration**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** administers the Act.
- The **Commissioner of Revenue** (Canada Revenue Agency) is responsible for enforcing compliance and collecting fees.
- A **"net charge"** is calculated for each reporting period, based on emissions and fuel usage.
- Fees are collected through a **mandatory assessment** on businesses and individuals who use covered fuels.

> The system includes **reassessments** to ensure accuracy and fairness over time.

---

### 6. **Delivery and Compliance**

- A **"delivery"** of fuel is defined broadly—any availability of fuel for use.
- **Confirmed delivery service** (e.g., certified mail) is required for notifying parties of assessments or changes in pricing.
- The Act includes mechanisms for **enforcement**, including penalties for non-compliance.

---

### 7. **Adjustment Days**

- The Act defines **"adjustment days"** (e.g., January 1, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and future prescribed days) when the pricing structure may be adjusted.
- These allow for periodic updates to pricing, reflecting changes in emissions targets, inflation, or scientific understanding.

## 🚩 **Challenges and Considerations**

1. **Provincial Disparities:**
   - Some provinces already have carbon pricing systems (e.g., British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec), while others (e.g., Alberta) do not.
   - The federal system aims to **level the playing field** and prevent carbon leakage (where businesses move to provinces with weaker regulations).

2. **Equity Concerns:**
   - Small businesses and low-income households may face higher costs.
   - The Act includes **offset mechanisms** (e.g., rebates, tax credits) to mitigate these impacts.

3. **Implementation and Enforcement:**
   - Requires coordination between federal and provincial governments.
   - Needs clear reporting, monitoring, and compliance systems.

4. **Scientific and Technological Evolution:**
   - The Act allows for future adjustments as new data or technologies emerge.
