### **Detailed Summary of the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act***  
*(Cited as: Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act)*

---

## **Overview**

The **Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act** (FOAEAA) is a federal statute enacted to facilitate the **enforcement of family-related orders and agreements** across provincial boundaries in Canada. It enables the **searching and release of certain personal and financial information** from designated information banks to assist in:

- Establishing or varying **support provisions** (e.g., child support, spousal support),
- Enforcing **parenting, custody, access, and contact rights**, and
- Investigating **child abduction**.

The Act operates through a **cooperative framework between the federal government and provincial authorities**, supported by **information banks** that store data on individuals involved in family law matters.

It is designed to **ensure consistency, efficiency, and legal compliance** when enforcing family law provisions across jurisdictions, particularly where parties reside in different provinces.

## **Core Provisions and Operational Framework**

### **1. Agreements Between Federal Government and Provinces**

- The **Minister of Justice** (with Governor in Council approval) may enter into **agreements with each province** under **section 3**.
- These agreements allow for:
  - The **searching and release of information** from information banks.
  - The **establishment of safeguards** to protect personal information released under the Act.
- Agreements must include **robust privacy and data protection measures** to ensure that sensitive family law information is not misused.

> These agreements are essential for the operation of the Act and define the scope of information sharing and the responsibilities of all parties.

---

### **2. Designation of Key Entities**

Under section 3, the Minister and a province may jointly designate:

- **Provincial Child Support Services** (to calculate child support),
- **Provincial Enforcement Services** (to enforce family provisions),
- **Designated Authorities** (to process inter-jurisdictional support applications),
- **Central Authorities** (to act on international conventions).

These designated entities can apply to the Minister to access information from information banks to assist in their work.

> This creates a **clear hierarchy and delegation of authority**, ensuring that only authorized bodies can access sensitive data.

---

### **3. Agreements with Police Forces**

- The Minister may enter into an agreement with **any police force in Canada** to allow them to search information banks in cases of **child abduction**.
- Such agreements must include **safeguards** to protect privacy and prevent misuse of information.

> This provision strengthens the federal government’s ability to respond to child abduction cases involving cross-provincial or cross-border elements.

---

### **4. Special Provision for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Contributors**

- The **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, with Governor in Council approval, may enter into agreements with provinces offering **comprehensive pension plans** (e.g., CPP).
- These agreements enable:
  - The creation of a **central information bank** under the Department of Employment and Social Development (DoESD).
  - Release of information about **CPP contributors and beneficiaries** to support enforcement of family orders.
- This is a **unique exception** allowing access to pension data for enforcement purposes.

> The purpose is to ensure that individuals who receive CPP benefits (e.g., retirees, disabled persons) are not evading support obligations due to lack of financial visibility.

---

### **5. Application Process for Information Release**

Applications for information release must:

- Be in a **form approved by the Minister**.
- Contain **information prescribed by regulations**.

#### **Types of Applications**

| Application Type | Purpose |
|------------------|--------|
| **Support Provision (Establishment/Variation)** | To establish or vary child or spousal support. |
| **Family Provision Enforcement** | To enforce parenting, custody, contact, or access rights. |
| **Child Abduction Investigation** | To locate a missing child or suspect. |
| **Support Calculation** | To recalculate child support amounts. |
| **Inter-jurisdictional Support Processing** | To assist in processing support applications where parties live in different provinces. |

#### **Requirements for Applications**

- **Affidavit** must:
  - State reasons for the application.
  - Identify the person or child involved.
  - Alleges a breach (in enforcement cases).
  - Include particulars of the breach or the person’s location.
- In **ex parte applications** (made without the other party present):
  - The applicant must:
    - Show **reasonable steps were taken** to locate the person or child.
    - Provide **criminal record checks** (if individual applicant).
    - State that the sole purpose is to obtain information for support or enforcement.
    - Disclose any existing **restrictions on contact**, **threats**, or **criminal charges**.

---

### **6. Court Authorization and Ex Parte Procedures**

- A **court** may authorize an **official of the court** to make an application under **section 12** (to access information banks) if it is satisfied that:
  1. The sole purpose is to obtain information for support or enforcement of a family provision.
  2. The order will not jeopardize the safety or security of any person.
  3. In ex parte cases, the required **reasonable steps** have been taken to locate the individual or child.

> The court has discretion to **protect privacy** and **safeguard vulnerable individuals**.

#### **Ex Parte Protection Measures**

- In ex parte cases by individuals, the court **may order** that:
  - The **Minister does not send** a copy of the authorization order or a notice to the person involved.
  - This prevents the person from being notified and potentially reacting to the application.

> This protects the individual from sudden exposure and potential harassment.
