**Detailed Summary of the *Coastal Fisheries Protection Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Coastal Fisheries Protection Act* (CFPA) is a Canadian statute designed to protect and sustainably manage fish stocks—particularly those that are migratory or straddling across national boundaries—by enforcing strict controls on foreign fishing vessels operating in Canadian fisheries waters and adjacent international areas. It establishes legal frameworks to prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, ensures compliance with international conservation and management measures, and strengthens Canada’s ability to enforce fisheries laws both domestically and internationally.

The Act is most notably focused on **straddling fish stocks**, such as those found on the **Grand Banks of Newfoundland**, which are vital to global food security and the livelihoods of coastal communities. It operates in tandem with international agreements, especially the *Fish Stocks Agreement* and the *Port State Measures Agreement*, to ensure that fishing activities do not undermine conservation efforts.

## **Key Definitions and Key Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Canadian fisheries waters** | All waters within Canada’s fishing zones, territorial sea, and internal waters. |
| **Canadian fishing vessel** | A vessel registered or licensed under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, or owned by Canadian citizens/residents/corporations with principal business in Canada. |
| **Fish** | Includes all parts, derivatives, eggs, larvae, and juvenile stages of fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and marine animals. |
| **Fishing vessel** | Any vessel used for fishing, processing, transporting fish, marine plants, or servicing foreign fleets. |
| **Foreign fishing vessel** | Any fishing vessel that is not a Canadian fishing vessel. |
| **Flag state** | The country whose flag a fishing vessel is legally entitled to fly. |
| **Fishing vessel without nationality** | A vessel that lacks proper registration, sails under an unauthorized flag, or flies flags not recognized internationally. |
| **Straddling stock** | A fish stock that migrates beyond national boundaries and exists both within and beyond Canadian waters (e.g., Atlantic cod). |
| **NAFO Regulatory Area** | A defined area in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of St. Lawrence where international fisheries management applies, including parts of the high seas. |
| **Fisheries management organization (FMO)** | An intergovernmental body (e.g., NAFO) established to manage fish stocks across multiple states. |
| **Protection officer** | A person authorized (e.g., fishery officer, RCMP member, or by Governor in Council) to enforce the Act. |

> **Note:** Several definitions (e.g., "participating state," "straddling stock") were repealed in 2015 (c. 18, s. 2), and the current definitions reflect updated international frameworks.

## **Core Provisions and Legal Framework**

### **1. Prohibition on Unauthorized Entry into Canadian Fisheries Waters**

> **Section 4(1):**  
No foreign fishing vessel may enter Canadian fisheries waters for any purpose unless authorized by:
- This Act,
- Regulations,
- Another Canadian law, or
- A treaty.

> **Section 4(2):**  
No person aboard a foreign fishing vessel (or crew member) may:
- Fish or prepare to fish,
- Unload, land, or tranship fish or supplies,
- Ship or discharge crew members,
- Purchase bait or supplies,
- Take or prepare to take marine plants,

**unless authorized** by law, regulation, or treaty.

> **Section 4(3):**  
No person aboard a foreign fishing vessel may fish for a **sedentary species** (organisms immobile on or under the seabed) **beyond** Canadian fisheries waters unless authorized.

> **Definition of sedentary species:**  
Living organisms that are immobile at harvestable stages or unable to move without physical contact with the seabed.

> **Section 4(4):**  
Canadian fishing vessels may not bring fish from foreign vessels into Canadian waters **unless authorized by regulation**.

### **2. Protection of Straddling Stocks (Section 5.2)**

> **Purpose:**  
Parliament declares that:
- Straddling stocks (e.g., Atlantic cod) on the Grand Banks are a major renewable food source.
- These stocks are under threat of extinction.
- There is an urgent need for **sound conservation and management** in both Canadian waters and the **NAFO Regulatory Area**.
- Some foreign vessels continue to fish in ways that undermine conservation efforts.

> **Key provisions:**
- **No foreign fishing vessel of a prescribed class** may fish or prepare to fish for a straddling stock **in contravention of prescribed conservation and management measures**.
- The Governor in Council may **prescribe**:
  - Which fish stocks are straddling stocks,
  - Which classes of foreign vessels are subject to restrictions,
  - Specific conservation and management measures (e.g., catch limits, seasonal closures) to be followed,
  - These measures must ensure compliance with the **Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (Ottawa 1978)**.

> This provision allows Canada to take **urgent domestic action** to protect stocks while continuing to seek long-term international cooperation.

### **3. Compliance with International Agreements (Sections 5.3 and 5.4)**

> **Section 5.3:**  
Foreign fishing vessels of a **state party to the Fish Stocks Agreement** (FSAA) may not:
- Contravene a conservation or management measure designated in a regional fisheries management organization (FMO),
- Conceal, tamper with, or dispose of evidence of contravention,
- Conceal their identity or registration (e.g., false markings).

> **Section 5.4:**  
Foreign fishing vessels of a state party to any treaty or arrangement described in **paragraph 6(f)** (e.g., Port State Measures Agreement) may not:
- Contravene designated conservation or management measures,
- Fish or prepare to fish in designated areas.

> **Section 5.5:**  
Fishing vessels **without nationality** are prohibited from:
- Fishing or preparing to fish in designated areas under the FSAA or other treaties,
- Contravening any conservation or management measures in those areas.

> **Section 5.6:**  
No person may:
- Import fish or marine plants **knowing** they were taken, harvested, transported, or sold in violation of:
  - International fisheries treaties (including enforcement measures),
  - Conservation or management measures of FMOs Canada is not a member of (as prescribed by regulation),
  - Laws of foreign states.

> **Section 5.7:**  
No person may **transport, sell, distribute, or accept delivery** of fish or marine plants **if they know** they were obtained illegally.

> **Section 5.8:**  
All fish and marine plants imported must be accompanied by **required documentation** (as prescribed by regulation).

### **4. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**

The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on ministerial advice) may make detailed regulations to implement the Act. Key regulatory powers include:

| Regulatory Power | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Licensing and Permits** | Authorize foreign vessels or individuals to enter Canadian waters for specific purposes (e.g., inspection, compliance). |
| **Issuance, Suspension, Cancellation** | Set rules for issuing, revoking, or suspending licenses/permits, including fees and terms. |
| **Prescribe Straddling Stocks** | Define which fish stocks are straddling (e.g., cod, herring). |
| **Prescribe Classes of Vessels** | Identify which foreign vessels are subject to restrictions (e.g., vessels over 100 m, vessels from certain countries). |
| **Prescribe Conservation Measures** | Enforce specific rules (e.g., gear restrictions, catch limits, closed seasons). |
| **Prescribe FMOs** | Identify fisheries management organizations (e.g., NAFO) for which Canada is not a member, to apply their measures. |
| **Use of Force** | Define when and how protection officers may use force (e.g., to board a vessel). |
| **Forms for Proceedings** | Allow alternative forms to those in the *Criminal Code* (e.g., for fishery offenses). |
| **Enforcement Powers** | Appoint persons to enforce the Act, secure seized vessels or property. |
| **Documentation Requirements** | Specify required import documentation. |
| **Implementation of International Agreements** | Incorporate and apply conservation measures from FMOs or treaties (e.g., NAFO, Port State Measures Agreement), designate areas, and define enforcement procedures. |
| **Enforcement Action by Foreign States** | Empower the Minister to authorize a foreign state party to take enforcement action against a **Canadian fishing vessel** (e.g., if it violates a treaty). |
| **Cost Recovery** | Permit Canada to recover reasonable costs incurred due to the detention of a foreign fishing vessel in port. |

> These regulations provide **flexibility and adaptability** to respond to evolving threats, scientific findings, and international developments.
