**Detailed Summary of the *World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted in 1994 to implement Canada’s obligations under the **Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement)**, which was signed at Marrakesh on April 15, 1994, as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

This Act provides the legal framework for Canada to fully participate in and comply with the new multilateral trading system governed by the WTO, ensuring that Canada’s domestic laws and policies align with international trade rules. It also establishes procedural mechanisms for managing trade disputes, enforcing obligations, and managing Canada’s role in global trade negotiations.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Purpose and Background (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with a series of "Whereas" clauses that establish the rationale for the legislation:

- **Multilateral Trade System**: Canada recognizes that free, fair, and open trade is essential for economic competitiveness, long-term sustainable development, job creation, consumer choice, and the strength of the Canadian economic union.
- **GATT and Uruguay Round**: The Uruguay Round led to the creation of the WTO, replacing GATT as the central institution for international trade regulation. The resulting agreements are intended to create a more open, stable, and predictable trading environment across all sectors—agriculture, resources, manufacturing, services, technology, and investment.
- **WTO as a Successor to GATT**: The WTO will manage the multilateral trading system, including dispute resolution and future negotiations.
- **Need for Legal Implementation**: To give effect to these international obligations, Canada must amend or update its domestic laws.

These clauses reflect a strong policy commitment to globalization and integration into the rules-based international trade order.

#### **2. Definitions (Section 2)**

The Act defines key terms used throughout:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the full WTO Agreement, including all annexes (1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 3) and any annexes (Annex 4) accepted by Canada. These constitute the "Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round."
- **Federal Law**: Any statute, regulation, order, or instrument made under powers granted by Parliament.
- **Minister**: The member of the Queen’s Privy Council designated for specific duties under the Act (as per Section 9).
- **World Trade Organization (WTO)**: The international body established under Article I of the Agreement.
- **WTO Member**: A country or territory that is a member of the WTO.

> This clarity ensures consistent interpretation of the Act and its relationship to international obligations.

---

#### **3. Publication and Legal Force**

- The Agreement is to be published in the **Canada Treaty Series**, making it officially accessible and part of Canada’s legal record.
- The Act is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada**, meaning it has full legal authority and applies to all levels of government and individuals within Canada.

---

#### **4. No Direct Legal Action Against the Agreement (Section 4)**

A critical provision:

> *No person has any cause of action, and no proceedings shall be taken without the consent of the Attorney General of Canada, to enforce or determine any right or obligation arising solely under or by virtue of Part I or any order made under Part I of the Act or the Agreement.*

This means:
- Individuals or private parties **cannot sue** to enforce rights or obligations derived directly from the WTO Agreement.
- The **Attorney General of Canada** has exclusive authority to determine whether such rights exist and whether legal action is appropriate.
- This protects the integrity of the multilateral system by preventing unilateral litigation that could undermine international cooperation.

> This is a standard feature in WTO implementation laws, designed to ensure that disputes are handled through formal diplomatic and legal channels rather than domestic courts.

---

#### **5. Exclusion of Water (Section 5)**

> *Nothing in this Act or the Agreement applies to water, except the Canadian Schedule to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Annex 1A).*

- **Definition of "water"**: Includes natural surface and ground water in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, but **excludes bottled water or water in tanks**.
- This exclusion reflects the fact that water is a matter of environmental and public policy, not trade policy.
- The only exception is the **Canadian Schedule to GATT 1994 (Annex 1A)**, which may contain specific trade-related provisions for water (e.g., in agriculture or processing).

> This prevents the WTO framework from being applied to essential natural resources like water, preserving national sovereignty over environmental and public health issues.

---

#### **6. Appointment of Officials (Section 7–9)**

- **Minister Designation (Section 7)**: The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may designate a member of the Privy Council as the **Minister** responsible for implementing the Act.
- **Ministerial Conference Representative (Section 8)**: The Governor in Council may appoint a Canadian representative to the **Ministerial Conference** under Article IV of the WTO Agreement (the highest-level meeting of WTO members).
- **Other Committees and Bodies (Section 9)**: The Minister may appoint individuals to represent Canada on **any other committees, councils, or bodies** established under the Agreement.

> These provisions ensure Canada has the necessary institutional capacity to participate in WTO decision-making and governance.

---

#### **7. Financial Obligations (Section 10)**

> *The Government of Canada shall pay its appropriate share of any expenditures incurred by or on behalf of the World Trade Organization.*

- Canada is required to contribute financially to the operations of the WTO.
- The exact amount is determined based on Canada’s trade volume, economic size, and other factors, as agreed under the WTO structure.
- This reflects Canada’s commitment to a shared, multilateral system where all members contribute to the functioning of the organization.

#### **8. Suspension Powers (Section 11–12)**

This is one of the most significant and sensitive provisions of the Act.

##### **(a) Suspension of Concessions (Section 11)**  
The Governor in Council may, by order, suspend the application of **Canadian concessions or obligations** to a WTO Member under **Article 22 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (Annex 2)**, if a dispute arises.

The powers include:
- Suspending rights or privileges granted to that WTO Member (e.g., market access, investment rights).
- Modifying or suspending the application of federal laws regarding that Member.
- Extending the application of federal laws to that Member.
- Taking any other measure the Governor in Council deems necessary.

> This power allows Canada to **protect its domestic interests** in cases where a WTO member is violating trade rules or engaging in unfair practices (e.g., dumping, subsidies, or protectionism). It is a form of **trade defense** within the multilateral system.

##### **(b) Application to Non-Member Countries (Section 12)**  
The same powers apply to **non-WTO Members** (e.g., states or customs territories that may become members in the future).

> This ensures Canada can respond to trade practices of non-members in a manner consistent with its international obligations.

##### **(c) Duration of Orders**  
Unless repealed, such orders remain in effect for the period specified in the order.

##### **(d) Requirement of Compliance with the Agreement**  
No order may be made unless the Governor in Council is satisfied that the **WTO Agreement is in force**.

> This safeguards against arbitrary or premature use of suspension powers and ensures that such actions are taken only when the multilateral framework is active and applicable.

> **Note**: These powers are a **last resort** and are strictly limited to situations where a WTO member or potential member is violating agreed-upon rules.

---

#### **9. Implementation and Entry into Force (Section 13)**

- The Act and its provisions come into force on a date or dates to be **determined by order of the Governor in Council**.
- This allows for phased implementation, ensuring that institutions, regulations, and officials are ready to operate under the new regime.

> This flexibility is crucial given the complexity of integrating international trade rules into domestic law.

---

#### **10. Amendments and Repeals (Section 14–15)**

The Act includes detailed historical notes on amendments and repeals:

- **SI/95-5 to SI/95-88**: Various sections came into force in 1995 (e.g., Sections 1–47, 50–55, 70–91, etc.), with some provisions introduced in August 1995.
- **SI/96-1 and SI/96-3**: Additional provisions came into force in 1996.
- **Repeal in 2008 (c. 20, s. 3)**: Sections 212 to 219 and Schedules II and III were repealed before coming into force.

> This shows that the Act has evolved over time, with some parts being updated or replaced to reflect changes in trade policy, legal interpretation, or international developments.

> The 2008 repeal indicates that certain provisions were no longer relevant or were superseded by newer legislation.
