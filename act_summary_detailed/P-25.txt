---

### **Act Title and Citation**  
The Act is titled the *Prohibition of International Air Services Act* and may be cited accordingly. This legislation establishes a legal framework to restrict or prohibit certain international air services between Canada and foreign states that are deemed to be in "default" under specific conditions related to international aviation law and the handling of unlawful acts on board aircraft.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Air Carrier**  
   - Defined as *any person who operates a commercial air service*.  
   - This includes airlines, both domestic and international, engaged in commercial flight operations for hire or reward.  
   - Excludes entities operating solely in military, customs, or police capacities.

2. **Aircraft**  
   - Refers to *any aircraft used for commercial purposes*, excluding those used in military, customs, or police operations.  
   - The scope is limited to commercial aviation, ensuring the Act does not interfere with government or law enforcement use of aircraft.

3. **Commercial Air Service**  
   - Defined as *any use of aircraft for hire or reward*.  
   - This broad definition covers scheduled flights, charter services, and other commercial operations involving payment or compensation.

4. **Applicability**  
   - The Act is binding on *Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province*.  
   - This means it applies at both the federal and provincial levels, with provincial governments subject to its provisions.

### **Core Provision: Prohibition of Air Services (Section 4)**

When the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** certifies to the **Governor in Council** that a foreign state is in default (as defined below), the Governor in Council may issue an order to prohibit specific air carrier activities involving Canada and that state.

#### **Activities That May Be Prohibited**  
The Governor in Council may prohibit the following actions by air carriers:

1. **Operating commercial air services** between Canada and the defaulting state.  
   - This includes all scheduled or charter flights between Canada and the offending country.

2. **If the air carrier is from the defaulting state**, operating commercial air services between Canada and *any other state*.  
   - This is a significant restriction: even if the carrier is from the defaulting country, it cannot operate flights to or from *any* third country via Canada.

3. **Flying across Canadian territory** if the flight originates from or terminates in the defaulting state.  
   - This prevents the aircraft from entering or passing through Canadian airspace.

4. **Landing in Canada** if the flight originates from or terminates in the defaulting state.  
   - Prevents the aircraft from touching down in Canadian airports.

5. **If the air carrier is from the defaulting state**, flying across Canadian territory.  
   - Applies to the movement of aircraft from or to the defaulting state.

6. **If the air carrier is from the defaulting state**, landing in Canada.  
   - Restricts the ability of foreign carriers (from the defaulting state) to land in Canada.

> These prohibitions are applied *in accordance with the circumstances*, allowing for flexibility in implementation based on the severity and nature of the default.

### **Definition of "Default" (Section 4(2))**

A foreign state is considered to be in default if it fails to meet **any one** of the following obligations in relation to an unlawful act committed on board an aircraft:

1. **Failure to extradite or prosecute** any of the parties involved in the unlawful act.  
   - If a crime (e.g., hijacking, unlawful seizure) occurs on a flight, the state must either prosecute the perpetrators or extradite them to face justice.

2. **Failure to permit the continuation of the journey** of passengers and crew of the aircraft.  
   - If an unlawful act occurs, the state must allow the passengers and crew to continue their journey without interference or obstruction.

3. **Failure to return the aircraft** to the persons lawfully entitled to possession of it.  
   - After an unlawful act, the aircraft must be returned to the rightful owner (e.g., the airline or operator), especially if it was seized or detained.

> The default applies when *any one* of these conditions is not met. This ensures that the state bears responsibility for the safety and legal integrity of international air travel.

---

### **Definition of "Unlawful Act" (Section 4(3))**

An *unlawful act* is defined as:

> *Any act by which a person, while on board an aircraft in flight, by force or threat of force, seizes or exercises control over the aircraft or attempts to do so.*

- This includes acts such as hijacking, unlawful interference, or attempts to take control of the aircraft.
- The act must occur *during flight* and involve the use of force or threat of force.
- The definition is narrow and focused on acts of violence or coercion directly affecting aircraft control.

> This ensures the Act targets only serious threats to aviation security and does not extend to minor disputes or civil disagreements.

---

### **Definition of "In Flight" (Section 4(3))**

An aircraft is deemed to be *in flight* from the time all external doors are closed after embarkation until:

- One of the doors is opened for disembarkation, **or**
- In the case of a forced landing, until the competent authorities (e.g., Canadian authorities) take responsibility for the aircraft and its occupants.

> This establishes a clear temporal boundary for when the unlawful act must occur — only during active flight, not during ground operations or after landing.

---

### **Amendment and Repeal of Orders (Section 4(4))**

- The **Governor in Council** has the authority to **amend or repeal** any order issued under Section 4(1) at any time.  
- This provides flexibility to adjust restrictions based on changing circumstances, diplomatic developments, or new evidence.

> This ensures the Act remains responsive and adaptable to evolving international relations and security concerns.

---

### **Offence and Penalties (Section 5)**

- Any **air carrier that fails to comply** with an order made under Section 4(1) commits an **offence**.
- The offence is punishable on **summary conviction** (a less formal trial process).
- The maximum fine is **$25,000 CAD**.

> This provides a clear legal consequence for non-compliance, reinforcing the enforceability of the Act.

---

### **Purpose and Context of the Act**

The *Prohibition of International Air Services Act* serves as a **deterrent and enforcement mechanism** in international aviation to:

- Protect national security and the safety of passengers and crew.
- Ensure that states that fail to uphold international standards of justice and cooperation in the face of unlawful acts on aircraft are held accountable.
- Prevent the use of international air routes as a tool for evading justice or obstructing lawful travel.

It is rooted in international law principles, particularly those related to the **1963 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation**, which emphasizes the importance of safe and lawful flight operations and the responsibility of states to protect aircraft and persons on board.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Targeted Restrictions** | Only applies to specific activities (e.g., landing, flying, operating) — not a blanket ban on all international flights. |
| **State-Level Default** | Requires a formal certification by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, ensuring political and diplomatic input. |
| **Focus on Unlawful Acts** | Targets serious acts like hijacking or forced control of aircraft, not minor disputes. |
| **Provincial Binding** | Applies to all provinces, reinforcing national consistency in aviation policy. |
| **Enforceable Penalties** | Provides a clear legal consequence for non-compliance, enhancing deterrence. |
| **Flexibility** | Allows for amendments or revocation of orders based on changing circumstances. |

---

### **Limitations and Criticisms (Implied)**

- The Act may be seen as **overly restrictive** in its scope, particularly when banning flights from a foreign state to *any* third country.
- It relies on **diplomatic certification**, which may delay enforcement or be subject to political influence.
- The definition of "unlawful act" is narrow — may exclude some forms of civil unrest or non-violent disruptions.
- Could potentially impact **economic interests** of airlines, especially in times of diplomatic tension.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Prohibition of International Air Services Act* is a targeted, security-focused legislative tool designed to respond to serious violations of international aviation norms — specifically, when a foreign state fails to uphold its obligations in the face of unlawful acts on board aircraft. By enabling Canada to restrict air services with such states, the Act reinforces Canada’s role in upholding international aviation standards and protecting the safety and legal rights of passengers and crew.

It balances national security concerns with diplomatic considerations and includes clear definitions, procedural safeguards, and enforceable penalties. While powerful, its application requires careful judgment and coordination with foreign governments and international aviation bodies.
