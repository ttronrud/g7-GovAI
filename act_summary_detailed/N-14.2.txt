### **Background and Context**

- **Historical Foundation**:  
  The Act acknowledges the origins of Canada’s peacekeeping tradition, tracing it back to 1956 when then-Minister of External Affairs, the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson, proposed the first United Nations peacekeeping mission. This initiative established Canada as a pioneering force in international peace operations.

- **Canada’s Peacekeeping Legacy**:  
  Since that time, Canada has participated in more than **66 peacekeeping and peace support missions** worldwide. Over **164 Canadian Forces personnel** have lost their lives while serving in these operations. This underscores the significant human cost and dedication associated with Canada’s role in global peacekeeping.

- **Tragic Incident of August 9, 1974**:  
  A pivotal moment in the nation’s peacekeeping history is highlighted—the shooting down of a Canadian Forces aircraft on August 9, 1974, en route from Beirut to Damascus. The plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile, resulting in the deaths of **nine Canadian peacekeepers**. This event is specifically referenced to emphasize both the dangers faced by peacekeepers and the enduring significance of honoring their sacrifice.
