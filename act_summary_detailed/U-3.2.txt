### **Detailed Summary of the Universal Child Care Benefit Act**

---

#### **1. Citation and Purpose of the Act**
- **Citation**: The Act is titled the *Universal Child Care Benefit Act*.
- **Primary Objective**: To support families by providing **direct financial assistance** for child care expenses, based on the age of the child and the parent's custody arrangement.

The Act aims to:
- Make child care more accessible and affordable for families.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Eligible Individual** | A person who meets the eligibility criteria under *Subdivision a.1 of Division E of Part I of the Income Tax Act*. This typically includes individuals who are not subject to certain income or tax thresholds and who have qualifying dependents. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development** (MESD), responsible for administering the benefit. |
| **Qualified Dependent** | A person who qualifies as a dependent under the same income tax rules referenced above (Subdivision a.1 of Division E of Part I of the Income Tax Act). This usually means a child under 18 years of age who is financially dependent on the parent. |
| **Shared-Custody Parent** | Defined under *section 122.6 of the Income Tax Act*. A parent who shares physical custody of a child with the other parent (e.g., 50/50 custody). This status affects the amount of benefit received. |

> These definitions ensure consistency with existing tax rules, which are used to determine eligibility and dependency.

#### **3. Benefit Structure and Payment Schedule**

The benefit is structured in **phased increments**, reflecting changes in policy over time. It is paid **monthly** and depends on two key factors:
- The **age of the child**
- Whether the parent is a **shared-custody parent**

##### **Phase 1: Before January 1, 2015**
- **For children under 6 years old**:
  - **Shared-custody parent**: $50 per month
  - **Other parents (non-shared custody)**: $100 per month
- **For children aged 6 to 17 years old**:
  - **Shared-custody parent**: $30 per month
  - **Other parents**: $60 per month

> *Note*: The benefit applies only for months when the individual is an eligible individual at the beginning of the month.

##### **Phase 2: From January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016**
- **For children under 6 years old**:
  - **Shared-custody parent**: $80 per month
  - **Other parents**: $160 per month
- **For children aged 6 to 17 years old**:
  - **Shared-custody parent**: $30 per month
  - **Other parents**: $60 per month

> This phase represents a significant increase in support for younger children, especially those under six, reflecting a policy shift toward greater investment in early childhood care.

> *Important*: The benefit **does not apply** to any month before **July 1, 2006** — meaning the program began in July 2006.

#### **4. Prohibitions on Benefit Use and Recovery**

The benefit is designed to be **non-liquidatable and protected**, ensuring it is not used to satisfy other debts or obligations. Specific protections include:

- ❌ **Not subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws**
- ❌ **Cannot be assigned, charged, or used as security**
- ❌ **Cannot be retained by deduction, set-off, or compensation** under any other federal Act (except this Act)
- ❌ **Not garnishable** under the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act* (FOAEAA)

> This protection ensures that families cannot lose the benefit due to other financial obligations (e.g., court-ordered debt collection).

---

#### **5. Overpayment and Repayment Provisions**

- If a person receives a benefit they are **not entitled to**, or receives an **excess amount**, they must **repay the overpayment promptly**.
- The **overpayment constitutes a debt owed to Her Majesty** (the Crown), dating from the day the benefit was paid.
- The debt may be recovered by the **Minister of National Revenue**.

##### **Limitation Period for Recovery**
- Generally, **no legal action** can be taken to recover the debt **after six years** from the date the money became due and payable.
- However, **this limitation period is suspended** during periods when legal actions are prohibited (e.g., during bankruptcy proceedings).
- If the person **acknowledges liability** (in writing or through partial payment), the time that had passed before acknowledgment **does not count** toward the six-year limit.
- If acknowledgment occurs **after the six-year period**, recovery may still be pursued **within six years of the acknowledgment date**.

##### **What Constitutes Acknowledgment of Liability?**
- A written promise to pay
- A written acknowledgment (even if it includes refusal to pay)
- A partial payment
- Any formal recognition during bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings (e.g., by a trustee or administrator)

> This allows flexibility in recovery, especially where the individual may not have known they were overpaid.

---

#### **6. Interest on Overpayments**

- **No interest** is charged on any overpayment or erroneous payment.
- This ensures that the burden of repayment is not increased due to time or inflation.

---

#### **7. Government Collaboration and Funding**

- The Minister may enter into **agreements or arrangements** with any **federal department, board, or agency** to improve the delivery and administration of the benefit.
- All payments under the Act are to be made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, which is the primary source of government funding for most federal programs.

---

#### **8. Effective Dates and Scope**

- **Subsection (1)** (the core benefit provisions) applies:
  - **After June 2011** (i.e., starting from July 2011)
  - To **payments for months after June 2011**

> This indicates that the benefit structure was reformed or adjusted after June 2011, with the new rates (e.g., $80 and $160) taking effect from January 1, 2015.

### **Summary Table: Benefit Amounts Over Time**

| Child Age | Period | Shared-Custody Parent | Other Parent |
|---------|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| Under 6 | Before Jan 1, 2015 | $50/month | $100/month |
| Under 6 | Jan 1, 2015 – Jun 30, 2016 | $80/month | $160/month |
| 6–17 | Jan 1, 2015 – Jun 30, 2016 | $30/month | $60/month |

> *Note: The benefit for older children remained unchanged in both phases.*

---

### **Key Takeaways and Implications**

1. **Progressive Support for Young Children**: The increase in monthly benefit for children under six (from $50 to $80) reflects a policy priority on early childhood development and care.

2. **Recognition of Shared Custody**: Parents with shared custody receive a reduced benefit compared to non-shared parents, which may reflect the assumption that shared custody reduces the financial burden on one parent.

3. **Strong Legal Protections**: The benefit is shielded from most forms of debt recovery, making it a reliable and secure source of income for families.

4. **Limited Time for Recovery**: While overpayments can be recovered, the six-year limitation period provides a reasonable window for recovery without indefinite legal pressure.

5. **Phased Implementation**: The benefit evolved over time, with major changes introduced in 2015, showing a government response to evolving family needs and economic conditions.

6. **Funding Source**: The program is fully funded by the federal government through the Consolidated Revenue Fund, indicating it is a permanent and stable policy.

7. **Tax-Linked Eligibility**: The eligibility rules are tied directly to the Income Tax Act, ensuring alignment with existing tax frameworks for dependents and income.

### **Conclusion**

The *Universal Child Care Benefit Act* provides a **targeted, phased, and protected financial support system** for Canadian families. It recognizes the importance of early childhood care and supports both single and shared-custody arrangements. While the benefit amounts are modest, the protections against debt recovery and the structured eligibility criteria ensure that the support is accessible and sustainable. The Act reflects a government commitment to family stability and equitable access to child care resources — particularly for low- and middle-income households.

> **Note**: As of July 1, 2016, the Act’s benefit structure appears to have been superseded or replaced by more modern programs (such as the *Universal Child Care Benefit* under the *Canada Child Benefit* or similar initiatives), but this summary reflects the actual provisions as stated in the document provided.
