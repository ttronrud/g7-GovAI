The provided text consists solely of repeated statements indicating that a particular statute or act has been **repealed**:

> [Repealed, 2005, c. 10, s. 37]  
> [Repealed, 2005, c. 10, s. 37]  
> [Repealed, 2005, c. 10, s. 37]  
> [Repealed, 2005, c. 10, s. 37]  
> [Repealed, 2005, c. 10, s. 37]

### Detailed Summary:

**Summary of the Act (as indicated by the provided information):**

There is **no detailed content** of the original act available in the provided text. Instead, the repeated entries indicate that the act in question was **officially repealed** (cancelled or removed from law) by **an act of Parliament in 2005**, specifically:

- **Statute:** *Chapter 10 of the 2005 Act*  
- **Section:** Section 37  
- **Year:** 2005  

This means that the legislation previously referenced (which is not named in the text) was **abolished or replaced** by a later legislative amendment or new law. The repeal is formal and legally binding — the act no longer exists in force and cannot be cited or applied in legal proceedings.

### Interpretation:
- The repeated nature of the entry suggests that the repeal applies to multiple provisions or sections, or that the original act was extensive and was fully repealed in one go.
- The repeal date (2005) indicates that the law was removed from the legal framework of the jurisdiction (likely Canada, given the format of the citation, which follows Canadian legislative style).
- Without the original name or content of the act, it is not possible to summarize its purpose, scope, or key provisions.

### Conclusion:
The provided text does **not contain a detailed summary of the original act**. It only confirms that the act was **repealed in 2005 under Chapter 10, Section 37**. Therefore, a detailed summary of the act itself cannot be provided due to the absence of its original text or content.

> ✅ Final Note: To obtain a detailed summary of the repealed act, the original legislation (e.g., the name of the act and its provisions) must be accessed from official legislative databases (such as the Canadian Statutes at Large or the National Archives of Canada). The current information only reflects the legal status — that the act is no longer in force.

If you can provide the name of the original act or the jurisdiction (e.g., Canada, Ontario, etc.), I can assist in retrieving or summarizing its historical content.
