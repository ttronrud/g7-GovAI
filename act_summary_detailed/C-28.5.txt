**Detailed Summary of the *Children’s Special Allowances Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Children’s Special Allowances Act* establishes a federal financial support mechanism to provide monthly payments—known as **special allowances**—to eligible children who are in government or Indigenous-led institutions, foster care, or private homes for the purpose of care, maintenance, education, and development. The Act ensures that these allowances are not subject to taxation, are paid exclusively for the child’s well-being, and are administered under strict conditions to prevent misuse.

Although the Act has been **repealed in part (2016)**—specifically sections 5 and 51—its core provisions remain in effect, particularly regarding the structure, eligibility, and conditions for special allowances. This summary focuses on the **current, active provisions** of the Act as they stand, including key definitions, eligibility criteria, payment rules, and administrative safeguards.

## **Eligibility for Special Allowance**

A special allowance is payable **monthly** for a child who meets **one of the following conditions**:

### **1. Government-Administered Care (Federal or Provincial)**
The child must reside in:
- An institution,
- A group foster home,
- The private home of foster parents, or
- The private home of a guardian, tutor, or similar individual,

**and** be maintained by:
- A department or agency of the **federal government** or a **province**, or
- An agency appointed by a province (including provincial authorities), for the purpose of protecting and caring for children.

### **2. Indigenous-Governing-Body-Administered Care**
The child must reside in the same types of placements (institution, foster home, private home) and be maintained by:
- The Indigenous governing body itself,
- A department or agency of the IGB, or
- An agency appointed by the IGB (including provincial-like authorities under IGB law), for child protection and care.

> **Note:** The Act applies to both federal and provincial systems, as well as Indigenous-led systems, recognizing the diversity of child care structures across Canada.

---

## **Purpose of the Allowance**

The special allowance is **exclusively for**:
- Care,
- Maintenance,
- Education,
- Training, or
- Advancement of the child.

It cannot be used for any other purpose, such as general operating expenses or administrative costs.

---

## **Conditions for Payment**

A special allowance is **only payable** if:
1. A formal **application** is submitted in the **prescribed manner** by the entity maintaining the child (e.g., provincial agency, IGB, or institution).
2. The payment has been **approved** under the Act.

> **No payment is due** for:
- The month a child **begins to be maintained** by the responsible body,
- The month the child is **born**, or
- The month the child **commences residence in Canada**.

---

## **Start Date of Payment**

Payment begins in the **month following** the month in which the application is received—**unless** the allowance would have been payable earlier.

In such cases, the allowance starts on the **latest of**:
- The **11th month before** the application was received,
- The month when the allowance would have first been payable **if the application had been submitted earlier**, and
- **January 1, 1993** (a minimum baseline date).

> This ensures that children in care receive support from a minimum starting point, even if the application is submitted late.

---

## **End of Payment**

A special allowance **ceases** when:
- The child **ceases to be maintained** by the responsible body,
- The child **ceases to reside in Canada**,
- The child **dies**, or
- The child **reaches 18 years of age**.

Upon cessation, the **chief executive officer** of the responsible body must **notify the Minister promptly** in the prescribed form and manner.

---

## **Payment Recipient**

The allowance is paid to:
- The **department, agency, institution, or Indigenous governing body** maintaining the child, **or**
- In **prescribed circumstances**, to a **foster parent**.

> This allows flexibility in how funds are distributed, especially in foster care settings.

---

## **Tax and Financial Status**

- The special allowance is **not subject to any tax** under any Act of Parliament.
- It **cannot be assigned, charged, attached, anticipated, or used as security**.
- It is **not subject to legal claims or liens**.

> This ensures the allowance remains protected and dedicated solely to the child’s welfare.

---

## **Amount of the Allowance**

The monthly amount is calculated as **one twelfth** of the total of:

### **Base Amount (from Income Tax Act, subsection 122.61(1))**
- If the child is **under 6 years old at the start of the month** → use the amount in **paragraph (a)** of the description of **E**.
- If the child is **6 years or older** → use the amount in **paragraph (b)** of the description of **E**.

> These amounts are derived from the Income Tax Act and are updated annually.

### **Additional Deduction (if applicable)**
- If a deduction is allowed under **section 118.3** of the Income Tax Act for the child in the relevant taxation year → add the amount in **paragraph (N)** of the description of E in subsection 122.61(1).

> This provides a potential increase based on tax-deductible benefits (e.g., for children with disabilities).

---

## **Special One-Time Additions (2021)**

An **additional $300** is added to the monthly allowance **if**:
- The child is **under 6 years old at the start of the month**, **and**
- The month is one of the following:
  - January 2021
  - April 2021
  - July 2021
  - October 2021

> This was a temporary measure introduced during the pandemic to support early childhood care.

---

## **Rounding Rules**

- Any fractional amount (e.g., 0.005 cents) is **rounded to the nearest whole cent**.
- If equidistant between two cents (e.g., 0.005), **round up** to the higher cent.

---

## **Return of Overpayments or Unauthorized Payments**

- Any entity or individual that receives:
  - A payment they are **not entitled to**, or
  - An **excess amount**,  
  must **return** the payment **as soon as possible**.

> This includes returning cheques or cash.

- The amount in question constitutes a **debt due to Her Majesty** (the Crown).
- The amount may be **deducted and retained** from future special allowances the entity is entitled to receive.

> This ensures accountability and prevents financial loss to the government.

---

## **Confidentiality and Information Privilege**

### **Privileged Information**
- All information obtained by the Minister in administering the Act is **privileged**.
- No person may **knowingly disclose** such information to someone not legally entitled to it.

3. To a **Member of Parliament** if the information is needed to respond to a formal request from that MP.

> These exceptions ensure transparency and administrative efficiency without compromising privacy.
