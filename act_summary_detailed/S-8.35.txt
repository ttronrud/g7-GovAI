**Detailed Summary of the *Select Luxury Items Tax Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Select Luxury Items Tax Act* (SLITA) is a Canadian federal tax legislation introduced to impose a **tax on the sale or transfer of specific luxury items**—specifically, **subject aircraft, subject vehicles, and subject vessels**—that meet certain criteria related to size, use, and date of manufacture. The Act targets high-end, personal-use luxury goods, aiming to generate revenue while ensuring equitable taxation of non-essential, high-value assets.

This Act applies to transactions involving these "subject items" and establishes detailed definitions, rules for when a sale is deemed to occur, valuation methods, exemptions, and administrative procedures. It also includes provisions for related parties, record-keeping, and enforcement.

### **2. Residency and Jurisdictional Rules**

To determine tax liability, the Act defines **residency** for various types of persons:

- **Corporation**: Resident if incorporated or continued in Canada and not elsewhere.
- **Partnership/Joint Venture/Unincorporated Organization**: Resident if majority of members or participants are resident in Canada.
- **Labour Union**: Resident if carrying out activities in Canada and has a local branch.
- **Individual**: Resident if deemed so under Income Tax Act paragraphs 250(1)(b) to (f).

These residency rules are critical for determining where tax is applied and whether a transaction is subject to the Act.

### **3. Related and Associated Persons**

The Act introduces key concepts of **relatedness** and **association**, which affect how transactions are interpreted:

- **Related Persons** and **Associated Persons** are deemed **not to deal at arm’s length**.
- It is a **question of fact** whether unrelated parties are dealing at arm’s length.
- **Relatedness** is defined under Income Tax Act subsections 251(2) to (6), with modifications:
  - "Corporation" includes **corporations or partnerships**.
  - "Shares" refers to **rights in a partnership or partners**.
- A **member of a partnership is deemed related to the partnership**.
- A **corporation is associated** with another if they are associated under Income Tax Act subsections 256(1)–(6).
- A **non-corporate person is associated** with a corporation if the corporation is controlled by that person or a group of persons who are mutually associated.
- A person is associated with:
  - A **partnership** if they (and associated persons) collectively hold more than half of its profits.
  - A **trust** if they (and associated persons) collectively hold more than half of its total value.

> These provisions prevent tax avoidance through artificial structuring or shifting of ownership between related parties.

### **4. Sale and Transfer of Subject Items**

#### **When a Sale Is Completed**
Under the Act, a sale of a subject item is completed at the **earlier of**:
1. Transfer of **possession** to the purchaser; or  
2. Transfer of **ownership** to the purchaser.

> This rule ensures tax is triggered at the time of actual delivery or transfer, not later.

#### **Exception – Prescribed Time**
If prescribed conditions exist (e.g., secured loan), the sale may be deemed completed at a **prescribed time**.

#### **Deemed Sale (Non-Sale Transfers)**
If ownership is transferred **without a sale** (e.g., via security agreement), the following applies:
- The transfer is **not** a sale.
- The transferee is **not** deemed to be an owner.
- Upon repayment or forgiveness of the debt, **re-transfer** is not treated as a sale.

> This prevents double taxation on secured transactions.

#### **Deemed Sale in Non-Sale Transactions**
If ownership is transferred in any manner other than a sale (e.g., gift, lease, barter), and the item is delivered in Canada:
- The **original owner is deemed to have sold** the item.
- The **original owner is the vendor**; the recipient is the **purchaser**.
- The sale is deemed completed at the earlier of possession or ownership transfer.
- The **value of consideration** is:
  - The **retail value** of the subject item at the time of sale (as determined under paragraph (c)), **plus**
  - A **prescribed amount** (e.g., a fixed fee or margin).

> This ensures that even non-market transactions (e.g., gifts, leases) are taxed as if they were sales.

---

### **5. Improvements to Subject Items**

An **improvement** in respect of a subject item includes:
- Installation of **tangible personal property** (e.g., furniture, electronics) on or affixed to the item.
- A **service** that physically modifies the item (e.g., custom paint, engine upgrades).
- A **prescribed property or service** (as defined by regulation).

> However, the following are **excluded** from being considered improvements:
- Routine **repairs, cleaning, or maintenance**.
- Provision of **tangible personal property to replace** another part of the item.

> This ensures that only significant, value-added modifications are taxed.

### **6. Exclusions and Exceptions**

The Act explicitly **excludes** certain items from being considered "subject items":

#### **Excluded Subject Aircraft**
- Aircraft designed and equipped for **military activities**.
- Aircraft equipped **solely for carrying goods**.
- Aircraft registered **before September 2022** with a government, where the user had possession before that date.
