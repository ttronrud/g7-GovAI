### **Detailed Summary of the Nunavik Inuit Land Claims Agreement Act**

This Act, formally titled the **Nunavik Inuit Land Claims Agreement Act**, is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that legally enshrines and gives effect to the **Nunavik Inuit Land Claims Agreement**—a landmark treaty between the Nunavik Inuit and the Government of Canada. The Act provides the legal framework to implement, enforce, and uphold the rights, powers, responsibilities, and benefits established under the Agreement, ensuring that the rights of the Inuit are recognized and protected under Canadian law.

---

### **1. Background and Context (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with a series of "whereas" clauses that establish the legal and historical foundation of the Agreement:

- **Aboriginal Rights and Title**: The Nunavik Inuit assert their **aboriginal rights, title, interests, and jurisdiction** over the Nunavik Inuit Settlement Area as defined in the Agreement. These rights are rooted in Indigenous sovereignty and traditional use of land and resources.

- **Constitutional Recognition**: The Constitution Act, 1982, Section 35, recognizes and affirms the existing **aboriginal and treaty rights** of Indigenous peoples in Canada. This constitutional principle provides the legal basis for the Agreement being treated as a treaty.

- **Negotiation and Approval**: The Agreement was negotiated between the Nunavik Inuit, represented by **Makivik**, and the Government of Canada. It was formally **approved by a vote of the Nunavik Inuit from October 16 to 20, 2006**, demonstrating democratic and community-based consent.

- **Signing and Ratification**: The Agreement was signed on **December 1, 2006**, on behalf of the Nunavik Inuit and Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada. However, for the Agreement to become legally binding, **Parliamentary legislation (this Act)** must be enacted.

This structure reflects Canada’s commitment to **treaty-making through democratic and legal processes**, ensuring that Indigenous communities have a formal, legally recognized voice in decisions affecting their lands and resources.

### **2. Key Provisions and Legal Effects**

#### **2.1 The Agreement is a Treaty under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**
- The Act explicitly states that the Agreement is a **treaty within the meaning of Section 35** of the Constitution Act, 1982. This elevates the Agreement from a mere land claim settlement to a **constitutional treaty**, giving it the highest legal status and ensuring it is protected against invalidation by ordinary legislation.

#### **2.2 Binding Effect on the Government and All Persons**
- The Agreement is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada** and on any province, meaning it must be implemented in accordance with its terms.
- It is **binding on all persons and bodies**, even those not directly party to the Agreement. This ensures that **all stakeholders** (including government agencies, private entities, and individuals) are subject to the Agreement’s provisions when they interact with the Nunavik Inuit Settlement Area.

#### **2.3 Supremacy of the Agreement**
- In the event of **inconsistency or conflict** between:
  - The Agreement and this Act or any law referenced in Section 2.11 of the Agreement,
  - This Act and any other statute,
  
  **The Agreement prevails** to the extent of the conflict. This establishes the **supremacy of Indigenous rights** in the legal system, ensuring that Inuit rights are not undermined by subsequent legislation.

#### **2.4 Establishment of Inuit-Managed Bodies with Legal Capacity**
- The Act grants **natural person status** to three key institutions established under the Agreement:
  - **Nunavik Marine Region Wildlife Board**
  - **Nunavik Marine Region Planning Commission**
  - **Nunavik Marine Region Impact Review Board**

> These bodies are given:
> - Capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a **natural person**
> - Authority to make decisions, enter into agreements, and manage resources
> - **No status as agents of the Government of Canada**, meaning they operate independently and are not subordinate to federal or provincial authorities.

This institutional empowerment allows the Inuit to **govern and manage natural resources and development** in Nunavik in a self-determined manner.

#### **2.5 Financial Obligations of the Government**
- The Government of Canada is required to **pay out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund** any monetary obligations under:
  - **Articles 5, 15, 16, and 23** of the Agreement.
- These obligations may include compensation for land, resource development, infrastructure, or other financial commitments made in the Agreement.

#### **2.6 Judicial Notice of the Agreement**
- The Agreement is taken as **judicially noticed**—meaning courts and tribunals are required to treat it as true and authentic **without needing to prove its existence or contents** in litigation. This ensures that the Agreement is treated as a binding legal document in all judicial proceedings.

#### **2.7 Publication and Evidence of the Agreement**
- The Agreement must be **published by the Queen’s Printer**.
- A **published copy** is **evidence of the Agreement and its contents**.
- A copy purporting to be published by the Queen’s Printer is deemed valid **unless proven otherwise**.

This ensures **public access**, transparency, and legal certainty regarding the Agreement’s terms.

### **3. Procedure for Challenges to the Agreement or This Act**

To protect the integrity and legitimacy of the Agreement, the Act includes a **strict procedural requirement** for challenges:

- **Any party raising an issue** about:
  - The **interpretation or validity** of the Agreement, or
  - The **validity or applicability** of this Act,

  **must serve notice** on both:
  - The **Attorney General of Canada**, and
  - **Makivik** (the Inuit representative body).

> The notice must include:
> - A description of the proceeding,
> - Whether the issue concerns interpretation, validity, or both,
> - The day on which the issue will be argued,
> - Specific points to be argued,
> - And must be served **at least 14 days before the hearing** (unless a court or tribunal allows a shorter period).

- **Parties to the proceeding** (Attorney General and Makivik) have the **right to appear and participate** with the same rights as any other party.

> This provision ensures that **Inuit interests are fully represented** in legal challenges and prevents unilateral or unbalanced judicial interpretations.

> **Note**: Oral hearings are not required if not otherwise mandated—this streamlines proceedings while preserving procedural fairness.

### **4. Statutory Instruments and Regulatory Powers**

- Instruments made under the Agreement are **not considered statutory instruments** under the Statutory Instruments Act. This means they are not subject to the usual review or approval process required for ordinary regulations, ensuring **greater flexibility and autonomy** for the Inuit in managing their affairs.

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has the authority to make **orders and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement. This allows for practical, responsive governance without requiring parliamentary debate for every rule.

### **5. Implementation and Review Requirements**

The Act mandates **two mandatory reviews** of the Agreement’s implementation within **ten years** of the Act receiving royal assent:

#### **5.1 Makivik Review (First Review)**
- Makivik is responsible for conducting a **review of the implementation** of the Act and the Agreement.
- Upon completion, Makivik may submit a report to the **Minister designated under Section 12.2(1)** of the Agreement.
- The Minister must **lay the report before each House of Parliament** within the first 15 days of a sitting after receiving it.

> This ensures **accountability and transparency**, with Inuit-led oversight of implementation.

#### **5.2 Ministerial Review (Second Review)**
- A **comprehensive review** of implementation is also required by the **Minister designated by the Governor in Council**.
- The Minister must lay the final report before each House of Parliament within the first 15 days of a sitting after completion.
