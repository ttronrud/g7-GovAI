  and **one instance** of:  
  `[Repealed, 1993, c. 34, s. 124]`

- **Meaning of "Repealed"**:  
  "Repealed" means that the specific section or provision of a law (likely from an earlier act) has been officially canceled or revoked by a later amendment or act of Parliament.

- **Details of Repeal**:
  - **2004, c. 21, s. 42**:  
    This refers to **Chapter 21 of the Statutes of Canada in 2004**, specifically **Section 42** of that act.  
    This section (or the law it refers to) was repealed by the **2004 Act (c. 21)**.  
    The fact that it appears 25 times suggests that **25 different sections or provisions** from a prior act were repealed by this single section of the 2004 legislation.

  - **1993, c. 34, s. 124**:  
    This refers to **Chapter 34 of the Statutes of Canada in 1993**, specifically **Section 124**, which was repealed by a different act in 1993.

- **Nature of the Original Act**:  
  While the original act is not named in the text, the repeated repeal notices imply that the legislation in question was a **prior act** (likely a statute or regulation) that contained multiple provisions that were later removed due to:
  - Obsolescence
  - Redundancy
  - Legislative modernization
  - Inconsistency with current law
  - Replacement by new legislation

### 📌 Key Points:

| Element | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|

### ⚠️ Important Note:

- The original **act or statute** that contained these provisions is **not named** in the provided text.
- The repeated entries suggest that this is a **list of repealed sections** found in a legal document (such as a statute or regulation), and not the full text of the act itself.
- Therefore, this summary **does not describe the original act's content**, only that **certain parts of it have been formally canceled**.

### ✅ Conclusion:

The provided text is **not a summary of an active act**, but rather a **list of repeals** indicating that **26 specific sections** of a prior legislative act (or multiple acts) have been officially removed from the law. These repeals were enacted in **1993 and 2004** through specific sections of new legislation (c. 34, s. 124 and c. 21, s. 42). As such, the provisions referenced are **no longer valid or in effect** under current Canadian law.

> 🔍 **Bottom Line**: This is a record of legal repeal, not an active law. The original content of the repealed sections is not described here, and the act itself is not identified.
