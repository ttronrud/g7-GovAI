**Detailed Summary of the Agreement under the *Indian Reserves Mining Agreement Act, 1943* (as referenced in the text)**

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The document presented is not a standalone *Act of Parliament* in the traditional legislative sense, but rather a **Memorandum of Agreement** between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of British Columbia**, confirmed and enacted under the authority of the Canadian Parliament. It is commonly referred to as the **Indian Reserves Mining Agreement of 1943**, and it establishes a framework for the development of mineral resources on **Indian Reserves** in British Columbia.

This agreement was passed by and with the advice and consent of the **Senate and House of Commons of Canada**, and thus formally becomes part of Canadian law as an *Act*—specifically, a statutory instrument confirming a bilateral agreement between federal and provincial governments.

### **Background and Context**

1. **Historical Treaty and Land Conveyance**  
   - Prior to this agreement, treaties were made with Indigenous peoples to surrender their personal and usufructuary rights to certain territories now located within British Columbia.
   - These surrendered areas were designated as **Indian Reserves**.
   - Under an earlier agreement dated **September 24, 1912**, the **Dominion Government** (federal government) was entrusted with holding these reserves **as trustee for the Indigenous peoples**.

2. **Mineral Rights Issue**  
   - The minerals (especially precious metals like gold and silver) found in or beneath these reserves are **not considered part of the reserve land itself**.
   - Instead, they are **beneficially owned by the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia**, based on Crown ownership of land and mineral rights.
   - Due to the **close association** of precious and base metals, mining them separately is **technically impractical** and economically unfeasible without coordinated development.

3. **Policy Objective**  
   - The governments agreed that, for **policy and practical development purposes**, the **Province of British Columbia** should assume **full responsibility** for managing and developing all minerals (both precious and base) within Indian Reserves.
   - This transfer of responsibility does **not** affect constitutional or legal rights of either government.

### **Key Provisions of the Agreement**

#### 1. **Continuity of Reserve Administration**
- Indian Reserves will continue to be administered according to **existing legislation and agreements**, preserving Indigenous rights and governance structures.

#### 2. **Provincial Authority Over Mineral Development**
- The **Province of British Columbia** shall have **exclusive authority** over:
  - Prospecting
  - Staking claims
  - Recording claims
  - Developing, leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of minerals
- All mineral activities must comply with **British Columbia’s mining laws**.

#### 3. **Exemptions and Safeguards**
- **Existing leases** under **Section 50(2) of the Indian Act** remain unaffected by this agreement.
- **No prospecting or entry** onto an Indian Reserve is permitted **without prior permission** from the **Indian Agent** responsible for that reserve.
- Such permission is subject to:
  - Terms and conditions set by the Indian Agent.
  - Approval by the **Gold Commissioner** of the Mining Division in the relevant province.
- **Base minerals and mineral rights** are only subject to this agreement **if surrendered** under the **Indian Act**.

#### 4. **Definition of "Mineral"**
- The term "mineral" includes:
  - Gold, silver
  - All naturally occurring useful minerals
- **Excludes**:
  - Peat, coal, petroleum, natural gas, bitumen, oil shales
  - Limestone, marble, clay, gypsum, building stones (when mined for construction)
  - Earth, ash, marl, gravel, sand
  - Agricultural surface materials (e.g., topsoil)

> This definition ensures that only economically viable and extractable minerals are included in the scope of the agreement.

#### 5. **Revenue Collection and Distribution**
- The **Department of Mines of British Columbia** (or its officers) is responsible for collecting **all revenue** from mineral activities, including:
  - Purchase money
  - Rent
  - Royalties
  - Licensing and permit fees
- Revenue is **split equally**:
  - **50% to the Province of British Columbia**
  - **50% to be remitted annually** to the **Receiver General of Canada** for handling under the **1912 Agreement** (specifically, Paragraph 7 of that agreement), which governs the distribution of revenues from Indian Reserve lands.

#### 6. **Revenue Policy and Fee Protection**
- The **current scale of fees, charges, and royalties** in effect at the time of the agreement **shall not be reduced** without the **consent of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet).
- This provision protects the financial viability of mining operations and prevents arbitrary cuts in revenue.

#### 7. **Provincial Responsibility and Liability**
- The Province shall use **best efforts** to collect revenue from mineral claims on reserves, treating these operations **the same as those outside reserves**.
- The Province **shall not be liable to the Dominion** for failure to collect revenue due to:
  - Negligence
  - Inadequate performance by officers or staff
- However, the Province **is liable only for half of the annual revenue collected** (i.e., the provincial share) and **not for any additional amounts**.

> This limits federal liability and protects provincial administrative independence.

### **Legal and Constitutional Significance**

- **Federal Role**: Remains as **trustee** for Indigenous peoples; retains oversight through the 1912 agreement.
- **Provincial Role**: Gains **operational control** over mineral development, reflecting a shift toward provincial jurisdiction in resource management.
- **Indigenous Rights**: The agreement does **not diminish** Indigenous rights. The reserves remain under Indigenous stewardship, and access is strictly regulated through Indian Agents and the Indian Act.
- **Balance of Power**: The agreement reflects a **pragmatic compromise**—allowing economic development while respecting legal and constitutional boundaries.

### **Implementation and Approval Process**

- The agreement was **ratified by both governments**:
  - **Canada**: Signed by **Thomas Alexander Crerar**, Minister of Mines and Resources.
  - **British Columbia**: Signed by **Ernest Crawford Carson**, Minister of Mines.
- It required **approval by both the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia** before becoming enforceable.
- The signatures were witnessed by officials from both governments, confirming the legitimacy and formality of the agreement.

### **Significance and Legacy**

1. **Economic Development**  
   - Enabled large-scale mining development on previously restricted Indian lands, contributing to British Columbia’s mining economy.

2. **Resource Governance Model**  
   - Established a precedent for **provincial control over mineral development on reserves**, with federal oversight through revenue sharing.

3. **Indigenous Land and Resource Rights**  
   - While allowing development, the agreement maintained Indigenous status and reserve integrity through strict access controls and reliance on the Indian Act.

4. **Legal Precedent**  
   - Set a foundation for future negotiations between federal, provincial, and Indigenous governments over land use and resource rights.

5. **Revenue Sharing Mechanism**  
   - The 50-50 revenue split with federal handling of half annually through the 1912 agreement created a **long-standing financial relationship** between the provinces and the federal government.

### **Conclusion**

The **1943 Memorandum of Agreement on Indian Reserves Mining** is a landmark piece of intergovernmental legislation that:

- Resolved a long-standing conflict between the **practical need for mineral development** and the **legal status of Indian Reserves**.
- Transferred operational control of mineral development to **British Columbia**, while preserving **federal trust responsibilities** and **Indigenous rights**.
- Established a clear, structured, and legally binding framework for revenue collection, access, and liability.

It remains a critical document in the history of **resource governance in Canada**, illustrating how federal-provincial cooperation can balance economic development with constitutional and Indigenous rights.

> **Note**: While the document is styled as an "Act," it is more accurately described as a **statutory agreement** or **memorandum of understanding** enacted under parliamentary authority. It does not create new rights or obligations in the same way as a typical statute but serves as a **binding legal instrument** confirmed by Parliament.
