### **Detailed Summary of the *Canada Emission Reduction Incentives Agency Act***

---

#### **Overview and Purpose**
The *Canada Emission Reduction Incentives Agency Act* establishes the **Canada Emission Reduction Incentives Agency (CERIA)** as a federal body corporate tasked with promoting the **reduction or removal of greenhouse gases (GHGs)** in Canada. The Act recognizes that addressing climate change is not only essential for environmental sustainability but also offers co-benefits such as:
- Improved air quality,
- Achievement of broader environmental goals,
- Enhanced competitiveness and energy efficiency in Canadian industries.

By incentivizing GHG reductions through the acquisition of **eligible credits**, the Agency supports a market-based approach to climate action that aligns with international commitments, particularly under the **Kyoto Protocol**.

---

### **Key Provisions and Components**

---

#### **1. Definitions**
The Act defines several key terms:
- **Greenhouse Gas (GHG):** Any gas listed in **Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol**, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and others.
- **Kyoto Protocol:** The 1997 international agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including all decisions made by the Conference of the Parties (COP) serving as the Meeting of the Parties (MOP).
- **Eligible Credit:** A credit that qualifies for use in Canada’s emissions reduction strategy. This includes:
  - **Eligible Domestic Credit:** A compliance unit issued under a federal program (e.g., under section 322 of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*) and designated as "eligible" by order.
  - **Eligible Kyoto Unit:** A compliance unit from the Kyoto Protocol that is designated as eligible by order.
- **Compliance Unit:** A tradable unit representing a verified reduction or removal of one tonne of GHG emissions (e.g., one tonne of CO₂ equivalent).
- **Minister:** Refers to the **Minister of the Environment**.

> *Note:* The term "compliance unit" was previously used but was **repealed in 2023 (s. 623, c. 26)**. Its functions are now absorbed into the definitions of "eligible domestic credit" and "eligible Kyoto unit."

#### **2. Establishment of the Canada Emission Reduction Incentives Agency (CERIA)**
- CERIA is a **body corporate** created to operate as an **agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- It is **not a government department** but a specialized agency with specific mandates.
- CERIA has **exclusive authority** to acquire eligible credits on behalf of the Government of Canada.
- It may act **in its own name** or in the name of Her Majesty, including entering into contracts and agreements with individuals, organizations, or foreign governments.

> **Key Principle:** CERIA can acquire eligible credits through its own procurement process, even if other laws restrict such actions — giving it operational flexibility.

---

#### **3. Leadership and Governance Structure**

##### **a. President of the Agency**
- Appointed by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet).
- Holds office for a **renewable term of up to five years**.
- Serves as the **chief executive officer** of CERIA.
- Responsible for supervising staff and directing the Agency’s operations.
- May delegate powers and functions to others within the Agency.
- Remuneration is set by the Governor in Council.

##### **b. Advisory Board**
- Composed of **no more than 12 members**, appointed by the Governor in Council.
- Members serve **during pleasure**, with a term of **up to three years**, renewable once or more.
- Must include individuals with **relevant expertise**, such as:
  - Agriculture,
  - Energy and forestry sectors,
  - Environmental organizations,
  - Provincial or municipal governments,
  - Market experts in domestic and international GHG credit markets.
- The **Chairperson** is one of the members, appointed by the Minister.
- The Chairperson determines meeting times and locations, but the board must meet **at least four times per year**.
- Members are paid remuneration and reimbursed for **travel, living, and other expenses** as per Treasury Board directives.

> **Purpose of the Advisory Board:** To provide expert advice to the Minister on:
> - Types of projects most likely to deliver significant GHG reductions while advancing Canadian industrial competitiveness.
> - Market conditions affecting eligible domestic and Kyoto units.

> The Minister must **publish the advisory board’s recommendations within 30 days** of receipt.

---

#### **4. Objectives of the Agency**
The primary objective of CERIA is to:
> **Provide incentives for the reduction or removal of greenhouse gases** by acquiring eligible credits — both domestically and internationally — on behalf of the Government of Canada.

This supports Canada’s broader climate goals, including its obligations under international climate agreements.

---

#### **5. Procurement and Credit Acquisition**

##### **a. Competitive Procurement Process**
- CERIA must use a **competitive process** to acquire:
  - **Eligible domestic credits**
  - **Eligible Kyoto units**

> This ensures **cost-effectiveness** and transparency in purchases.

##### **b. Pre-Creation Purchases (Conditional)**
- Under specific conditions, CERIA may make **payments before credits are created** (i.e., pre-emptive funding).
- These payments are allowed **only if**:
  1. The project will result in GHG reductions/removals as anticipated in the agreement;
  2. The Minister is satisfied that the project will deliver the expected emissions reductions;
  3. The agreement includes a **repayment clause** — meaning the Agency must repay any amount advanced if no credits are ultimately received.

> **Important Limitation:** The actual amount of GHG reductions tied to the acquired credits may be **less than or equal to** the anticipated reductions from the project. This introduces a risk of under-delivery.

> The decision to make such pre-creation payments requires **approval from the Treasury Board** and due diligence.

---

#### **6. Record-Keeping and Accountability**
- After acquiring eligible credits in its own name, CERIA must **promptly transfer them to the name of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This transfer occurs in a database designated by the Minister, ensuring that all credits are properly tracked and accounted for in Canada’s national inventory.

---

#### **7. Financial Oversight and Reporting**

##### **a. Corporate Business Plan**
- CERIA must submit a **corporate business plan** annually to the Minister, starting **as soon as possible after establishment** and **every year thereafter**.
- The plan must include:
  - Agency objectives for the next **five years**,
  - Strategies (operational, financial, human resources),
  - Expected performance,
  - Annual operating and capital budgets.

> The Minister must **table a copy of the approved plan in both Houses of Parliament** within 15 days of approval.

##### **b. Annual Report**
- CERIA must submit an **annual report** to the Minister by **December 31** of each year following its first full fiscal year.
- The report must contain:
  - Financial statements prepared in accordance with **accounting principles consistent with the Public Accounts Act**,
  - The Auditor General’s opinion on those statements,
  - Performance evaluation against the objectives in the business plan,
  - Any additional information required by the Minister.

> The Minister must table a copy of the annual report in both Houses of Parliament within 15 days of receiving it.

---

#### **8. Auditor General Oversight**
- The **Auditor General of Canada** is the independent auditor of CERIA.
- Responsibilities include:
  - Conducting **annual audits** of CERIA’s financial statements,
  - Providing an **opinion** on the financial statements to both the Agency and the Minister,
  - Delivering copies of audit reports to the Minister and President.

> This ensures **financial accountability, transparency, and public trust**.

---

#### **9. Legal Capacity and Liability**
- CERIA can enter into **contracts, agreements, or arrangements** with third parties (including foreign governments or international bodies) **as if it were not an agent of the Crown**.
- Legal actions (suits, claims, or proceedings) related to CERIA’s rights or obligations may be brought **in the name of the Agency** in any court with jurisdiction.
- This enhances the Agency’s operational autonomy and legal flexibility.

---

#### **10. Provincial Autonomy**
- The Act explicitly **does not limit or affect** provincial powers to:
  - Provide incentives for GHG reductions,
  - Acquire eligible credits **on their own behalf**, either before or after creation,
  - Use any means established by the province.

> This preserves **provincial flexibility** in climate policy while allowing federal coordination through CERIA.

---

#### **11. Regulatory Authority**
- The Minister has the power to:
  - By **order**, designate eligible classes of compliance units (e.g., under domestic programs or the Kyoto Protocol),
  - Make **regulations** specifying the **factors** to consider when determining whether the acquisition of Kyoto units is beneficial to Canada.

> These regulations may include considerations such as:
> - Cost-effectiveness,
> - Market stability,
> - Environmental impact,
> - Industrial competitiveness,
> - Equity and access.
