**Detailed Summary of the *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act***

---

### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act* (commonly referred to as the **Federal Prompt Payment Act**) is a legislative framework designed to **ensure timely and fair payment to contractors and subcontractors** involved in construction projects on federal real property or federal immovables in Canada. Its primary objective is to **promote the orderly and efficient execution of construction projects** by addressing delays and non-payment, which can otherwise disrupt project timelines, damage business relationships, and undermine the stability of the construction industry.

By establishing clear timelines for payment, defining contractual obligations, and creating a binding adjudication mechanism, the Act aims to provide **predictability, transparency, and legal recourse** for those performing construction work under federal contracts.

## **Scope and Application**

### **Who is Covered?**
- Her Majesty (the federal government)
- Any **service provider** contracting with Her Majesty
- Any **contractor or subcontractor** performing construction work on federal real property or immovable in Canada

### **Geographic Scope**
- Applies to construction projects located **within Canada**.
- **Exclusion**: A construction project that **straddles two or more provinces** is *not* subject to this Act under subsection (2), meaning the full Act does not apply across provincial borders.

### **Provincial Exemptions and Equivalents**
- The Governor in Council may **designate a province** for exemption from the Act if:
  1. That province has enacted a **payment regime reasonably similar** to this Act.
  2. It has a **similar adjudication regime** for non-payment disputes.
- If such a designation occurs:
  - Sections 8(2), 9(5), 10–14, and 16(5) **do not apply** to contractors in that province.
  - The Act **does not apply** to:
    - Subcontractors working on projects in that province.
    - Service providers paying for work in that province.
  - However, the Governor in Council may **adapt provisions** of the Act to align with provincial laws and resolve inconsistencies.

> This allows provinces with robust, comparable systems to operate under their own rules while maintaining fairness and consistency where applicable.

### **Exemptions**
- The Governor in Council may **exempt specific construction projects** from the Act via order, allowing flexibility for unique or exceptional circumstances.

## **Payment Timelines and Obligations**

### **1. Contractor’s Obligation to Submit Invoices**
- Contractors must submit a **proper invoice monthly or as specified in the contract**.
- The invoice must cover:
  - Work performed by the contractor.
  - Work performed and invoiced by subcontractors in the chain.
- **No prior verification of work is required**—this reduces administrative delays.

### **2. Payment by Her Majesty or Service Provider**
- Must pay the contractor **within 28 days** of receiving a proper invoice.
- This deadline is **non-negotiable** unless a notice of non-payment is issued.

### **3. Notice of Non-Payment**
- Her Majesty or a service provider may **decline to pay** some or all of the work **if they provide a notice of non-payment within 21 days** of receiving the invoice.
- The notice must include:
  - Description of the construction work involved.
  - Amount not being paid.
  - Reasons for non-payment (e.g., lack of funds).
  - Whether the non-payment is due to receiving a similar notice from another party.
  - Any other information prescribed by regulation.

> This provision allows for **financial justification** and protects public entities from being forced into immediate payment without financial capacity.

---

## **Subcontractor Payment Obligations**

The Act establishes a **tiered payment chain** that ensures payments flow down the subcontracting hierarchy with clear timeframes and obligations.

### **Contractor Pays Subcontractors**
- Must pay subcontractors **within 35 days** of receiving the proper invoice from Her Majesty or the service provider.
- If only partially paid:
  - First, pay subcontractors whose work is **not covered** by a notice of non-payment (on a **rateable basis**).
  - Then, pay subcontractors whose work is **partially covered** by a notice of non-payment (again on a rateable basis).
- A contractor may **decline to pay** some or all work by issuing a **notice of non-payment** to a subcontractor **within 28 days** of receiving the invoice.

### **Subcontractor Pays Lower-Level Subcontractors**
- Must pay lower-tier subcontractors **within 42 days** of the invoice receipt.
- If only partially paid:
  - First, pay those whose work is **not covered** by a notice of non-payment.
  - Then, pay those whose work is **partially covered**.
- May issue a notice of non-payment to lower-tier subcontractors **within 35 days**.

### **Chain of Subcontractors**
- The rules apply recursively down the subcontracting chain:
  - Each level must pay its subcontractors **within 7-day increments**:
    - Level 1 (contractor): 35 days
    - Level 2 (subcontractor): 42 days
    - Level 3: 49 days
    - Level 4: 56 days
    - And so on...
- Each level may issue a **notice of non-payment** within:
  - 28 days (contractor)
  - 35 days (subcontractor)
  - 42 days (next level)
  - 49 days (next level)
  - Etc.

> This ensures that **payment obligations are cascaded** and that **all parties have a defined timeline** to receive and pass on funds.

---

## **Holdbacks and Contractual Flexibility**

- Payments may include a **holdback** (a percentage withheld until completion or final inspection).
- However:
  - The **maximum holdback** cannot exceed what would be allowed under **provincial construction law**.
  - The holdback must be **paid by the same date** as it would be under provincial law.
- This ensures **provincial fairness** while maintaining national consistency.

---

## **Interest on Unpaid Amounts**

Interest begins to accrue on unpaid amounts from the **expiry of the payment deadline** or from the **shorter contractual deadline**, whichever is earlier.

### **Interest Applies To:**
1. **Amounts not covered** by a notice of non-payment.
2. **Amounts covered by a notice of non-payment**, **if**:
   - The non-payment is due to the payer lacking funds (because they also received a notice of non-payment).
3. **Amounts covered by a notice of non-payment**, **if**:
   - There is a reason for non-payment other than lack of funds (e.g., dispute, breach of contract), **but only for the portion ordered by an adjudicator**.

### **Interest Rate**
- The rate is set by **regulation**.
- If the contract specifies a rate, the **higher** of the two rates applies.

> This provides a **financial incentive** for timely payment and compensates for delays.

## **Adjudication Mechanism**

### **When Can a Dispute Be Resolved?**
A contractor or subcontractor may request adjudication if:
- They have not been fully paid within the time limit (28 days or contractual shorter period).
- The dispute arises after:
  - Receipt of a **certificate of completion** from Her Majesty or a service provider, **or**
  - The expiry of the payment time limit for the last proper invoice.

> The notice of adjudication must be submitted **no later than
