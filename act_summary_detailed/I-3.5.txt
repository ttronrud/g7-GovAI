### 🔹 **4. Determination of Residency Status**

Residency is a critical factor in determining which country has the right to tax income. The rules are designed to avoid double taxation and ensure fairness.

#### For Individuals:
1. **Permanent Home** → Resident of the State where they have a permanent home.
2. **If home in both countries** → Resident of the country with **closer personal and economic ties** ("centre of vital interests").
3. **If centre of vital interests cannot be determined** → Resident of the country where they have an **habitual abode**.
4. **If habitual abode in both or neither** → Resident of the country where they are a **national**.
5. **If national of both or neither** → The competent authorities must **resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.

#### For Companies:
- A company is deemed a resident only of the country of its **nationality**.

#### For Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships):
- The competent authorities must **resolve residency by mutual agreement**.

> 💡 This residency rule ensures that individuals and entities are not taxed twice in both countries.

### 🔹 **5. Permanent Establishment (PE) Rules**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which business is carried out.

#### ✅ Examples of PE:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or site for natural resource exploration
- Building site or construction project **only if lasting more than 6 months**

#### ❌ Exclusions (Not Considered a PE):
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods
- Maintenance of stock for **storage, display, or delivery**
- Maintenance of stock solely for **processing by another enterprise**
- Fixed place for **purchasing goods or collecting information**
- Fixed place for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**
- Any combination of the above if the overall activity is **preparatory or auxiliary**

> 🚫 A PE is **not created** simply because an enterprise uses a warehouse or office for routine operations.

#### 🚨 Exception: Agent with Contracting Authority
- If a person (not an independent agent) has **authority to conclude contracts** on behalf of an enterprise and habitually exercises that authority in a foreign country:
  - That enterprise is deemed to have a **permanent establishment** in that country.
  - **Exception**: If the activities are limited to those listed above (e.g., purchasing or information gathering), and are not preparatory or auxiliary.

> ⚖️ This prevents tax avoidance through the use of independent agents.

#### 🚫 No PE Created by Control or Ownership
- Merely **controlling or being controlled by** a company in the other country **does not** create a permanent establishment.

### 🔹 **6. Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**

#### ✅ Income from Immovable Property in the Other Country
- A resident of a Contracting State may be taxed in the **other country** on income from immovable property located there.

#### 📌 What is "Immovable Property"?
- Includes:
  - Land and buildings
  - Property accessory to land
  - Livestock and equipment used in agriculture or forestry
  - Rights related to land (e.g., usufruct, options to buy land)
  - Rights to variable or fixed payments for working mineral deposits or natural resources
- **Excludes**: Ships and aircraft

#### ✅ Application of Rules:
- Applies to:
  - Direct use, letting, or use of property
  - Income from alienation (sale) of property
- If shares or corporate rights give the owner the right to use immovable property held by a company, income from such use may be taxed in the country where the property is located.

> 📝 This ensures that income from land-based assets is taxed where the asset is physically located.

### 🔹 **7. Taxation of Business Profits**

#### 🏢 General Rule:
- Business profits of an enterprise are taxable **only in the country where the enterprise is resident**.
- **Exception**: If the enterprise operates through a **permanent establishment** in the other country, profits attributable to that PE may be taxed in that country.

#### 💡 How Profits Are Attributed to a Permanent Establishment:
- The profits are attributed based on what the PE **would have earned** if it were a separate, independent enterprise:
  - Under the same or similar conditions
  - Dealing independently with other businesses

#### ✅ Deductions Allowed:
- All **operating expenses** of the PE (including executive and general administrative costs) may be deducted, whether incurred in Canada or abroad.

> 📌 This ensures a fair and realistic calculation of profits.

#### 📏 Apportionment Method:
- A country may use **apportionment of total profits** among different parts of an enterprise (e.g., by revenue, assets, or staff).
- However, the method must **reflect the actual economic activity** and not distort the true profit.

> ❌ Profits are **not attributed** simply because a PE purchases goods.

> 🔁 The method of attribution is applied **year by year**, unless there is a valid reason to change it.

#### ⚠️ Interaction with Other Articles:
- If profits are already dealt with in other sections (e.g., shipping, royalties), those rules **do not override** this section.

### 🔹 **8. Profits from Ships and Aircraft in International Traffic**

#### ✅ General Rule:
- Profits from operating ships or aircraft in **international traffic** are taxable **only in the country of the resident enterprise**.
