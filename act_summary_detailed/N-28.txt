The provided text consists of **repeated entries** indicating that a particular provision or section of a legislative act has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Bill C-4, 2015**, specifically under **section 128** of that act.

---

### Detailed Summary:

**Status of the Act/Provision:**  
The listed entries show that **a specific section (or possibly multiple sections)** of a prior act has been **repealed** — meaning it is no longer in force or legal effect.

- **Repealed:** The provision is no longer valid or applicable.
- **Date of Repeal:** 2015
- **Repealing Legislation:** *Bill C-4, 2015* (an Act to amend certain Acts and Regulations, commonly known as the *2015 Budget Implementation Act* or similar)
- **Section of Repealing Act:** Section 128

---

### Interpretation:

While the original act or section being repealed is not explicitly named in your input, the repeated notation suggests that **a number of provisions** (possibly a section, a schedule, or multiple subsections) were removed from the law due to changes in legislation.

Common reasons for such repeals include:
- Legislative modernization
- Redundancy or overlap with newer laws
- Alignment with updated policy or administrative frameworks
- Streamlining of the legal code
- Correction of outdated or obsolete provisions

Since the repealing section (s. 128 of C-4) is not detailed in your input, the exact nature of the repealed provisions (e.g., specific regulations, definitions, penalties, or administrative duties) cannot be determined without referencing the original legislation or the full text of Bill C-4, 2015.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not summarize a live or active act**, but rather indicates that **a number of provisions were formally removed from the law in 2015 via section 128 of Bill C-4**. As such, **no detailed content of the original act or its provisions can be reconstructed from this input alone**. To understand the substance of what was repealed, one would need to consult the original legislation or the full text of Bill C-4, 2015, particularly section 128 and its associated schedules or explanatory notes.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If this refers to a specific Canadian or provincial statute (e.g., the *Criminal Code*, *Health Act*, or *Labour Code*), the actual content of the repealed section would need to be verified from official legal databases such as [ParlInfo](https://www.parlinfo.gov.au), [CanLII](https://www.canlii.org), or the relevant provincial legislative website.

If you can provide the **name of the original act** or the **jurisdiction** (e.g., Canada, Ontario, Quebec), I can offer a more detailed and accurate summary of what was repealed.
