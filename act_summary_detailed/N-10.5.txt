**Detailed Summary of the *National Holocaust Monument Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Holocaust Monument Act* is a legislative measure introduced by the Government of Canada to establish a national monument in the National Capital Region (NCR) that commemorates the victims and Canadian survivors of the Holocaust. The Act is rooted in a commitment to remember the atrocities of the Holocaust, honor the memory of those who perished, and ensure that future generations remain aware of the dangers of hatred, genocide, and state-sanctioned anti-Semitism.

---

### **Preamble: Purpose and Context**

The Act begins with a series of "whereas" clauses that establish its foundational rationale:

1. **Lack of Public Commemoration**: There is currently no public monument in the National Capital Region honoring all Holocaust victims and Canadian survivors.
2. **Scale of the Holocaust**: The Nazis murdered six million Jews during World War II, as part of a broader plan to exterminate entire groups based on race, ideology, and perceived "racial inferiority."
3. **Targeted Persecution**: Beyond Jews, the Nazis also systematically targeted disabled individuals, Roma (Gypsies), and homosexuals in their effort to create a so-called "pure" Aryan society.
4. **Moral Obligation**: Canada has a responsibility to preserve the memory of Holocaust victims as part of national consciousness and to ensure that such atrocities are never forgotten.
5. **Educational Value**: A national monument will serve as an enduring educational tool to teach the root causes of the Holocaust and its consequences, helping to prevent future genocides.
6. **Prevention of Hatred**: The monument will serve as a permanent reminder of the dangers of state-sponsored hatred, anti-Semitism, and intolerance.

This moral and historical imperative drives the creation of a national monument that is both symbolic and educational.
