### **Detailed Summary of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act***  

---

#### **1. Overview and Purpose**  
The *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act* (FNJEEA) is a foundational piece of legislation enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. Its primary purpose is to **recognize, enable, and implement the self-governance of specific First Nations in British Columbia over education** on their lands.  

This Act brings into effect **individual agreements** between the Government of Canada and participating First Nations, which grant those First Nations **jurisdiction over education** on First Nation land. The Act ensures that such jurisdiction is legally recognized, enforceable, and protected within the Canadian legal framework.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**  
The Act establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Authority**: Refers to the *First Nations Education Authority (FNEA)* established under Section 11. This body acts as a supporting and regulatory entity for education on First Nation land.
- **Council of a Participating First Nation**: Has the same meaning as “council of the band” under subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*, ensuring continuity with existing governance structures.
- **Education**: Defined broadly as education programs and services from kindergarten through Grade 12.
- **First Nation Land**: Includes reserves defined under the *Indian Act* and also includes land defined under the *Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act*.
- **First Nation Law**: Laws made under subsection 9(1) of this Act — i.e., laws enacted by a participating First Nation in relation to education.
- **Individual Agreement**: A legally binding agreement between Her Majesty (Canada) and a participating First Nation regarding jurisdiction over education on First Nation land. Amendments to such agreements are also included.
- **Minister**: Refers to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs (formerly Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development).
- **Participating First Nation**: A specific band listed in the Schedule to the Act. As of the text, these include:
  - ?aq’am  
  - Cowichan Tribes  
  - Lil’wat Nation  
  - Seabird Island  
  - Canim Lake  
  - Ditidaht First Nation  
  - Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation)

> *Note:* Unless otherwise specified, terms used in this Act have the same meaning as in the *Indian Act*.

#### **3. Precedence of Agreements**  
The Act establishes a hierarchy of legal authority:
- **Individual agreements prevail over any Act of Parliament**, including this Act, **to the extent of conflict**.
- **This Act prevails over any other Act of Parliament** to the extent of conflict — ensuring that the rights granted under the individual agreements are not undermined by other federal statutes.

This reflects a principle of **constitutional recognition and self-determination**, affirming that First Nations have the right to make their own education laws and manage their own schools, even when those laws may appear to conflict with broader federal policies.

---

#### **4. Bringing Agreements into Effect**  
- The Governor in Council may issue an **order** to bring an individual agreement into effect and add the participating First Nation’s name to the Schedule.
- Once an order is made, the individual agreement **gains full force of law**.
- The Governor in Council may **remove a First Nation from the Schedule** if the Minister determines that the First Nation has entered into a **comprehensive self-government agreement**, a **treaty**, or a **land claims agreement** that includes jurisdiction over education.

---

#### **5. Powers of Participating First Nations**  
Under the Act, participating First Nations have the power to:
- **Enact laws** regarding education on First Nation land.
- **Delegate** this power to the First Nations Education Authority (FNEA) to make laws on behalf of the Nation.

These powers are **limited to the scope of the individual agreement**, and the Act emphasizes that no provision in this Act invalidates any specific terms of an individual agreement not explicitly addressed here.

---

#### **6. Education Transfer Rights**  
A key provision ensures **educational equity and continuity**:
> A participating First Nation must provide education so that students can **transfer without academic penalty** to an equivalent level in the British Columbia public school system.

This promotes access to broader educational opportunities and prevents academic disadvantages due to geographic or jurisdictional boundaries.

---

#### **7. Establishment of the First Nations Education Authority (FNEA)**  
The FNEA is established in British Columbia as a **distinct legal entity** with the following attributes:

- **Legal Capacity**: The Authority has the **capacity of a natural person**, meaning it can:
  - Enter into contracts  
  - Acquire, hold, and dispose of property  
  - Raise, invest, or borrow money  
  - Sue and be sued in its own name  
- **Not an Agent of Her Majesty**: It is independent and not acting on behalf of the Crown.
- **Board of Directors**:
  - Minimum of **six directors**, including a President and Vice-President.
  - Each participating First Nation appoints **two directors**, at least one of whom must be a member of the Nation.
  - Initial term: **two years**; reappointment possible for further terms, as decided by the board.
  - Directors can be removed by the board for "cause" or under grounds set out in the board’s rules.
- **Leadership Roles**:
  - The board appoints a President and Vice-President from among directors.
  - Initial term: **not exceeding two years**, with reappointment possible.
- **Board Rules**:
  - May establish internal rules covering:
    - Grounds for director removal  
    - Administrative management  
    - Duties of officers, employees, and retained personnel  

> The Authority’s head office must be located in British Columbia.

#### **8. Authority’s Responsibilities and Functions**  
The FNEA is mandated to:
- Assist participating First Nations in **developing educational capacity**.
- Provide **co-management agreements** with participating First Nations upon request and in accordance with individual agreements.

Specific duties include:
1. **Establish curriculum and examination standards** for courses required to meet graduation requirements.
2. **Provide a teacher certification process** for teachers delivering instruction in schools operated by a participating First Nation — **except** for those teaching only the language and culture of the Nation.
3. **Provide a certification process** for teachers who teach only the language and culture of the Nation (upon request).
4. **Certify schools** operated by a participating First Nation.
5. **Perform other duties** consistent with individual agreements and this Act.

> The Authority must **consult with British Columbia’s competent education authorities** (e.g., B.C. Ministry of Education) when establishing standards.

---

#### **9. Expansion of Authority to Other First Nations**  
The FNEA may enter into agreements with **non-participating First Nations** if:
- The First Nation has entered into a **comprehensive self-government agreement**, **treaty**, or **land claims agreement** that grants jurisdiction over education.

In such cases:
- The FNEA may enter into an education agreement with the First Nation.
- Upon entering into such an agreement, the FNEA **exercises jurisdiction over education** in a manner consistent with the individual agreement.
- The First Nation may appoint **two directors** to the FNEA board (at least one a member of the Nation), with similar terms and removal rights.

This provision enables **broader application** of the FNEA’s support functions beyond just the initial list of participating First Nations.

---

#### **10. Community Education Authorities (CEAs)**  
Participating First Nations may establish **Community Education Authorities (CEAs)** to:
- Operate, administer, and manage their own education systems on First Nation land.
- These CEAs have the **same powers, rights, privileges, and benefits** as the First Nation itself, and are subject to the same **liabilities and duties** under First Nation law as defined in the individual agreement.

> Upon the coming into force of a First Nation law, **Sections 114 to 122 of the Indian Act cease to apply** to the participating First Nation and its members — effectively removing federal restrictions on education governance.

---

#### **11. Indemnity Provisions**  
To protect both parties from legal liability, the Act includes strong **indemnity clauses**:

- **Her Majesty (the Crown) indemnifies** a participating First Nation for any loss arising from actions or omissions by the Crown or its authorized agents in education matters.
- **The participating First Nation indemnifies** the Crown for any loss arising from its own actions or omissions in education matters.

These provisions ensure that **neither party bears undue legal or financial risk** when exercising jurisdiction over education.

---

#### **12. Legal Recognition and Judicial Notice**  
- **Judicial notice** is taken of:
  - All individual agreements  
  - All First Nation laws  
- A copy of a First Nation law deposited in the public registry of First Nation laws is **evidence of that law and its contents**, unless contradicted.
- First Nation laws are **not considered statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act* — meaning they are not subject to the same review or approval processes as federal regulations.
- No body established under this Act or a First Nation law is considered a **federal board, commission, or tribunal** under the *Federal Courts Act*.

---

#### **13. Procedural Safeguards in Legal Proceedings**  
Any party in a legal proceeding must:
- Serve written notice to both the **
