**Detailed Summary of the *Postal Services Resumption and Continuation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Postal Services Resumption and Continuation Act* is a temporary, emergency legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of Canada to resolve a prolonged labor dispute between the **Canada Post Corporation** (the employer) and the **Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW)** (the union), which had led to widespread work stoppages in the postal sector. The Act was introduced in response to significant disruptions in mail and parcel delivery, economic harm to workers, consumers, and businesses, and the urgent public need for stable, functioning postal services.

This legislation provides a comprehensive framework to:

- Immediately resume postal operations;
- Protect employees from disciplinary action due to prior strikes;
- Extend the validity of expired collective agreements temporarily;
- Establish a special mediator-arbitrator to resolve disputes over the renewal of collective agreements;
- Ensure fair and equitable outcomes that balance worker rights, employer sustainability, and public service delivery.

## **Background and Context**

1. **Expired Collective Agreements**  
   - The two expired collective agreements were:
     - One expiring on **December 31, 2017**
     - One expiring on **January 31, 2018**

2. **Negotiations and Stalemate**  
   - Since **November 2017**, the parties engaged in collective bargaining to reach new agreements.
   - Despite repeated meetings between the **Minister of Labour** and the parties, negotiations failed to produce a resolution.
   - In **July 2018**, the Minister appointed **conciliation officers**, but no agreement was reached.
   - In **September 2018**, **mediators** were appointed to assist in negotiations.
   - On **October 22, 2018**, work stoppages (strikes) began, disrupting essential postal services.

3. **Escalation of Disruptions**  
   - The strikes severely impacted:
     - Delivery of mail and parcels across Canada
     - Consumer access to postal services
     - Business operations relying on timely communication
     - The livelihoods of postal workers and their families

4. **Government Intervention**  
   - The Minister of Labour recognized the **public interest** in resolving the dispute swiftly and fairly.
   - Given the negative consequences of the strike, the government concluded that an **exceptional solution** was required to restore normal operations and achieve a new collective agreement.

### **6. Dispute Resolution Mechanism: Mediator-Arbitrator (Sections 7–12)**

To resolve core disputes over the renewal of collective agreements, the Act establishes a **special mediator-arbitrator** with broad powers.

#### **Appointment Process (Section 7)**

- Within **two days** of the Act coming into force, both the employer and the union can submit lists of up to **three qualified individuals** for the role.
- If the lists have:
  - **One name in common** → that person is appointed as mediator-arbitrator.
  - **More than one name in common** → one is chosen.
- If:
  - No names are in common, or
  - Lists are not received within the two-day period,
  → The Minister appoints the mediator-arbitrator **after consulting the Chairperson of the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB)**.

#### **Powers and Duties (Section 8)**

The mediator-arbitrator has all powers and duties under:
- **Paragraphs 60(1)(a), (a.2) to (a.4)** and
- **Sections 61 and 84 of the Canada Labour Code**

These include:
- Mediation
- Arbitration
- Final offer selection

#### **Timeline and Process (Section 9)**

- The mediator-arbitrator has **90 days** (or more if extended) to:
  1. **Mediate** all disputed matters related to the amendment or revision of the collective agreements.
  2. If mediation fails:
     - **Arbitrate** the matter and issue a decision, OR
     - Ask each party to submit a **final offer** (in writing), and then **select** one (employer’s or union’s) to resolve the dispute.
- The mediator must **report to the Minister** and provide the parties with a copy of the report.

> The choice between mediation and arbitration is at the **discretion of the mediator-arbitrator**.

#### **Guiding Principles in Decision-Making (Section 10)**

When making decisions or selecting final offers, the mediator-arbitrator must prioritize:

1. **Employee health and safety**
2. **Equal pay for work of equal value**
3. **Fair treatment of temporary, part-time, and non-standard employees**
4. **Financial sustainability of Canada Post**
5. **Collaborative labour-management relations**
6. **High-quality, affordable postal service for Canadians**

> These principles ensure that the final agreement balances fairness, economic viability, and public service quality.

#### **Time Limit for Mediation (Section 11)**

- The mediator has **up to 7 days** (extendable by up to 7 days with party agreement) to begin mediation.
- This ensures timely action without undue delay.

#### **Final Offer Requirements (Section 12)**

- Final offers must include **proposed contractual language** that can be incorporated directly into a new collective agreement.

> If one party fails to submit a final offer when requested, the mediator-arbitrator **selects the offer from the other party**.

> This prevents deadlock and ensures progress toward a resolution.

### **7. Early Agreement and Termination of Duties**

- If the employer and union **reach a new collective agreement before the mediator-arbitrator reports**, then:
  - The mediator-arbitrator’s duties **cease immediately** upon the new agreement being signed.
- This allows flexibility for parties to resolve disputes through mutual agreement.

---

### **8. Financial Responsibility (Section 13)**

- All costs related to the appointment and duties of the mediator-arbitrator are **debts due to Her Majesty in Right of Canada**.
- These costs are to be **shared equally** between the employer and the union in any court of competent jurisdiction.

> This ensures accountability and prevents either party from bearing the full burden.

### **9. Formation of the New Collective Agreement (Section 14)**

After the mediator-arbitrator reports, a **new collective agreement** becomes effective and binding, consisting of:

1. All agreements entered into **before** the mediator’s appointment, regarding the amendment or revision of the expired
