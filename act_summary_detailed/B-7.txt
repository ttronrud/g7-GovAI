### **Detailed Summary of the Bretton Woods and Related Agreements Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
The *Bretton Woods and Related Agreements Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that formalizes Canada’s participation in key international financial institutions established during the 1944 United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods. The Act enables Canada to become a member of five major multilateral financial institutions:

- **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**  
- **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)** – commonly known as the World Bank  
- **International Development Association (IDA)**  
- **International Finance Corporation (IFC)**  
- **Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)**

This Act provides the legal framework for Canada to:
- Accept the **Articles of Agreement** and the **Convention** governing these institutions,
- Fulfill its obligations under them,
- Exercise rights granted by those agreements,
- And ensure that Canada’s participation is properly managed through government authorities.

---

#### **2. Key Provisions and Legislative Framework**

##### **(A) Approval of Agreements**
- The **Agreements** (as set out in Schedules I to V) are **approved by Canada** under this Act.
- These include:
  - **Schedule I**: Articles of Agreement of the IMF
  - **Schedule II**: Articles of Agreement of the IBRD
  - **Schedule III**: Articles of Agreement of the IDA
  - **Schedule IV**: Articles of Agreement of the IFC
  - **Schedule V**: Convention establishing MIGA

> This means Canada formally recognizes and ratifies these international instruments, thereby becoming a full member.

---

##### **(B) Authority to Accept Agreements**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has broad authority to:
  - **Accept the Agreements on behalf of Canada**,
  - Make **appointments**,
  - Authorize **acts, transactions, orders, and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreements and carry out Canada’s obligations.

> This gives the federal government flexibility to manage Canada’s integration into the institutions, including administrative and operational matters.

---

##### **(C) Setting the Par Value of the Canadian Dollar**
- The Governor in Council may take **measures necessary** to establish the **par value of the Canadian dollar** in accordance with the **IMF Agreement**.
- This is critical because the IMF requires member countries to maintain exchange rate stability, and Canada must define a reference value for its currency within the system.

> This provision allows Canada to align its currency valuation with international standards under the IMF framework.

---

##### **(D) Legal Force of Article VIII, Paragraph 2(b)**
- The **first sentence of paragraph 2(b) of Article VIII of the IMF Agreement** has **the force of law in Canada**.
- This means that Canada is legally bound by this clause, which typically relates to the **obligation of member countries to maintain exchange stability** and to avoid competitive devaluation.

> This strengthens Canada’s legal commitment to maintaining a stable and orderly exchange rate regime.

---

##### **(E) Role of the Bank of Canada**
- The **Bank of Canada** is designated as the **depository** in Canada for:
  - All assets and holdings of the IMF, IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA.
- It will act as the **central repository** for these institutions’ monetary assets in Canada.

> This ensures transparency, security, and operational efficiency in managing Canada’s financial exposure to these institutions.

---

##### **(F) Initial Subscriptions and Financial Contributions**

###### **1. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)**
- The **Minister of Finance** may pay up to **$6,416,260 USD** (six million, four hundred and sixteen thousand, two hundred and sixty American dollars) from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** for Canada’s **initial subscription** to MIGA.

> This is a one-time, limited contribution to start Canada’s participation in MIGA, which supports foreign investment in developing countries.

###### **2. International Monetary Fund (IMF)**
- Canada may contribute up to **16.535 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)** to the IMF.
- SDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement member countries’ foreign exchange reserves.

> This amount is equivalent to the **subscription required from Canada** under the IMF Agreement.

---

##### **(G) Financial Assistance to International Institutions**
The Minister of Finance may provide **financial assistance** to the IMF, IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA through various mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct payments, grants, and loans** | Can be made directly or through trusts or bodies established by the institutions. |
| **Non-interest-bearing, non-negotiable demand notes** | These are essentially short-term, zero-interest instruments that can be used to meet temporary funding needs. |
| **Purchase of shares** | On behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada. |
| **Issuance of guarantees** | To support loans or operations of the institutions. |
| **Other appropriate methods** | As determined by the Minister. |

> This provision gives Canada significant flexibility in supporting the operations of these institutions, especially in times of global financial stress.

---

##### **(H) Limits on Financial Assistance**
- The total amount of financial assistance provided in any given period **cannot exceed** the amount **appropriated by Parliament**.
- This ensures that such spending remains **accountable and subject to democratic oversight**.

---

##### **(I) Lending to the IMF**
The Minister of Finance may lend to the IMF under two scenarios:

1. **To fund trusts or bodies** assisting the Fund’s purposes:
   - Maximum: **$250 million** (or a higher amount approved by the Governor in Council).

2. **To assist in safeguarding global economic and financial stability**:
   - Maximum: **$13 billion SDRs** (or a higher amount approved by the Governor in Council).

> These lending powers allow Canada to support the IMF’s role in stabilizing global financial systems during crises.

---

##### **(J) Reassignment of Funds**
- The Minister of Finance may **reassign funds** subscribed or owed by Canada to the IMF for similar purposes within the Fund.
- This provides operational flexibility in how Canada manages its financial commitments.

> Example: Redirecting a portion of a contribution to support a specific program or emergency response.

---

##### **(K) Transactions in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)**
- The Minister of Finance may carry out financial transactions involving SDRs in accordance with the **policy established under Section 17.1(1) of the Currency Act**.
- This ensures that SDR usage is consistent with Canada’s broader monetary policy and exchange rate management.

---

##### **(L) Guarantee of Foreign Credit Facilities**
- If the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** provides a credit facility to a country seeking financial assistance from the IMF or IBRD, and the Minister of Finance determines that the facility is **necessary to facilitate such assistance**, the Minister may:
  - Enter into an agreement with the BIS to **guarantee repayment** of the principal and interest.

> Key limitations:
- Term: **No longer than one year**
- Maximum repayment amount: **$500 million USD** or **10% of the credit facility**, whichever is greater

> This allows Canada to support international financial stability without exposing itself to unmanageable risks.

---

##### **(M) Role of Export Development Canada (EDC)**
- EDC may act as an **agent of the Minister of Finance** to provide financial assistance to a foreign state under the above provisions.
- This expands Canada’s ability to support foreign economies through structured financial instruments.

> EDC’s role is limited to **acting as an agent**, not as a direct lender.

---

##### **(N) Financial Assistance to Foreign States**
- The Minister of Finance may provide financial assistance to a **foreign state** (a country other than Canada) **only if**:
  1. The foreign state has an **IMF arrangement** (i.e., it is a member of the IMF),
  2. Other countries will participate in the assistance in an amount the Minister considers **satisfactory**.

> **Maximum limits**:
- Per foreign state: **$15 billion**
- Total across all foreign states: **$22 billion**

> The total financial obligation includes:
- Outstanding principal of credit arrangements,
- Any future advances by Canada,
- Contingent liabilities arising from such arrangements.

> This ensures that Canada does not overcommit to foreign financial support and maintains fiscal responsibility.

---

##### **(O) Reporting Requirements**
- The **Minister of Finance** must lay before each House of Parliament:
  - A **summary report** of operations under the Act annually,
  - Details of all operations directly affecting Canada (e.g., lending, contributions, procurement),
  - The **communiqués** issued by:
    - The **IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC)**,
