### **Detailed Summary of the *Underused Housing Tax Act***

---

#### **1. Overview of the Act**
The *Underused Housing Tax Act* is a Canadian federal legislation introduced to address the issue of underutilized residential property — particularly housing that is not being used for residential purposes despite being available for occupancy. The core objective of the Act is to ensure that residential properties are being used efficiently by imposing a tax on owners who fail to meet certain occupancy thresholds.

The Act applies to individuals and entities who own residential property in Canada but do not maintain it as a primary residence or allow it to be occupied by eligible individuals for at least a qualifying period. It introduces a tax liability based on the ownership percentage and the value of the property, with exemptions or reduced obligations for specific categories of owners (e.g., trusts, charities, Indigenous bodies, etc.).

#### **2. Key Definitions and Key Concepts**

| Term | Meaning and Context |
|------|---------------------|
| **Residential Property** | A dwelling unit (e.g., detached house, semi-detached, condominium) that contains private kitchen, bathroom, and living space. Excludes commercial or non-residential properties. Includes parts of larger buildings that are intended to be self-contained. |
| **Owner** | A person legally identified as an owner via land registration or other systems. Includes life tenants, life lease holders, and those with continuous possession under long-term leases. Does *not* include someone who merely grants possession. |
| **Excluded Owner** | Specific categories of owners who are exempt from the tax. These include: <br> - Trustees of specified Canadian trusts (e.g., mutual fund trusts, REITs, SIFT trusts) <br> - Partners in specified Canadian partnerships <br> - Certain corporations (e.g., publicly traded, listed on Canadian exchanges) <br> - Registered charities, cooperatives, hospitals, municipalities, universities, para-municipal organizations, Indigenous governing bodies <br> - Personal representatives of deceased individuals (in certain cases) <br> - Prescribed persons (as defined by regulation) |
| **Ownership Percentage** | The proportion of ownership in a residential property held by a particular individual. Determined through: <br> - Land registration records (if clearly stated) <br> - Individual’s return (if self-reported and approved by the Minister) <br> - Formula-based calculation if no percentage is recorded (sum of other owners’ percentages divided by total number of unquantified owners) |
| **Taxable Value** | The value used to calculate the tax. If not prescribed, it is the greater of: <br> - The value established by a provincial property tax authority <br> - The most recent sale price of the property before December 31 of the year |
| **Fair Rent** | The amount of rent that would be considered reasonable for the property in a given calendar year. If not prescribed, it is 5% of the taxable value. This serves as a benchmark for determining whether occupancy is at market rate. |
| **Qualifying Occupancy Period** | A period of **at least one month** during which one of the following individuals occupies a dwelling unit: <br> - A person dealing at arm’s length with the owner and spouse/common-law partner, under a written agreement <br> - A person not dealing at arm’s length but occupying the unit for **consideration not below fair rent** (prorated) <br> - The owner or spouse/common-law partner in Canada for authorized work under a work permit <br> - Spouse, common-law partner, parent, or child of the owner who is a citizen or permanent resident <br> - A prescribed individual (as defined by regulation) |
| **Arm’s Length Principle** | Related persons are deemed not to deal at arm’s length. Whether unrelated persons deal at arm’s length is a question of fact. This is based on the Income Tax Act’s definition of related persons (subsections 251(2)–(6)). A partner or trustee is deemed related to the partnership or trust. |
| **Tax Liability** | Every owner (excluding excluded owners) must pay a tax equal to: <br> **Tax = 1% × (Taxable Value) × (Ownership Percentage)** <br> This applies to the calendar year in which the property is owned. |

#### **3. Tax Calculation and Payment Requirements**

- **Tax Rate**: A flat rate of **1%** applied to the taxable value of the property, multiplied by the owner’s ownership percentage.
  
- **Election to Use Fair Market Value**:
  - An owner may elect to use the **fair market value** (FMV) instead of the taxable value, provided:
    - The FMV is determined in a manner satisfactory to the Minister.
    - The election is made **on or after January 1** and **on or before April 30** of the following calendar year.
  - This election must be made in a **prescribed form** and filed with the Minister by **April 30 of the following year**, or a later date permitted by the Minister.

- **Payment Deadline**: The tax must be paid to the **Receiver General** by **April 30 of the following calendar year** after the year in which the property is owned.

- **Exemption Clause**:
  - No tax is payable **if** the residential property is **not suitable for year-round use** as a place of residence.
  - This exemption is **repealed** in the 2024 amendments (c. 17, s. 138), meaning it is no longer in force. Thus, **all residential properties** (unless excluded) are now subject to the tax **if they are not used for qualifying occupancy**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The exemption related to unsuitability for year-round use has been **removed** by legislative amendment in 2024, which significantly increases the scope of the tax.

#### **4. Exemptions and Excluded Entities**

The following categories of owners are **exempt** from the tax:

| Category | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Specified Canadian Trusts** | Includes mutual fund trusts, REITs, SIFT trusts, and other trusts where beneficiaries are citizens or permanent residents or other qualifying entities. |
| **Specified Canadian Partnerships** | Partnerships where all members are excluded owners or specified trusts. |
| **Specified Canadian Corporations** | Corporations where ownership is held by citizens or permanent residents, or where 10% or more of shares are held by non-residents or non-citizens — *only if* such ownership is not significant. |
| **Registered Charities, Cooperatives, Municipalities, Universities, etc.** | Entities that serve public or social functions. |
| **Indigenous Governing Bodies** | Bodies recognized under the Department of Indigenous Services Act. |
| **Personal Representatives of Deceased Individuals** | In specific circumstances. |
| **Prescribed Persons** | As defined by regulation (e.g., government agencies, certain institutions). |

These exemptions are designed to protect entities that operate in the public interest or manage property for social or institutional purposes.

#### **5. Enforcement and Administration**

- **Commissioner of Revenue** (Canada Revenue Agency): The primary officer responsible for administering and enforcing the Act, except in sections 21, 22, and 83.
- **Officer**: Any person appointed or employed in the administration or enforcement of the Act.
- **Confirmed Delivery Service**: Certified mail or other services that provide proof of delivery (e.g., registered mail). Required for sending notices or forms to owners.
- **Record**: Any material (paper, digital, etc.) that contains information and can be read or processed by a person or system.

- **Collection of Tax**: The Act explicitly includes the **collection of tax** as part of its administration and enforcement.

#### **6. Key Provisions and Legal Principles**

- **Arm’s Length Doctrine**: The Act assumes that related parties (e.g., spouses, partners, family members) are not dealing at arm’s length. This affects how rental agreements and occupancy are evaluated.
- **Deemed Ownership**: If a person is a partner in a partnership or a trustee in a trust, the Act treats them as a separate individual for the purposes of ownership and tax liability.
- **Qualifying Occupancy is Mandatory**: To avoid tax liability, at least one qualifying individual must occupy the dwelling unit for a qualifying period.
- **No Tax if No Qualifying Occupancy**: If no qualifying occupancy occurs during the year, tax is due — unless the property is excluded or unsuitable for year-round use (which is now repealed).
- **Disaster Exceptions**: The Act defines "disaster" (e.g., fire, flood, oil spill) and may allow temporary relief or exemptions in such cases, though no specific relief mechanism is detailed here.

#### **7. Legislative Intent and Policy Objectives**

The primary goals of the *Underused Housing Tax Act* are:

1. **Promote Housing Utilization**: Encourage owners to use their properties for residential purposes rather than leaving them vacant.
2. **Address Housing Shortages**: By taxing underused housing, the government aims to increase the supply of available homes, especially in urban areas.
3. **Ensure Fairness in Property Use**: Prevents property owners from profiting from idle or underused real estate without contributing to public housing needs.
4. **Support Social Equity**: Exemptions for public institutions, charities, and Indigenous communities reflect a commitment to equitable access to housing and social responsibility.
