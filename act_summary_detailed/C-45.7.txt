## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Naskapi and the Cree-Naskapi Commission Act**

### 📌 **Background and Purpose**

The *Naskapi and the Cree-Naskapi Commission Act* (commonly referred to as the **Naskapi Band Act**) was enacted to fulfill a specific obligation under **Section 7 of the Northeastern Quebec Agreement (NEQA)**, which requires the Government of Canada to recommend special legislation that establishes an **orderly and efficient system of local government** for the Naskapi people.

This Act provides the **legal foundation for the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach** to establish and operate as a **self-governing Indigenous band**, with full authority over its **Category IA-N land**, natural resources, and internal affairs—subject to the terms of the NEQA and other relevant agreements.

> **Key Purpose**: To enable the Naskapi Nation to administer, manage, and control its land and resources independently and efficiently, while protecting individual and collective rights under the NEQA.

### 🏛️ **Core Legal Framework and Key Definitions**

#### 1. **The Naskapi Band**
- The legal entity established is the **Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach**, formerly known as the *Indian Act Naskapis de Schefferville band*.
- It is now a **corporation** with full legal capacity, recognized as a **natural person** under the Act.
- The band may be officially referred to in three languages:
  - **English**: *Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach*
  - **French**: *Nation naskapie de Kawawachikamach*
  - **Naskapi**: *Kobac Naskapi-aeyouch*

> This reflects a commitment to **language sovereignty and cultural identity**.

#### 2. **Category IA-N Land**
This is the central land base of the Naskapi Nation. It includes:
- Land transferred from Quebec to Canada by **temporary deed (1981)** and later confirmed by **final deed** under the NEQA.
- Land **set aside by the Governor in Council** for the exclusive use and benefit of the Naskapi band.
- Any land designated as Category IA-N land under **paragraph 125(1)(d)** of the Act.

> This land is **not subject to the Indian Act** for governance purposes, except for determining who qualifies as an "Indian" under federal law.

#### 3. **Category II-N and III Land**
- **Category II-N land**: Allocated under the NEQA for specific purposes (e.g., economic development).
- **Category III land**: Land within the perimeter of Category IA-N land that was **ceded prior to January 31, 1978**, and now falls under the band’s jurisdiction.

> These lands are included in the **territorial scope** of band by-laws and governance.

#### 4. **Band Members and Electors**
- **Members of the band** = **Naskapi beneficiaries** (as defined in the NEQA).
- **Electors** = All members aged **18 or over** who are not under curatorship in Quebec.
- **Important Exception**: Individuals who were members of the former *Indian Act Naskapis de Schefferville band* but were **not Naskapi beneficiaries** are:
  - Deemed **members** for certain legal purposes (e.g., section 45, 55, 90, 94, 103).
  - Deemed **electors** for voting purposes (except on matters in Parts VI–IX, which may require special approval).

> This ensures continuity of governance and rights for those who were part of the original band structure.

#### 5. **Exclusions from the Indian Act**
- The **Indian Act does not apply** to:
  - The band as a whole.
  - Category IA-N land.
- **Exception**: Only for determining whether a person is an "Indian" under the Indian Act (for enrollment, status, etc.).

> This is a significant step toward **Indigenous self-determination**, removing federal administrative control over land and governance.
