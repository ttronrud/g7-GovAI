**Detailed Summary of the *Legislative Instruments Re-enactment Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Legislative Instruments Re-enactment Act* is a Canadian statute enacted to ensure that certain **legislative instruments**—specifically those originally enacted in only one official language—receive **equal publication in both official languages (English and French)**, in accordance with Canada’s Official Languages Act. This Act addresses historical inconsistencies in the bilingual publication of administrative or regulatory instruments, ensuring legal equality and access for all Canadians regardless of language.

It also provides a mechanism for **re-enacting** such instruments in both languages, even if the original legislative power or governing body no longer exists, and establishes clear rules regarding retroactivity, authority, and oversight.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Citation of the Act**
- The Act is titled: **"The Legislative Instruments Re-enactment Act"**.
- This title reflects its purpose: to re-enact legislative instruments in both official languages.

---

### **2. Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Enacted** | Includes issuance, making, or establishment (covers all forms of creation). |
| **Government Publication** | Refers to the *Canada Gazette* or any other official publication of the Government of Canada where legislative instruments were previously published. |
| **Legislative Instrument** | Defined in two parts: <br> (a) An instrument enacted before September 15, 1988, by or with the approval of the Governor in Council or a minister exercising a legislative power under an Act of Parliament; or <br> (b) An instrument that amends or repeals such an instrument. |

> This definition focuses on instruments created prior to a key date (September 15, 1988), when the *Official Languages Act* mandated that all legislative instruments be published in both official languages.

---

### **3. Mandatory Bilingual Re-enactment (Section 3)**

> **Subsection 3(1):**  
Every legislative instrument originally enacted in **only one official language** that was **published in both languages at the time of enactment** is hereby **re-enacted in both official languages**, in the **same form** as it was originally published.

#### Key Points:
- Applies only to instruments that were **already published in both languages** at the time of enactment.
- The re-enactment is **not a new creation**—it preserves the original text.
- Ensures consistency and continuity in legal effect.

#### Retroactivity and Repeal (Subsection 3(2)):
- The **provisions of the re-enacted instrument are retroactive**.
- They are deemed to have come into force on the **same day(s)** as the original instrument.
- The original provisions are deemed **repealed as of that date**.

> This means that any legal effect, rights, or obligations created by the original instrument continue to apply, even though it is now officially bilingual.

---

### **4. Optional Re-enactment for Instruments Not Published Bilingually (Section 4)**

> **Subsection 4(1):**  
If a legislative instrument was originally enacted in one language and:
- Was published in **only one official language**, or  
- Was **exempted by law** from being published in a government publication,

Then the **Governor in Council may, by regulation**, repeal it and re-enact it in **both official languages**, without changing the original version in the first language.

#### Key Features:
- Provides a **flexible pathway** for instruments that were historically not required to be bilingual.
- Allows the government to correct past omissions in bilingual publication.
- Maintains the **original content** of the instrument in its original language.

#### Retroactivity Requirement (Subsection 4(2)):
- Any regulation under this subsection must **state that the re-enacted provisions are retroactive** to the day(s) the original instrument came into force.

> Ensures legal continuity and prevents gaps in legal application.

---

### **5. Authority to Re-enact Despite Changes in Power or Body (Subsection 4(3))**

> The Governor in Council may **repeal and re-enact** a legislative instrument under subsection (1) **even if**:
- The legislative power under which it was originally enacted no longer exists, or  
- The office or body that enacted it no longer exists.

#### Significance:
- This provision ensures that **historical instruments do not become obsolete due to changes in government structure or legal powers**.
- Provides **legal stability** and prevents the loss of important administrative rules due to administrative or constitutional shifts.

> Example: A regulation made by a former minister in 1970 may still be valid and bilingual today, even though the ministerial office was abolished.

---

### **6. No New Conditions Apply (Subsection 4(4))**

> The re-enactment is **not subject to the same conditions** (e.g., approval, review, or time limits) that applied to the original enactment.

#### Purpose:
- Prevents over-regulation or delays in re-enacting instruments.
- Ensures that re-enactment is **not hampered by outdated procedural requirements**.

---

### **7. Publication of Regulations (Subsection 4(5))**

> A regulation made under subsection (1) must be published in the *Canada Gazette*, **unless** it is a regulation of a class referred to in subsection 15(3) of the *Statutory Instruments Regulations*.

#### Exception:
- Certain types of regulations (e.g., those under specific statutory classes) may be exempt from *Canada Gazette* publication.

> Ensures transparency and public access to re-enacted instruments.

---

### **8. Automatic Repeal After Six Years (Section 8)**

> After **six years** from the coming into force of this Act, any legislative instrument described in subsection (1) that has **not been re-enacted in both official languages** is **automatically repealed**.

#### Purpose:
- Prevents indefinite accumulation of outdated or uncorrected instruments.
- Encourages timely action by the government to bring instruments into compliance with bilingual requirements.

> This creates a **time-bound obligation** to act—failure to re-enact within six years results in the instrument being nullified.

---

### **9. Legal Status and Citation of Re-enacted Instruments**

> **Subsection 9(1):**  
An instrument re-enacted under section 3 or 4 is **deemed to be and to have always been** the instrument it replaces.

> **Subsection 9(2):**  
It shall be **cited in the same manner** as the original instrument.

#### Implications:
- The re-enacted instrument is treated as if it had always existed in the same form.
- Legal references, citations, and case law will treat the re-enacted version as the original.
- Avoids confusion in legal interpretation or judicial decisions.

---

### **10. Authority to Amend or Repeal Re-enacted Instruments**

> For greater certainty, **any office or body that had the power to amend or repeal the original instrument** may also use that power to amend or repeal the re-enacted instrument.

#### Significance:
- Maintains **legal continuity** of administrative authority.
- Ensures that institutions with oversight responsibilities can continue to manage or update instruments as needed.

---

### **11. Flexibility in Referencing Titles (Section 10)**

> Where a legislative instrument was not published at the time of enactment or was published in only one language, the re-enacted instrument may be **referred to by its title in either official language**.

#### Purpose:
- Allows flexibility in how instruments are referenced in legal, administrative, or public documents.
- Avoids the need to always use the correct language in all contexts.

---

### **12. Equality of Authority of English and French Versions**

> The **English and French versions of a re-enacted instrument are equally authoritative**.

#### Legal Principle:
- No version is superior or secondary.
- Courts, agencies, and individuals may rely on either version with equal legal weight.

> This reinforces Canada’s commitment to **bilingualism and equality** under the *Official Languages Act*.

---

### **13. No Revival of Pre-Existing Instruments (Section 14)**

> An instrument that was **repealed or ceased to have effect before this Act came into force** is **not revived** by this Act or any regulation made under it for any period after its repeal.

#### Important Clarification:
- This Act **does not bring back** instruments that were already discontinued.
- It only applies to instruments that were **in force at the time of enactment** and were not fully published in both languages.

> Prevents misuse of the Act to resurrect outdated or invalid rules.

---

### **14. Exemption from Statutory Instruments Act (Section 15)**

> The *Statutory Instruments Act* **does not apply** to:
- Instruments re-enacted under section 3, or  
- Regulations made under section 4.

#### Rationale:
- These are not ordinary statutory instruments.
- They are **special-purpose re-enactments** tied to language compliance, not routine regulatory processes.
- Avoids unnecessary procedural hurdles (e.g., notice, consultation, or review) that would otherwise apply.

---

### **15. Permanent Review by Committee (Section 16)**

> Instruments re-enacted under section 3 or 4 are **permanently referred to the Committee referred to in section 19 of the Statutory Instruments Act** for **review and scrutiny**.

#### Purpose:
- Ensures ongoing **accountability and transparency**.
- Allows parliamentary oversight of the re-enactment process.
- Provides
