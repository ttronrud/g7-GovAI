**Detailed Summary of the *Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes two key institutions—**the Nunavut Water Board** and the **Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal**—as part of the implementation of the **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA)**. This Act provides statutory authority, structure, powers, and responsibilities for these bodies, ensuring that water rights and surface rights in Nunavut are governed in a way that respects Inuit rights, promotes environmental protection, and maintains equitable access to natural resources.

The Act came into force on **July 9, 1993**, the same day the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement was ratified by both the Government of Canada and the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area. It is designed to operationalize the promises made in that agreement, particularly regarding the establishment of independent, Indigenous-led institutions with statutory authority over water and land use.
