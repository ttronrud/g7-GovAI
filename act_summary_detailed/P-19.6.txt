#### **2. Resumption of Grain Handling Operations**  
- Upon coming into force, the **employer (Prince Rupert Grain Ltd.) must immediately resume grain handling operations** at the terminal on **Ridley Island, Prince Rupert, British Columbia**.
- All **employees must immediately resume their duties** when required to do so.
- This provision aims to restore essential economic and logistical functions of the port and ensures continuity in grain transportation and storage.

> **Note**: The Act is effective only after the twelfth hour following its assent (January 20, 1988), meaning it took effect on **January 21, 1988**.

---

#### **3. Union Responsibilities**  
- The union and its officers/representatives must:
  - **Immediately notify employees** of the resumption of operations and the requirement to resume work.
  - Take **reasonable steps to ensure compliance** with the resumption of work.
  - **Refrain from any conduct** that might discourage employees from returning to work.

> This provision places responsibility on the union to act positively and cooperatively in facilitating the return to operations, preventing any obstruction or demoralization of workers.

---

#### **4. Employer Protections Against Discipline**  
- The employer and its officers or representatives **must not**:
  - Impede any employee from complying with the resumption of duties.
  - Discharge, discipline, or authorize the discharge or discipline of any employee **because they previously participated in a strike before the Act came into force**.

> This is a critical protection for employees who may have been involved in a prior strike. It prevents retaliatory actions and upholds the principle of fair labor practices, reinforcing the legitimacy of the post-strike return to work.

---

#### **5. Extension and Amendment of the Collective Agreement**  
- The original collective agreement (expired December 31, 1983) is **extended** to cover the period from **January 1, 1984, to December 31, 1989**.
- On coming into force, the agreement is **deemed amended** to include:
  - The terms and conditions of the collective agreement between the **B.C. Terminal Elevator Operators’ Association** and the union, effective from **January 1, 1987, to December 31, 1989**.
  - **Exclusions**: Any terms related to matters referred to the arbitrator under subsection 7(1) are excluded from this amendment.

> This ensures continuity of employment terms while incorporating updated conditions from a newer agreement, particularly those related to staffing, job classifications, and security.

---

#### **6. Effectiveness and Legal Standing of the Amended Agreement**  
- The extended and amended collective agreement is:
  - **Effective and binding** on both parties for the extended term.
  - **Legally recognized** as if the original term had been extended to December 31, 1989, even though the original agreement expired in 1983.
- **Part V of the Canada Labour Code applies** to the agreement as amended, ensuring compliance with federal labor standards (e.g., minimum wage, working hours, health and safety).
- For **federal legislative purposes**, the agreement is treated as a binding agreement between the employer and **each individual employee**, not just the union.

> This strengthens the legal enforceability of the agreement and ensures that individual employees are protected under federal labor law.

---

#### **7. Prohibition of Strikes and Lockouts**  
During the extended term of the collective agreement (January 1, 1984 – December 31, 1989), the following are strictly prohibited:
- The **employer** shall not declare or cause a **lockout** against the union.
- No **union officer or representative** shall declare or authorize a **strike** against the employer.
- No **employee** shall participate in a strike against the employer.

> This provision establishes a **neutral, non-escalatory environment** during the period of agreement validity, preventing renewed industrial action that could disrupt operations.

---

#### **8. Arbitration of Disputed Issues**  
- The **Minister of Labour** shall appoint an **arbitrator** to resolve disputes over:
  - Staffing levels at the Grain Centre
  - Job classifications
  - Security personnel
- The arbitrator is granted **all powers and duties** equivalent to those under **section 157 of the Canada Labour Code**, including the authority to hear evidence, issue decisions, and make binding rulings.
- The arbitrator must deliver a decision on all referred matters **within 45 days** of appointment, or a longer period agreed upon by both parties.
- The decision must be presented in a **form suitable for incorporation into the collective agreement**, consistent with section 8 of the Act.

> This ensures a fair, independent, and legally sound resolution of unresolved labor disputes, providing a structured path to resolution without resorting to strikes or lockouts.

---

#### **9. Incorporation of Arbitrator’s Decision into the Agreement**  
- Once the arbitrator delivers a decision:
  - The collective agreement is **automatically amended** to include:
    - The arbitrator’s decision.
    - Any additional amendments agreed upon by the employer and union prior to the decision.
- This ensures that the final resolution becomes a formal, legally binding part of the employment contract.

---

#### **10. Flexibility in Agreement Amendments**  
- The Act **does not restrict** the parties’ ability to:
  - Amend any provision of the agreement (except the term of the agreement itself).
  - Reach new agreements on terms related to wages, benefits, or working conditions.
- This preserves flexibility for future negotiations while maintaining stability during the extended term.

---

#### **11. Offences and Penalties**  
Violations of the Act are punishable as **offences punishable on summary conviction**:

| Offence | Fine (per day or part of a day) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Individual** (acting as officer/representative of employer or union) | $10,000 to $50,000 |
| **Individual** (in any other case) | $500 to $1,000 |
| **Employer or Union** (contravening any provision) | $20,000 to $100,000 |

> These penalties are significant and serve as a deterrent against obstruction, retaliation, or unlawful conduct during the resumption of operations.

---

#### **12. Enforcement and Legal Standing**  
- For enforcement purposes, the **union is deemed a "person"** under the Act.  
- This allows the union to be treated as a legal entity capable of being sued or prosecuted, enhancing the effectiveness of enforcement mechanisms.

---

#### **13. Coming Into Force**  
- The Act comes into force on the **day immediately after** it is assented to (January 20, 1988), **but not before the twelfth hour after assent** (i.e., January 21, 1988 at 12:00 noon).  
- This ensures that the Act is not implemented prematurely and provides a clear timeline for compliance.
