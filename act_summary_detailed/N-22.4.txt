**Detailed Summary of the *Nelson House First Nation Flooded Land Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Nelson House First Nation Flooded Land Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. This Act provides a legal framework to clarify the rights, obligations, and financial arrangements related to land flooding and compensation that occurred under the *Flood Agreement* of 1977. It specifically addresses the status of payments and land transfers involving the **Nelson House First Nation** (NHFN), a First Nation community in Manitoba, in connection with the construction of hydroelectric infrastructure.

The Act ensures that the financial and property rights arising from the original 1977 agreement are properly recognized and administered, while also clarifying the legal status of those funds and lands under the *Indian Act*.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Citation of the Act**
- The Act is officially titled: **"The Nelson House First Nation Flooded Land Act."**
- This title reflects its purpose: to govern matters related to flooded lands and associated compensation for the Nelson House First Nation.

---

#### **2. Definitions**

Two key terms are defined in the Act:

- **Agreement**  
  Refers to the **new agreement** concluded between:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada  
  - Her Majesty in right of Manitoba  
  - The Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board  
  - The Nelson House First Nation  
  This agreement was negotiated to comprehensively implement the original *Flood Agreement* of 1977.  
  → *Purpose:* To provide a modern, legally binding framework for managing compensation, land transfers, and dispute resolution related to the flooding of land.

- **Flood Agreement**  
  Refers to the **original 1977 agreement** signed between:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada  
  - Her Majesty in right of Manitoba  
  - The Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board  
  - The Northern Flood Committee, Inc.  
  → *Purpose:* To formalize the flooding of certain lands (particularly in northern Manitoba) for hydroelectric development, and to establish compensation and land use arrangements.

These definitions establish a clear distinction between the original 1977 agreement and the newer, more comprehensive implementation agreement reached with the Nelson House First Nation.

#### **3. Non-Recognition of Payments as "Indian Money"**

> *"Amounts paid to the Nelson House First Nation pursuant to the agreement, whether before or after the coming into force of this Act, are not Indian moneys within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act."*

- **Significance:**  
  Under the *Indian Act*, "Indian money" refers to funds received by a First Nation that are considered part of the reserve or trust fund and are subject to specific regulatory and reporting requirements (e.g., income tax, financial oversight, and control by the federal government).

- This provision **exempts all payments made under the Flood Agreement** from being classified as "Indian money."  
- As a result:
  - The Nelson House First Nation is **not subject to the reporting, accounting, or control obligations** that apply to Indian money under the *Indian Act*.
  - The payments are treated as **compensation or compensation-related funds**, not as income or trust assets governed by the Indian Act.

---

#### **4. Transfer of Funds to the Nelson House First Nation**

> *"As soon as practicable after the coming into force of this Act, all amounts collected, received or held by Her Majesty in right of Canada for the use or benefit of the Nelson House First Nation pursuant to the agreement shall be transferred to the Nelson House First Nation in accordance with the agreement."*

- **Purpose:**  
  To ensure that compensation funds previously held by the federal government (Canada) are **promptly and fully transferred** to the Nelson House First Nation.

- **Key Points:**
  - Applies to **all funds collected, received, or held** by the federal government under the agreement.
  - Must be transferred **as soon as practicable** after the Act comes into force.
  - The transfer must occur **in accordance with the agreement** — meaning the terms and conditions of the 1977 Flood Agreement and the new agreement must govern the transfer process.
  - This provision strengthens the autonomy and financial control of the Nelson House First Nation over its compensation.

#### **5. Exemption from Subsection 35(4) of the Indian Act**

> *"Subsection 35(4) of the Indian Act does not apply in respect of any amount paid, whether before or after the coming into force of this Act, to the Nelson House First Nation pursuant to the agreement."*

- **Background:**  
  Section 35(4) of the *Indian Act* generally prohibits First Nations from receiving or using funds from the federal government for purposes that would be considered "non-Indian" or outside the scope of Indian governance — such as for non-Indian development or commercial activities — unless specific conditions are met.

- **Effect of this provision:**  
  - Payments made under the Flood Agreement are **exempt from Section 35(4)**.  
  - This allows the Nelson House First Nation **greater flexibility** in how it uses the funds — including for community development, infrastructure, housing, or economic initiatives — without being restricted by the limitations imposed by Section 35(4).

---

#### **6. Exemption from Section 36 of the Indian Act Regarding Land Ownership**

> *"Where land is held or transferred pursuant to the agreement, section 36 of the Indian Act does not apply in respect of that land if the holder or transferee of the land, or any subsequent holder or transferee of the land, is not Her Majesty in right of Canada."*

- **Background:**  
  Section 36 of the *Indian Act* generally applies to land held by or transferred to a First Nation. It requires that such land be held **in trust for the benefit of the First Nation**, and that the federal government (Her Majesty in right of Canada) retain ultimate ownership and control.

- **Effect of this provision:**  
  - If land is transferred or held by a **private party, a corporation, or a group of members** (not the federal government), then **Section 36 does not apply**.
  - This means:
    - The Nelson House First Nation or its designated entities (e.g., corporations, associations) can **own, manage, and develop** the land without being subject to the trust obligations and federal oversight imposed by Section 36.
    - The land is treated as **freehold or private property** under the terms of the agreement, enhancing the First Nation’s ability to use and benefit from the land.

#### **7. Eligibility to Exercise Claims Under the Agreement**

> *"A claim provided for by both the Flood Agreement and the agreement may be exercised by..."*

This section outlines **who is authorized to bring claims** (e.g., legal or financial claims) under the agreement.

Eligible parties include:

1. **The Council of the Nelson House First Nation**  
2. **The Nelson House First Nation** (as a community entity)  
3. **Any individual who is a member** of the Nelson House First Nation  
4. **Any group or unincorporated association** that is:
   - Wholly or substantially comprised of members of the Nelson House First Nation  
5. **Any unincorporated association established by the Council**  
6. **Any share capital corporation** where:
   - Shares are wholly or substantially owned and controlled by the Nelson House First Nation or its members  
7. **Any non-share capital corporation** where:
   - Membership consists wholly or substantially of Nelson House First Nation members or their descendants

- **Important Limitation:**  
  All claims must be exercised **in accordance with the agreement** — meaning they must follow the procedures, timelines, and conditions set out in the original and new agreements.

- **Purpose:**  
  To ensure that **community members and affiliated organizations** have a legal pathway to access compensation or benefits, while maintaining accountability and adherence to the terms of the agreement.

#### **8. Application of Manitoba Arbitration Law**

> *"Except as otherwise provided in the agreement, the legislation of Manitoba relating to arbitration applies in respect of any dispute between the parties to the agreement that, under the terms of the agreement, is to be settled by way of arbitration."*

- **Purpose:**  
  To establish a clear and accessible mechanism for resolving disputes arising from the agreement.

- **Key Points:**
  - If a dispute is to be settled by **arbitration**, it must be governed by **Manitoba’s arbitration laws** (e.g., the *Manitoba Arbitration Act*).
  - This ensures that disputes are resolved in a **fair, efficient, and locally relevant** manner, rather than through costly and time-consuming court proceedings.
  - The parties are **not required to go to court** if the agreement specifies arbitration.
  - The exemption only applies **unless otherwise specified** in the agreement — meaning the parties may choose alternative dispute resolution methods if agreed upon.
