The provided text is a statutory provision enacted under the authority of Her Majesty in Canada, acting with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It constitutes a **legislative clarification** or **constitutional interpretation** designed to enhance the legal certainty and validity of certain postal fee regulations that were originally established through Orders in Council, rather than through direct parliamentary legislation.

Below is a **detailed summary** of the provisions:

---

### **1. Purpose of the Provision**
The primary purpose of this section is to **ensure legal certainty and enforceability** of postal fee regulations that were created via Orders in Council under the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), rather than through direct enactment by Parliament. By treating these Orders as if they had been made under specific Acts of Parliament, the provision strengthens their legal standing and ensures they are treated with the same force and effect as if they were formally enacted by Parliament.

---

### **2. Key Provisions and Legal Framework**

#### **A. Recognition of Orders in Council as Equivalent to Parliamentary Acts**
The Act explicitly recognizes three specific **Orders in Council** made under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which grants the Postmaster General the authority to prescribe fees:

1. **Order in Council P.C. 1976-2073** – Made on **August 19, 1976**
2. **Order in Council P.C. 1978-883** – Made on **March 23, 1978**
3. **Order in Council P.C. 1979-88** – Made on **January 18, 1979**

These Orders granted the Postmaster General the power to prescribe postage fees for postal services.

> **Legal Effect**:  
> The Act declares that these Orders are **deemed to have had, and continue to have, the same force and effect** as if they had been made **on the day they were issued**, under a **specific Act of Parliament** that explicitly authorized such fee-prescribing powers.

> This means that even though these Orders were issued administratively via the Governor in Council (a form of executive action), they are now treated as **legally equivalent to legislation passed by Parliament**. This is critical because:

- It ensures **legislative legitimacy** and **constitutional validity**.
- It prevents challenges based on the lack of parliamentary authorization.
- It provides **greater legal certainty** for postal service providers, users, and courts.

#### **B. Deemed Prescriptive Effect of Postal Rates**
The Act further extends this principle to **regulations made pursuant to the above Orders** that set **postage rates**.

> **Legal Effect**:  
> Any regulation establishing postage rates based on the aforementioned Orders is **deemed to have been prescribed on the day it was issued**, as if it had been established by a **specific Act of Parliament** that authorized such rate-setting in place of the rates previously set out in **sections 10 and 11 of the Post Office Act**.

> This means:
- The rates established by these regulations are **not subject to challenge** on the grounds of lacking parliamentary authorization.
- They are treated as **legally binding and enforceable** as if they were enacted directly by Parliament.
- The rates **replace or substitute** the older, pre-existing rates in sections 10 and 11 of the *Post Office Act*, which may have been outdated or no longer reflective of current postal costs or service needs.

### **3. Legal and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Constitutional Validity** | Ensures that executive Orders in Council (which are not directly legislative) are treated as valid and enforceable legislation. |
| **Legal Certainty** | Provides clarity for postal users, businesses, and courts regarding the validity and enforceability of postage fees. |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Allows the Postmaster General to adjust postage rates flexibly without requiring a full parliamentary process each time. |
| **Judicial Enforcement** | Courts will not question the validity of these fees or regulations based on procedural grounds (e.g., lack of parliamentary enactment). |
| **Continuity of Policy** | Maintains stability in postal pricing, preventing disruptions due to uncertainty about the legal basis of fees. |

### **4. Context and Background**

- The *Financial Administration Act* (FAA) allows certain executive authorities (like the Postmaster General) to issue Orders in Council to prescribe fees, provided they are made under specific statutory powers.
- Historically, postal rates were set under the *Post Office Act*, with sections 10 and 11 defining standard rates.
- Over time, the need for more flexible and responsive fee structures led to the use of Orders in Council to adjust rates.
- However, such executive actions could be challenged in court on the grounds that they lack the necessary parliamentary authority or are not "statutory" in nature.
- This provision **preempts such challenges** by legally "recharacterizing" the Orders and regulations as if they were enacted by Parliament.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

This section of the Act serves as a **critical legislative safeguard** that enhances the **legal standing, enforceability, and continuity** of postal fee regulations. By formally declaring that the three Orders in Council and the regulations derived from them are **deemed to have been made under specific Acts of Parliament**, the legislation:

- Removes uncertainty about the legal basis of postage fees.
- Grants administrative flexibility to the postal service.
- Ensures that postal pricing remains stable and enforceable, even when changes are made through executive action.

It is a classic example of **parliamentary delegation** and **executive authority**, where Parliament provides a legal framework (via enabling powers) and then affirms the validity of administrative actions through declaratory provisions.

---

**In short**:  
This provision ensures that certain postal fee regulations made by Orders in Council are legally treated as if they were passed by Parliament, giving them full force and effect—thus securing legal certainty, stability, and enforceability in Canada’s postal pricing system.
