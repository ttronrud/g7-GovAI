### **Detailed Summary of the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation Governance Act**

The **Sioux Valley Dakota Nation Governance Act** is a federal law enacted in Canada to legally implement and give effect to a **government-to-government relationship** between the **Sioux Valley Dakota Nation (SVDDN)** and the **Government of Canada**, as well as the **Government of Manitoba**, through two key agreements: the **Governance Agreement** and the **Tripartite Governance Agreement**.

This Act serves as the legislative framework that enables the recognition of the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation as a **distinct legal entity with full sovereignty** over its lands, governance, laws, and rights — consistent with constitutional principles of self-determination and Indigenous rights under the Canadian Constitution.

---

## **Background and Context**

1. **Government-to-Government Relationship**  
   The Act is rooted in a foundational principle: **recognition of Indigenous nations as equal partners** with the federal and provincial governments. This relationship is established through the **Governance Agreement**, signed on **August 30, 2013**, between:
   - The Sioux Valley Dakota Nation (SVDDN)
   - Her Majesty in Right of Canada (federal government)

   A **Tripartite Governance Agreement** was also signed on the same date, involving:
   - The Sioux Valley Dakota Nation
   - The Government of Canada
   - The Government of Manitoba

   These agreements affirm that SVDDN is not a "band" under the Indian Act but a **sovereign nation** with the capacity to govern itself, make laws, and manage its affairs independently.

2. **Purpose of the Act**  
   The Act formalizes the legal status of the Governance and Tripartite Agreements by:
   - Declaring them valid and binding
   - Providing legal recognition of SVDDN as a legal person
   - Removing the applicability of the Indian Act to SVDDN
   - Establishing the supremacy of the Agreements over conflicting federal laws
   - Enabling judicial and administrative processes to respect the autonomy of the nation

---

## **Key Provisions and Legal Impacts**

### **1. Legal Status of Sioux Valley Dakota Nation**
- **Legal Entity**: SVDDN is recognized as a **legal person**, possessing all the rights, powers, privileges, and capacities of a natural person.
- **Standing in Legal Proceedings**: SVDDN has the capacity to:
  - Assert Aboriginal or treaty rights
  - Exercise rights of its citizens
  - Participate in legal actions involving its land, rights, or governance

> This elevates SVDDN from a status of "band" under the Indian Act to that of a **sovereign Indigenous nation** with full legal standing.

---

### **2. Binding Nature and Supremacy of the Agreements**
- The **Governance Agreement** and **Tripartite Governance Agreement** are:
  - **Approved, valid, and binding** on all persons and bodies
  - **Legally enforceable** and may be relied upon in all legal contexts
- **Precedence over Federal Laws**:
  - The Agreements **prevail over any conflicting federal law**
  - This Act **prevails over any other federal law** to the extent of conflict

> This establishes a clear hierarchy: **the Agreements take priority** over existing federal statutes, including the Indian Act and others.

---

### **3. Supremacy of SVDDN Laws**
- SVDDN may **make its own laws** (called "Sioux Valley Dakota Nation Laws") through its governing body, the **Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Government**.
- These laws have **full force and effect** as law.
- In case of **inconsistency** between a SVDDN Law and a federal law:
  - The **provisions of the Agreement** governing that inconsistency **apply**
- SVDDN Laws are **not by-laws** under the Indian Act and are **not statutory instruments** under the Statutory Instruments Act.

> This ensures that SVDDN laws are not treated as subordinate or administrative rules but as **equal legal instruments**.

---

### **4. Termination of the Indian Act Application**
- The **Indian Act ceases to apply** to:
  - SVDDN
  - SVDDN Lands
  - Persons found on those lands
- This change occurs **on the coming into effect of the Agreement**
- The Indian Act no longer governs SVDDN’s land, governance, or rights

> This is a transformative shift, removing colonial legal frameworks and affirming Indigenous self-governance.

---

### **5. Termination of the Indian Oil and Gas Act**
- If a SVDDN Law addresses **oil and gas matters** (same or similar to those covered by the Indian Oil and Gas Act):
  - That federal Act **ceases to apply** to SVDDN lands and royalties
- This allows SVDDN to regulate oil and gas development on its lands according to its own laws and priorities

> This grants SVDDN **autonomy over natural resource management**, including energy development.

---

### **6. Jurisdiction and Legal Recognition**
- **Judicial Notice**:
  - Courts must take judicial notice of:
    - The Governance Agreement
    - The Tripartite Governance Agreement
    - Any registered SVDDN Law
- **Public Publication**:
  - The Agreements and SVDDN Laws must be **published by the Queen’s Printer**
  - A published copy is **evidence of the agreement or law** and is **proof of publication**, unless contradicted

> This ensures transparency, access, and legal certainty for all stakeholders.

---

### **7. Judicial Review and Oversight**
- The **Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench** has jurisdiction to:
  - Issue **orders, injunctions, or declaratory relief** against decision-making bodies established under SVDDN laws
  - Conduct **judicial review** of decisions made by such bodies
- This creates a **provincial court mechanism** to ensure accountability and fairness, while respecting SVDDN’s autonomy

> This is a unique arrangement — allowing provincial courts to oversee Indigenous governance bodies without undermining their sovereignty.

---

### **8. Procedure for Judicial or Administrative Challenges**
- If any party raises an issue regarding:
  - The **interpretation or validity** of the Agreements
  - The **validity or applicability** of this Act
  - Or any **SVDDN Law** or Manitoba legislation giving effect to the Agreements
- Then the party **must serve notice** to:
  - The **Attorney General of Canada**
  - The **Attorney General of Manitoba**
  - The **Sioux Valley Dakota Nation**
- **Notice must be served at least 14 days before argument**, unless court allows a shorter period
- Notice must include:
  - The proceeding
  - The issue
  - Facts giving rise to the issue
  - Legal basis
  - Date of argument

> This ensures **shared accountability and consultation** among all three parties before legal challenges proceed.

- **Parties may participate** in such proceedings as **full parties with equal rights** (including the right to appear, argue, and be heard)

> This promotes **collaborative governance** and prevents unilateral legal challenges.

---

### **9. Immunity from Crown Liability**
- On the coming into effect of the Agreement:
  - The **Government of Canada is not liable** for damages under **paragraph 3(b)(ii) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act** for any breach of duty related to:
    - Ownership
    - Occupation
    - Possession
    - Control
    of SVDDN lands

> This protects the Crown from liability arising from its role in facilitating the transition to self-governance.

---

### **10. Special Provisions in the Agreement**
- **Part 16 of the Agreement** (which deals with specific governance or financial provisions) is **deemed effective as of August 30, 2013**, despite not being part of the main body of the Act.

> This ensures continuity and enforceability of key governance provisions from the outset.

---

### **11. Regulatory Authority**
- The **Governor in Council** (federal Cabinet) may:
  - Make **regulations or orders** to implement the Agreement
  - Adapt or restrict provisions of the **First Nations Fiscal Management Act** to enable SVDDN to access its services
  - Ensure that SVDDN can benefit from federal fiscal support and services while maintaining its self-governance

> This allows flexibility in implementation while respecting the nation’s autonomy.

---

### **12. Coming Into Force**
- The Act comes into force on a **day to be fixed by the Governor in Council**
- **Exception**: Section 20 (which deals with judicial notice and publication) does **not** come into force until **July 1, 2014** (as per SI/2014-51)

> This phased implementation ensures orderly transition and allows time for legal and administrative preparation.
