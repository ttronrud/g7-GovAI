### **Detailed Summary of the Indian Lands Agreement (1986) Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Citation**
The *Indian Lands Agreement (1986) Act* is a federal legislation enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons. It formally establishes and implements the **Indian Lands Agreement (1986)** — a significant framework for land and resource management involving Indigenous bands in Canada, particularly in Ontario.

This Act serves as the legal instrument that gives effect to the **1986 agreement** between the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario, aimed at improving the self-governance of First Nations, clarifying land rights, and enabling more flexible arrangements regarding land use, natural resources, and administrative control.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Agreement**: Refers to the overarching 1986 agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario, as set out in the Schedule to the Act.
- **Specific Agreement**: A subordinate, customized agreement entered into by:
  - The Government of Canada,
  - The Government of Ontario,
  - A specific **band of Indians** or a **group of bands**,
  under the broader framework of the 1986 Agreement.

These definitions establish a hierarchy: the main agreement provides the foundational structure, while specific agreements allow for tailored outcomes based on the unique circumstances of individual bands.

---

#### **3. Legal Binding Nature of the Agreement**
- The **1986 Agreement** is binding on **Her Majesty in Right of Canada**.
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) is authorized to implement and carry out the provisions of the agreement.
- This ensures that the federal government has the legal authority to enforce and administer the terms of the agreement.

---

#### **4. Continuity of the Indian Act**
- The **Indian Act** continues to apply to:
  - **Reserve lands**
  - **Surrendered lands**
  that are subject to a specific agreement.
- This provision ensures that fundamental Indigenous rights and governance structures under the Indian Act remain in place, even when specific agreements are made, thereby maintaining legal stability and continuity.

---

#### **5. Regulatory Authority for Confirmation Procedures**
- The **Governor in Council** may make regulations to define the **procedures for confirming a specific agreement** under **paragraph 10(a)** of the agreement.
- These regulations will govern how confirmation processes are conducted, including timelines, requirements, and oversight mechanisms.

---

#### **6. Binding Effect of Confirmation**
- When a **band confirms** a specific agreement under paragraph 10(a) or (b) of the agreement:
  - The **specific agreement** and any **notification from the band council** (as per paragraph 10(b)) become binding on:
    - All **existing and future members** of the band,
    - The **band council**,
    - And the **successors** to the band (e.g., after amalgamation or succession).
- This ensures that once a band formally approves a specific agreement, it applies to all members and future generations, strengthening the legal and communal legitimacy of the agreement.

---

#### **7. Enhanced Binding Effect Upon Official Confirmation**
- For greater certainty, if a specific agreement is confirmed by:
  - An **Order in Council of Canada**,
  - An **Order in Council of Ontario**, and
  - The **band itself**,
  then the agreement becomes **binding on Her Majesty in Right of Canada**.
- This triple confirmation mechanism strengthens the legal enforceability of the agreement and ensures cross-jurisdictional alignment between federal, provincial, and Indigenous governance.

---

#### **8. Coming Into Force**
- The Act and its provisions come into force on a date or dates to be **fixed by proclamation**.
- **Note**: The Act came into force on **July 1, 1990**, as indicated in the statutory instrument SI/90-91.

---

#### **9. Definitions from the Indian Act**
The Agreement adopts the definitions of key terms from the **Indian Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. I-6)**, including:
- **Band**,
- **Council of the Band**,
- **Surrender**,
- **Custom**,
- **Indian**.

These definitions may be amended over time, ensuring the agreement remains consistent with evolving legal and cultural interpretations.

---

#### **10. Scope of Specific Agreements**
Specific agreements may cover **any matter or question relating to lands or natural resources**, including:
- Matters addressed in the **1924 Agreement** (a historical agreement between Canada and Ontario),
- Administration and control of lands and resources,
- Exercise, allocation, transfer, or disposal of interests in lands or natural resources,
- Minerals (including gold, silver, base metals, coal, natural gas, oil, salt, sand, gravel),
- Mineral rights and royalties,
- Disposition or taxation of mineral rights,
- Hydroelectric power development,
- Disposition of lands or natural resources,
- Consequences of **band extinction** or **enfranchisement** (i.e., when a band loses its status),
- Disposition of monies (e.g., proceeds from land sales),
- Non-application of any section of the 1924 Agreement,
- Any other provision necessary to implement the agreement.

This broad scope allows for comprehensive and flexible negotiations between Indigenous bands and the Crown.

---

#### **11. Supersession of Inconsistent Provisions**
- In the event of **inconsistency** between a specific agreement and the **1924 Agreement**, the **specific agreement shall prevail**.
- This gives bands greater autonomy to override outdated or restrictive provisions of the 1924 Agreement, enabling modernization and adaptation to current needs.

---

#### **12. Non-Effect on Treaties or Surrenders**
- **Neither this Agreement nor any specific agreement affects the validity of any treaty or surrender**.
- This is a critical safeguard to ensure that existing treaty rights and historical land surrenders remain legally intact and not undermined by the new agreement.

---

#### **13. Land Patent and Disposition Confirmations**
- Canada and Ontario may enter into agreements to **confirm patents** or other land dispositions made by each other.
- However, **such confirmations do not affect**:
  - The rights of any band,
  - The recourse any band would have against individuals or land (including Crown lands),
  - In other words, bands retain their legal rights even if land is transferred or confirmed through such agreements.

---

#### **14. Management of Monies Collected by Canada**
- If Canada collects money (e.g., from land sales) on behalf of a band or bands:
  - Canada may **continue to administer** those funds for the benefit of the band.
- However, **money collected by Canada on behalf of Ontario** is **not deemed to be collected on behalf of any band**.
- This clarifies the financial accountability and prevents misattribution of funds.

---

#### **15. Effective Date of the Agreement**
- The **main 1986 Agreement** comes into force only after it is:
  - Confirmed by **Parliament of Canada**,
  - Confirmed by the **Legislature of Ontario**,
  - And such confirmations take effect.
- This ensures that the agreement is not implemented without democratic and legislative endorsement.

---

#### **16. Confirmation Process for Specific Agreements**
A specific agreement is only effective upon confirmation by:
1. **Referendum** conducted under regulations made by the **Governor in Council**, or  
2. **Pursuant to the band’s custom or constitution**, **provided that**:
   - The **Council of the band** gives **written notification** to:
     - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**,
     - The **Minister of Natural Resources (Ontario)**,
     - Confirming that confirmation occurred under the band’s internal rules.

This dual path (referendum or customary process) respects both democratic processes and Indigenous self-governance, ensuring that confirmation is culturally appropriate and transparent.

---

#### **17. Land Description in Specific Agreements**
- Any specific agreement that affects land must include a **schedule** that **describes the lands affected**.
- This ensures clarity and legal precision in land rights and responsibilities.

---

#### **18. Limited Scope of Binding Effect**
- A specific agreement entered into by one band is **not binding on other bands**.
- It only applies to the **band that entered into it**, unless **confirmed by that other band**.
- This prevents overreach and ensures that each band maintains its autonomy and distinct legal status.

---

#### **19. Amendments to Specific Agreements**
- A specific agreement may be **amended** by the **parties involved** (Canada, Ontario, and the band) or their successors, in the **same manner as the original agreement**.
- This provides flexibility for evolving needs, such as changes in economic conditions, environmental concerns, or governance structures.
