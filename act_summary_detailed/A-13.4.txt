**Detailed Summary of the *Assisted Human Reproduction Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Assisted Human Reproduction Act* (AHRA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted in 2004 (coming into force in 2005) to regulate the use of assisted human reproductive technologies (AHRTs) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), surrogacy, donor gametes (sperm or ova), and embryo research. It was introduced to balance the **ethical, medical, and social implications** of these technologies while protecting the **health, safety, dignity, and rights** of individuals, particularly women and children.

Importantly, the Act was significantly amended and partially repealed in 2012 by the *Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2012*, which removed or restructured several provisions — notably those related to compensation for donors, surrogates, and reimbursement. As of the current version, the Act reflects a **strictly regulated framework** designed to prevent exploitation, ensure informed consent, protect human dignity, and uphold public health standards.

This summary provides a comprehensive, detailed analysis of the core principles, definitions, prohibitions, and enforcement mechanisms contained in the Act as currently applicable.

## **I. Key Principles and Declarations**

The Act begins with a series of foundational declarations that guide its policy framework:

1. **Child Health and Well-being as Priority**  
   The health and well-being of children born through assisted reproductive technologies must be the primary consideration in all decisions involving their use.

2. **Benefits Must Be Secured Through Ethical Safeguards**  
   The benefits of AHRTs for individuals, families, and society are best realized when human health, safety, dignity, and rights are protected throughout the process.

3. **Women Are Particularly Affected**  
   Women are disproportionately impacted by these technologies, and their health and well-being must be prioritized in policy and practice.

4. **Free and Informed Consent is Fundamental**  
   All individuals participating in assisted reproduction must give **voluntary, informed, and fully understood consent** — a cornerstone of ethical practice.

5. **Prohibition of Discrimination**  
   No person shall be discriminated against in accessing assisted reproduction services based on **sexual orientation, marital status, or other protected grounds**.

6. **Prohibition of Exploitation**  
   The trade in reproductive capabilities (e.g., selling eggs or sperm) and the commercial exploitation of children, women, or men are strictly prohibited due to serious health and ethical concerns.

7. **Protection of Human Individuality and Genome Integrity**  
   Human individuality and genetic diversity must be preserved. The human genome must not be altered in ways that could compromise human identity or lead to long-term harm.

These principles establish the ethical foundation upon which the legal provisions are built.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The Act defines key terms used throughout its provisions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Embryo** | A human organism from fertilization to 56 days of development (excluding suspended development). Includes cells derived from such an organism used to create a human being. |
| **Foetus** | A human organism from day 57 post-fertilization until birth. |
| **Human Reproductive Material** | Includes sperm, ovum, or other human cells or genes (including parts of them). |
| **In Vitro Embryo** | An embryo created and developed outside the human body. |
| **Donor** | The individual from whom human reproductive material was obtained — whether for consideration or not. For in vitro embryos, defined separately in regulations. |
| **Surrogate Mother** | A woman who carries an embryo conceived via assisted reproduction and intends to surrender the child at birth to a donor or another person. |
| **Hybrid** | An embryo or ovum containing genetic material from both a human and a non-human life form. |
| **Chimera** | An embryo with cells from more than one human being or with a non-human life form introduced. |
| **Human Clone** | An embryo with a diploid set of chromosomes derived entirely from one human being (living or deceased). |
| **Gene / Genome** | A nucleotide sequence (natural or artificially created); the total DNA sequence of a cell. |
| **Health Reporting Information** | (Repealed) Previously included health data related to donors or embryos. |

> Note: Several definitions (e.g., "Agency," "Consent," "Controlled Activity") were **repealed in 2012** and are no longer in force.

## **III. Prohibited Activities (Core Legal Provisions)**

The Act prohibits a wide range of actions that could lead to ethical violations, health risks, or exploitation.

### **1. Prohibited Acts (Section 10)**

No person may:

- **Create or transplant a human clone** (from a human being, foetus, or embryo) — *including any technique that results in a genetically identical copy*.
- **Create an in vitro embryo for any purpose other than creating a human being or improving assisted reproduction techniques**.
- **Create an embryo from a cell taken from an embryo or foetus**, or transplant such an embryo into a human being.
- **Maintain an embryo outside the body beyond 14 days of development** (excluding suspended development).
- **Manipulate sex determination** (e.g., selecting embryo sex) unless for diagnosing or treating sex-linked disorders.
- **Alter the human genome in a way that can be passed to descendants** (i.e., germline modification).
- **Transplant non-human reproductive material (sperm, ovum, embryo, foetus) into a human being**.
- **Use human reproductive material or in vitro embryos in non-human life forms**.
- **Create or transplant chimeras or hybrids** (human + non-human genetic material) for reproduction or implantation.

> These prohibitions reflect strong ethical boundaries against cloning, genetic manipulation, and hybridization — especially those involving human reproduction.

---

### **2. Prohibition of Commercial Transactions (Section 11)**

The Act strictly bans commercialization of reproductive materials and services:

- **No purchase, sale, or advertisement of sperm, ova, or in vitro embryos**.
- **No purchase, sale, or advertisement of human cells or genes** with the intent to create a human being or make them available for such use.
- **"Purchase" includes acquiring in exchange for property or services**.

> This ensures that reproductive materials are not commodified, protecting donors from exploitation.

---

### **3. Restrictions on Donor Use and Distribution (Section 12)**

- Sperm or ova **cannot be used for a female person other than**:
  - The donor’s spouse,
  - Common-law partner,
  - Sexual partner.

> Exceptions apply only if:
> - The sperm or ovum has been tested, stored, labeled, and assessed per regulations.
> - The donor has been screened and deemed suitable.

- Ova **cannot be used by a donor for their own surrogacy** unless under specific regulatory conditions.

> These rules protect the privacy and autonomy of donors and prevent misuse of reproductive materials.

---

### **4. Donor and Surrogate Compensation (Section 13)**

- **No reimbursement** allowed for:
  - Donors for expenses related to donating sperm or ova.
  - Maintenance, transport, or storage of in vitro embryos.
  - Surrogates for personal expenses or lost income during pregnancy.

> **Exception**: A surrogate may receive reimbursement for **lost work income** only if:
> - A qualified medical practitioner certifies that continuing work poses a risk to her health or the embryo/foetus.
> - The reimbursement is made in accordance with regulations.

> This provision prevents financial exploitation of donors and surrogates.

---

### **5. Prohibition of Counseling or Inducement to Become a Surrogate (Section 14)**

- No person may:
  - Counsel or induce a woman to become a surrogate.
  - Perform medical procedures to assist her in becoming a surrogate.
  - Knowingly or reasonably believe she is under 21 years of age.

> This protects minors from being drawn into reproductive arrangements and ensures informed consent.

---

### **6. Prohibition of Payment for Surrogate Services (Section 15)**

- No person may:
  - Pay or offer to pay a woman to be a surrogate.
  - Offer to arrange or advertise such payment.
  - Pay another person to arrange for a surrogate.

> This reinforces that surrogacy is not a commercial transaction.

---

## **IV. Regulatory and Enforcement Mechanisms**

### **1. Ministerial Oversight**

- The **Minister of Health** is responsible for:
  - Setting government policy on assisted human reproduction.
  - Overseeing matters related to the Act.
  - Taking action when contraventions are suspected.

> The Minister may issue orders or take measures to prevent or mitigate violations.

### **2. Inspections and Enforcement (Sections 47–49)**

- The Minister may designate **government inspectors** (federal or provincial) to enforce the Act.
- Inspectors may:
  - Enter any place or conveyance where they have **reasonable grounds** to believe activity related to AHRTs is occurring.
  - Examine, copy, or extract records.
  - Open receptacles or packages containing relevant materials.
  - Take samples or conduct tests.
  - Require individuals to produce documents or information.

> Inspections are limited to verifying compliance with sections 8, 10, and 12 (prohibitions on cloning, embryo use, and commercial activity).

### **3. Immunity from Liability (Section 50)**

- Individuals or entities taking enforcement actions under this section
