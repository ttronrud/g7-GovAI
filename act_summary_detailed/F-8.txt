The **Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act** (commonly referred to as the *Fiscal Arrangements Act*) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the framework for fiscal cooperation between the federal government and provincial governments, particularly in the area of **fiscal equalization**—a mechanism designed to ensure that provinces with lower revenues relative to their population and economic capacity receive adequate financial support from the federal government.

Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the Act, broken down by key components, definitions, and policy objectives:

---

## 🔍 **1. Purpose and Overview**

The primary purpose of the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act* is to:

- Establish a fair and equitable system of **fiscal equalization** so that all provinces can maintain a reasonable level of public service provision regardless of their economic strength.
- Provide mechanisms for **coordinated tax administration** between federal and provincial governments.
- Define specific **taxation agreements** related to emerging industries (e.g., cannabis, vaping products).
- Ensure that the federal government supports provinces with lower fiscal capacity through targeted payments.

> ⚠️ Note: The Act was substantially **repealed or amended in 2013** (under *C-33*, s. 110–114), meaning **this version is largely historical or transitional**. It reflects the structure and principles of the original 1972 Act, which was replaced by the *Fiscal Arrangements Act, 2013*, and more recently, the *Fiscal Arrangements Act, 2023*, which modernized the equalization system.

However, for clarity and completeness, this summary focuses on the **content and structure** of the version provided—preserving its legal and policy significance even if it is no longer fully in force.

## 📊 **3. Population and GDP Definitions**

- **Population of a Province**: Determined annually by the **Chief Statistician of Canada** in a prescribed manner.
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Canada**: Determined annually by the Chief Statistician in a prescribed manner for a calendar year.

> These data are used to calculate per capita revenue and fiscal capacity, ensuring that comparisons are based on consistent, reliable statistics.

## 💰 **4. Fiscal Equalization Payments**

This is the **core mechanism** of the Act.

### ✅ General Rule:
A fiscal equalization payment **may be paid to a province** each year (from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2029), **not exceeding** the amount calculated under the specific formulas in Part III.

---

### 🔢 Formula for Equalization Payment (Section 3.2)

The amount of the equalization payment is the **greater of two values**:

#### (a) Formula Based on Revenue Shortfalls:
> **Payment = [Sum of (National Yield – Provincial Yield) per revenue source] × 50% (for one specific revenue source) + [Sum of (National Yield – Provincial Yield) for all other sources]**

- **Revenue sources** are defined in subsection 3.5(1).
- The formula compares the **average annual per capita yield** (revenue per person) in each province to the **national average**.
- For each revenue source, the difference is multiplied by the province’s population.
- A **50% cap** applies to the shortfall for one designated revenue source (likely income tax or sales tax).

> This ensures that provinces with lower revenue per capita receive compensation based on real revenue gaps.

#### (b) Alternative Formula (if elected):
A province may **choose** to accept the payment calculated under formula (a), instead of the default method.

> This gives provinces flexibility in how they manage their fiscal capacity.

---

### 🚨 Negative Payment Rule:
If the calculated payment is **negative**, it is **treated as zero**. This prevents provinces from receiving a "refund" or negative support.

---

## 🔄 **5. Adjustment for Inter-Provincial Fiscal Capacity**

To prevent **fiscal dominance** by wealthier provinces, the Act includes **two key safeguards**:

### (1) Cap on Total Equalization Payments
If the total equalization payments (if calculated without any province's election under subsection 3.2(2)) would exceed **50% of the total population**, then the payments are **reduced** to ensure no single province gains disproportionate advantage.

#### Reduction Formula:
> **Reduction = (Total Per Capita Fiscal Capacity) – (Per Capita Equalized Fiscal Capacity of Lowest-Non-Recipients Province)**

This ensures that the **lowest-per-capita fiscal capacity provinces** are not outcompeted by higher-capacity ones.

> This is applied **repeatedly** until the total payment reaches a sustainable level.

---

### (2) Cap on Aggregate Equalization Payments
The **total equalization payments** for a fiscal year must not exceed a **prescribed ceiling**, which is calculated as:

> **Ceiling = (Average annual growth rate of Canada’s nominal GDP) × (Base amount from 2010)**

- For **2010**: $14.185 billion.
- For **each subsequent year**: Based on the **average growth rate** of Canada’s nominal GDP over the prior three years.

> This ensures that equalization payments grow **only with economic growth**, not arbitrarily.

---

### 📉 If Total Payments Exceed Ceiling:
- The payments are **reduced** across provinces.
- The **reduction per province** is the **lesser of**:
  - The province’s per capita equalization payment
  - The per capita reduction (to maintain equity)

> The total reduction must equal the **excess over the ceiling**.

---

### 📈 If Total Payments Are Below Ceiling:
- A **positive adjustment payment** may be made to provinces that would otherwise receive less than their fair share.
- The adjustment payment is:
  - For provinces receiving equalization: Based on **per capita pre-adjustment equalized fiscal capacity**.
  - For others: Based on the **greatest per capita capacity** among non-receiving provinces.

> This ensures that even if the total equalization is capped, provinces with the lowest capacity still get support.

## 📌 Key Provisions and Principles

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Equity** | Equalization aims to ensure that provinces with lower revenues (due to geography, economy, or population) have sufficient funds to deliver public services. |
| **Transparency** | All calculations are based on publicly available data (population, GDP, revenue yields). |
| **Flexibility** | Provinces can elect to use the standard formula or the alternative formula. |
| **Growth Linkage** | Payments grow with the national economy, not independently. |
| **Stability** | Prevents overpayment or underpayment through built-in caps and adjustments. |
| **Indigenous Inclusion** | Recognizes First Nations and Métis governments as legitimate tax authorities under the *First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act*. |

---

## 🚨 Repealed Provisions (2013)

Several sections were **repealed in 2013** (under *C-33*, s. 110–114):

- Sections on **additional equalization payments** for specific years (2010–2013) were removed.
- The **original 1972 Act** was replaced with a modernized version.
- The **specific formulas and caps** were revised to reflect new economic realities and fiscal policy goals.

> These repealed sections were likely **temporary or transitional** and do not reflect current federal policy.
