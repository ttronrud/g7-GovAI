### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The *Department of Veterans Affairs Act* establishes a dedicated federal department of the Government of Canada responsible for the care, treatment, support, and benefits of veterans and their dependants. The Act is designed to ensure that individuals who have served in Canada’s armed forces, merchant navy, or in other war-related capacities—along with their families—are provided with appropriate benefits, services, and protections.

This Act consolidates and modernizes previous legislation related to veterans’ welfare, creating a centralized, coherent framework for administering benefits and services under one department.
