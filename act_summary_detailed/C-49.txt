The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of a specific legal provision. Specifically, the entries state:

> [Repealed, 1997, c. 20, s. 45]  
> [Repealed, R.S., 1985, c. 38 (1st Supp.), s. 3]

These notations indicate that the legislation or section in question was **officially removed (repealed)** from the statute books in two different instances:

### Summary of the Repeal Information:

1. **Primary Repeal (1997):**  
   - The provision was repealed by **Chapter 20 of the Statutes of 1997** (commonly referred to as *c. 20, s. 45*).  
   - This means that the law or section previously existing in the jurisdiction’s statute book was formally abolished and no longer in force as of the date of the 1997 act.  
   - The repeal likely applied to a section that had been in effect prior to 1997, possibly related to a specific area of law such as land use, property rights, or administrative regulations.

2. **Earlier Repeal (1985):**  
   - A section previously cited as **R.S., 1985, c. 38 (1st Supp.), s. 3** was also repealed.  
   - "R.S." stands for *Revised Statutes*, indicating this was part of the official codified statutes of the province or state.  
   - This suggests that the provision may have originated in a prior legislative session and was already subject to repeal before the 1997 amendment.

### Key Observations:

- **The original act or section is no longer in force.**  
  There is no active legal content to summarize because the text provided is a list of repeals, not the actual provisions of the law.

- **The repeated entries suggest either a formatting error or a reference to a section that was repealed multiple times or listed in a legislative table multiple times.**

- **No substantive content (e.g., definitions, rights, obligations, penalties) is present** in the provided text. Therefore, a detailed summary of the *provisions* of the act cannot be given.

### Conclusion:

✅ **The provided text does not contain the actual content of an act.**  
Instead, it is a list of **repeal notices** indicating that a particular legal section (originally in R.S. 1985, c. 38, s. 3 and later referenced in 1997, c. 20, s. 45) was **officially removed from the statute book** in 1997.  

➡️ **As a result, the act or section has been repealed and is no longer valid or enforceable law.**  
➡️ There is **no detailed summary of the original act** because it does not exist in current law.

If you have the original text of the act (e.g., the full section or statute), I would be happy to provide a detailed summary of its provisions.
