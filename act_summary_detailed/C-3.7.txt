## **4. Eligibility Criteria**

A worker is eligible for a CERB payment **if and only if**:

1. **Ceased working due to COVID-19**:
   - The worker **stops working for at least 14 consecutive days** within the four-week period for which they apply.
   - This cessation must be **due to reasons related to COVID-19** (e.g., lockdowns, business closures, illness, quarantine).

2. **No other income during the days of cessation**:
   - The worker must **not receive income** during the days they ceased working, except for:
     - Income from **employment or self-employment**;
     - **Employment Insurance (EI) benefits** (including emergency response benefits under section 153.7 of the EI Act);
     - **Provincial benefits** for pregnancy or childcare;
     - Any other income **prescribed by regulation**.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> An **employed worker who quits voluntarily** is **not considered to have ceased working** for the purpose of CERB eligibility.

> 📝 **Regulatory Flexibility**:
> - The Minister may, by regulation, **exclude certain types of income** from being counted (e.g., certain government or non-employment-related benefits).
> - The Minister may also **prescribe additional income sources** that are excluded from eligibility.

---

## **5. Payment Amount and Duration**

- **Weekly Payment Amount**:
  - Fixed by **regulation**.
  - The Minister may, with the **consent of the Minister of Finance**, set the weekly amount.
  - Regulations may **distinguish between different classes of workers** (e.g., self-employed vs. employed).

- **Maximum Duration**:
  - A worker can receive CERB payments for a **maximum of 16 weeks**.
  - This can be adjusted by regulation (e.g., if a higher or lower number is deemed appropriate).
  - The 16-week limit applies **per individual**, not per week.

---

## **6. Administration and Data Collection**

- The Minister is authorized to:
  - **Collect and use** a person’s **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** to verify identity and eligibility.
  - **Require information or documents** from applicants via **notice** (personal delivery or confirmed delivery service), within a **reasonable time**.

> This ensures accountability and helps verify claims against income and employment records.

---

## **7. Legal Protections for CERB Payments**

To protect recipients and ensure the benefit is not subject to general debt collection mechanisms:

- **Not subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws**.
- **Cannot be assigned, charged, attached, or used as security**.
- **Cannot be deducted, offset, or garnished** under any other federal or provincial law, **except under this Act**.
- **Not garnishable** under the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act*.

> This means CERB payments are **protected from creditors** and cannot be seized for other debts.

---

## **8. Overpayments and Repayment Obligations**

- If the Minister determines that a person:
  - Received a CERB payment they were **not entitled to**, or
  - Received **more than their entitled amount**,
  
  → The person must **repay the overpayment** as soon as feasible.

- The overpayment is treated as a **debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- The Minister may **certify the amount of the debt**, and such certification has the **same legal effect as a judgment** in the **Federal Court**, including all related registration costs.

> This allows the government to pursue repayment efficiently and legally.

---

## **9. Limitation Period for Recovery of Overpayments**

- **General Rule**: No legal action can be taken to recover money owed under this Act **after six years** from the date the money became due and payable.
- **Exception**: If a person **acknowledges liability** (in any form), the limitation period is **reset**:
  - Acknowledgment includes:
    - A promise to pay;
    - An admission of debt (even without a promise);
    - A partial payment;
    - An acknowledgment during bankruptcy or debt proceedings.
  - Once acknowledged, the **time before acknowledgment does not count** in the six-year period.
  - If acknowledgment occurs **after the six-year period**, recovery may still be pursued **within six years of the acknowledgment**.

> ⚠️ **Suspended Periods**: If it is prohibited to pursue legal action against a person (e.g., due to bankruptcy), the limitation period **suspends** during that time.

---

## **10. Interest and Enforcement**

- **No interest** is payable on any overpayment or debt arising under this Act.
- The government **cannot recover** the debt from income or benefits **under section 122.61 of the Income Tax Act** (i.e., tax credits or refunds).

---

## **11. Special Provisions for Employment Insurance Emergency Benefits**

- If a worker received an **Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EIERB)** during the four-week period:
  - The CERB payment is **not considered ineligible** **if** the **Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC)** notifies the Minister that the EIERB should not disqualify the worker.
  - In such cases, the worker is **deemed eligible** for CERB, despite receiving EI benefits.

> This creates a **protective mechanism** to avoid double-dipping or overpayment, while ensuring support reaches those who genuinely lost income.

---

## **12. Special Formula for Repayment in Cases of Non-Eligibility Due to Benefits**

If a worker received **benefits, allowances, or money** (e.g., EI, provincial childcare) during the four-week period, and this is the **only reason** they were ineligible for CERB:

- The amount the worker must repay is calculated using the formula:
  
  > **Repayment Amount = (Number of weeks the worker received ineligible benefits) × (Weekly CERB amount)**

> Example: If a worker received 3 weeks of EI benefits during a 4-week period, and the weekly CERB was $500, they would repay $1,500.
