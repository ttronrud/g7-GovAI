**Detailed Summary of the *Remote Sensing Space Systems Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Remote Sensing Space Systems Act* is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation designed to regulate the operation of **remote sensing space systems** — satellite-based systems that collect data about Earth's surface using electromagnetic waves — in order to protect **national security, public safety, environmental protection, and Canada’s international obligations**. The Act establishes a strict licensing framework, defines key activities and responsibilities, and provides mechanisms for oversight, data sharing, system disposal, and emergency intervention.

This Act applies to all persons operating or intending to operate remote sensing space systems in Canada, including both domestic entities and foreign entities with substantial ties to Canada.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definitions and Core Concepts**

The Act begins by defining essential terms used throughout:

- **Controlled Activity**: Any activity related to the operation of a remote sensing space system, including:
  - Formulating or issuing commands to satellites
  - Receiving raw data
  - Storing, processing, or distributing raw data
  - Using cryptography or information assurance measures

- **Information Assurance**: The protection of information systems through ensuring:
  - Availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation

- **Licence**: A formal authorization issued by the Minister to operate a remote sensing space system.

- **Licensed System**: A remote sensing space system operating under a valid licence.

- **Licensor (Licensee)**: The individual or entity holding the licence.

- **Minister**: The Minister of Foreign Affairs (subject to section 3; may be delegated).

- **Person**: Includes individuals, partnerships, government bodies, government agencies, and unincorporated organizations.

- **Prescribed**: As defined in regulations (subject to future rulemaking).

- **Raw Data**: Sensor data from satellites and auxiliary data needed to produce remote sensing products — but **not yet transformed** into a final product.

- **Remote Sensing Product**: Any image or data product derived from raw data through transformation (e.g., processed images, maps).

- **Remote Sensing Satellite**: A satellite capable of sensing Earth’s surface via electromagnetic radiation.

- **Remote Sensing Space System**: A system comprising:
  - One or more satellites
  - Mission control centres and supporting facilities
  - Facilities for receiving, storing, processing, or distributing raw data — even after the satellite is no longer operational

- **System Participant**: A person designated in a licence condition (paragraph 8(5)(b)) who may carry out controlled activities under the licensee’s authority.

- **Transform**: To process raw data so that it is **substantially impossible to reconstitute** the original data from the product (a key privacy and data protection concept).

### **2. Applicability and Scope**

- **Jurisdiction**: The Act binds Her Majesty in right of Canada or any province.
- **Exemptions**: The Governor in Council may issue orders exempting specific systems (e.g., Defence or CSA operations) from full application — with conditions.
- **Exemptions by Minister**: The Minister may exempt individuals or systems from provisions **only if**:
  - The exemption does **not harm** national security, defence, safety of Canadian Forces, or Canada’s international relations
  - Adequate protection of the environment, public health, and safety is ensured
  - Provincial interests are protected

> *Note: Exemptions are highly restricted and require rigorous justification.*

- **Application to Persons Outside Canada**: The Act applies to:
  - Canadian citizens
  - Permanent residents (under IRPA)
  - Canadian or provincial corporations
  - Prescribed classes of persons with substantial ties to Canada

> This ensures that even foreign entities with Canadian links are subject to Canadian oversight.

### **3. Licensing Process**

An application for a licence must:
- Be submitted in the **prescribed form and manner**
- Include:
  - A **system disposal plan**
  - **Guarantee arrangements** (for fulfilling obligations under the disposal plan)
  - Any other prescribed information, documents, or undertakings
  - A prescribed **application fee**

The Minister may then:
- Issue a **provisional approval** (binding while material facts remain unchanged)
- Issue a **full licence**
- Amend or renew a licence

> Provisional approvals are binding as long as the underlying facts are unchanged.

On refusal, the Minister must provide **clear, timely reasons** to the applicant.

---

### **4. Licence Conditions (Mandatory and Flexible)**

Every licence includes the following **mandatory conditions**:

#### a) **Control of the System**
- The licensee must **retain full control** of the licensed system.

#### b) **Restrictions on Controlled Activities**
- No other person may carry out controlled activities (e.g., commanding satellites, processing data) without the licensee’s consent or Ministerial approval.

#### c) **Data Sharing with Foreign Governments**
- Raw data and remote sensing products about **any country’s territory** must be made available to that country’s government:
  - Within a **reasonable time**
  - On **reasonable terms**
  - As long as the data has not been disposed of
  - **Exclusion**: Data enhanced or with added value is exempt from this obligation

> This promotes transparency and international cooperation, while respecting national sovereignty.

#### d) **Data Control Until Disposal**
- The licensee must retain control of all raw data and remote sensing products until they are disposed of in accordance with the Act.

#### e) **Restricted Data Communication**
- Raw data may only be communicated to:
  - A government listed in paragraph (c)
  - The licensee
  - A system participant
  - A person authorized under subsection (6)

> This limits data exposure and ensures accountability.

#### f) **Encouragement of Compliance**
- The licensee must encourage recipients of raw data or products who have signed agreements (under (6)(b) or (7)(b)) to **comply with those agreements**.

#### g) **Payment of Prescribed Fees**
- All prescribed fees must be paid when due.

#### h) **Additional Conditions (At Minister’s Discretion)**
The Minister may add any condition, including:
- On **cryptography or information assurance** (e.g., encryption standards)
- **Designating system participants** (individuals or entities allowed to perform controlled activities)

> These allow flexibility in tailoring oversight to specific systems.

#### i) **Communication of Raw Data to Third Parties**
- The Minister may authorize communication of raw data to other persons (not just licensee or participants), **on conditions** such as:
  - Requires **prior Ministerial approval**
  - Must be under a **legally enforceable agreement** with security provisions

> Importantly, **receiving, processing, or storing** such data by third parties is **not considered a controlled activity**.

#### j) **Restrictions on Remote Sensing Product Distribution**
- The Minister may restrict who receives remote sensing products (e.g., only certain entities), with conditions such as:
  - Requires **prior Ministerial approval**
  - Must be under a **legally enforceable agreement** with security clauses

> This enables sensitive data to be protected from unauthorized access.

### **5. Licence Duration and Transferability**

- A licence is valid for a period set by the Minister.
- **Not transferable** without the Minister’s written consent.
- The **Statutory Instruments Act does not apply** to licences — meaning licences are not subject to standard regulatory review processes.

---

### **6. System Disposal and Guarantee Arrangements**

Before issuing a licence, the Minister must approve:

- A **system disposal plan** that includes:
  - Protection of the environment, public health, and safety of persons and property
- **Guarantee arrangements** ensuring the licensee fulfills obligations under the disposal plan

**Obligations of the Licensee (and Former Licensee):**

- Must dispose of:
  - All system satellites
  - Cryptographic and information assurance equipment
  - Raw data and remote sensing products
  - Any other items prescribed by the Minister

- Must **maintain and enforce** the guarantee arrangements until the disposal plan is fully implemented.

> This ensures long-term environmental and public safety responsibility.

### **7. Amendments to Licences and Disposal Plans**

The Minister may amend:
- A **disposal plan** or **guarantee arrangements** (on application or on own initiative)
- A **licence condition** (especially those under subsections 8(5) to (7))

**Amendment Procedures:**

| Condition | Notice & Representation |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Under **8(5)** (control, data sharing) | Must give **notice + reasonable opportunity to respond** |
| Under **8(6)** or **(7)** (data sharing/product distribution) | Can take effect **immediately**, but must give **15-day (or longer) opportunity to respond** |

> These provisions ensure transparency and due process.
