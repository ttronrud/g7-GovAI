**Section in Question:** (Originally Section 3, now repealed)

#### **Key Provisions (as written in the excerpt):**

   The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) has the power to issue regulations that:

   - Have **not previously received** such commissions
   - Are **declared by regulation** to be entitled to them

3. **Recording and Public Notification**

### **Important Context and Historical Background**

- This provision was part of an earlier version of the *Public Officers Act*, which historically governed the formal appointment and ceremonial aspects of federal public office.
- The **Great Seal** and **Privy Seal** are symbolic and legal instruments used in the formal appointment of certain public officials. For example:
  - The Great Seal is used in the appointment of judges, certain administrative officers, and other high-ranking civil servants.
  - The Privy Seal is traditionally used in the appointment of members of the Privy Council, such as senior ministers or members of the Cabinet.
- The requirement for public notice in the *Canada Gazette* ensured **transparency** and **accountability** in the appointment process.

### **Status of the Provision: Repealed**

- The section cited in the excerpt is **repealed**.
- It was formally **repealed in 1992** under **Section 146 of the Statutes of Canada, 1992 (c. 1)**.
- This repeal was part of a broader modernization and streamlining of federal appointment and public service regulations, as the formal use of commissions under the Great and Privy Seals became less common or obsolete.
- Modern appointments are now governed by different statutes and administrative procedures, such as:
  - The *Appointments to the Privy Council Act*
  - The *Judicial Officers Act*
  - The *Public Service Employment Act*
  - The *Federal Public Service Act* (as amended)

### **Conclusion**

The excerpt describes a historical provision of the Public Officers Act that allowed the federal government (via the Governor in Council) to regulate who receives formal commissions under the Great or Privy Seal, set fees, and ensure public transparency through publication in the *Canada Gazette* and parliamentary reporting.  

However, **this section is no longer in force**. It was repealed in 1992 as part of a shift toward more modern, transparent, and administratively efficient systems for appointing public officers. The current framework for appointments is governed by other, more specific legislation and administrative practices.

### **Note on Accuracy and Source**

The provided text is not a complete or current version of the Public Officers Act. The *Public Officers Act* as it stands today is largely obsolete or replaced by other statutes. The current primary legislation governing public service appointments and official commissions in Canada is primarily found in the *Public Service Employment Act* and the *Appointments to the Privy Council Act*, among others.

Therefore, while the summary reflects the **historical intent and structure** of the provision, it does **not reflect current law**.

✅ **Final Summary (Concise):**  
This section of the Public Officers Act (now repealed since 1992) authorized the federal Cabinet to regulate who receives commissions under the Great or Privy Seal, set fees, and require public notice in the Canada Gazette and parliamentary reporting. It was abolished due to changes in administrative practices and the modernization of public service appointments.
