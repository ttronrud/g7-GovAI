**Background and Rationale (Whereas Clauses):**

The Act begins with a series of "Whereas" clauses that provide historical context and justification for the legislation:

1. **Sir John Alexander Macdonald (1815–1891):**  
   - Born on January 11, 1815, Macdonald was a key architect of Canadian Confederation in 1867.  
   - He served as the first Prime Minister of Canada, holding office from 1867 to 1873 and again from 1878 to 1891.  
   - As a dominant political figure, he played a central role in shaping Canada’s early political institutions, economy, and national identity.

2. **Sir Wilfrid Laurier (1841–1919):**  
   - Born on November 20, 1841, Laurier was the first Prime Minister of Canadian French-Canadian descent.  
   - He served as Prime Minister from 1896 to 1911, leading Canada through a period of significant economic and social development.  
   - A strong advocate for national unity, he promoted bilingualism, biculturalism, and the inclusion of French-Canadian interests in federal governance.

These clauses emphasize not only the personal significance of the two men but also their collective impact on Canada’s identity—particularly in terms of unity, Confederation, and representation.
