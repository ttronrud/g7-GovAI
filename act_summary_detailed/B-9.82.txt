**Detailed Summary of the *Budget Implementation Act, 1998***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Budget Implementation Act, 1998* is a federal statute enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It was introduced to implement specific provisions of the federal budget passed in 1998, particularly those related to the restructuring, dissolution, and asset management of certain government entities.  

Despite its name, the Act is not a general budget law but rather a legislative instrument designed to operationalize financial and administrative decisions made in the 1998 budget. Crucially, **the Act has been largely repealed or superseded**, with most of its provisions being repealed in 2008 by *Canada, c. 28, s. 95* and later by *c. 20, s. 3*. Only a few provisions remain in force or were adapted into later legislation.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Citation and Repeal Status**
- The Act is cited as the *Budget Implementation Act, 1998*.
- **Most sections were repealed in 2008** under *c. 28, s. 95* and *s. 96–97*, indicating that the Act was rendered obsolete due to subsequent legislative changes.
- Some provisions (e.g., sections 127–132) came into force in stages and were later updated or replaced, particularly in 2012.
- **Note**: Sections 53 to 55 were repealed before coming into force (per *c. 20, s. 3*), meaning they were never implemented.

> **Conclusion**: The Act is largely defunct. Only specific provisions related to the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation and certain administrative powers of the Governor in Council remain functionally relevant or were transitioned into later laws.

### **2. Definition of "Corporation"**
- In this Part, **"Corporation"** refers specifically to the **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)**.
- This is a government-owned entity established to invest in Canadian enterprises, particularly in infrastructure and development projects.

### **3. Authority for Disposal of Shares and Assets**
The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by order, authorize:
- The **CDIC** to sell or dispose of shares in any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries; or  
- A **wholly-owned subsidiary** of CDIC to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.

> **Key Provision**:  
> For the purpose of asset disposal, “assets” of a subsidiary include:
> - Shares in other corporations held by the subsidiary or on its behalf;
> - Shares held in trust for the subsidiary.

> **Purpose**: This provision gives the government broad flexibility to restructure or liquidate corporate holdings within the CDIC group, especially during financial or strategic realignments.

### **4. Transfer of Administration, Management, and Control**
The Governor in Council may transfer:
- The **administration, management, and control** of any property, rights, or interests held by a CDIC subsidiary to any **minister, department, or agency** of the Government of Canada.

> **Implication**: This allows the federal government to take direct control of assets or operations previously managed by a subsidiary, enabling centralization or reallocation of resources.

---

### **5. Transfer of Obligations and Liabilities**
The Governor in Council may transfer any **obligations or liabilities** incurred by a CDIC subsidiary to a minister, department, or agency of the Government of Canada.

### **6. Dissolution of the Canada Development Investment Corporation**
- The **Minister of Finance** is authorized to **procure the dissolution** of the CDIC.
- Upon dissolution:
  - Every reference to the CDIC in contracts, deeds, or legal documents shall be **read as a reference to Her Majesty in Right of Canada**.
  - This ensures continuity of legal obligations and avoids the need to re-identify the corporation in existing agreements.

> **Legal Effect**: After dissolution, the CDIC ceases to exist as a legal entity. All its rights and liabilities are assumed by the Crown.

---

### **7. Minister of Finance’s Powers in Closing Out Affairs**
- The Minister of Finance may do **all acts necessary** to close out the affairs of the CDIC, including financial settlements, audits, and final reporting.

---

### **8. Legal Proceedings Against the Crown**
- Any legal action or proceeding related to:
  - Obligations or liabilities of the CDIC, or
  - Actions taken by the Minister of Finance in closing out the CDIC’s affairs  
  may be brought **against Her Majesty in Right of Canada** in any court that would have had jurisdiction over the CDIC.

- Additionally, **pending legal actions** against or involving the CDIC may be continued by or against the Crown in the same manner and to the same extent.

> **Purpose**: Provides legal continuity and ensures that claims or defenses can proceed without interruption after the CDIC’s dissolution.

---

- The Minister of Finance, after consulting with the **President of the Treasury Board**, must make **necessary adjustments to Canada’s accounts** resulting from any transaction authorized under this Part.

> **Purpose**: Ensures fiscal transparency and accurate financial reporting in the national accounts.

### **10. Amendments and Implementation Dates**
- Sections 53 to 55 were to come into force on a date set by the Governor in Council, but were **repealed before implementation** (per *c. 20, s. 3*).
