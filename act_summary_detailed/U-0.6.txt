### **Detailed Summary of the *Unemployment Assistance Act***  
*(Cited as: The Unemployment Assistance Act)*

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The *Unemployment Assistance Act* establishes a framework for **financial cooperation between the Government of Canada and provincial governments** to share the costs of providing **unemployment assistance to persons in need**. The primary objective is to ensure that unemployed individuals who are unable to support themselves receive timely and adequate financial aid, while distributing the burden of such costs fairly between federal and provincial levels.

The Act allows Canada to provide **contributions to provinces** to help cover the expenses of unemployment assistance programs administered by provinces or municipalities. These contributions are intended to supplement provincial funding and ensure consistent access to support across Canada.

---

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agreement** | A formal arrangement made under Section 3 between Canada and a province for the sharing of unemployment assistance costs. |
| **Contributions** | Payments made by Canada to a province to cover a portion of the province's unemployment assistance costs. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development** (originally Minister of National Health and Welfare). |
| **Unemployment Assistance Costs** | The total cost to a province and its municipalities of providing financial assistance to unemployed persons in need. This includes payments for basic living expenses, but excludes certain categories such as medical, travel, or administrative costs. |

---

## **3. Conditions for Entering an Agreement**

- The Minister of Employment and Social Development may enter into an agreement with any province **only with the approval of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet).
- The agreement must be **substantially in the form set out in the Schedule** (a model agreement attached to the Act).
- The agreement must include the following essential provisions:
  1. **Definition and calculation** of unemployment assistance costs.
  2. **Procedures for claims and payments**, including how applications are submitted and under what conditions payments are made.
  3. **Administration responsibilities** — provinces or municipalities must carry out assistance programs and provide Canada with all necessary information and documentation.
  4. **Dispute resolution mechanism** — procedures for resolving disagreements arising under the agreement.
  5. **Duration** — the agreement shall last **no more than five years**, after which it continues until terminated by either party with **one year’s written notice**.

---

## **4. Limits on Contributions**

- Contributions from Canada to a province **shall not exceed 50%** of the total unemployment assistance costs in that province for which Canada has committed to contribute.
- This cap ensures that provinces retain the majority of responsibility for their own programs and prevents federal overreach.

---

## **5. Exclusions from Unemployment Assistance Costs**

Certain types of payments and benefits are **excluded** from being counted as "unemployment assistance costs" and therefore are not eligible for contribution under this Act:

| Excluded Payments/Benefits | Reason |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Payments to inmates in institutions funded by Canada, provinces, municipalities, or charitable organizations | These are considered institutional care, not general unemployment relief. |
| Payments made to individuals receiving benefits under other federal Acts (e.g., Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, Blind/Disabled Persons Acts) | These are already covered by other federal programs. |
| Mothers’ allowances | Considered a separate, targeted benefit. |
| Medical, hospital, dental, optical care, drugs, dressings, funeral expenses | These are health-related and not part of basic living support. |
| Traveling expenses (except specific cases) | Only travel for return home, job-seeking, or medical care is allowed. |
| Administrative costs of the program | Not considered a direct cost of providing assistance. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These exclusions are critical to defining the scope of what qualifies as "unemployment assistance" and prevent double-counting or inappropriate inclusion of other social programs.

## **6. Inclusions in Unemployment Assistance Costs**

Despite the exclusions, the agreement allows for **specific inclusions** of certain payments:

| Included Payments | Explanation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Assistance to inmates in **homes for special care** (e.g., nursing homes, homes for the aged, poor houses) | These are excluded from general hospitals and mental institutions. Only those who would not normally be treated in acute or chronic hospitals qualify. |
| Additional relief payments to persons already receiving assistance (beyond base payments) | If the recipient is unemployed and in need, such supplemental payments may be included. |
| Traveling costs for beneficiaries and dependants | Only if used for returning home, securing employment, or accessing medical care not available at home. |

> 🔍 **Definition of "Homes for Special Care"**:
> Includes nursing homes, hostels for indigent transients, homes for the aged, poor houses, alms houses, and hostel facilities within housing projects under the *National Housing Act*.

---

## **7. Retroactive Contributions**

- An agreement may include contributions for **unemployment assistance costs incurred within one year before the agreement is signed**.
- This allows for a transitional period where past costs are recognized and reimbursed, helping to stabilize funding during the implementation of the agreement.

---

## **8. Payment Mechanism**

- Contributions are paid from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- Payments are made **upon certification by the Minister of Employment and Social Development**.
