### **Detailed Summary of the *Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act***

---

#### **1. Context and Purpose**

The *Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act* is a legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of Canada to address the profound human and societal impacts of terrorism. It is grounded in the fundamental principles of justice, peace, freedom, and security for all Canadians and people around the world.

The Act responds to several key concerns:

- **Terrorism as a national and international threat**: Terrorist acts endanger Canada’s political institutions, economic stability, and public welfare.
- **Transnational nature of terrorism**: Terrorist networks operate across borders, requiring enhanced international cooperation and stronger domestic legal tools.
- **Financial and material support as enablers**: Terrorism depends on financial and logistical support, making such support a critical target for disruption.
- **Need for accountability**: The Act recognizes that victims of terrorism deserve legal recourse against perpetrators and their supporters, including those who financially or materially assist terrorist activities.

The **primary purpose** of the Act is to **deter and prevent terrorism** by creating a **new cause of action** that allows victims of terrorism to sue individuals, organizations, and foreign states responsible for acts of terrorism — thereby undermining the operational capacity of terrorist groups.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The Act establishes clear definitions to ensure legal clarity:

- **Foreign State**: Defined as per Section 2 of the *State Immunity Act*. This refers to any government or state entity outside Canada.
- **Listed Entity**: Defined as per subsection 83.01(1) of the *Criminal Code*. These are entities (individuals or organizations) designated by the Government of Canada as being involved in terrorism-related activities, particularly in financing or supporting terrorism.
- **Person**: Includes both individuals and organizations, as defined in Section 2 of the *Criminal Code*.

These definitions are crucial for determining who can be sued under the Act and which entities are subject to liability.

#### **3. Scope of the Legal Cause of Action**

The Act enables **any person** who has suffered **loss or damage** — either in Canada or abroad — **on or after January 1, 1985** — to bring a civil lawsuit if the harm resulted from an act or omission that would have been punishable under **Part II.1 of the Criminal Code** (which deals with terrorism offenses).

##### **Who Can Sue?**
- Any person who suffered loss or damage due to a terrorist act or omission.
- The loss or damage must have occurred **on or after January 1, 1985**.
- The act or omission must fall under the scope of **Part II.1 of the Criminal Code**, which includes offenses such as:
  - Planning, preparing, or carrying out acts of terrorism.
  - Providing material support or financing to terrorist groups.
  - Using or threatening the use of violence to intimidate or coerce.

##### **Who Can Be Sued?**
Victims may sue one or more of the following:

1. **Any listed entity** (a designated terrorist-financing or support organization).
2. **A foreign state** whose immunity from legal action is lifted under **Section 6.1 of the State Immunity Act**.
3. **Any other person** who committed the act or omission that caused the loss or damage.
4. **A foreign state or listed entity** that:
   - Acted **for the benefit of or in relation to** a listed entity;
   - And committed an act or omission that would be punishable under **sections 83.02 to 83.04 and 83.18 to 83.23 of the Criminal Code** (which cover terrorism-related support, financing, and facilitation offenses).

> This broad scope ensures that even indirect supporters — such as financiers, logistics providers, or foreign governments that enable terrorist operations — can be held legally accountable.

#### **4. Jurisdictional Requirements**

A court may only hear and determine a claim under this Act if **at least one of the following conditions is met**:

- The claim has a **real and substantial connection to Canada**, or
- The plaintiff is a **Canadian citizen or permanent resident** (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*).

This ensures that the Act serves Canadian interests and respects the principle of jurisdictional fairness, while still allowing victims with strong ties to Canada to access justice.

---

#### **5. Presumption of Liability**

In an action brought under the Act, the **defendant is presumed to have committed the wrongful act** if the court finds that:

1. A **listed entity** caused or contributed to the loss or damage by committing an act or omission that would have been punishable under **Part II.1 of the Criminal Code**; **and**
2. The defendant (whether a foreign state, listed entity, or individual) **acted for the benefit of or in relation to** that listed entity and committed an act or omission that would have been punishable under **sections 83.02 to 83.04 and 83.18 to 83.23** of the *Criminal Code*.

This presumption significantly reduces the burden of proof on victims, enabling them to secure compensation even when direct evidence of wrongdoing is difficult to obtain.

---

#### **6. Limitation Periods**

- The **limitation period** for bringing a claim under this Act **does not begin until the day the Act comes into force**.
- The period is **suspended** during any time when:
  - The victim is **incapacitated** due to a physical, mental, or psychological condition; or
  - The victim is **unable to identify** the listed entity, person, or foreign state responsible for the harm.

This provision protects vulnerable victims who may suffer trauma, confusion, or delayed awareness of their victimization — ensuring they are not unfairly barred from seeking justice due to circumstances beyond their control.

---

#### **7. Foreign State Litigation and Arbitration**

Courts **may refuse to hear a claim against a foreign state** if:
- The loss or damage occurred **within that foreign state**, and
- The plaintiff **did not give the foreign state a reasonable opportunity** to resolve the dispute through **arbitration** in accordance with **accepted international rules** (such as those set by the International Chamber of Commerce or the United Nations).

This reflects a balance between enabling victims to seek justice and respecting international legal norms, particularly the principle of state immunity and the importance of diplomatic dispute resolution.

---

#### **8. Recognition of Foreign Judgments**

Canadian courts must **recognize and enforce** judgments from foreign courts **if**:
- The judgment meets Canadian criteria for recognition (e.g., finality, legitimacy, compliance with public policy);
- The judgment is **in favor of a person who suffered loss or damage** under the Act.

**Exception**: If the judgment is **against a foreign state**, the foreign state must be **included on the list** in subsection 6.1(2) of the *State Immunity Act* (the list of states whose immunity has been lifted) **for the judgment to be recognized**.

This ensures that foreign states cannot evade accountability simply by claiming immunity — and that justice is served even in cross-border disputes.

---

#### **9. Policy and Ethical Foundations**

The Act is rooted in several foundational principles:

- **Justice for victims**: It acknowledges that victims of terrorism deserve access to legal redress and compensation.
- **Deterrence**: By enabling lawsuits against terrorist supporters, the Act aims to disrupt the financial and operational networks that sustain terrorism.
- **International cooperation**: The Act aligns with **UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001)**, which calls for global action against terrorism, including the suppression of terrorist financing.
- **Compliance with international law**: Canada’s ratification of the **1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism** (on February 15, 2002) provides a legal basis for targeting financial support of terrorism.

---

#### **10. Significance and Impact**

The *Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act* represents a significant shift in Canada’s approach to counter-terrorism:

- It **moves beyond reactive security measures** to include **proactive civil remedies** that target the financial and organizational infrastructure of terrorism.
- It provides **a legal pathway for victims** — many of whom have been injured or killed — to seek justice and compensation, which had previously been difficult due to the lack of liability for supporters.
- It **challenges state immunity** in cases involving terrorism financing, promoting greater accountability.
- It supports **international legal standards** and reinforces Canada’s commitment to global anti-terrorism efforts.

### **Conclusion**

The *Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act* is a landmark piece of legislation designed to:

✅ Provide victims of terrorism with access to the justice system  
✅ Deter terrorism by disrupting its financial and logistical support networks  
✅ Strengthen Canada’s legal capacity to respond to transnational terrorist threats  
✅ Uphold international obligations and norms in the fight against terrorism  

By establishing a clear, enforceable cause of action and setting robust procedural safeguards, the Act balances the need for justice with respect for international law, state sovereignty, and the well-being of victims. It is both a moral imperative and a strategic tool in Canada’s comprehensive counter-terrorism framework.
