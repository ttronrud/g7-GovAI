### **Detailed Summary of the Tlicho Land Claims and Self-Government Act**

The **Tlicho Land Claims and Self-Government Act** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that legally enacts and validates the **Tlicho Land Claims and Self-Government Agreement** (commonly referred to as the "Agreement"), a landmark treaty between the **Tlicho people**, the **Government of the Northwest Territories (NWT)**, and the **Government of Canada**. This Act provides the legal framework, definitions, enforcement mechanisms, and procedural safeguards necessary for the Agreement to take effect and operate within the Canadian legal system.

---

## **I. Background and Context**

The Act begins with a series of **"Whereas" clauses** that establish the historical, legal, and political foundation of the Agreement:

- The **Tlicho** are an Indigenous people of Canada with **immemorial use and occupation** of lands in and around the Northwest Territories.
- The Tlicho, through their representative body—the **Dogrib Treaty 11 Council**—negotiated a comprehensive land claims and self-government agreement with the NWT and federal government.
- The Agreement was **approved by a vote of the Tlicho on June 26–27, 2003**.
- It was **formally signed on August 25, 2003**.
- On **October 10, 2003**, the Commissioner in Council of the NWT issued an ordinance approving the Agreement.
- Crucially, the Agreement is defined as a **land claims agreement under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, which recognizes Indigenous rights and provides that **Parliament’s approval is a condition precedent** to its validity.

Thus, the Act is not merely a regulatory instrument—it is a constitutional-level affirmation of Indigenous rights and self-determination.

### **3. Legal Validity and Binding Nature**

- The **Agreement is approved, given effect, and declared valid** and has the **force of law**.
- It is **binding on all persons and bodies**, meaning any individual or organization may rely on its terms.
- The Agreement **prevails over conflicting laws**, including:
  - Other Acts of Parliament;
  - Laws of the NWT Legislature;
  - Regulations under those laws;
  - Tlicho laws (in cases of conflict).
- In case of **conflict between the Agreement and this Act**, the Agreement **prevails**.

> This prioritization underscores the **supremacy of Indigenous self-government rights** under Canadian constitutional law.

---

### **4. Public Access and Record-Keeping**

The Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs is required to deposit copies of:
- The Agreement (and amendments);
- The Tax Treatment Agreement (and amendments);

in the following places:
- Library of Parliament;
- Legislative Assembly of the NWT;
- Main office of the Tlicho Government;
- Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs (in Ottawa);
- Office of the Registrar of Land Titles (NWT);
- Regional office of the Department in NWT;
- Any other place the Minister deems necessary.

This ensures **transparency, accessibility, and accountability**.

---

### **5. Judicial Notice**

- **Judicial notice** is taken of:
  - The Agreement;
  - The Tax Treatment Agreement;
  - Tlicho laws.

This means that courts are **presumed to know** the content of these documents without requiring evidence or proof in litigation—greatly simplifying legal proceedings involving Tlicho rights.

---

### **6. Publication and Evidence**

- The Agreement and Tax Treatment Agreement are to be **published by the Queen’s Printer**.
- A **copy published by the Queen’s Printer is legally evidence** of the Agreement or Tax Treatment Agreement.
- A copy purporting to be published is **deemed valid** unless proven otherwise.

This establishes a **formal, authoritative record** that can be used in legal and administrative contexts.

---

### **7. Status of Tlicho Laws**

- Tlicho laws are **not statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.
- This means they are **not subject to the same review or approval processes** as ordinary government regulations.
- A copy of a Tlicho law deposited in the public registry of Tlicho laws is **evidence of its existence and content**, unless challenged.

This affirms the **autonomy and legal standing** of Tlicho laws as sovereign, self-determined legal instruments.

---

### **8. Regulatory Authority**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **orders and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement and Tax Treatment Agreement.
- This allows flexibility in administrative implementation while remaining within constitutional and legal boundaries.

---

### **9. Continuity of Pre-Existing Entities**

- The **Eligibility Committee** (established prior to the Agreement) is deemed to have been **validly established under the Agreement**.
- It retains all **jurisdiction, powers, and authority** granted by the Agreement from the date of its establishment.

This ensures **legal continuity** and avoids disruption in ongoing processes.

---

### **10. Pre-Decision Notice Requirement in Legal Proceedings**

This is a **critical procedural safeguard** designed to protect the integrity of the Agreement:

> In any judicial or administrative proceeding involving:
> - Interpretation, validity, or applicability of the Agreement; or  
> - Validity or applicability of this Act or Tlicho law,

the party raising the issue **must serve notice** to:
- The **Attorney General of Canada**;
- The **Attorney General of the Northwest Territories**;
- The **Tlicho Government**.

**Notice must include**:
- Description of the proceeding;
- Whether the issue relates to the Agreement or this Act;
- The day the issue will be argued;
- Particulars of the point to be argued;
- Must be served at least **14 days before the hearing**, unless authorized otherwise.

**Rights of Participation**:
- The three parties (AG of Canada, AG of NWT, Tlicho Government) may **appear and participate as full parties** with the same rights as any other party.

> This ensures **shared decision-making**, **consultation**, and **consensus-based interpretation**—a cornerstone of self-government.

> **Note**: This does *not* require an oral hearing, unless otherwise required by the court or tribunal.

---

### **11. Repeal and Continuity of Prior Ordinances**

- Certain **prior NWT ordinances** are **deemed valid** even though they were made before the Act came into force.
- These include:
  - The **Tlicho Land Claims and Self-Government Agreement Act** (NWT ordinance);
  - Ordinances establishing **community governments** under Chapter 8 of the Agreement;
  - Ordinances establishing a **community services agency** under 7.10 of Chapter 7.

This ensures **legal continuity** and avoids gaps in governance or service delivery.

> **Repealed provisions (2005 and 2019)**: Some earlier sections were repealed (e.g., s. 110, 2005; s. 81, 2019), reflecting updates in policy, structure, or administrative needs.

---

### **12. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The Act (excluding sections 107–110) **comes into force on a day to be fixed by the Governor in Council**.
- **Sections 107 to 110** came into force on **February 15, 2005**.
- The rest of the Act (excluding those sections) came into force on **August 4, 2005** (as per SI/2005-54).

This phased implementation allowed time for administrative preparation and public awareness.

---

### **13. Reference Updates (Name Changes)**

Due to government restructuring:
- References to the **"Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development"** are read as referring to the **"Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs"** in specific provisions.
- Similarly, the **"Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development"** is read as the **"Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations"** in relevant parts of section 4.

This ensures **legal accuracy** despite changes in departmental names.
