**Detailed Summary of the Act: "Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Material Reporting and Notification Act" (as referenced in the text)**

This act, enacted by Her Majesty in Canada with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, establishes a legal framework for **Internet service providers (ISPs)** to report and notify authorities when they become aware of **child sexual abuse and exploitation material (CSAEM)** or when their services are being used to commit offences related to such material. It is designed to strengthen the response of digital platforms to the illegal distribution, possession, or access to harmful content involving children, while protecting the privacy and integrity of reporting entities and individuals involved.

### **1. Definitions**

The Act begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Material (CSAEM):**  
  Has the same meaning as in *subsection 163.1(1) of the Criminal Code*. This includes any visual, audio, or digital content depicting a child engaged in sexual activity or exploitation. The definition is consistent with the federal Criminal Code’s strict interpretation of such material.

- **Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Material Offence:**  
  Refers to any offence under the following Criminal Code provisions:
  - *s. 163.1(2)* – Creating or producing CSAEM;
  - *s. 163.1(3)* – Distributing, transmitting, or making available CSAEM;
  - *s. 163.1(4)* – Possessing CSAEM;
  - *s. 163.1(4.1)* – Accessing CSAEM.  
  *(Note: The parenthetical French terms are for reference only and do not form part of the legal definition.)*

- **Computer Data:**  
  Refers to any representations—such as signs, signals, or symbols—in a form suitable for processing by a computer system. This includes digital files, metadata, logs, and other electronically stored information.

- **Internet Service:**  
  Defined as a service that provides:
  - Internet access,
  - Hosting of Internet content, or
  - Electronic mail (email).  
  This broad definition includes ISPs, cloud hosting providers, social media platforms, and email services.

- **Person:**  
  Encompasses individuals, corporations, partnerships, and unincorporated associations or organizations.

### **2. Reporting Obligations**

#### **Section 2 – Reporting of Addresses or URLs**
> *If a person is advised, in the course of providing an Internet service to the public, of an Internet Protocol (IP) address or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) where CSAEM may be available to the public, they must report that address or URL to the organization designated by regulations.*

- **Trigger:** A provider learns (directly or indirectly) that CSAEM is accessible via a specific IP address or URL.
- **Action Required:** The provider must **immediately report** the address or URL to the **designated organization** (to be named by regulation).
- **Timing:** As soon as feasible, in accordance with regulations.
- **Purpose:** To enable authorities to locate, investigate, and remove CSAEM from circulation.

#### **Section 3 – Notification of Suspected Offences**
> *If a person who provides an Internet service has reasonable grounds to believe that their service is being used to commit a CSAEM offence, they must notify an officer, constable, or peace officer as soon as feasible and in accordance with regulations.*

- **Trigger:** Reasonable suspicion that the service is being used to distribute, possess, or access CSAEM.
- **Action Required:** Notify a law enforcement officer (e.g., police or public safety officer).
- **Timing:** As soon as feasible, per regulations.
- **Note:** The provider does **not** need to have direct evidence; reasonable grounds are sufficient.

### **3. Preservation and Destruction of Computer Data**

#### **Section 4 – Preservation of Data**
> *A person who makes a notification under section 3 must preserve all computer data related to the notification that is in their possession or control for 21 days after the notification is made.*

- **Duration:** 21 days from the date of notification.
- **Scope:** Must include all relevant data (e.g., logs, IP addresses, timestamps, user activity) related to the reported or suspected offence.

#### **Section 4 – Destruction of Data**
> *The person must destroy the computer data that would not be retained in the ordinary course of business and any documents prepared for preservation purposes as soon as feasible after the 21-day period—unless required to preserve data by a judicial order under another law.*

- **Destruction Criteria:**
  - Only data that would not normally be retained (e.g., temporary logs) must be destroyed.
  - Documents created specifically to preserve data are also subject to destruction.
- **Exception:** If a court order under another Act (e.g., criminal investigation, subpoena) requires retention, the data must be preserved.
- **Goal:** To balance law enforcement needs with data privacy and reduce the risk of misuse or over-retention.

### **4. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure**

> *A person must not disclose that they have made a report under section 2 or a notification under section 3, or disclose the contents of the report or notification, if such disclosure could prejudice a criminal investigation—whether or not a criminal investigation has begun.*

- **Prohibition on Disclosure:** Providers and individuals are strictly prohibited from:
  - Revealing that a report or notification was made.
  - Revealing the content or details of the report or notification.
- **Exception:** Disclosure is only allowed if it would **harm a criminal investigation**.
- **Purpose:** To protect investigative integrity and prevent retaliation or obstruction by suspects or offenders.

### **5. Prohibitions and Limitations**

> *Nothing in this Act requires or authorizes a person to seek out, search for, or proactively discover CSAEM.*

- **No Active Search Mandate:** Providers are **not required** to conduct active searches or scans for CSAEM.
- **No Duty to Investigate:** The act does not impose a duty to investigate or locate material independently.
- **Purpose:** To prevent overreach, ensure compliance with privacy rights, and avoid creating a legal obligation to monitor content.

> *A civil proceeding cannot be commenced against a person for making a report in good faith under section 2 or a notification under section 3.*

- **Immunity from Civil Liability:** Providers are protected from lawsuits (e.g., defamation, breach of contract) for reporting or notifying in good faith.
- **Protects Whistleblowers and Providers:** Encourages transparency and reporting without fear of legal repercussions.

> *For greater certainty, nothing in this Act affects any right of a person to be protected against self-incrimination.*

- **Preserves Fifth Amendment Rights (in common law context):** Individuals and organizations are not required to incriminate themselves. This ensures compliance with constitutional protections.

> *A person who has reported information in compliance with provincial or foreign laws is deemed to have complied with section 2 of this Act.*

- **International and Provincial Recognition:** If a provider already reported CSAEM under provincial law or foreign legislation, that report counts as fulfilling the reporting obligation under this federal Act.
- **Promotes Consistency:** Encourages harmonization across jurisdictions and international cooperation.
