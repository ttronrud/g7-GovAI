**Detailed Summary of the *International Financial Assistance Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *International Financial Assistance Act* (IFA Act) establishes a legal framework enabling the Canadian government to provide financial assistance to foreign states, entities, and individuals through various instruments—such as loans, guarantees, and equity investments—primarily aimed at supporting international development, climate change mitigation, and innovative financing initiatives. The Act grants broad powers to the competent minister to facilitate these activities while ensuring fiscal accountability, risk management, and regulatory oversight.

---

### **Key Definitions and Key Parties**

- **Competent Minister**:  
  Refers to either:
  - The **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, or  
  - The **Minister for International Development**, for purposes related to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD).  
  This dual designation ensures that both diplomatic and development policy considerations are integrated into financial decision-making.

## **Core Powers and Activities Under the Act**

---

### **Section 3: Sovereign Loans Program**

> *Purpose:* To support a federal sovereign loan program by providing direct financial assistance to foreign states or entities.

#### Powers Granted to the Competent Minister:
1. **Make Loans**  
   - Can lend money directly to a foreign state or any person/entity.

2. **Acquire and Hold Security or Security Interests**  
   - May acquire and hold securities (e.g., bonds, mortgages, equity interests), including in Quebec, a *right in a security* (a legal interest in property or assets), to secure repayment of loans.

3. **Surrender and Replace Security**  
   - Can surrender existing security or interest and acquire a new one in exchange—useful for restructuring or refinancing.

4. **Realize Security**  
   - May sell or liquidate security to recover funds if repayment becomes due or uncollectible.

5. **Exchange, Assign, Sell, or Dispose of Security**  
   - Full flexibility to transfer or dispose of securities as needed to manage obligations.

6. **Acquire, Hold, Assign, Exchange, Sell, or Dispose of Shares**  
   - Powers extend to acquiring and managing shares under the definition in **paragraph 90(5)(e) of the Financial Administration Act** (i.e., shares held on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada).

#### **Guarantee Requirement**  
- **Unless the loan is made to a foreign government**, it **must be guaranteed** by that foreign government in favour of *Her Majesty in right of Canada*.  
  → This ensures that non-governmental recipients (e.g., private companies) are backed by the host country, reducing default risk.

> **Note**: This requirement strengthens the financial protection of Canada’s investments and ensures that risks are shared with the recipient country.

---

### **Section 4: Innovative Financing for International Assistance**

> *Purpose:* To promote international development through innovative financing mechanisms (e.g., blended finance, risk-sharing, green bonds).

#### Powers Granted:
1. **Guarantee Obligations**  
   - Can directly or indirectly guarantee any obligation (e.g., loans, project financing) undertaken by a person or entity abroad—full or partial guarantees allowed.

2. **Acquire and Hold Security**  
   - Same security rights as in Section 3, including rights in securities in Quebec.

3. **Surrender and Replace Security**  
   - Same flexibility as in Section 3.

4. **Realize and Dispose of Security**  
   - Full rights to realize and dispose of secured assets.

5. **Acquire, Hold, Assign, Exchange, Sell, or Dispose of Shares**  
   - Same share-related powers as in Section 3.

> **Note**: This section allows Canada to act as a guarantor or co-investor in innovative financial instruments, supporting private-sector development projects globally.

---

### **Section 5: Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation via Repayable Contributions**

> *Purpose:* To support international efforts to combat climate change through targeted, repayable financial contributions.

#### Powers Granted:
- The competent minister may, directly or indirectly:
  - **Acquire, hold, assign, exchange, sell, or otherwise dispose of shares** (within the meaning of paragraph 90(5)(e) of the Financial Administration Act).

> **Note**: This section focuses on **climate-related financing**, where Canada provides financial support that is expected to be repaid. It enables investment in green infrastructure, renewable energy, or adaptation projects in developing countries.

---

### **Fees and Interest**

- The competent minister may **charge fees and interest** on loans or guarantees, as determined by **regulations**.
- **Exemption from Service Fees Act**:  
  Fees and interest under this Act are **not subject** to the *Service Fees Act*, meaning they are not governed by standard service fee rules or limitations.

> This allows flexibility in pricing and risk-based fee structures.

---

### **Exclusions from Other Financial Rules**

- **Surplus Crown Assets Act**: Does **not apply** to the use of powers related to:
  - Loans (Section 3)
  - Guarantees (Section 4)
  - Climate-related share transactions (Section 5)
- **Section 61 of the Financial Administration Act**: Does **not apply** to:
  - The exercise of powers under Sections 3 to 5.

> These exclusions ensure that the Act can operate without being constrained by rules that govern the sale or transfer of surplus Crown assets or standard financial administration procedures.

---

### **Accounting and Financial Accountability**

- **Foreign Exchange Losses**:  
  Any foreign exchange losses arising from transactions under Sections 3, 4, or 5 must be **charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund**.  
  → Ensures fiscal responsibility and prevents loss absorption from public funds.

- **Payments to Development Finance Institute Canada (DFIC)**:  
  - The competent minister may make payments **up to $720 million in aggregate** (or a higher amount specified in an appropriation Act) to **DFIC**.
  - These payments are **for the purpose of supporting international programs**.

- **DFIC Account Requirements**:  
  - Must maintain a **separate account** for:
    - All amounts received under the payment provisions.
    - All receipts, recoveries, and disbursements related to those funds.

- **Repayment to Consolidated Revenue Fund**:  
  - The competent minister may require DFIC to **pay any outstanding amounts** (e.g., recoveries, losses) to the Receiver General for credit to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, at the minister’s discretion.

> This creates a clear financial trail and ensures that DFIC operates as a dedicated, accountable entity.

---

### **Definition of Development Finance Institute Canada (DFIC)**

- Refers to **DFIC Inc.**, a corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*, or any successor entity.

> DFIC acts as the operational arm through which Canada delivers financial assistance abroad.
