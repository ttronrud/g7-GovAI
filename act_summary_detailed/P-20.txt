### **Overview**
The *Prisons and Reformatories Act* is a foundational piece of legislation governing the administration, operation, and rehabilitation of prisoners in provincial correctional facilities in Canada.

### 3. **Prison**
- Defined as any place of confinement **other than a penitentiary**.

- Provinces may enter into **agreements** to transfer prisoners between provinces.
- Upon transfer:
  - The prisoner is **deemed lawfully confined** in the receiving prison.
  - The prisoner is subject to **all applicable statutes, regulations, and rules** of the receiving province.

### **2. Earned Remission (Sentence Credits)**
This is a central component of the Act, promoting **rehabilitation and reintegration**.

#### **General Rule:**
- Every prisoner (except those serving **criminal or civil contempt sentences** requiring return to court) earns:
  - **15 days of remission per month** served in prison.
  - **Pro rata remission** for incomplete months, based on:
    - Obedience to prison rules;
    - Active participation in rehabilitation and reintegration programs (excluding full parole).

> These programs include educational, vocational, mental health, and substance abuse treatment.

#### **Timing of First Credit:**
- The **first credit** must be issued **no later than the end of the month following the month** the prisoner is received into the prison.
- For prisoners received **before July 1, 1978**, the first credit is due on **August 31, 1978**, and subsequent credits follow from that date.

#### **Forfeiture of Remission:**
- If a prisoner **breaches prison rules**, they may forfeit **part or all** of their earned remission.
- This applies only to remission earned **after July 1, 1978**.
- **Exception**: If parole is **terminated** (not revoked), the prisoner **does not forfeit** earned remission.

#### **Revocation of Parole and Remission:**
- If a prisoner’s **parole is revoked** under the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act* (CCRA), they forfeit the remission.
- If parole is **terminated** (e.g., due to non-compliance), remission is **not forfeited**.

#### **Release Based on Remission:**
- A prisoner who has earned remission is **entitled to be released before the full sentence expires**.
- This applies **except** to prisoners under subsection 127(1) of the CCRA (e.g., those with mandatory return requirements).

#### **Special Provisions for Transfers:**
- **From Penitentiary to Prison:**
  - The prisoner earns **full remission** for the time served in the penitentiary, **as if it had been served in a prison**.

    - The prisoner is **entitled to be released on the date the youth sentence expires**.
  - If the sentence was under 42(2)(n), sections **97–103** of the YCJA apply to the remainder.
  - If under 42(2)(o), (q), or (r), sections **104–109** of the YCJA apply.

#### **Recrediting Forfeited Remission:**
- The **institutional head** may recredit forfeited remission.
