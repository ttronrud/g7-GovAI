### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Citation**: The Act is known as the *Northern Transportation Company Limited Disposal Authorization Act*.
- **Key Definitions**:
  - **Corporation**: Refers to *Northern Transportation Company Limited*, a corporation continuing under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA).
  - **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of Transport**, who holds the primary authority under this Act.

> This establishes the subject matter and key actors involved in the disposal process.

---

#### **2. Authorization to Sell Shares Held by the Minister**

- The **Minister of Transport** is authorized to **sell, on such terms and conditions as are approved by the Governor in Council**, any or all of the shares of the Corporation held by the Minister in trust for Her Majesty.
  
> This grants the Minister broad discretion to sell the Government’s equity stake in NTCL, subject to Cabinet-level (Governor in Council) approval.

---

#### **3. Transfer of Property and Rights from Her Majesty to the Corporation**

- Upon coming into force of the Act, **all property, real or personal, rights, and interests** of Her Majesty that were used in the business of the Corporation **before** the Act came into effect are **transferred from Her Majesty to the Corporation**.

> This ensures that the Corporation becomes the legal owner of the assets previously held by the Crown, enabling it to operate independently and manage those assets in a commercial context.

---

#### **4. Exemption and Transfer of Control by Governor in Council**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by **order**, **exempt** any property, rights, or interests from the transfer under subsection 3(3).
- If exempted, the **control, management, and administration** of such property may be transferred to:
  - Any **Minister** or **department of the Government of Canada**, or
  - Any **other person or body**.

> This provides flexibility for the Government to retain control over certain key assets or operations if deemed necessary (e.g., for national security, strategic interests, or operational continuity).

---

#### **5. Tax Treatment – Income Tax Act, Rules, and Regulations**

This section ensures that the transfer of assets from Her Majesty to the Corporation is treated for **tax purposes** as if the Corporation had always owned the assets.

- **Ownership Attribution**:  
  For income tax purposes, the property transferred is **deemed to have been owned by the Corporation** throughout the period it was administered by the Corporation (i.e., from the date of transfer onward).

- **Cost Base and Cost Amount**:
  - For **non-depreciable property**:  
    The **cost amount** to the Corporation immediately after transfer is deemed to be the **cost amount to Her Majesty** immediately before the transfer.
  - For **depreciable property**:  
    The **adjusted cost base** and **cost amount** to the Corporation are deemed to be the amounts that are **"reasonably regarded"** as the adjusted cost base and cost amount to Her Majesty prior to the transfer.

> These provisions prevent tax double-counting or loss of deductions and ensure a fair and consistent tax treatment of the transferred assets.

---

#### **6. Authority to Sell or Dispose of Assets (in Response to Ministerial Direction)**

- The **Minister** may, at any time **before a share sale**, direct the Corporation to **sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of its assets**, including shares in other corporations, on terms and conditions approved by the Governor in Council.

- Upon receiving such a direction, the **Corporation is authorized to act** in compliance with the direction and to sell or dispose of the assets accordingly.

> This allows the Government to manage the disposal process in a phased or flexible manner, potentially selling assets before or alongside share sales.

> Importantly, **subsections 183(2) to (8)** of the *Canada Business Corporations Act* and **subsections 108(2) to (5)** of the *Financial Administration Act* **do not apply** to any such sale or disposal.

> This removes procedural and administrative restrictions that would normally apply to corporate transactions, allowing greater flexibility in the disposal process.

---

#### **7. Debt Forgiveness and Write-Off**

- The **Minister is authorized to forgive and write off**, in full or in part, any **debt or obligation** of the Corporation owed to Her Majesty, or any claim by Her Majesty against the Corporation.

- **Regulations under the Financial Administration Act** (e.g., those governing financial reporting or compliance) **do not apply** to such write-offs.

> This enables the Government to eliminate outstanding liabilities without being subject to standard financial administration rules.

- **Tax Consequence**:
  - For income tax purposes, the **amount of any debt forgiven (excluding interest)** is **deemed to have been fully repaid** by the Corporation **immediately before** the forgiveness.
  - This prevents the Corporation from receiving a tax deduction for forgiven debts, as the forgiveness is treated as a repayment.

- **Reporting Requirement**:
  - Any debt forgiven in a fiscal year must be **reported in the Public Accounts** for that year, in the form determined by the **Treasury Board**.

> This ensures transparency and accountability in the financial handling of the Corporation’s liabilities.

---

#### **8. Adjustments to Government Accounts**

- The **Minister**, after consulting with the **President of the Treasury Board**, shall make **necessary adjustments** to the accounts of Canada as a result of:
  - A share sale, or
  - A sale or disposal of assets of the Corporation.

> This ensures that the financial records of the federal government accurately reflect the economic impact of the disposal.

---

#### **9. Termination of Government Oversight and Tax Status**

- The **Government Companies Operation Act** ceases to apply to the Corporation.
- The Corporation **ceases to be an agent of Her Majesty**.

> This removes the Corporation from the category of Crown agents, effectively ending direct government control over its operations.

- **Section 27 and subsection 124(3) of the Income Tax Act** cease to apply to the Corporation.
- The Corporation **ceases to be a "prescribed federal Crown corporation"** for the purposes of those provisions.

> This removes the Corporation from special tax treatment previously afforded to Crown corporations, aligning it more closely with private corporations.

---

#### **10. Special Tax Treatment for the First Tax Year**

- For the **taxation year in which this section comes into force**, the Corporation’s taxable income earned in a province is calculated as:
  
  > **Proportion of total income** based on the number of days in the year **on or after** the date the Act came into force, divided by the **total number of days** in that year.

> Example:  
  If the Act came into force on July 1, 1985, and the year is 1985 (365 days), then:
  - Income attributable to days from July 1 to December 31 = 181 days
  - Proportion = 181 / 365 ≈ 49.6%
  - Taxable income in that province = 49.6% of total income

> This ensures a **smooth transition** in taxation, avoiding a sudden or disproportionate tax burden due to the change in status.

---

#### **11. Repeal and Amendments**

- The section **repealed in 1988** (s. 101 of *c. 38*) — indicating that the Act or part of it was later withdrawn or superseded.
- The **amendments to other Acts** are noted, indicating that this Act may have triggered changes in other laws (e.g., Income Tax Act, CBCA, Financial Administration Act).
