## **4. Contribution Requirements (Section 5)**

### **General Rule**
- All persons **required to contribute** to the **Superannuation Account** or **Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF)** must do so by **reservation from salary or otherwise**.
- Contribution rates are set by the **Treasury Board**, on the recommendation of the Minister.

### **Threshold for Exemption (Post-January 1, 2013)**
- A person with **at least 35 years of pensionable service** (or combined pensionable service) **before January 1, 2013** is **exempt** from future contributions.
- However, they **must contribute** to the PSPF from the **later of**:
  - January 1, 2013, or
  - The date they achieve 35 years of pensionable service.

> This ensures that long-serving employees are not burdened with ongoing contributions beyond a certain threshold.

### **Contribution Caps**
- Contribution rates for **Group 1 and Group 2 contributors** must not result in total contributions exceeding **50% of the current service cost** of those groups for benefits under Parts I and III.
- This cap ensures **financial sustainability** and prevents over-contribution.

### **Salary-Based Contribution Limits**
- **No contribution may exceed** the annual salary fixed or determined by regulation.
- This protects employees from being over-contributing, especially in high-salary roles.

### **Exemptions Based on Work Hours**
- Employees working **less than 12 hours per week** (or a lesser number prescribed by regulation) are **not required** to contribute under section 5.
- Employees who were **not required to contribute on September 9, 1993** due to being in a category defined in paragraph 5(1)(j) of the Act are **exempt from contribution** for any service on or after that date.

## **5. Election and Service Credit Rules**

### **Election to Contribute**
- Employees who work **12+ hours per week** may **elect** to contribute to the Superannuation Account or PSPF, starting the month after making the election.
- Elections are subject to **regulatory conditions**.

### **Election to Count Leave as Pensionable Service**
- A contributor who has been on **leave of absence without pay** for more than **three months** may **elect not to count** that portion of the leave as pensionable service.
- If the leave ended **before** the subsection came into force, and the contributor has made **all required contributions**, they may **cease contributing** and **count only the prescribed portion** as pensionable service.
- If contributions were **partial**, the contributor must **cease further contributions** and count only the **prescribed portion** as pensionable service.

> This provides flexibility for employees taking extended leaves, especially those in medical or personal circumstances.

### **Election to Count Past Service**
- A person who **ceased employment before the subsection came into force** may **elect to count** periods of service during which they were unable to contribute due to being in a category defined in paragraph 5(1)(j) (e.g., low hours, part-time status).
- Upon making the election, the person must **pay into the Superannuation Account** an amount determined by regulation.

> This ensures **historical service is recognized**, even if contributions were not made during those periods.
