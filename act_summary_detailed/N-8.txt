**Detailed Summary of the *National Film Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Film Act* establishes and outlines the structure, functions, governance, and operational framework of the **National Film Board (NFB)** of Canada. The Act is designed to ensure that the NFB fulfills a national cultural and informational mission by promoting Canadian film production, supporting the interpretation of Canada to domestic and international audiences, and serving as a representative body for the Government of Canada in the film industry.

Although the Act has been significantly amended or repealed in parts over time (notably in 1995, 1996, and 2002), the core provisions described here represent the foundational and enduring elements of the legislation as it existed in its original form and prior to major reforms. This summary focuses on the key provisions relevant to the establishment, governance, mandate, powers, and accountability of the National Film Board.
