**Detailed Summary of the Poverty Reduction Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Poverty Reduction Act* is a comprehensive federal legislative framework enacted by Canada to systematically advance and monitor efforts aimed at reducing poverty across the country. The Act aligns Canada’s domestic policies with international human rights commitments and global development goals, establishing clear targets, institutional mechanisms, and accountability measures to ensure sustained progress in poverty reduction.

---

### **Preamble and Policy Foundations**

The Act begins with a strong policy foundation grounded in several key principles:

1. **Canada’s Aspiration**: Canada aims to become a global leader in eradicating poverty.
2. **Human Rights Obligations**: Poverty reduction supports Canada’s fulfillment of international human rights obligations under:
   - The *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* (ICESCR)
   - The *Convention on the Rights of the Child* (CRC)
   - The *Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities* (CRPD)
   - The *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women* (CEDAW)

3. **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: Progress in poverty reduction contributes directly to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals—particularly Goal 1 (No Poverty), which is central to Canada’s development agenda.

This establishes the Act not only as a domestic policy tool but also as a mechanism for upholding Canada’s global responsibilities.

### **Key Provisions and Structure**

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- The Act is titled the **Poverty Reduction Act**.
- Key definitions include:
  - **Council**: Refers to the *National Advisory Council on Poverty*, established under Section 9.
  - **Minister**: A member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada designated for poverty-related responsibilities (as per Section 4).
  - **Official Poverty Line**: Defined as the **Market Basket Measure (MBM)** published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*. This serves as Canada’s official benchmark for measuring poverty.

#### **2. Purpose of the Act**

The central purpose is to:
- Support **continuous efforts** in poverty reduction.
- Enable **continuous monitoring** of progress toward poverty reduction goals.

This ensures that poverty reduction is not a one-time initiative but an ongoing, evidence-based national priority.

---

#### **3. Appointment of the Minister**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may designate a Minister responsible for poverty reduction.
- This Minister will be responsible for developing and implementing a **national poverty reduction strategy**.

> *Note*: The Minister is not automatically appointed; the designation must be made by the Governor in Council, providing flexibility in leadership based on government priorities.

---

#### **4. Poverty Reduction Targets**

The Government of Canada has set two ambitious, time-bound targets:

| Target | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Reduce poverty to **20% below the 2015 level** by **2020** | Short-term milestone |
| Reduce poverty to **50% below the 2015 level** by **2030** | Long-term vision |

These targets are aspirational and serve as performance benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of federal policy and programs.

> The targets are based on the **2015 Official Poverty Line**, which is defined as the Market Basket Measure.

---

#### **5. Official Poverty Line (OPL)**

- The **Market Basket Measure (MBM)** is Canada’s official metric for measuring poverty.
- It reflects the cost of a modest, basic standard of living—what is needed to meet essential needs such as food, housing, utilities, transportation, and healthcare.
- The OPL is **reviewed regularly** by Statistics Canada to ensure it remains relevant and reflects changes in the cost of living.
- Reviews are conducted at intervals determined by Statistics Canada, ensuring the measure stays current and accurate.

> This ensures that poverty data is both reliable and responsive to economic shifts.

---

#### **6. Additional Metrics for Measuring Poverty**

While the Official Poverty Line is primary, the Act recognizes that poverty is multidimensional. To capture broader aspects of deprivation, the following **metrics** (listed in a schedule) are used to measure poverty:

- Income inequality (e.g., Gini coefficient)
- Access to education
- Health outcomes
- Housing stability
- Employment status
- Social inclusion and discrimination
- Indigenous-specific indicators (e.g., Indigenous child poverty)

> These metrics provide a more holistic picture of poverty beyond income alone.

- The **Governor in Council** may, by order, **add or remove** metrics from the schedule, allowing for adaptability as new data or policy insights emerge.

---

#### **7. Establishment of the National Advisory Council on Poverty (Council)**

The Council is a key institutional body designed to provide expert, independent, and inclusive advice on poverty reduction.

##### **Composition**:
- 8 to 10 members total.
- Includes:
  - A **Chairperson** (full-time)
  - At least one member with **specific responsibility for children’s issues**
  - The **Deputy Minister** of the department the Minister is responsible for is an *ex officio* member (automatically included).

##### **Appointment Process**:
- Members (excluding the ex officio member) are appointed by the Governor in Council.
- Terms are **not exceeding three years**, with eligibility for reappointment.
- Members may serve multiple terms.

##### **Roles and Responsibilities**:
- **Chairperson**:
  - Has **supervision and direction** over the Council’s work.
  - Acts as the lead facilitator and coordinator.
- In the event of absence or vacancy of the Chairperson, the **Minister may designate another member** to act temporarily.
  - However, such temporary designation may **only last more than 90 days** with **Governor in Council approval**—ensuring accountability and preventing prolonged interim leadership without formal oversight.

##### **Compensation and Expenses**:
- Members are paid remuneration fixed by the Governor in Council.
- Full-time members receive **public service benefits**, including:
  - Compensation under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*
  - Coverage under the *Government Employees Compensation Act*
- Part-time members are entitled to reimbursement for:
  - Travel
  - Living expenses
  - Other reasonable costs incurred while fulfilling Council duties

> This ensures that members can participate without financial or logistical barriers.

##### **Legal Status**:
- Members are **deemed employees** of the federal government for:
  - The *Government Employees Compensation Act*
  - The *Aeronautics Act* (for employment classification purposes)
- Full-time members are also considered **public servants** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*

> This legal status provides protections, benefits, and administrative clarity for Council members.

---

#### **8. Mandate of the Council**

The Council has a broad and active mandate, including:

1. **Provide Advice to the Minister**:
   - On programs, funding, and activities that support poverty reduction.
   - This includes recommendations on policy design, implementation, and evaluation.

2. **Conduct Public Consultations**:
   - Engage with diverse stakeholders, including:
     - The academic community
     - Experts in social sciences and economics
     - Indigenous peoples
     - People with lived experience of poverty
   - Ensures that policy is informed by real-world perspectives and community needs.

3. **Submit Annual Reports**:
   - Within **six months after the end of each fiscal year**, the Council must submit a report to the Minister that includes:
     - Progress in meeting the poverty reduction targets (set in Section 6)
     - Progress measured using the metrics in the schedule
     - Summary of the advice provided to the Minister during the year
   - These reports are **public accountability tools** and serve to inform government decision-making.

4. **Undertake Other Activities**:
   - The Minister may specify additional activities for the Council to carry out (e.g., research projects, regional assessments, thematic reviews).

---

#### **9. Dissolution of the Council**

- The Council may be **dissolved** by the Governor in Council.
- This can only occur **on the recommendation of the Minister**.
- The Minister may recommend dissolution **only when the level of poverty in Canada has been reduced by 50% below the 2015 level**.

> This is a significant condition—indicating that the Council is not a permanent body, but rather one designed to operate during a period of active poverty reduction. Once the 50% target is met, the Council’s role may be reassessed or transitioned.

---

#### **10. Parliamentary Accountability**

- The Minister is required to **table the annual report** in each House of Parliament (House of Commons and Senate) on **any of the first 15 days** after the House resumes sitting following receipt of the report.
- This ensures **transparency**, **public access**, and **parliamentary oversight** of poverty reduction progress.

> This provision strengthens democratic accountability by making the Council’s findings and recommendations accessible to elected representatives and the public.
