**Detailed Summary of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**

---

**Act Title:**  
*Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*

---

### **Overview**  
The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* is a legislative instrument that grants the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet or the government's executive authority) broad powers to restructure and reorganize the federal public administration. Its primary purpose is to enable flexible and efficient management of government functions by allowing the transfer of powers, duties, functions, and supervisory control between ministers and departments—either within the same department or across different ones. It also allows for the amalgamation of departments under a single ministerial and administrative structure.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

#### **1. Power to Transfer Powers, Duties, Functions, or Control**  
The Governor in Council may:  
- Transfer any **powers, duties, functions**, or **control or supervision** of a portion of the federal public administration:  
  - From **one minister** to another; or  
  - From **one department or portion** of the federal public administration to another.  

This provision enables the government to realign responsibilities based on strategic, operational, or administrative needs—such as improving efficiency, reducing duplication, or aligning functions with policy priorities.

> *Example:* The Ministry of Health may transfer its responsibilities for pandemic preparedness to the Ministry of Emergency Management, allowing for better coordination during crises.

---

#### **2. Power to Amalgamate and Combine Departments**  
The Governor in Council may:  
- **Amalgamate and combine two or more departments** under:  
  - A **single minister**; and  
  - A **single deputy minister**.  

This provision facilitates the consolidation of overlapping or related functions, reducing bureaucratic complexity and promoting interdepartmental collaboration.

> *Example:* The Department of Transportation and the Department of Infrastructure may be merged under a new Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, with a single deputy minister overseeing operations.

---

#### **3. Effect of a Transfer – Substitution of Responsibility**  
Upon any transfer of powers, duties, functions, or control under this Act or any other lawful authority:  

- The **receiving minister, department, or portion** of the administration, along with its **appropriate officers**,  
- **Immediately assume and carry out** the powers, duties, functions, control, or supervision that were previously held by the original minister, department, or portion.  

This ensures continuity and legal validity of the transferred responsibilities. The receiving entity is not merely "given" the duties—it is **legally substituted** as the holder of those responsibilities.

> *Implication:* The transfer is not symbolic. It creates a legal and administrative shift where the new entity is now responsible for fulfilling the former obligations.

---

#### **4. Succession in Case of Ministerial Death or Resignation**  
If a minister to whom powers, duties, or functions have been transferred under this Act:  
- **Dies**, or  
- **Ceases to be a minister** (e.g., resigns, is removed, or otherwise leaves office),  

Then those powers, duties, or functions **may be transferred to another minister**.  

This ensures that administrative continuity is maintained even in the event of leadership changes. It prevents administrative vacuum or disruption in critical functions.

> *Example:* If the Minister of Environment dies, and the Minister of Natural Resources has been transferred the environmental oversight functions, those functions can be reassigned to another minister (e.g., the Minister of Climate Action) without requiring a new legislative process.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Flexibility** | Allows the government to respond dynamically to changing policy, economic, or emergency needs. |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Reduces duplication, streamlines operations, and improves inter-departmental coordination. |
| **Legal Continuity** | Transfers are not just administrative—they are legally binding and effective immediately. |
| **Ministerial Accountability** | Each minister remains accountable for the functions they hold, even after transfer. |
| **No Requirement for Legislative Approval** | Transfers can occur under the Governor in Council (Cabinet) authority, without needing a new bill or parliamentary approval—making them swift and responsive. |

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The Act does **not require justification** for transfers, though practical and policy-based reasons are typically applied in practice.  
- Transfers must be **lawful**—they cannot be used to circumvent constitutional or statutory obligations.  
- The Act **does not create new powers**; it only redistributes existing ones.  
- The **receiving entity** must have the capacity and structure to manage the transferred responsibilities.  
- The process should be transparent and documented to ensure accountability and public trust.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* is a critical tool for modernizing and streamlining federal governance. It provides the executive branch with the authority to restructure public administration efficiently and responsively. By enabling the transfer and amalgamation of functions, and ensuring legal continuity through substitution and succession, the Act supports effective government operations, enhances accountability, and allows for agile adaptation to emerging challenges.

It serves as a foundational mechanism for administrative reform within the federal public service, balancing operational flexibility with legal and institutional integrity.
