**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Azerbaijan Tax Convention Act, 2004***

---

### **Overview**
The *Canada–Azerbaijan Tax Convention Act, 2004* is a legislative instrument that enables the implementation in Canada of the **Canada–Azerbaijan Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital**. This Act gives legal force to the tax treaty between Canada and the Republic of Azerbaijan, ensuring that income and capital gains are taxed fairly and without double taxation, while preventing tax avoidance through artificial arrangements.

The Convention was signed to promote economic cooperation, reduce tax disputes, and ensure that individuals and businesses are not taxed twice on the same income or capital gains in both countries.

### **5. Determination of Residency**

This is a **critical provision** for determining which country has taxing rights over income.

#### **For Individuals**
An individual is deemed a resident of **only one** Contracting State based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home**  
   → If the individual has a permanent home in one country, they are a resident of that country.

2. **Centre of Vital Interests**  
   → If permanent home is in both countries, residency is determined by **where personal and economic ties are stronger** (i.e., centre of vital interests).

3. **Habitual Abode**  
   → If centre of vital interests cannot be determined or no permanent home exists, residency is based on **habitual abode**.

4. **Nationality**  
   → If no habitual abode, residency is determined by **nationality**.

5. **Mutual Agreement**  
   → If an individual is a national of both or neither, the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue through **mutual agreement**.

> This prevents double taxation by clearly defining residency and ensuring that individuals are taxed in the country where they have the strongest connection.

#### **For Non-Individual Entities (e.g., Companies)**
- If a company is a resident of both countries, the **competent authorities** must **mutually agree** on residency.
- In the **absence of agreement**, the company **cannot claim benefits or exemptions** under the Convention.

> This prevents ambiguity in corporate tax residency and ensures fair application of treaty rules.

### **6. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment** is a **fixed place of business** through which an enterprise conducts business.

#### **Examples of Permanent Establishments**
- Place of management,
- Branch,
- Office,
- Factory,
- Workshop,
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, installation, structure, vessel (for resource exploration or extraction).

#### **Additional Cases (Where PE is Deemed to Exist)**
- A **building site or construction project** (if ongoing for **more than 12 months**) and associated supervisory/consultancy activities.
- **Furnishing of services** (e.g., consultancy) by employees or personnel of an enterprise, **if such activities continue for more than 6 months in any 12-month period**.

#### **Exclusions (Where PE is NOT Created)**
The following **do not constitute** a permanent establishment:
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods,
- Maintenance of **stock for storage, display, or delivery**,
- Maintenance of stock **for processing by another enterprise**,
- Fixed place used only for **purchasing goods or collecting information**,
- Fixed place used only for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**,
- Any combination of the above if the overall activity is **preparatory or auxiliary**.

> These exclusions prevent tax abuse through minor or incidental operations.

#### **Special Rule: Agents of Independent Status**
- An individual acting **on behalf of an enterprise** with authority to **conclude contracts** in a Contracting State is deemed to have a PE **unless** their activities are limited to those excluded above.
- **Exception:** If the agent is acting in the ordinary course of business (e.g., a broker), it does **not** constitute a PE.

#### **Insurance Exception**
- If an insurance company from one country collects premiums and provides coverage in the other country (excluding reinsurance via independent agents), it is deemed to have a PE in the other country.

> This ensures insurance companies are taxed appropriately on cross-border operations.

#### **Broker/Agent Rule**
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE merely through a broker or general agent acting in the ordinary course.
- However, if the agent’s activities are **wholly or almost wholly for the enterprise**, and not independent, it is **not** considered an agent of independent status.

> This protects legitimate business intermediaries from being treated as permanent establishments.

#### **Control and Ownership**
- Merely **controlling or being controlled by** a company in the other country **does not** create a PE.
> This prevents tax avoidance through ownership structures.
