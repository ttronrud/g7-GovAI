**Detailed Summary of the Canada Labour Code (Act)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Labour Code* is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that establishes the legal framework for industrial relations between employees, employers, and trade unions. It applies to federal workplaces, certain federally regulated enterprises, and specific public corporations. The Act promotes **free collective bargaining**, **freedom of association**, and **constructive dispute resolution** as essential components of fair and equitable labour relations.

It is designed to ensure that workers and employers can negotiate terms and conditions of employment in a transparent, fair, and legally protected manner, while also providing mechanisms for resolving disputes through conciliation, arbitration, and adjudication.

## **Core Principles and Objectives**

1. **Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining**  
   The Act recognizes that freedom of association and free collective bargaining are fundamental to healthy industrial relations. It protects employees’ rights to join unions of their choice and employers’ rights to join employer organizations.

2. **International Commitment**  
   Canada has ratified **ILO Convention No. 87** on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize, and this Act reflects that international commitment by enshrining rights to unionization and collective bargaining.

3. **Promotion of Constructive Industrial Relations**  
   The government believes that good industrial relations contribute to economic growth, social stability, and equitable distribution of the benefits of progress.

4. **Non-Discrimination in Employment Status**  
   An employee does not lose status due to a strike or lockout or dismissal contrary to the Act. This protects workers during industrial action or disputes.
