**Detailed Summary of the Wages Liability Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Wages Liability Act* is a legislative measure designed to ensure the timely payment of wages to workers employed on public works and railway projects in Canada. It establishes a framework under which the Crown (Her Majesty) can intervene to protect the rights of foremen, workmen, labourers, and teams by securing payment of unpaid wages when contractors or subcontractors fail to meet their obligations. The Act also imposes obligations on companies and contractors to maintain accurate wage records and to provide transparency in wage payments.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Payment of Unpaid Wages by the Crown**
- **Trigger**: If a contractor or subcontractor (working on a public work contract awarded by Her Majesty) defaults in paying wages to a foreman, workman, or labourer, or fails to pay a sum due for labour performed (including by teams), and a claim is filed **within two months of the due date**, the Crown may pay the claim.
- **Amount Paid**: The Crown will pay the claim **up to the amount of all moneys or securities** held by Her Majesty for securing the performance of the contract at the time the claim is filed.
- **Requirement**: The claimant must provide **satisfactory proof** of the unpaid wages or labour dues.

> *Purpose*: This provision ensures that workers are not left without compensation due to contractor insolvency or negligence, and provides a safety net through the Crown’s financial security interest.

---

#### **2. Monthly Wage Reporting Requirement**
- **Mandatory Reporting**: Contractors and subcontractors must file with the Minister (on behalf of Her Majesty) a **monthly list** of:
  - Names of all foremen, workmen, labourers, and teams employed.
  - Their wage rates.
  - Amounts already paid.
  - Amounts still due and unpaid.
- **Deadline**: The list must be submitted:
  - No later than the **tenth day of each month**, or
  - Within **ten days** after receiving a written demand from the Minister.
- **Authentication**: The list must be **attested by the contractor or subcontractor** or their authorized agent via **oath or statutory declaration**.

> *Purpose*: To ensure transparency and accountability in wage payments, enabling the government to monitor compliance and identify potential defaults.

---

#### **3. Condition for Financial Grants (Subsidies, Advances, Loans, Bonuses)**
- Any subsidy, advance, loan, or bonus granted by Parliament to a company or individual for the construction of railways or other public works is **automatically conditioned** on the following:
  - The Crown may **retain a portion of the funds** (as determined by the Governor in Council) to secure the payment of claims for wages owed to workers employed by the company, contractor, or subcontractor.
- This applies **unless Parliament provides a specific exception**.

> *Purpose*: To prevent financial support from being used to fund projects where workers’ wages are not being paid, thereby protecting workers' rights through financial safeguards.

---

#### **4. Enforcement of Unpaid Wages (After 30 Days of Notice)**
- If a wage claim remains **unpaid for 30 days after notice is served** on the Minister of Transport (or the relevant minister overseeing the project), the Governor in Council may:
  - Direct that the claim be paid.
  - Include **all reasonable costs and charges** associated with the claim.
- Payment must come from the **funds retained by the Crown** under section 3.

> *Purpose*: To establish a time-bound enforcement mechanism to ensure prompt resolution of wage disputes and prevent prolonged unpaid claims.

---

#### **5. Liability of Railway and Infrastructure Companies**
- Any company incorporated by Parliament or receiving a renewal/extension of its charter for constructing railways, canals, telegraph lines, or other public works **automatically becomes liable** for:
  - The payment of wages (for up to **three months**) of every foreman, workman, labourer, or team employed in the construction of such works — whether directly or through contractors/subcontractors.
- This liability arises **by virtue of accepting the charter**.

> *Purpose*: To extend the responsibility for wage compliance to corporate entities involved in public infrastructure, ensuring that even indirect employment is covered under the law.

> **Important Limitation**: This section **does not prejudice** the right of any worker to pursue legal action against the **specific contractor or subcontractor** with whom they have a direct employment relationship.

> *Note*: This means that while the company bears general liability, workers still retain their right to sue the actual employer (contractor/subcontractor) for unpaid wages.

#### **6. Procedure for Workers to Claim Wages Against the Company**
- If a worker is not paid wages by their contractor or subcontractor, the worker may:
  - Serve a **written notice** on the company within **two months after the wages are earned**, containing:
    - Name of the claimant.
    - Amount of wages claimed.
    - Rate of wages.
    - Nature and amount of work done.
    - Time and place of work.
    - Name of the contractor, subcontractor, superintendent, or foreman for whom the work was done.
- After serving the notice, the worker must **commence a legal suit** in a court of competent jurisdiction within **30 days** of the notice being served.
- If the liability under section 5 **ceases** (e.g., due to the expiry of the three-month period), the worker must still file a suit within 30 days of the notice.

> *Purpose*: To create a clear, enforceable process for workers to pursue claims against the company, ensuring timely legal recourse.

---

#### **7. Service of Notices and Process**
- Notices and legal processes (summons, orders, etc.) required under section 6 may be served on:
  - Any of the company’s officers (e.g., president, vice-president, secretary, managing director, superintendent, engineer).
  - Or on any **recognized officer representing the company**.
- Alternatively, the notice may be **left with any adult person** at the office or residence of any of the named officers.

> *Purpose*: To ensure that notices reach the company’s responsible parties, even if the company is not actively operating or has no physical presence.

---

#### **8. Penalties for Non-Compliance with Reporting Requirements**
- Any contractor or subcontractor who **fails to forward the required monthly list** after receiving a written demand from the Crown (under section 3) is guilty of an **offence**.
- **Fine**: 
  - A fine of **not less than $10 and not more than $100** per day of default.
- **Determination of Fine**: The fine is set by the **Minister responsible for the project**.
- **Enforcement**: The fine may be **deducted from the moneys held by Her Majesty** that are deposited by or owed to the contractor.

> *Purpose*: To deter non-compliance with reporting obligations and to ensure that contractors maintain accurate wage records.

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The Act **does not override** the contractual rights of workers against their direct employer (contractor or subcontractor).
- It does **not apply to private-sector projects** unless they are part of a public work or railway project.
- The Crown’s power is **limited to the amount of funds held** for the contract.
- The three-month wage liability period for companies is **not perpetual** and ends after three months of construction.

---

### **Historical and Practical Context**
This Act was enacted during a period of rapid infrastructure development in Canada (late 19th to early 20th century), when large-scale public works such as railways and canals were common. Wages were often paid late or not at all due to contractor financial instability. The Act was a response to widespread labour unrest and worker exploitation, aiming to balance the interests of:
- Public projects (reliability and cost control),
- Workers (fair pay and protection),
- Contractors (operational flexibility).

It reflects early efforts in Canadian labour law to institutionalize worker protections through state intervention and financial oversight.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Wages Liability Act* is a comprehensive piece of legislation that establishes a robust system for ensuring the timely payment of wages to workers on public construction projects. By placing financial responsibility on the Crown and requiring regular reporting from contractors, it creates a strong deterrent against wage arrears. It also provides clear legal pathways for workers to enforce their rights, while preserving contractual relationships between workers and employers. Though rooted in historical context, its principles of accountability, transparency, and worker protection remain relevant in modern labour and public works policy.
