## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Israel Tax Convention Act, 2016**

### 🔹 **Overview and Purpose**

The *Canada–Israel Tax Convention Act, 2016* (the "Act") is the legislative instrument that implements the **Canada–Israel Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital**, signed on **July 21, 1975**, and amended by a protocol. This Act brings the international tax treaty into force and gives it legal effect within Canada.

The primary objectives of the Convention are:
- To **prevent double taxation** of income and capital gains earned by individuals and enterprises in either country.
- To **eliminate fiscal evasion** through tax avoidance strategies.
- To **clarify the tax residency and source rules** for income and profits.
- To **ensure fair and equitable treatment** of taxpayers from both countries under a consistent international tax framework.

This Act ensures that the Convention is not only recognized but also **fully enforceable** in Canadian law.

## 🔍 Key Provisions and Structural Elements

### 1. **Citation and Definitions**
- The Act may be cited as the **Canada–Israel Tax Convention Act, 2016**.
- The central document is referred to as the **"Convention"**, which includes:
  - The original 1975 Convention (set out in Schedule III of the *1976 Implementation Act*).
  - Amendments made by the **Protocol in Schedule 2**.

> ✅ The Convention has the **force of law in Canada** during the period it is in force under its own terms.

---

### 2. **Hierarchy of Legal Provisions**
- In case of **inconsistency** between:
  - The Act and the Convention,
