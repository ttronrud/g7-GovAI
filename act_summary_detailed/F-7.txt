**Detailed Summary of the *Federal Courts Act***  
*(Cited as the Federal Courts Act)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**
The *Federal Courts Act* establishes and reorganizes the structure, jurisdiction, appointment, and operational procedures of the **Federal Court of Appeal** and the **Federal Court** in Canada. It serves as the foundational legislation governing the administration of **federal civil and criminal matters**, particularly those involving **maritime law**, **admiralty**, **federal jurisdiction**, and **inter-provincial disputes**. The Act ensures that these courts function as **superior courts of record**, with **civil and criminal jurisdiction**, and are equipped to administer justice efficiently and uniformly across Canada.

### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

#### **Action for Collision**
- Includes claims arising from **damage caused by one or more ships** to another ship, property, or persons on board — even **without a physical collision**.
- Covers situations involving:
  - **Failure or omission to carry out a manoeuvre**;
  - **Non-compliance with maritime laws**.
- This broad definition reflects the principle that **negligence or breach of duty** in navigation can lead to liability, regardless of whether contact occurred.

> *Example*: A ship fails to avoid a collision due to poor navigation, causing damage to another vessel — even if no physical impact occurred — constitutes an "action for collision."

---

#### **Canadian Maritime Law**
- Refers to the body of law administered by the **Exchequer Court of Canada** on its Admiralty side under the *Admiralty Act* (Chapter A-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970), or any other applicable statute.
- This includes all **maritime and admiralty matters** as they were historically administered, **as modified by this Act or other federal legislation**.

#### **Ship**
- Defined broadly to include:
  - Any vessel or craft designed, used, or capable of being used for **navigation**, regardless of propulsion method.

    - A ship that has been **stranded, wrecked, or sunk**;
