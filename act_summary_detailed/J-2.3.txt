**Detailed Summary of the *Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act* (Sergei Magnitsky Law)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*, commonly known as the **Sergei Magnitsky Law**, is a Canadian piece of legislation enacted in 2012 (with subsequent amendments) to strengthen Canada’s commitment to international human rights and the rule of law. It provides a legal framework for imposing economic sanctions on foreign nationals and entities involved in **gross violations of internationally recognized human rights**, particularly those committed against individuals who expose corruption or defend fundamental freedoms.

The Act is named after **Sergei Magnitsky**, a Russian lawyer who uncovered one of the largest tax frauds in Russian history. He was detained without trial, tortured, and died in prison in 2009. Despite widespread international condemnation, Russian authorities failed to conduct a thorough, independent, or objective investigation into his death. The Act seeks to address such injustices by enabling Canada to sanction individuals responsible for human rights abuses and corruption — especially when those abuses target activists or whistleblowers.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

### **1. Purpose and Legislative Background**

The Act is grounded in several core principles:

- **Human Rights and the Rule of Law**: Canada reaffirms its commitment to international human rights standards and the principles of fundamental justice.
- **Accountability for Human Rights Violations**: It establishes a mechanism to hold accountable foreign nationals responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of human rights — especially when such violations are committed against individuals seeking to expose corruption or defend their rights (e.g., freedom of speech, assembly, fair trial).
- **Response to Systemic Abuses**: The Act responds to documented cases of abuse, including:
  - The torture and death of **Sergei Magnitsky** (2009)
  - The assassination of **Alexander Litvinenko** (2006), with evidence pointing to Russian agents
  - The assassination of **Boris Nemtsov** (2015)
  - The illegal imprisonment of **Nadiya Savchenko** and other Ukrainian activists in Russia

These incidents have prompted calls from Canadian and international institutions (including the U.S., EU, UK Parliament, and Canadian federal institutions) for targeted sanctions against those responsible.

### **6. Forfeiture of Property**

If a foreign national's property is identified in a sanction order, the **property may be forfeited** to Her Majesty in Right of Canada.

#### **Process:**
- A **judge** of the superior court in the province where the property is located must order forfeiture if:
  - The property is described in the order
  - It is owned or controlled by the foreign national
- Before the order, the court must:
  - Provide **notice** to any person with a potential interest in the property
  - Allow a **30-day period** for claims to be filed
- Any person (excluding the foreign national) who claims an interest may apply within 30 days to have their interest recognized and compensated.

> **Exception**: If the property consists of all shares in a corporation, that corporation is **not deemed a Crown corporation** under the Financial Administration Act.

#### **Compensation**
- After consulting with the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs, the Minister may distribute **net proceeds** from forfeited property to **victims** of the human rights violations or corruption.
- Funds are drawn from the **Proceeds Account** under the *Seized Property Management Act*.

> This ensures that victims of abuse receive some form of redress.
