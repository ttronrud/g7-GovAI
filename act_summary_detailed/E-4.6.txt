The provided text consists entirely of repeals—statements indicating that certain provisions of a law or act have been officially removed or cancelled by subsequent legislation. However, **no actual act or law is listed**, only repeated references to repeals.

Here is a detailed summary of what the provided information means:

### Summary of the Provided Text:

The repeated entries:

> [Repealed, 2007, c. 15, s. 13]  
> [Repealed, 1995, c. 29, s. 24]  
> [Repealed, 1995, c. 29, s. 28]  

indicate that **specific sections of various prior acts have been repealed** (i.e., officially cancelled or removed from legal force) by later amendments or acts of legislation.

#### Breakdown of the Repeals:

1. **Repealed in 2007, under Chapter 15, Section 13**  
   - This means that certain provisions of a law were removed by **the Statute Law Repeal Act, 2007** (commonly referred to as *c. 15* in legislative references).  
   - Section 13 of that act specifically targeted and repealed certain outdated or redundant sections.  
   - The repetition of this repeal entry suggests that **multiple sections** (possibly across different acts) were repealed under this same provision.

2. **Repealed in 1995, under Chapter 29, Section 24**  
   - This refers to a repeal enacted in **1995** via *Chapter 29* of the Statutes of the province or country (likely Ontario, Canada, based on the format).  
   - Section 24 of that act removed specific provisions from a prior law.  
   - This repeal may have addressed obsolete or redundant rules, possibly related to administrative, tax, or land-use matters.

3. **Repealed in 1995, under Chapter 29, Section 28**  
   - A second repeal from the same 1995 legislation, targeting different provisions.  
   - Likely related to similar types of outdated or redundant legal provisions.

### Key Observations:

- **No original act is described** in the text.  
  The entries are only *repeal notices*, not summaries of laws that were previously in force.  
  Therefore, **there is no detailed summary of a specific act** being presented—only a list of what parts of previous laws have been removed.

- The repeated nature of the entries (e.g., "Repealed, 2007, c. 15, s. 13" appearing multiple times) suggests that **multiple sections or subsections** were repealed under the same legal instrument, possibly due to a broad legislative cleanup.

- These repeals are typically part of **statute law reform efforts**, aimed at:
  - Removing obsolete or redundant laws.
  - Simplifying the legal code.
  - Clarifying current legal frameworks.

---

### Conclusion:

**There is no detailed summary of an act** because the provided text does not contain the content of any law—it only lists repeals. The entries show that several sections of prior legislation have been officially removed:

- Sections of laws were repealed in **1995** (under *c. 29, s. 24 and s. 28*).
- Additional sections were repealed in **2007** (under *c. 15, s. 13*).

These repeals are part of ongoing legal modernization efforts to maintain a clear, relevant, and efficient legal framework.

✅ **Final Answer**:  
The provided text does not summarize a specific act; instead, it lists multiple repeals of legal provisions. These repeals—under *c. 15, s. 13* (2007) and *c. 29, s. 24 and s. 28* (1995)—indicate that certain outdated or redundant sections of prior laws have been officially removed by legislative action. No detailed content of an original act is present, only references to its repeal.
