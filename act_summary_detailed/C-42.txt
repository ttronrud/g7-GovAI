This section of the **Copyright Act** (Canada) sets out a comprehensive and precise definition of key terms used throughout the Act.

### 📚 **Core Definitions of Protected Works**

The Act defines several categories of protected **works**, which are the subject of copyright protection under Canadian law.

#### 1. **Literary Work**
- Includes:  
  - Tables  
  - Computer programs  
  - Compilations of literary works  
- *Note:* This broad definition ensures that even functional or data-driven works (like software or databases) are protected if they are original and fixed in a tangible form.

#### 2. **Dramatic Work**
- Includes:
  - Any piece for recitation, choreography, or mime, with a fixed form (in writing or otherwise)
  - Any cinematographic work (film)
  - Any compilation of dramatic works
- *Key point:* The definition includes performances and choreography, regardless of narrative content.

#### 3. **Musical Work**
- Any work of music or composition, with or without lyrics
- Includes any compilation of such works
- *Note:* This includes both original compositions and arrangements.

#### 4. **Artistic Work**
- Includes:
  - Paintings, drawings, maps, charts, plans, photographs, engravings, sculptures
  - Works of artistic craftsmanship
  - Architectural works
  - Compilations of artistic works
- *Note:* Engravings includes etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, prints — but excludes photographs.
- *Clarification:* A photograph is defined separately as a work analogous to photography.

#### 5. **Architectural Work**
- Refers to:
  - Any building or structure
  - Any model of a building or structure
- *Note:* This category is distinct from artistic works and is protected as a separate category of original creation.

#### 6. **Cinematographic Work**
- Includes any work expressed by processes analogous to cinematography (e.g., film, video)
- Does **not** require a soundtrack
- *Note:* Excludes soundtracks that accompany a cinematographic work (these are treated separately under sound recordings)

#### 7. **Compilations**
- A work resulting from:
  - The **selection or arrangement** of literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works or parts thereof
  - The **selection or arrangement of data**
- *Important:* A compilation is protected as a distinct work, even if it contains pre-existing works. However:
  - The mere inclusion of a work in a compilation **does not** increase or reduce the copyright protection of the original work.
  - If a compilation contains two or more types of works, it is deemed a compilation of the category that makes up the **most substantial part**.

#### 8. **Computer Program**
- A set of instructions or statements expressed, fixed, embodied, or stored in any form (e.g., code, firmware, databases)
- Must be used directly or indirectly in a computer to achieve a specific result
- *Note:* This is a foundational definition for software protection under Canadian copyright law.

#### 9. **Work of Joint Authorship**
- A work produced by two or more authors where the contributions are **not distinct** from one another
- Implies collaborative effort where individual authorship cannot be clearly identified
- *Example:* A group of artists creating a mural where each contribution blends into the whole

#### 10. **Work of Sculpture**
- *Repealed (1997)*: This definition was removed. The term "sculpture" is now covered under the broader definition of "artistic work" and includes casts or models.
