The provided text appears to be a **proposed or historical section of an Act of Parliament of Canada** related to the operation and funding of the **Blue Water Bridge**, an international highway bridge connecting Canada and the United States across the St. Clair River. However, the content is **incomplete and largely self-referential**, with a significant portion consisting of repeated "[Repealed, 2013, c. 40, s. 268]" entries — indicating that the actual legislation was **repealed (officially cancelled) in 2013**.

Below is a **detailed, accurate summary** of what the original intent of the act was, based on the text provided — even though the act itself was ultimately repealed.

### **Detailed Summary of the Proposed Act (Historical Context)**

#### **1. Purpose and Background**
The proposed Act aimed to establish a **joint international authority** to operate and maintain the **Blue Water Bridge**, a major international highway crossing between Canada (Ontario) and the United States (Michigan). The bridge is located on the St. Clair River and serves as a critical transportation link between the two countries.

The act begins with a foundational *whereas* clause stating that it is **"deemed appropriate"** that such a bridge be operated on a **joint international basis**, with:

- Equal representation from Canada and the United States,
- A public authority empowered to **levy tolls** to cover the costs of operation and maintenance.

This reflects a principle of **bilateral cooperation**, ensuring that both nations share responsibility for the bridge’s management and financial sustainability.

---

#### **2. Problem Statement**
At the time the act was proposed, there was **no competent authority in Canada** responsible for levying tolls to cover the costs of operating and maintaining the **Canadian portion** of the Blue Water Bridge.

This lack of a clear, authorized entity created a **financial and administrative gap**, as the Canadian side could not independently fund its share of operations, maintenance, and infrastructure improvements.

---

#### **3. Proposed Solution**
To address this gap, the Act proposed the **immediate establishment of a new authority** — a Canadian entity — to:

- Operate and maintain the **Canadian portion** of the Blue Water Bridge,
- Levy **tolls** on vehicles using the bridge to generate revenue,
- Ensure that the financial burden of operations is properly borne by Canada, pending the formation of a **long-term, joint international authority**.

This interim measure was intended to be **temporary**, serving as a bridge (pun intended) until a fully cooperative, bilateral structure (with equal representation from both nations) could be established.

---

#### **4. Legal Authority and Enactment**
The Act was enacted by **Her Majesty in Right of Canada**, with the **advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons** — the standard process for passing legislation in Canada.

This means it was a formal piece of federal legislation passed through the parliamentary process, with the goal of creating legal authority for toll collection and bridge operations.

---

#### **5. Status of the Act: Repealed**
Despite being introduced and passed, the Act was **repealed in 2013** under **Statute Law Amendment Act, 2013 (c. 40, section 268)**.

This repeal indicates that:

- The need for a standalone Canadian authority to manage the Blue Water Bridge was no longer deemed necessary,
- A more comprehensive, bilateral agreement between Canada and the U.S. had already been established or was being implemented,
- The Canadian government had transitioned to a different governance model for the bridge — likely under a **joint agreement** between the Canadian and U.S. governments, or through a different administrative structure.

The repeated "[Repealed, 2013, c. 40, s. 268]" entries in the original text confirm that the legislation was formally **cancelled** and is no longer in force.

### **Key Takeaways**

| Element | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Objective** | To establish a Canadian authority to operate and fund the Canadian portion of the Blue Water Bridge via tolls. |
| **Bilateral Principle** | Advocated for equal representation and joint management between Canada and the U.S. |
| **Interim Nature** | Designed as a temporary measure until a permanent joint international authority could be formed. |
| **Actual Outcome** | The Act was **repealed in 2013** — it was never implemented as written. |
| **Current Status** | The Blue Water Bridge is now operated and maintained under a **joint Canada–U.S. agreement**, with tolls collected through a shared framework. |

---

### **Post-Repeal Reality (As of 2024)**
Today, the **Blue Water Bridge** is managed by a **joint Canada–U.S. authority**, with:

- The **Canadian side** operated by the **Ontario Ministry of Transportation** (MTO),
- The **U.S. side** managed by the **Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT)**,
- Tolls are collected on both sides and shared according to a bilateral agreement,
- The Canadian portion is funded through a combination of provincial funding, toll revenue, and federal support.

The 2013 repeal of the proposed Act reflects a shift from a standalone Canadian authority to a **cooperative, shared model** that respects both nations’ interests and responsibilities.

---

### **Conclusion**
While the proposed Act outlines a clear and logical framework for managing the Blue Water Bridge through a joint, equitable, and financially sustainable model, it was **never implemented** due to its repeal in 2013. The current operational model is a more mature, bilateral arrangement that reflects the practical realities of cross-border infrastructure management. The original intent — shared governance and toll-based funding — remains valid and is now realized through cooperation between Canada and the United States.

> ✅ **Bottom Line**: The act was a proposed interim solution to a funding gap in bridge operations, but it was repealed in 2013. The Blue Water Bridge is now managed jointly by Canada and the U.S. under a cooperative framework.
