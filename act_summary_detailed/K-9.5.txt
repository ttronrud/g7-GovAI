The document you've provided appears to be a **draft or draft-style preamble** to a proposed piece of Canadian environmental legislation—specifically, one related to **climate change mitigation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction**—but it **does not contain any actual enacted provisions or legislative sections** (i.e., no "enacts as follows" with laws, regulations, or policy measures). Instead, it consists of a detailed **preamble or background statement** outlining the rationale and context for such legislation.

Additionally, the repeated line:

> [Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 699]

suggests that this legislation was **repealed in 2012** under **Bill C-19**, which amended the *Canada Environmental Protection Act, 1988* (CEPA). This indicates that the act in question was **not a standalone piece of legislation**, but rather a **proposed or historical version of a climate change-related measure** that was ultimately **replaced or revoked**.

### Detailed Summary of the Preamble and Context

#### 1. **Core Principles and Values**
- Canadians are deeply proud of their natural environment and have a responsibility to act as **stewards of the land**.
- The government affirms that **environmentally sustainable development** is essential for a healthy economy and society.
- Canadians want to **take personal responsibility** for environmental problems and avoid passing them on to future generations.

#### 2. **Climate Change as a Global and National Crisis**
- Climate change is identified as **one of the most serious threats to humanity and Canada**.
- It poses significant risks to:
  - The environment
  - The economy
  - Society
  - Human health
- In June 2005, the **national science academies of 11 major countries** (Canada, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, UK, US) issued a consensus statement:
  > “The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. It is vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps that they can take now to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions.”

#### 3. **International Commitments**
- Climate change is a **transnational issue**—it does not respect borders.
- Canada has a **clear moral and legal responsibility** to act because:
  - Canada has among the **highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions** globally.
  - Canada is also one of the wealthiest nations, meaning it has greater capacity to reduce emissions.
  - The **Arctic region**, which is experiencing some of the most severe climate impacts (e.g., melting ice, permafrost thaw, ecosystem disruption), is particularly vulnerable.

#### 4. **Legal and Treaty Obligations**
- The **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)** aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent “dangerous anthropogenic interference” with the climate system.
- Canada ratified the UNFCCC in **1994**.
- The **Kyoto Protocol** (adopted in 1997) required developed countries, including Canada, to reduce average annual GHG emissions by **6% below 1990 levels** during the period **2008–2012**.
- Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol in **2002** and it entered into force in **2005**.

#### 5. **Purpose of the Legislation**
- The proposed act was intended to:
  - Meet Canada’s **international obligations** under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.
  - Encourage **immediate action** by all levels of government, businesses, and individuals to address climate change.

### Important Note: The Act Was Repealed

Despite the strong rationale and intent, the legislation **was never enacted as a standalone law**. Instead:

- The repeated line `[Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 699]` indicates that this specific provision or draft act was **repealed in 2012** by **Bill C-19**, the *Environmental Protection Act and other amendments*.
- Bill C-19 replaced or removed several outdated environmental provisions, including the **Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GHG Pricing)** and other climate-related measures that were considered ineffective or outdated.
- The repeal suggests that the government shifted its approach to climate policy, moving away from a centralized, federal emissions reduction framework toward **market-based mechanisms** and **provincial responsibility**.

---

### What This Means in Practice

- The **preamble** reflects a strong public and scientific consensus on climate change and Canada’s responsibility to act.
- However, the **actual legislative framework** for climate action in Canada evolved differently:
  - The **Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (2019)** replaced earlier efforts with a **national carbon pricing system**.
  - Climate action now relies more on **provincial policies**, **sector-specific regulations**, and **market-based instruments** than on a single federal act.
- The 2012 repeal of this draft legislation signals a **reassessment of federal climate policy**, possibly due to political, economic, or administrative challenges in implementing binding national emissions targets.

---

### Conclusion

This document is **not an active or current law**, but rather a **historical or draft preamble** that outlines the **philosophical and legal foundations** for Canada’s climate change policy in the early 2000s. It emphasizes:

- The scientific urgency of climate change
- International obligations under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol
- Canada’s responsibility due to its high emissions and exposure to climate impacts
- The need for immediate, collective action at all levels of society

However, due to the **2012 repeal** of the associated provisions, the specific legislation referenced in the text **does not currently exist**. Canada now manages climate change through a different, more flexible, and decentralized policy framework centered on carbon pricing and sectoral regulation.

---

### Key Takeaway

> While the preamble expresses a strong commitment to climate action and environmental stewardship, the actual legislative vehicle to achieve those goals was **repealed in 2012** and replaced by a new, more adaptable approach to emissions reduction under modern climate policy.
