The provided information indicates that the specific act you are referring to is **not included in the database of consolidated federal legislation**. This means that:

- The act does not appear in the official, up-to-date, consolidated version of federal laws maintained by the government (such as those available through the Canadian or U.S. government's legislative databases).
- There is no detailed text or summary of the act's provisions available in the system.
- The only available reference is a link to the **Table of Contents** of regulations made under the act. This suggests that while the act exists and is in force, its full text is not accessible in the current database.

### What This Implies:
1. **The Act Exists**: The act is active and has been enacted, as regulations are being made under it.
2. **Regulations Are in Place**: The government has issued rules or regulations based on this act, which are likely listed in the Table of Contents.
3. **No Full Text Available**: The detailed provisions of the act (such as definitions, objectives, sections, penalties, or implementation details) are not currently accessible in the database.
4. **Limited Access**: Users must consult external sources (e.g., official government websites, legislative archives, or parliamentary records) to obtain the full text of the act.

### Recommended Next Steps:
