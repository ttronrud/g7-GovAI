## 📚 OVERVIEW OF THE OLD AGE SECURITY ACT

**Official Citation:** *Old Age Security Act*  
**Purpose:** To provide a monthly pension to eligible elderly Canadians, ensuring financial support during retirement based on age, residency, and citizenship status.

This Act governs the eligibility, calculation, payment, and administration of **Old Age Security (OAS) pensions** and related benefits such as the **Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)** — though the GIS is not explicitly detailed here. It also includes provisions for **survivors**, **residency requirements**, **income adjustments**, and **exceptions** for certain individuals.

## 📌 ELIGIBILITY FOR A FULL MONTHLY PENSION

A full monthly pension may be paid to a person if they meet **one of three categories** of eligibility:

### 1. **People who were pensioners on July 1, 1977**
- Automatically eligible without further conditions.

### 2. **People who were not pensioners on July 1, 1977**
Must meet **all** of the following:
- Attained **65 years of age**.
- Resided in Canada for the **ten years immediately before** the approval date of their application, **OR**
  - If they did not reside in Canada, they must have:
    - Resided in Canada **after age 18** for an aggregate period **equal to at least three times** their total absence from Canada during those ten years.
    - Resided in Canada for **at least one year immediately before** the application approval date.
- **Additional condition**: Must have attained 25 years of age on July 1, 1977, or have lived in Canada after age 18 or held a valid immigration visa.

> ⚖️ This rule emphasizes **long-term residency** in Canada as a key eligibility factor.

### 3. **People who were not pensioners on July 1, 1977**
Must meet:
- Attained **65 years of age**.
- Resided in Canada **after age 18** and **before application approval** for an aggregate period of **at least 40 years**.

> ✅ This category is designed to recognize long-term residents who may have lived abroad but maintained a strong connection to Canada.

---

## 📌 ELIGIBILITY FOR A PARTIAL MONTHLY PENSION

A partial pension may be paid **only if** the person is **not eligible** for a full pension under the above categories, but still meets:

- Attained **65 years of age**.
- Resided in Canada after age 18 and before application approval for an aggregate period of **at least 10 years but less than 40 years**.
- **If the aggregate period is less than 20 years**, the person must have been a **resident in Canada on the day before application approval**.

### 💡 How the Amount is Calculated
- The partial pension amount is a **proportional fraction** of the full monthly pension.
- Formula:
  > Partial Pension = (Residency Period / 40 years) × Full Monthly Pension  
  (The residency period is rounded down to the nearest whole year.)

> 🔁 **Important:** Once a partial pension is approved, **future periods of residence in Canada cannot increase** the monthly amount.

> ❌ **No increase** after approval, even if the person later moves back to Canada.

## 📌 RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS (WITH KEY CHANGES OVER TIME)

### Pre-1996 (Before April 1996)
- A **special qualifying factor** was used to assess eligibility.
- For individuals who were not "specially qualified," the factor was **1**.
- For "specially qualified individuals" (those who lived in Canada for ≥10 years after age 18), the factor was:
  > (Years lived in Canada after age 18) / 10  
  (Rounded down to the next lower whole number)

### After March 1996
- The definition of "specially qualified individual" changed:
  - A person qualifies if they:
    - Have lived in Canada after age 18 for **10+ years**, **OR**
    - Were a **Canadian citizen or permanent resident** before March 7, 1996.

> 📌 This change reflects a shift from strict residency to recognizing long-term residents and citizens.

## 📌 INCOME DEDUCTIONS (CRUCIAL FOR BENEFIT CALCULATION)

Income is calculated under the *Income Tax Act*, but with **specific deductions** applied depending on the year.

### Deductions (General Rules):

| Time Period | Deductions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Before July 2008** | Deduct **lesser of $500 or 1/5 of income from employment** |
| **July 2008 – June 2020** | Deduct **lesser of $3,500 or full income from employment** |
| **After June 2020** | Deduct **from combined income** (employment + self-employment):<br> - **Lesser of $5,000 and combined income**<br> - **If combined income > $5,000**, deduct **lesser of $5,000 and half the amount over $5,000** |

> 📌 This creates a **progressive income cap** — higher earners see larger reductions in benefit.

### Additional Deductions (from income for the year):
- Amounts of **Employment Insurance (EI) premiums** and **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or provincial pension contributions.
- **Self-employment contributions** under CPP or provincial plans.
- **Premiums under Part VII.1 of EI Act** (e.g., for workers with disabilities or other benefits).

### Post-June 2022 Additions:
- Deduct **any payment under**:
  - Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)
  - Part VIII.4 of EI Act
  - Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB)
  - Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit (CWL)

> 📌 These deductions reflect temporary pandemic-era benefits that are not eligible for OAS inclusion.

### Tax Adjustment Rule (Post-2022):
- Deduct **three times** the amount by which:
  > Total tax deductions under section 121 of the Income Tax Act  
  > Exceeds  
  > "Tax for the year otherwise payable under this Part" (as defined in subsection 126(7
