**Detailed Summary of the *International Rapids Power Development Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *International Rapids Power Development Act* is a legislative instrument enacted in Canada to provide legal authority and framework for the development of hydroelectric power in the **International Rapids Section of the St. Lawrence River**, a key area along the Canada–United States border. The Act formalizes and approves an international agreement signed on **December 3, 1951**, between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of Ontario**, focusing on the construction, operation, and maintenance of hydroelectric works while respecting environmental, navigational, and international treaty obligations.

This Act serves as the enabling legislation that gives legal force to the agreement, authorizes necessary governmental actions, and establishes mechanisms for cooperation, dispute resolution, and compensation between the parties.

## **Key Provisions and Features**

---

### **1. Legal Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is officially titled the **International Rapids Power Development Act**.
- It is designed to **approve and implement** the 1951 agreement between Canada and Ontario regarding power development in the International Rapids Section of the St. Lawrence River.
- The Act provides a legal foundation for all actions related to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the power project.

---

### **2. Approval of the 1951 Agreement**
- The core of the Act is the **approval of the December 3, 1951 agreement** between Canada and Ontario.
- This agreement outlines joint development of hydroelectric resources in the International Rapids Section, with a key objective: to **develop power resources that will benefit Ontario**, particularly through shared use of the St. Lawrence River system.
- The agreement is binding on both governments and all actions taken under it are authorized by this Act.

---

### **3. Authority to Transfer Lands**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has the power to **transfer administrative control of lands or properties belonging to Canada** to the Government of Ontario if it determines such lands are necessary for:
  - Construction
  - Operation
  - Maintenance of the power works
- Conversely, **Ontario must transfer administrative control** of certain lands to Canada when required for:
  - Deep waterway navigation (e.g., locks and channels)
  - Operation of navigation infrastructure
- These transfers are **not automatic** but require assessment and approval by the Governor in Council.

---

### **4. Powers of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (HEP)**
- The HEP Commission is granted **the legal status of a natural person** (i.e., it is treated as a corporate entity with full legal capacity).
- This enables the Commission to:
  - Enter into contracts
  - Acquire property
  - Be sued or sue others
- This status is equivalent to being incorporated by **Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Canada**, giving it the necessary legal standing to operate the project.

---

### **5. Application of the St. Lawrence Development Act (1952)**
- The provisions of the **St. Lawrence Development Act, 1952**, specifically those related to **expropriation or taking of private land** for the project, are **made effective as if enacted in this Act**.
- This means that if land must be acquired for the project, the process of expropriation can proceed under the authority and procedures of the St. Lawrence Development Act, ensuring legal consistency and clarity.

---

### **6. Entry into Force**
- The Act comes into force on a date to be **proclaimed by the Governor General** (i.e., announced by executive order).
- This allows flexibility in timing, ensuring implementation occurs only when conditions are met (e.g., environmental assessments, international approvals).

## **Core Agreement Between Canada and Ontario (December 3, 1951)**

The agreement is structured around several key principles and provisions:

---

### **A. Definitions and Key Terms**
- **Deep Waterway**: A navigable channel requiring:
  - A **controlling channel depth of 27 feet**
  - **30 feet over lock sills**
  - Aligned with specifications from the **1926 Joint Board of Engineers Report**
- **International Rapids Section**: The stretch of the St. Lawrence River from **Chimney Point to St. Regis**.
- **International Section**: The portion of the river that lies along the Canada–U.S. boundary.
- **Works**: The specific hydroelectric infrastructure to be developed (dams, powerhouses, channels, etc.), as described in **Article II**.

---

### **B. Canada’s Obligations – International Waters Treaty Compliance**
- Canada is **responsible for obtaining approval** from the **International Joint Commission (IJC)** before any development proceeds.
- The IJC must approve the project under the **Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909**, which governs shared use of boundary waters.
- Canada will:
  - Submit an application to the IJC in a form approved by Canada
  - Ensure the project complies with the **order of water use precedence**:
    1. Domestic and sanitary uses
    2. Navigation (including canal service)
    3. Power and irrigation (least priority)
- This ensures that **navigation rights are protected**, and no power development will interfere with essential uses of the river.

---

### **C. Conditions for Activation of Key Provisions**
- Articles IV to XVI (which govern operations, compensation, and dispute resolution) **do not take effect until**:
  1. The Governor General in Council **approves** that the IJC has found the project acceptable under the Boundary Waters Treaty.
  2. Ontario has **committed to carry out** the works **concurrently** with complementary U.S. development (i.e., a matching project on the American side).

> This ensures that the project only proceeds when both **international treaty compliance** and **mutual commitment** are established.

---

### **D. Legislative Authorization**
- Canada and Ontario agree to **enact necessary legislation** to:
  - Authorize construction
  - Provide funding
  - Establish regulatory frameworks
  - Ensure compliance with environmental, safety, and operational standards

---

### **E. Land Transfers and Compensation**
#### **(1) Canada to Ontario**
- Canada transfers **administrative control** of lands needed for the works to Ontario.
- **Compensation** is paid to Canada for these lands **except** for:
  - Lands that are part of the **existing canal system** in the International Rapids Section.

#### **(2) Ontario to Canada**
- Ontario transfers administrative control of lands required for:
  - Deep waterway navigation (locks, channels)
  - Operation of navigation infrastructure
- **Compensation** is paid to Ontario for these lands **except** for:
  - Lands already held or acquired by Ontario for the works.

> This creates a **mutual exchange of land rights** with **financial compensation** for any loss or disruption.

---

### **F. Indemnity Clauses (Protection from Third-Party Claims)**
- **Ontario indemnifies Canada** against claims from third parties arising from construction, operation, or maintenance of the works.
- **Exception**: No damages can arise **west of a line drawn due north and south through the most westerly point of Spencer Island**.
- This clause **does not apply** to claims west of that line.

- **Canada indemnifies Ontario** against claims arising from the construction of the **deep waterway**.

> These clauses protect both governments from liability due to third-party lawsuits, especially in sensitive border areas.

---

### **G. Ontario’s Obligations to Operate the Works**
- Ontario is required to:
  - Construct, maintain, and operate the works **concurrently** with U.S. complementary projects.
  - Comply fully with:
    - Orders or conditions from the **International Joint Commission**
    - Regulations from the **Governor General in Council** (e.g., for navigation or environmental protection)
- If Ontario fails to comply:
  - Canada may issue a **written notice** specifying the default.
  - If non-compliance persists, Canada may **take over operation** of the works or any part of them.
- **Exception**: If a dispute over compliance arises, it will be referred to an **arbitral tribunal** (see below), and Canada will **not intervene** during the arbitration.

---

### **H. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements**
- Ontario must:
  - **Maintain records** of flow and water levels in the International Rapids Section.
  - **Furnish certified copies** of these records to Canada.
  - **Calibrate** turbines, penstocks, sluices, and other water passages.
- Canada has the right to:
  - **Access the works freely**
  - **Measure discharge** from sluices, turbines, and other components
  - **Request plans, drawings, or technical information** from Ontario

> These provisions ensure **transparency, accountability, and data-sharing** between the two governments.

---

### **I. Ontario’s Right to Use HEP Commission Benefits**
- Ontario may allow the **Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario** to exercise any rights or benefits under the Agreement.
- This allows the Commission to manage and benefit from the power generated by the project.

---

### **J. Compensation for Land Use Changes**
- **Ontario is not entitled to compensation** for lands used for the works, even if they are part of the project, if the land is transferred to Canada.
- **Exception**: If Ontario had **previously notified Canada** of a proposed work location, and Canada later requires the land to be transferred for deep waterway development, Ontario is entitled to compensation for:
  - The land
  - The works
  - Losses or expenses related to the project
