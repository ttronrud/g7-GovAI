**Detailed Summary of the Government Property Traffic Act**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is formally titled the **Government Property Traffic Act** and may be cited accordingly. This legislation governs traffic management and enforcement on lands belonging to or occupied by **Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

---

### **2. Authority to Make Regulations**
The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Cabinet) has broad authority to make regulations to control traffic on Crown lands. These regulations may cover a wide range of traffic-related matters, including:

#### **a. Speed and Parking Controls**
- Regulations may specify **maximum speeds** for vehicles.
- Rules may govern **parking restrictions**, including prohibited zones, time limits, and vehicle types.

#### **b. Routes of Travel**
- Regulations can **prescribe designated routes** for vehicles, especially in sensitive or congested areas.

#### **c. One-Way Traffic, Obstruction, and Pedestrian Traffic**
- The Act allows for:
  - Designation of **one-way streets**.
  - Prohibitions against **obstructing traffic** (e.g., blocking lanes or intersections).
  - Rules to manage **pedestrian movement**, ensuring safety and orderly flow.

#### **d. Traffic Direction and Signage**
- Regulations may authorize the **direction of traffic flow** and the **erection of traffic signs** (e.g., speed limits, no entry, stop signs).

#### **e. Prohibition of Specific Vehicles or Activities**
- The Governor in Council may **prohibit certain vehicles** (e.g., trucks, motorcycles, or large commercial vehicles) from operating:
  - At specific times (e.g., during peak hours).
  - In specific locations (e.g., near schools or residential areas).
  - Under certain conditions (e.g., during emergencies or high-risk weather).

#### **f. Noise Restrictions**
- Regulations may **prohibit unnecessary noise** near buildings, particularly to protect residents from disturbances such as engine noise, honking, or loud equipment operation.

#### **g. Enforcement Powers**
- The Act empowers **authorized officers** (e.g., police, traffic officers, or designated officials) to:
  - Enforce the regulations.
  - Issue citations or warnings.
  - Conduct inspections or investigations.

#### **h. Penalties for Contravention**
- Violations of the regulations are punishable by:
  - A **fine not exceeding $500**.
  - A **term of imprisonment not exceeding six months**.
  - **Both** a fine and imprisonment may be imposed upon summary conviction (a type of quick trial without a jury).
- These penalties are **enforceable without the need for a full trial**, allowing for swift responses to traffic violations.

#### **i. Voluntary Payment and Driving Prohibitions**
- The Act provides for **voluntary payment of fines** by offenders, which may reduce or eliminate penalties.
- However, individuals who **contravene a regulation** may be **prohibited from driving a vehicle on Crown lands for up to one year**. This restriction applies regardless of whether the fine is paid.

---

### **3. Vehicle Classification and Regulation**
- The Governor in Council may **classify vehicles** based on:
  - Dimensions (size)
  - Design (e.g., type of vehicle)
  - Use (e.g., public transport, private, emergency)
  - Weight
  - Kind (e.g., passenger cars, trucks, trailers)
- Regulations may be made **specifically for one or more classes** of vehicles, allowing for tailored traffic controls (e.g., restricting heavy trucks from certain areas).

---

### **4. Liability of Vehicle Owners**
- If a vehicle is **operated or parked in violation** of a regulation, the **owner of the vehicle is liable** for the penalty, **unless**:
  - At the time of the violation, the vehicle was **not operated or parked by the owner**.
  - The vehicle was **not operated or parked with the owner’s consent**, either **express** (explicit) or **implied** (inferred from circumstances).
- **Important Exception**: Even if the owner did not operate or park the vehicle, the **person operating it is still liable** under the Act. This means that **no person who operates or parks a vehicle in violation is relieved of liability**, regardless of ownership.

> In other words: **The owner is liable**, and **the operator is personally liable** — even if they are not the owner.

---

### **5. Evidence of Crown Land Ownership**
To prove that a particular piece of land belongs to or is occupied by **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, the following **certificate** is admissible as **evidence** in any prosecution:

- A certificate signed by:
  - The **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**, or
  - A **Deputy, Assistant Deputy, or Acting Deputy** of that Minister (who has administrative responsibility for the land),
  - OR
  - An **officer or person having custody of the documents of title or other appropriate records**.

> **Key Provisions**:
- The certificate **does not require proof of the signer’s official status** (e.g., no need to verify the signature or title).
- The certificate is **sufficient evidence** on its own to establish that the land is Crown property or occupied by the Crown.
- No further evidence (e.g., land deeds or surveys) is required to establish ownership in a prosecution under this Act.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Traffic Order and Safety** | Ensures safe, efficient, and orderly movement of vehicles and pedestrians on Crown lands (e.g., national parks, government facilities, military zones, or federal infrastructure). |
| **Environmental and Community Protection** | Noise restrictions and parking rules help minimize disruption to nearby communities and natural environments. |
| **Enforcement Flexibility** | The broad regulatory powers allow the federal government to adapt traffic rules to changing needs, emergencies, or seasonal conditions. |
| **Accountability** | Clear liability rules ensure that both owners and operators are held responsible, promoting compliance. |
| **Simplified Legal Process** | The use of a single certificate to prove Crown ownership streamlines legal proceedings, reducing delays and costs in enforcement actions. |

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**
- The Act applies **only to lands belonging to or occupied by Her Majesty in right of Canada** — it does not extend to private land.
- It is a **regulatory framework**, not a standalone criminal law; it relies on secondary regulations (rules made by the Governor in Council) to define specific traffic controls.
- The power to impose fines and imprisonment is **summary**, meaning trials are generally fast and informal, which may limit due process for some individuals.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Government Property Traffic Act** is a comprehensive and flexible tool enabling the federal government to manage traffic on Crown lands effectively. It balances public safety, environmental protection, and administrative efficiency by allowing detailed regulation of vehicle movement, noise, parking, and enforcement. The Act ensures accountability through strict liability for owners and operators and simplifies legal proceedings through a streamlined mechanism for proving Crown land ownership.

This legislation is particularly relevant in areas such as:
- National parks and protected natural areas
- Government buildings and federal facilities
- Military installations
- Infrastructure projects on Crown land

It reflects a strong federal role in maintaining order and safety on public lands, while respecting the principle of accountability and legal clarity.
