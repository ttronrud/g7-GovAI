### **Detailed Summary of the *Indigenous Child and Family Services Act* (2023)**

The **Indigenous Child and Family Services Act** is a landmark piece of federal legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada in 2023, designed to address systemic inequities in child and family services affecting Indigenous children — First Nations, Inuit, and Métis — and to advance reconciliation, cultural continuity, and the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples. This Act is rooted in historical recognition of colonial harm, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, and international human rights obligations, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).

## **I. Context and Motivation**

The Act begins with a series of **"whereas" clauses** that establish the foundational reasons for its enactment:

1. **International Commitments**:
   - Canada has ratified the **UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)** and the **International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD)**.
   - The Government affirms its commitment to implementing the **UNDRIP**, which recognizes the rights of Indigenous peoples, including self-determination and cultural preservation.

2. **Historical Harm**:
   - Parliament recognizes the **legacy of residential schools**, which caused **intergenerational trauma** and deep structural harm to Indigenous families and communities.
   - It acknowledges the **over-representation of Indigenous women and girls** in child and family services systems, and the disruption these systems have caused to their lives.

3. **Principles of Reconciliation**:
   - The Act supports the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) Calls to Action**, specifically those calling for:
     - National standards for Indigenous child and family services.
     - Federal legislation to establish such standards.
     - Collaboration between federal, provincial, and Indigenous governments.
   - It affirms the **inherent right of self-determination**, including **jurisdiction over child and family services**.

4. **Cultural Diversity and Equity**:
   - Recognizes the **diversity of Indigenous peoples** in terms of laws, cultures, languages, traditions, histories, and governance.
   - Emphasizes the need to address the unique needs of **elders, youth, persons with disabilities, women, men, gender-diverse, and two-spirit individuals**.
   - Aims to **eliminate over-representation** of Indigenous children in child welfare systems and ensure **no service gaps**, whether on reserves or off.

5. **Partnership and Funding**:
   - Calls for **predictable, stable, sustainable, and needs-based funding** that upholds the principle of **substantive equality**.
   - Stresses **nation-to-nation, government-to-government, and Inuit-Crown relationships** based on respect, cooperation, and partnership.

## **III. Core Principles of the Act**

The Act is grounded in three **fundamental principles**, which govern all aspects of child and family services for Indigenous children:

### 1. **Best Interests of the Child**
- The **primary consideration** in all decisions involving Indigenous children.
- In cases of **child apprehension**, the best interests of the child are the **paramount consideration**.
- Factors to consider include:
  - Physical, emotional, and psychological safety and well-being.
  - Ongoing relationships with family and community.
  - Cultural identity, language, and connection to territory.
  - The child’s views and preferences (weighted by age and maturity).
  - Exposure to family violence and its impact.
  - Any legal proceedings or orders affecting the child.

> These factors are to be interpreted **in a manner consistent with Indigenous laws and customs**.

---

### 2. **Cultural Continuity**
- Cultural continuity is **essential to the well-being** of Indigenous children, families, and communities.
- Key elements:
  - Transmission of **languages, cultures, traditions, ceremonies, and knowledge**.
  - Children’s best interests are promoted when they reside with family and their culture is respected.
  - Services must **not promote assimilation** or destroy Indigenous culture.
  - Regional context (e.g., geography, community structure) must be considered.

---

### 3. **Substantive Equality**
- Ensures Indigenous children are treated **equally to non-Indigenous children** in access to services and decision-making.
- Specific obligations:
  - Rights of children with disabilities must be respected, enabling full participation in family and community life.
  - Children and family members must be able to have their **views and preferences considered** without discrimination based on sex, gender identity, or expression.
  - Indigenous governing bodies must be able to have their **views and preferences recognized** in decisions affecting their communities.
  - Jurisdictional disputes must **not create gaps** in services for Indigenous children.

---

## **IV. Key Provisions on Service Delivery**

### 1. **Notice Before Significant Measures**
- Before taking any significant action (e.g., apprehension, removal, placement), service providers must:
  - Provide **notice to the child’s parent, care provider**, and the **Indigenous governing body**.
  - Notice must **not contain personal information** about the child or family, except what is necessary to explain the action or required by the governing body’s coordination agreement.

### 2. **Right to Representation in Legal Proceedings**
- In civil proceedings related to child and family services:
  - The **child’s parent and care provider** have the right to make representations and have **party status**.
  - The **Indigenous governing body** also has the right to make representations — ensuring Indigenous voices are heard in legal processes.

### 3. **Priority of Preventive and Prenatal Services**
- **Preventive care** (e.g., parenting support, mental health, early intervention) is given **priority** over other services.
- **Prenatal services** that promote child well-being are prioritized to **prevent apprehension at birth**.

### 4. **Prohibition of Apprehension Based on Socio-Economic Status**
- A child **cannot be apprehended solely due to poverty, inadequate housing, or poor parental health** — unless immediate safety concerns exist.

### 5. **Mandatory Efforts to Maintain Family Residence**
- Before apprehending a child living with a parent or family member, the service provider must demonstrate they made **reasonable efforts** to keep the child with that person.

### 6. **Placement Priorities (in Order of Preference)**
The Act establishes a clear hierarchy for child placement, prioritizing family and cultural ties:

1. **With one of the child’s parents**  
2. **With another adult member of the child’s family**  
3. **With an adult from the same Indigenous group/community as the child**  
4. **With an adult from a different Indigenous group/community**  
5. **With any other adult**

> **Additional consideration**: The possibility of placing a child with siblings or other family members must be evaluated when determining placement.

> **Customary adoption practices** (e.g., traditional adoption, kinship care) must be respected and considered in placements.

### 7. **Ongoing Reassessment of Placements**
- If a child is not placed with a parent or family member, the placement must be **reassessed regularly** to ensure it remains consistent with the child’s best interests and emotional ties.

### 8. **Promotion of Attachment to Family**
- If a child is not placed with a family member, efforts must be made to **promote emotional and psychological attachment** to each member of the family.

## **V. Inherent Right of Self-Government**

A central and transformative feature of the Act is the **affirmation of Indigenous self-government** in child and family services:

- The **inherent right of self-determination** (recognized under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*) includes:
  - **Jurisdiction** over child and family services.
  - **Legislative authority** to create laws and regulations.
  - **Authority to administer and enforce** those laws.
  - The right to establish **dispute resolution mechanisms**.

> This means that Indigenous governing bodies can create their own laws and policies for child welfare, consistent with their cultural values and traditions.

---

## **VI. Coordination Agreements**

To ensure cooperation between Indigenous governments and federal/provincial authorities, the Act establishes a **coordination agreement framework**:

- An Indigenous governing body may request a coordination agreement with:
  - The **Minister of Indigenous Services**.
  - The **provincial governments** where the community is located.
- These agreements can cover:
  - Emergency services for child safety
