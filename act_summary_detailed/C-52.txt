**Detailed Summary of the *Currency Act***  
*(Cited as the Currency Act)*

---

### **Overview**
The *Currency Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the legal framework governing the **monetary system of Canada**, including the **definition of the currency unit**, the **legal tender status of coins and notes**, **regulations on counterfeit and unauthorized handling of currency**, **contractual obligations involving money**, and the **administration of the Exchange Fund Account**—a key instrument for managing Canada’s external monetary value and financial liquidity.

This Act provides clarity on how money is defined, how it functions legally, and how it is managed by the Government of Canada. It also contains provisions for **regulatory flexibility**, **government accountability**, and **international monetary equivalence**.

---

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definition of the Monetary Unit**
- **Monetary Unit**: The official currency of Canada is the **dollar**.
- **Denominations**: Money in Canada is expressed in **dollars and cents**, with **one cent equal to one hundredth of a dollar**.
- This establishes a clear, standardized monetary unit across all financial transactions and legal proceedings.

> *Note: This provision ensures uniformity in financial reporting and legal interpretation.*

---

### **2. Legal Tender Status of Coins and Notes**

#### **Section 7 – Current Coins**
A coin is considered **current** (and thus legal tender) if:
- It was issued under the authority of the **Royal Canadian Mint Act**, **or**
- It was issued by the **Crown in any province of Canada before Confederation** and was **current and legal tender in Canada immediately before October 15, 1952**.

> *Note: This recognizes historical pre-Confederation coins that were previously valid.*

**Exclusions**: Coins that are:
- **Bent, mutilated, or defaced**, or
- **Reduced in weight** (except by normal wear and tear)

are **not current** and cannot be used as legal tender.

#### **Section 7.1 – Current Notes**
A **banknote** is current if it was issued under the authority of the **Bank of Canada Act**.

> *Note: Only Bank of Canada-issued notes are valid legal tender.*

---

### **3. Legal Tender Limits for Coin Payments**

Despite being legal tender, **coins have limits on the amount of payment they can represent**, based on denomination:

| Denomination | Maximum Legal Tender Amount |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Two dollars or more (but ≤ ten dollars) | Up to **$40** |
| One dollar | Up to **$25** |
| Ten cents or more (but < $1) | Up to **$10** |
| Five cents | Up to **$5** |
| One cent | Up to **$0.25** |

**Special Rule for Coins > $10**:
- A tender of a coin valued over $10 may consist of **only one coin**.
- The legal tender value is **limited to the face value of that single coin**.

> *Purpose*: Prevents abuse of high-denomination coins (e.g., using a $50 coin to pay for a $100 bill).

#### **Section 7.2 – Consolidation of Payments**
If a person owes **multiple amounts** on the same day under various obligations, those amounts are **deemed one total amount** for the purpose of legal tender rules.

> *Example*: If someone owes $20 in rent and $30 in taxes on the same day, it is treated as a single $50 obligation.

> *This simplifies enforcement and avoids multiple tender limits being applied.*

### **4. Government Power to Call in Currency**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, by **order**, **call in**:
- Any coin currently valid under Section 7, or
- Any note currently valid under Section 7.1.

> *Effect*: Once called in, such coins or notes are **no longer considered current** and are **not legal tender**.

> *Purpose*: Enables the government to manage monetary supply during economic stress, inflation, or currency devaluation.

---

### **5. Redemption of Coins**

- The Governor in Council may make **regulations** allowing the **Minister of Finance** to **redeem coins** that were or have been current in Canada.
- All **payments for redemption**, including associated costs, must be made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, upon **Ministerial authorization**.
- All proceeds from the **issuance of coins** must be paid into the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that the government maintains control over coin issuance and revenue generation.

---

### **6. Counterfeit Coin Handling**

Every **revenue officer** (e.g., customs officer) must:
- **Cut, break, or deface** any **counterfeit coin** received in payment of a government obligation.
- **Forward the counterfeit coin immediately** to the **Minister of Finance**.

> *Purpose*: Prevents fraud and ensures accountability in public financial transactions.

---

### **7. Prohibition on Unauthorized Use of Coins**

- **No person** may:
  - **Melt down**, **break up**, or
  - Use **otherwise than as currency**
  any coin that is **current and legal tender** in Canada — **except with a license from the Minister**.

  - A **fine of up to $250**, or
  - **Imprisonment for up to 12 months**, or
  - Both.

- Made, executed, or carried out **in the currency of Canada** (i.e., dollars and cents).

**Exceptions**:

- Transactions in:
  - A **currency of a foreign country**, or
  - A **unit of account defined in terms of multiple currencies** (e.g., USD/EUR hybrid)

are **exempt** from the requirement to use Canadian dollars — **unless otherwise required by law**.

> *Purpose*: Balances modernization with respect for historical agreements and international trade practices.

---

### **9. Constitutional and Legal Interpretation**

Any sum mentioned in:
- The **Constitution Acts (1867–1982)**, or
- Any **Act of Parliament**

that is stated in **dollars and cents** is to be interpreted as being in the **currency of Canada**, **unless otherwise specified**.

> *Purpose*: Ensures consistency in legal and constitutional references to money.

Despite any other law, where a law, treaty, convention, contract, or agreement involving Canada refers to:
- A **foreign currency**,  
- A **multi-currency unit**,  
- **Gold**, or  
- A **combination** of these,

The **Governor in Council** may make **regulations** to:
