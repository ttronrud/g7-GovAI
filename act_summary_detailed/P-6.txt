**Detailed Summary of the *Pension Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Pension Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the framework for providing **pension, compensation, and allowances** to members of the Canadian Armed Forces (the "forces"), their dependants, and survivors in recognition of **military service-related disabilities or deaths**. The Act is designed to uphold the **government’s constitutional obligation** to provide compensation to those who have suffered harm due to military service, ensuring that such benefits are accessible, fair, and generously interpreted.

---

## **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Liberal Construction**  
   - The Act is to be **liberally construed and interpreted** to fulfill the recognized obligation of the Government of Canada to compensate members of the forces and their dependants for disabilities or deaths resulting from military service.  
   - This principle ensures that the Act is applied in a way that supports the **intended purpose** — protecting veterans and their families from financial hardship due to service-related injuries or loss.

2. **Equality and Fairness**  
   - **Male and female members of the forces** enjoy **equal status, rights, and obligations** under the Act.  
   - This reflects Canada’s commitment to gender equality in veteran benefits.

3. **Fair and Expedient Decision-Making**  
   - The Minister is required to:
     - Draw **every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant**.
     - Accept **uncontradicted, credible evidence** presented by the applicant or pensioner.
     - Resolve **any doubt in favour of the applicant** when assessing whether a case has been established.
   - Decisions must be made **informally and expeditiously**, balancing fairness with administrative efficiency.

## **Eligibility for Awards**

### **1. Disability Pensions**  
- A pension is awarded to a member of the forces **if they suffer a disability** resulting from:
  - Injury or disease incurred during **WWI, WWII, Korean War**, or **special duty service**.
  - Aggravation of an existing injury or disease during such service.
- The pension is based on **rates set in Schedule I** (basic and additional pension amounts).
- **No deduction** is made from the degree of disability for pre-service conditions **unless**:
  - The pre-existing condition is already being compensated via a pension, or
  - It was **obvious or recorded on medical examination before enlistment**.

> 📌 **Exception**: A pension is **not denied** simply because no "substantial disability" existed at discharge — the Act recognizes that service-related conditions may develop later.

### **2. Death Benefits**  
- A pension is awarded upon the **death of a member of the forces** if the death resulted from:
  - Injury, disease, or aggravation of injury/disease incurred during service in WWI, WWII, Korean War, or special duty service.
- Rates are set in **Schedule II**.
- Benefits are paid to the **surviving spouse or common-law partner**.

> ✅ **Note**: The Act ensures that **even if a member was discharged with no apparent disability**, benefits may still be granted if a service-related condition emerged later.

### **3. Treatment During Discharge**  
- If a member is **passed directly to the Department for treatment** upon retirement or discharge, a pension is paid for **any disability or death incurred during that treatment**, regardless of whether it was directly service-related.

## **Exclusions and Limitations**

### **1. Application Restrictions (Post-April 1, 2006)**  
No award is payable under this Act for applications made **after April 1, 2006**, unless:

- The application relates to a **disability already granted** or under **section 36** (for such disability);
- The death occurred **before April 1, 2006**, or resulted from a service-related injury/disease (including aggravation);
- The injury/disease was **incurred during service** in:
  - The Canadian Forces **on or before April 1, 1947**, or
  - During service in the **Korean War**;
- The aggravation is attributable to service in the above periods;
- The injury/disease is **inseparable from a previously granted pension** (as determined under the *Veterans Well-being Act*);
- The application is made **under section 38 by a pensioner**.

> 🔍 This restriction reflects a **policy shift** to limit claims to those with clear historical ties to service prior to 2006, ensuring that claims are based on established, verifiable service periods.

### **2. Compensation for Prisoner of War Service**  
- Compensation is available for time spent in **enemy captivity or escaping from captivity**.
- This provision is **not subject to the April 1, 2006 restriction**, meaning applications for **pre-2006 captivity periods** are still eligible.

> 💡 This exception recognizes the unique and often traumatic nature of prisoner-of-war experiences.

## **Pension Adjustments and Changes**

- If a member’s **degree of actual disability changes** after receiving a pension (due to new medical findings or worsening condition), the pension is:
  - **Increased, decreased, or discontinued** to reflect the new level of disability.
- **Limitation**: If the member is receiving pensions for multiple types of service (e.g., WWI, WWII, Korean War), the **total pension cannot exceed** the amount corresponding to the **total actual disability** from all such services.

---

## **Spousal and Survivor Benefits**

- If a member has an **additional pension** for a spouse or common-law partner who is living with them:
  - The pension **continues for one year** after the partner’s death.

  - Decide on all matters related to:
    - Awarding, increasing, decreasing, suspending, or canceling pensions.

## **Trust and Property Administration**
