### **Detailed Summary of the *Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2001***

The *Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2001* is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation that enables the implementation of bilateral income tax treaties (conventions or agreements) between Canada and several foreign countries. The Act ensures that these treaties are legally binding in Canada, providing clarity, consistency, and enforceability in the application of tax rules to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion.

The Act is structured as a single legislative framework that contains **separate parts** corresponding to each bilateral tax treaty or agreement between Canada and a different country. Each part establishes the legal status, definitions, and procedural mechanisms for applying the respective treaty within Canadian tax law.

## **1. General Provisions of the Act**

### **Title and Citation**
- The Act is titled **"Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2001"**.
- Each part of the Act is separately cited with a specific name (e.g., *Canada — Slovenia Income Tax Convention Act, 2001*), reflecting the bilateral relationship.

### **Definition of "Convention" or "Agreement"**
- In each part, the term **"Convention"** or **"Agreement"** refers to a formal treaty or agreement between the Government of Canada and the government of a specific foreign country (e.g., Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Senegal, Czech Republic, Slovakia).
- These treaties are typically designed to:
  - Avoid double taxation of income and capital gains;
  - Prevent tax evasion through fiscal avoidance;
  - Clarify tax residency and source rules;
  - Define taxable events and tax credits.

### **Legal Force and Duration**
- The Convention or Agreement is **approved and has the force of law in Canada** during the period it is in force under its own terms.
- This means that once a treaty is ratified and enters into force, it becomes part of Canadian law for the duration specified in the treaty itself.

### **Hierarchy of Legal Rules**
- **Precedence Rule**: In the event of inconsistency between:
  - The provisions of the relevant Part or Convention and any other Canadian law,
  - The Convention and the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*,
  
  → The **provisions of the Part and the Convention prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.

- However, if there is a conflict between the **Convention and the Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act**, then **the Interpretation Act takes precedence**. This ensures consistency in how tax conventions are interpreted across all treaties.

### **Regulatory Authority**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** may issue regulations to:
  - Implement the Convention or Agreement;
  - Clarify or interpret its provisions;
  - Provide practical guidance for tax authorities and taxpayers.

### **Public Notification Requirement**
- The **Minister of Finance** must publish in the *Canada Gazette*:
  - The date on which the Convention or Agreement **enters into force**;
  - The date on which it **ceases to have effect**;
  - Within **60 days** of either event.

> This ensures transparency and allows taxpayers, legal professionals, and other stakeholders to be aware of changes in tax treatment due to treaty implementation.
