### **Detailed Summary of the *Grassy Narrows and Islington Indian Bands Mercury Pollution Claims Settlement Act***

---

#### **1. Purpose and Background**

The *Grassy Narrows and Islington Indian Bands Mercury Pollution Claims Settlement Act* is a federal statute enacted in Canada to **formally implement and give legal effect** to a comprehensive settlement agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of Ontario, Reed Inc., Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd., and two First Nations communities—the **Grassy Narrows Indian Band (GNIB)** and the **Islington Indian Band (IIB)**.

This Act was created in response to decades of environmental contamination caused by the **discharge of mercury and other pollutants** into the **English and Wabigoon River systems**—critical watersheds that support the traditional way of life, food sources, and cultural practices of the two Bands.

Key historical context:
- Mercury pollution was first identified in **1969**, primarily due to industrial discharges from pulp and paper mills operated by **Reed Inc.** and **Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd.**
- The contamination led to **elevated levels of methylmercury** in fish and other aquatic life, which entered the food chain and had severe **health consequences** for Indigenous communities, including neurological damage, developmental delays, and death.
- The pollution has had **long-term and intergenerational impacts** on the social, economic, and physical well-being of Band members.

---

#### **2. Core Objectives of the Agreement (as codified in the Act)**

The settlement aims to:
- **Acknowledge and address historical harm** caused by industrial pollution.
- **Provide financial compensation and health-related benefits** to affected individuals and communities.
- **Establish institutions and mechanisms** to support long-term health and well-being.
- **Eliminate future legal claims** related to the pollution, thereby providing closure and stability to the Bands.

---

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Act**

##### **A. Approval and Validity of the Agreement**
- The **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)** signed in November 1985 (and later amended by the Escrow Agreement) is formally **approved, declared valid, and given legal force** under this Act.
- The MOA was tabled in Parliament and recorded as document #331-7/43, ensuring transparency and legislative accountability.

> **Note**: The Escrow Agreement governs the financial management and disbursement of funds under the settlement, with oversight and approval by the Bands and federal authorities.

---

##### **B. Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Band"** refers to either the **Grassy Narrows Indian Band** or the **Islington Indian Band**.
- **"Agreement"** includes both the original MOA and its amendments (especially the Escrow Agreement).
- **"Member"** is defined broadly: any person registered as an **Indian under the *Indian Act*** who was **customarily resident on a Band’s reserve before October 1, 1985**, and who qualifies under **paragraph 1(b) of Schedule A** to the Agreement.

> This ensures that individuals with historical ties to the Bands—particularly those affected by health or economic harms—are included in the benefits.

---

##### **C. Abolition of All Legal Rights of Action**
- **All existing and future claims** (past, present, or future) by the Bands or any member of the Bands—including their estates—**are extinguished** in respect of claims arising from mercury pollution and related environmental harms.
- This is **subject to exceptions** specified in **sections 1.16 and 2.3 of the Agreement**, which may preserve certain rights (e.g., for claims involving fraud, misrepresentation, or non-compliance with environmental laws).

> This provision provides **legal closure** and prevents ongoing litigation, allowing the Bands to move forward without the burden of future lawsuits.

---

##### **D. Rights and Benefits Under the Agreement**
Upon the abolition of claims, the beneficiaries (Band members and the Bands themselves) receive the following rights, privileges, and benefits:
- **Direct financial payments** to each Band.
- **Establishment of the Grassy Narrows and Islington Bands Mercury Disability Board** – a governing body to oversee health and disability-related matters.
- **Establishment of the Mercury Disability Fund** – a dedicated fund to provide financial support to members affected by mercury-related health conditions.
- **Payment of benefits** to Band members suffering from mercury-related disabilities or health impacts.
- **Access to health services** under provincial insurance plans (see below).

---

##### **E. Treatment of Settlement Funds and Property under the Indian Act**
To ensure that settlement funds are used appropriately and not restricted by existing laws:
- All **moneys paid or payable** to a Band under the Agreement, and any **personal property purchased with those funds**, are **deemed personal property given under an agreement between the Band and Her Majesty**.
- **Section 90 of the Indian Act**, which restricts the use of Band funds for certain purposes, **does not apply** to these funds.
- **Subsections 90(2) and (3)** of the Indian Act (which govern the use of property in trust or for non-Indian purposes) **do not apply** to settlement assets.
- **Paragraph 41(a) of Schedule A** to the Agreement (which relates to certain types of payments) is also exempted from the Indian Act’s restrictions.

> This ensures that the Bands have **full autonomy** to manage settlement funds for health, disability, and community development.

---

##### **F. Health Service Recognition**
- Any **medical examination, test, or report** conducted by a medical practitioner for a Band member **pursuant to the Agreement** is deemed an **insured health service** under the **Canada Health Act**.
- This means such services are **covered under Ontario’s public health care insurance plan**, ensuring that affected individuals receive necessary medical care without additional out-of-pocket costs.

> This provision is critical in addressing the **long-term health impacts** of methylmercury exposure, particularly in children and pregnant women.

---

##### **G. Income and Benefit Protection**
- **Benefits paid under the Agreement are not considered income** for tax purposes under any other Act of Parliament.
- No other government benefit (federal or provincial) is **reduced or diminished** because of the receipt of Agreement-related payments.

> This protects the financial stability of Band members and prevents double-dipping or reduced access to other social programs.

---

##### **H. Regulatory Authority**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **regulations** necessary to:
  - Implement the Agreement.
  - Clarify or enforce its provisions.
  - Ensure compliance with financial, administrative, or operational requirements.

> This allows for **flexible, responsive governance** while maintaining consistency with the original agreement.

---

##### **I. Funding Mechanism**
- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** (Canada’s primary source of government revenue) will provide the **necessary funds** to meet Canada’s monetary obligations under the Agreement.
- This ensures that the federal government fulfills its financial commitments without requiring new taxation or budgetary reallocation.

---

##### **J. Enactment and Effective Date**
- The Act comes into force on a **day to be fixed by proclamation**.
- It was **enacted on July 28, 1986**, as indicated in the note (SI/86-149), making it one of the earliest legislative responses to Indigenous environmental harm in Canada.

---

#### **4. Significance and Impact**

This Act represents a **landmark moment in Canadian environmental justice and Indigenous rights**. It:

- **Acknowledges the harm** caused by industrial pollution to Indigenous communities.
- **Provides tangible, long-term support** through financial compensation, health services, and institutional oversight.
- **Sets a precedent** for how governments can resolve environmental and health claims through negotiated settlements, especially when historical injustices are involved.
- **Strengthens the self-determination** of First Nations by enabling them to manage their own health and welfare programs.

It also reflects a shift from **reactive legal disputes** to **proactive, restorative justice**, recognizing that environmental harm is not just an ecological issue but a **social, cultural, and intergenerational one**.

---

#### **5. Limitations and Criticisms**

While the Act provides significant benefits, it has also faced criticism:
- **Abolition of claims** may be seen as a **loss of legal recourse** for future environmental or health violations.
- The **exclusion of certain claims** (e.g., those involving fraud or environmental negligence) may leave gaps in accountability.
- The **long-term effectiveness** of the Mercury Disability Fund and the Board remains dependent on ongoing funding and administrative capacity.
- Some members of the Bands have expressed concerns about **lack of transparency or community control** over how funds are used.

Despite these concerns, the Act remains a foundational piece of legislation in the history of **Indigenous environmental and health rights in Canada**.
