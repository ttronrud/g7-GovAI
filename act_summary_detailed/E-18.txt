**Detailed Summary of the Export Act**

---

### **General Overview**

The *Export Act* is a Canadian statute that grants the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Minister of Finance) broad authority to impose **export duties** under specific conditions. The Act is designed to protect Canadian industries and respond to international trade practices—particularly when foreign countries impose import duties on Canadian goods. It also includes provisions related to the export of certain metals, ores, and timber, as well as strict controls on the export of intoxicating liquor to prohibited destinations.

The Act may be cited as the *Export Act*, and its provisions are both reactive (in response to foreign duties) and proactive (in regulating certain exports).

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Export Duty on Timber and Pulpwood (Subsection 1)**

**Trigger:**  
If any country imposes an import duty on any of the following **enumerated timber products** when imported from Canada:

- Pine  
- Douglas fir  
- Spruce  
- Fir balsam  
- Cedar  
- Hemlock  
- Logs and pulpwood  

👉 The **Governor in Council** may by **proclamation** impose an **export duty** on these products exported from Canada to that country.

**Rate Limitations:**

- The **maximum export duty** is **$3 per thousand feet, board measure**.
- If logs or pulpwood are exported in **shorter lengths than nine feet**, a **rate per cord** may be applied instead.
- The **cord-based rate** must not exceed the **equivalent value** of $3 per thousand feet, board measure.

> This provision allows Canada to counteract foreign import duties by imposing a reciprocal export duty, effectively balancing trade pressures.

### **2. Export Duties on Ores and Metals**

The Governor in Council may impose export duties on specific metals and ores under the following conditions:

| Metal/Ore | Export Duty Limit |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Nickel** (in matte, ore, or crude form) | Not exceeding **10 cents per pound** |
| **Copper** (in matte or ore containing nickel) | Not exceeding **2 cents per pound** |
| **Ores containing copper or other metals (except nickel or lead)** | Not exceeding **15% of the value of the ore** |
| **Lead ores and lead/silver ores** | An export duty on the **lead content** equal to the **excess** of the foreign import duty on lead (in bars or pig lead) over the duty on lead contained in the ore. |

> This provision enables Canada to protect domestic mining industries and prevent foreign countries from gaining an unfair advantage through preferential treatment of lead or copper in imported ore forms.

**Key Features:**
- The duties are **proportional** and **value-based** for most metals.
- The **lead-specific rule** is particularly significant: if a foreign country imposes a higher duty on **pig lead or bars** than on **lead in ores**, Canada can impose a duty on the lead content to offset that difference.

---

### **3. Timing of Duty Application**

> Export duties declared under this Act become **chargeable only after the publication of the proclamation**.

This ensures that the duty is not applied retroactively and provides clarity on when the financial obligation begins.

---

### **4. Flexibility: Removal and Reimposition of Duties**

> The Governor in Council may **remove and re-impose** any export duty by proclamation.

This gives the government flexibility to adjust duties in response to changing trade conditions, economic shifts, or policy changes.

---

### **5. Prohibition of Certain Exports via Regulation**

The Governor in Council may, by **regulation**, prohibit the export of:

1. **Petroleum** in its **crude or partly manufactured state**  
2. **Pulpwood** of a specific:
   - Variety  
   - Kind  
   - Place of origin  
   - Identification or ownership details  
   - Production particulars  

> This allows the government to protect strategic resources (e.g., crude oil) or safeguard national interests (e.g., environmental, economic, or security concerns) by restricting exports of sensitive materials.

---

### **6. Regulatory Process and Parliamentary Oversight**

Every regulation made under this Act must:

- Be **laid before both Houses of Parliament** within **15 days** of the session following its enactment.
- Remain in force **until the day immediately after the prorogation** of that session.
- **Stay in force unless approved by resolution** of both Houses of Parliament during that session.

> This ensures **parliamentary accountability** and public scrutiny of export restrictions, preventing arbitrary or long-term bans without democratic approval.

---

### **7. Restrictions on Export of Intoxicating Liquor**

**Prohibition on Export to Prohibited Countries:**

Despite any other law, **no intoxicating liquor** may be:

- Released or removed from storage (e.g., warehouses)  
- Cleared for export  
- Entered for export  

**If the liquor is destined for delivery in a country where the importation of liquor is prohibited by law.**

> This provision prevents Canada from exporting alcohol to nations where such imports are banned—protecting both international law and public health standards.

---

#### **Definition of "Intoxicating Liquor"**

Includes:
- Spirituous or malt liquors  
- Wine  
- Any combination of drinks that is intoxicating  
- Mixed drinks that contain intoxicating components (e.g., cocktails with alcohol)

> This broad definition ensures comprehensive coverage of all forms of alcohol.

---

#### **Governor in Council’s Authority**

The Governor in Council may issue **orders and regulations** to give effect to the above provisions, including implementing enforcement mechanisms.
