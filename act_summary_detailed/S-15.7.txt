**Detailed Summary of the *Split Lake Cree First Nation Flooded Land Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Split Lake Cree First Nation Flooded Land Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. The Act formally recognizes and governs the legal and financial arrangements related to the flooding of land in the Split Lake area, which occurred as part of a major hydroelectric development project in Manitoba.

The Act is designed to clarify the status of funds and land transfers associated with the original **Flood Agreement of 1977** and the subsequent **1992 Agreement** between the Canadian and Manitoba governments, the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, and the Split Lake Cree First Nation. It ensures that the rights, obligations, and financial arrangements under these agreements are respected and legally enforceable, while also addressing specific issues related to Indigenous status, Indian Act provisions, and dispute resolution.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Agreement"**  
   Refers to the **1992 Agreement** concluded between:
   - Her Majesty in right of Canada  
   - Her Majesty in right of Manitoba  
   - The Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board  
   - The Split Lake Cree First Nation  

   This agreement was reached through negotiations to comprehensively implement the original Flood Agreement and provides the legal framework for the management, transfer, and use of land and funds related to the flooding of Split Lake area lands.

2. **"Flood Agreement"**  
   Refers to the **1977 Agreement** between:
   - Her Majesty in right of Canada  
   - Her Majesty in right of Manitoba  
   - The Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board  
   - The Northern Flood Committee, Inc.  

   This original agreement authorized the flooding of certain lands in northern Manitoba to create reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation, affecting the traditional territories of several First Nations, including the Split Lake Cree First Nation.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Implications**

#### **1. Exemption from Indian Act Definitions (Non-Indian Money)**  
> *"Amounts paid to the Split Lake Cree First Nation pursuant to the agreement, whether before or after the coming into force of this Act, are not Indian moneys within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act."*

- **Purpose**: This provision explicitly excludes payments made under the 1977 Flood Agreement and the 1992 Agreement from being classified as "Indian money" under **section 2(1) of the Indian Act**.
- **Significance**: 
  - This is crucial because "Indian money" is subject to strict regulatory controls under the Indian Act, including restrictions on how such funds can be used, spent, or transferred.
  - By excluding these payments, the Act ensures that the funds received by the Split Lake Cree First Nation are not subject to those restrictions, thereby allowing greater flexibility in financial management and use of funds for community development, infrastructure, or economic projects.

#### **2. Transfer of Funds to the Split Lake Cree First Nation**  
> *"As soon as practicable after the coming into force of this Act, all amounts collected, received or held by Her Majesty in right of Canada for the use or benefit of the Split Lake Cree First Nation pursuant to the agreement shall be transferred to the Split Lake Cree First Nation in accordance with the agreement."*

- **Purpose**: Ensures that any funds held by the federal government (or its agencies) on behalf of the Split Lake Cree First Nation are promptly transferred to the First Nation.
- **Implementation**: The transfer must occur as soon as practicable after the Act comes into force, and must follow the terms and conditions outlined in the 1992 Agreement.
- **Impact**: This strengthens financial autonomy and accountability, ensuring that the First Nation has direct access to funds intended for its benefit.

#### **3. Exemption from Section 35(4) of the Indian Act**  
> *"Subsection 35(4) of the Indian Act does not apply in respect of any amount paid, whether before or after the coming into force of this Act, to the Split Lake Cree First Nation pursuant to the agreement."*

- **Background**: Section 35(4) of the Indian Act generally prohibits the use of Indian money for certain purposes (e.g., for non-Indigenous or non-Indigenous-related activities), and may restrict how funds are distributed.
- **Effect of this provision**: The funds in question are exempt from such restrictions, allowing the Split Lake Cree First Nation to use the money for a broader range of purposes—such as education, health, housing, or economic development—without being constrained by the Indian Act’s limitations.

#### **4. Exemption from Section 36 of the Indian Act (Land Ownership)**  
> *"Where land is held or transferred pursuant to the agreement, section 36 of the Indian Act does not apply in respect of that land if the holder or transferee of the land, or any subsequent holder or transferee of the land, is not Her Majesty in right of Canada."*

- **Background**: Section 36 of the Indian Act governs the ownership and transfer of land held by or on behalf of First Nations. It typically requires that land held by a First Nation be in the name of Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- **Effect of this provision**: 
  - If land is transferred or held by a private individual, a corporation, or an unincorporated body (e.g., a community group), and not by the Crown, then the restrictions under section 36 do not apply.
  - This allows the Split Lake Cree First Nation to hold land in private or community-owned forms without triggering the Crown’s ownership requirements under the Indian Act.
- **Significance**: This provision promotes land ownership flexibility and supports community-led development, land-based economic initiatives, or land use planning that may not involve direct Crown ownership.

#### **5. Claim Rights Under the Agreement**  
> *"A claim provided for by both the Flood Agreement and the agreement may be exercised by..."*

- **Eligible Claimants**:
  1. A **member** of the Split Lake Cree First Nation  
  2. The **council** of the Split Lake Cree First Nation  
  3. A **body corporate or unincorporated association**:
     - Incorporated or established by the council  
     - Whose shareholders or members are **all or substantially all members** of the Split Lake Cree First Nation  

- **Restriction**: Claims must be exercised **in accordance with the agreement** (i.e., the 1992 Agreement).
- **Purpose**: This ensures that claim rights (such as compensation, land entitlements, or access rights) are accessible to the community and its members, while maintaining the integrity of the original agreement and preventing misuse or arbitrary claims.

#### **6. Dispute Resolution via Manitoba Arbitration Laws**  
> *"Except as otherwise provided in the agreement, the legislation of Manitoba relating to arbitration applies in respect of any dispute between the parties to the agreement that, under the terms of the agreement, is to be settled by way of arbitration."*

- **Purpose**: Establishes a clear and predictable process for resolving disputes arising from the 1992 Agreement or the 1977 Flood Agreement.
- **Key Point**: If the agreement specifies that a dispute should be settled by arbitration, then the applicable **Manitoba arbitration laws** will govern the process.
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides a neutral, fair, and accessible forum for resolving conflicts.
  - Avoids the need for costly and time-consuming litigation in federal or provincial courts.
  - Respects the negotiated terms of the agreement and promotes peaceful, community-based conflict resolution.
