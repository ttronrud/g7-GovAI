#### **General Rule for Classification**
- Imported goods are classified under a **tariff item** based on the **General Rules for Interpretation of the Harmonized System (HS)** and **Canadian Rules** (as set out in the schedule).
- Classification must follow the **Harmonized System (HS)** and its **Explanatory Notes** and **Compendium of Classification Opinions** (published by the World Customs Organization).

  - Imported under a permit issued under **Section 8.3 of the Export and Import Permits Act**, and
  - Comply with the permit’s conditions.

> This ensures that access commitments (e.g., quotas or trade agreements) are strictly enforced and not misused.

### **4. Application of Customs Duties**

#### **Duty Calculation**
- **Percentage-based duties**: Calculated in accordance with **Section 44 of the Customs Act**.
- **Weight-based duties**: Calculated on the **net weight** of goods, unless otherwise specified.

> This ensures consistency and fairness in duty assessment, particularly for bulk or commodity goods.

#### **Duty Rates and Treatments**
- The **List of Tariff Provisions** (in the schedule) is the central document that:
  - Lists tariff items (with 8-digit HS codes)
  - Specifies duty rates
  - Identifies applicable trade agreements
- The **List of Countries** (also in the schedule) specifies which countries are eligible for which tariff treatments.

#### **Minister’s Authority**
- The **Minister of Finance** may, by order, amend the **List of Tariff Provisions** to:
  - Change a tariff item number or description
  - Add, repeal, or replace a tariff item
  - **Only if** the amendment does **not affect the rate of customs duty** applicable to the goods.

> This protects the integrity of duty rates while allowing flexibility in classification.

#### **Governor in Council’s Authority**
- On the **recommendation of the Minister**, the Governor in Council may amend the schedule (excluding tariff items 9898.00.00 or 9899.00.00) to:

  2. Implement changes to **international trade agreements** Canada is party to;
  3. Reflect **new trade commitments or arrangements** extending benefits from existing agreements.

> This ensures Canada remains aligned with international standards and evolving trade practices.

#### **Reduction of Duties**
- The Governor in Council may reduce customs duties on goods from a country **if**:
  - It is compensation for concessions granted by that country or another country;
  - Required by Canada’s international obligations; or
  - Required to compensate for actions taken under specific provisions (e.g., anti-dumping, countervailing duties, or permit conditions).

> These reductions are subject to conditions in the order and may be **retroactive** (effective before the order is made, but only for periods after the Act’s coming into force).
