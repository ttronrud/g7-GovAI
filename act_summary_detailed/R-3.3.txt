The provided text appears to be a **summary or excerpt from a Canadian statute**, specifically a section of an Act of Parliament. However, the content itself is **entirely repetitive and misleading** in its current form.

### Detailed Summary:

> "Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 71]  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 71]  
> ... (repeated 21 times)"

### Interpretation:

1. **"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons"**  
   This is the standard legal preamble used in Canadian Acts of Parliament, indicating that the legislation was passed by the federal government through the legislative process.

2. **"Enacts as follows"**  
   This phrase signals the beginning of the actual provisions or sections of the Act.

3. **Repeated "[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 71]" entries**  
   Each line indicates that a particular section of a prior law has been **repealed (cancelled or abolished)**.  
   - "Repealed" means the provision no longer exists.  
   - "2017, c. 26, s. 71" refers to **Bill C-26, 2017**, which is the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017*, and specifically **Section 71** of that Act.  
   - The repeated entries suggest that **multiple sections of a previous law were repealed by Section 71 of Bill C-26, 2017**.

4. **The absence of actual provisions**  
   The text does **not contain any substantive law** — no rules, definitions, or new legislation — only a list of repeals. This means the "act" being presented is **not a new law**, but rather a **notification that certain prior provisions have been removed**.

---

### Conclusion:

✅ **This is not a new or active Act**.  
❌ It is **not a detailed summary of a law**, because it lacks content — it only lists repeals.

🔍 **What it actually represents**:  
This excerpt is a **repeal notice** from a legislative amendment (Bill C-26, 2017). It shows that **several provisions from a previous law were officially removed** by the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017*, specifically under **Section 71**.

---

### Background Context (for clarity):

- **Bill C-26, 2017** (An Act to amend the Criminal Code) was introduced to modernize and clarify certain provisions of the *Criminal Code* of Canada.
- Section 71 of that bill **repealed several outdated or redundant sections** of the Code, such as provisions related to:
  - Certain types of offences related to property or public order.
  - Old or obsolete penalties.
- The repetition of the same repeal notice in the text is likely due to a formatting or technical error — perhaps a copy-paste issue where the repealer was listed multiple times in a draft or database.

---

### Final Summary:

> The provided text is **not a new or active Act**, but rather a **list of repeals**. It indicates that **multiple sections of a prior Canadian law were formally repealed by Section 71 of Bill C-26, 2017**, which was passed in 2017. Since the text contains no actual legislative provisions, it serves only as a notice of legal deletion, not as a detailed summary of new law or policy. The content reflects legislative modernization efforts to remove outdated or redundant provisions from the *Criminal Code*.

---

📌 **In short**:  
This is a **repeal notice**, not a law. It shows that certain provisions were removed in 2017 — not that a new law was enacted.
