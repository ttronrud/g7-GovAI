**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Commercial Corporation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Commercial Corporation Act* establishes the **Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)** as a federal corporation designed to support Canada’s international trade and economic development. It provides a legal framework for the creation, governance, operations, funding, and accountability of the Corporation, enabling it to act as an agent of the Government of Canada in facilitating trade and commerce between Canada and other nations.

This Act is a key instrument in Canada’s foreign trade policy, allowing the federal government to use a dedicated commercial entity to manage imports, exports, and other trade-related activities without directly engaging in commercial operations through government departments.
