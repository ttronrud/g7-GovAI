**Detailed Summary of the *Financial Advisors Association of Canada Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Financial Advisors Association of Canada Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada on June 12, 2003. Its primary purpose is to **legalize and authorize the amalgamation** of two existing professional associations — the *Canadian Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors (CAIFA)* and the *Canadian Association of Financial Planners (CAFP)* — into a single, unified organization named **The Financial Advisors Association of Canada (FAAC)**.  

This Act fills a legal gap by creating a statutory framework that enables such a merger without relying on existing general laws, which did not previously provide a mechanism for the amalgamation of corporations in this context. It establishes the FAAC as a **non-profit, non-share capital corporation** with specific powers, objectives, and governance structures to serve the interests of financial advisors and consumers.
