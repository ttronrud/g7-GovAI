**Detailed Summary of the Act on the Resumption of Operation of the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River**

---

### **Background and Context**

The act addresses a critical national and global health emergency caused by the temporary shutdown of the **National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor** at Chalk River, Ontario. This reactor is the **primary source of medical isotopes** in Canada and plays a vital role in the production of essential radiopharmaceuticals used in diagnosing and treating diseases such as cancer, heart conditions, and neurological disorders.

The shutdown was initiated for **scheduled maintenance**, but it has been prolonged due to **regulatory requirements** related to the reactor’s safety systems. Specifically, **Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)**, the operator of the NRU reactor, is legally prohibited from resuming operations until it complies with certain conditions in its licence under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*—particularly those concerning the **installation of seismically qualified motor starters** on the heavy water pumps and their **connection to the emergency power supply**.

These safety conditions were introduced to ensure the reactor can withstand seismic events and maintain critical safety functions during emergencies. However, the failure to meet these conditions has resulted in a **serious shortage of medical isotopes** in Canada and internationally, threatening patient care and public health.

### **Key Provisions of the Act**

#### **1. Temporary Resumption of Reactor Operation**
- The Act authorizes **Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)** to **resume and continue the operation** of the NRU reactor at Chalk River for a **period of 120 days** after the coming into force of this legislation.
- This authorization is **explicitly granted despite** the existing licence conditions under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* related to:
  - Seismically qualified motor starters on heavy water pumps
  - Connection to the emergency power supply

> This means that AECL is legally permitted to restart the reactor even though it has not yet fulfilled these specific safety requirements, which would normally be a prerequisite for operation.

#### **2. Safety Requirement for Resumption**
- AECL may only resume operations **if it is satisfied that it is safe to do so**.
- This provision emphasizes that the decision to restart is not made lightly and must be based on a **comprehensive safety assessment** by AECL, taking into account all technical, operational, and risk-related factors.
- The safety determination must be grounded in sound engineering and risk analysis, ensuring that the reactor remains within acceptable safety margins during operation.

#### **3. Non-Derogation of Regulatory Authority**
- The Act explicitly states that **nothing in this legislation undermines or limits the authority of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)**.
- The CNSC retains full regulatory oversight and authority over AECL in all other aspects of nuclear safety, licensing, and compliance.
- The only exception is the specific licence conditions mentioned in subsection 1(1) (i.e., the seismically qualified motor starters and emergency power supply connection), which are temporarily waived for the purpose of this emergency.

> This ensures that the temporary exemption does not create a precedent for undermining regulatory oversight in other areas. The CNSC will still have the power to review, monitor, and potentially require compliance with the original safety conditions once the 120-day period ends or if new risks emerge.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

1. **Address a Public Health Crisis**  
   The primary goal is to **alleviate the urgent shortage of medical isotopes** that has affected healthcare providers across Canada and contributed to delays in patient diagnosis and treatment.

2. **Protect Patient Safety and Health**  
   By restoring isotope production, the Act directly supports the health and well-being of Canadians, especially in oncology and other critical medical fields.

3. **Maintain Global Supply Chain Stability**  
   Canada is a key supplier of medical isotopes globally. The shutdown disrupted international supply chains, and this act helps stabilize those networks.

4. **Balance Safety and Urgency**  
   The legislation demonstrates a **pragmatic approach** to balancing nuclear safety standards with public health imperatives. It acknowledges that while safety is paramount, emergencies may require temporary flexibility in regulatory compliance.

### **Legal and Regulatory Implications**

- The Act operates as a **temporary emergency measure**, valid for only 120 days.
- It does **not** constitute a permanent waiver of safety requirements; rather, it is a **conditional and time-limited exception**.
- The CNSC will likely conduct a **review of the situation** after the 120-day period to assess whether the reactor can safely meet the original safety conditions or whether further measures are needed.
- AECL is expected to submit a **comprehensive safety report** to the CNSC upon resumption and at regular intervals during the 120-day period.

### **Conclusion**

This Act is a targeted, emergency response to a significant public health emergency. It allows the resumption of operations at the NRU reactor—Canada’s most critical medical isotope source—by temporarily suspending specific safety conditions related to seismic resilience, under the condition that AECL confirms the operation is safe. The measure underscores the government’s commitment to protecting public health while maintaining rigorous nuclear safety standards. Importantly, it preserves the authority of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and ensures that the long-term safety and regulatory integrity of the reactor are not compromised.

> **In essence**: A temporary, health-driven exception to safety regulations, designed to restore essential medical services without sacrificing core nuclear safety principles.
