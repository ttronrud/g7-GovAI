**Detailed Summary of the *Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act***  
*(Note: This Act is largely obsolete and has been repealed or superseded by amendments in 1992, as indicated in the text. However, this summary provides a comprehensive analysis of its original provisions as written.)*

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act* establishes a system of **supplementary retirement benefits** for certain individuals receiving pensions under various federal public service and government-related retirement schemes. These benefits are designed to **adjust pension amounts over time** based on inflation and changes in the cost of living, ensuring that retirees receive a fair and stable level of income despite inflation.

Despite its original purpose, the Act was **repealed in 1992** (via *Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, c. 46, s. 98–104*), and its functions have since been absorbed into other legislation, particularly the **Public Service Pension Adjustment Act** and modernized retirement benefit frameworks.

| **Benefit Index** | A measure used to adjust supplementary retirement benefits. For years listed in Schedule II, it is a fixed figure; for 1985 and later, it is calculated annually using a formula based on the previous year’s Benefit Index and the ratio of the current to prior Pension Index. |
| **Pension Index** | The average of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Canada over a 12-month period ending September 30 of the year before the reference year. Published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*. |
| **Disabled** | A person incapable of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation. |
| **Minister** | The designated member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada responsible for administering the Act. |

| **Recipient** | A person who qualifies under one of several defined categories, including: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• | Age 60 and receiving a pension |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• | Under age 60 but receiving a pension and is disabled |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• | Receiving a pension under specific Acts (e.g., Members of Parliament, Judges, Diplomats, RCMP, Defence Services) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• | Receiving a pension based on at least a specified number of years of service (26+ years at age 59, 30+ at age 55) |

## **Core Provisions and Mechanism of Benefits**

### **1. Payment of Supplementary Retirement Benefits**

- **Every eligible recipient** (defined above) is entitled to a **supplementary retirement benefit**.
- The benefit for a given month in a year is calculated using the following formula:

> **Supplementary Benefit = (Pension × (Benefit Index for Year / Benefit Index for Retirement Year)) − Pension**

This means:
- The benefit is **proportional to the change in the Benefit Index** between the retirement year and the current year.
- It effectively **increases pension amounts in line with inflation** (as reflected in the Benefit Index), but **only if the Benefit Index rises**.

> Example: If the Benefit Index increases from 100 to 110, the supplementary benefit increases by 10%, even though the pension amount itself remains unchanged.

---

### **2. Calculation of the Benefit Index**

- For years listed in **Schedule II**, the Benefit Index is a fixed value (e.g., 100 in 1982).
- For **1985 and later**, the Benefit Index is calculated as:
  
> **New Benefit Index = Previous Benefit Index × (Pension Index for Current Year / Pension Index for Previous Year)**

This ensures that the benefit adjusts **in tandem with inflation**, measured by the CPI.

> This mechanism links the benefit directly to **consumer price changes**, making it inflation-protected.

---

### **3. Special Rules for Retirement Years 1982 and Later**

If a person retires **on or after June 22, 1982**, the supplementary benefit is adjusted for **partial months** in the year immediately following retirement.

#### **For the month immediately after retirement:**
> Supplementary Benefit = (Base Benefit × (Remaining Months in Retirement Year / 12))

This ensures that the benefit is **pro-rated** if retirement occurs mid-year.

#### **For subsequent years (after the first year post-retirement):**
- The **pension amount used** in the calculation is **increased by the supplementary benefit** from the year after retirement.
- The **Benefit Index used** is **the one from the year immediately after retirement**, not the retirement year.

> This prevents a "step-down" in benefit due to timing of retirement and ensures continuity.

---

### **4. Minimum Benefit Guarantees**

To prevent erosion of benefits due to inflation or timing issues, the Act includes **minimum floor provisions**:

#### **General Rule (Section 7):**
> The total of pension + supplementary benefit in any year must **not be less than** the total in the prior year.

#### **For retirement years 1976 and later:**
> The supplementary benefit must be **at least equal to the difference** between:
> - The **maximum possible pension + supplementary benefit** that would have been payable if retirement had occurred in that month,
> - And the actual pension amount.

This ensures that **no retiree receives a net reduction** in income due to inflation or timing of retirement.

> This rule is applied differently depending on whether the retiree is a person appointed by the Governor in Council (e.g., a senior official) or a public servant (e.g., civil servant), with the **Governor in Council** or **Treasury Board** setting thresholds.

---

### **5. Payment Timing and Conditions**

- Supplementary benefits are paid **at the same times, in the same manner, during the same periods, and under the same terms** as the pension.
- This ensures **predictability and consistency** in financial planning for retirees.

---

### **6. Return of Contributions and Death Benefits**

#### **For Contributors Who Cease to Contribute:**
- If a person stops contributing and **no pension is payable**, they are entitled to:
  - All contributions made to the SRBA
  - Plus interest (calculated at 4% per year, compounded annually)

#### **For Death:**
- If a contributor dies and:
  - No beneficiary receives a benefit, or
  - Beneficiaries die or lose entitlements,
- Then the **excess** of:
  - Total contributions + interest
  - Minus all amounts paid to beneficiaries or the contributor
- Is paid as a **death benefit** to the estate.
- If the excess is **less than $1,000**, the Minister may direct it to be paid to a beneficiary or retained.

> This provides a **financial safety net** for contributors and their families.

---

### **7. Interest on Contributions**

- Interest is calculated at **4% per annum, compounded annually**:
  - On contributions made **before 1974**
  - On each **contribution year (1974 onwards)** from December 31 of that year to the year before cessation of contributions.

> This ensures that contributions grow over time, even in periods of low inflation.

---

### **8. Error Recovery**

- If an erroneous payment is made under the Act, the **Minister may deduct the amount** from future payments (pension or supplementary benefit) without prejudice to other legal remedies.

> This protects the government from financial loss due to administrative errors.

---

### **9. Funding and Accounting**

- All benefits are paid from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Benefits calculated for pensions **after December 1973** for individuals whose retirement year is **before 1970** → paid from general fund.
  - Benefits **exceeding the balance in the SRBA** (i.e., when pension + supplementary benefit exceeds total contributions + interest) → charged to the SRBA.
  - Benefits under the **Governor General’s Act** or **Judges Act** → charged to the SRBA.

> This ensures that the SRBA is **sustainable** and that overpayments are not left unaccounted for.

---

### **10. Interest Accrual and Annual Reporting**

- The **Treasury Board** sets the interest rate on the SRBA balance.
- Each year, the **Minister must report to Parliament**:
  - Amounts paid into and out of the SRBA
  - Financial performance
  - Additional information as required by the Governor in Council

> This provides **transparency and accountability** in the administration of the Act.

---

### **11. Regulatory Authority**

The Minister may make regulations to:
- Define how the **Pension Index average** is calculated
- Define how the **Benefit Index** and ratios are computed
- Specify how **errors** or deductions from benefits are handled

> These regulations allow flexibility in implementation while maintaining consistency.

---

### **12. Adjustment for CPI Changes**

- If the **Consumer Price Index (C
