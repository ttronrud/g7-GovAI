The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, 2005, c. 35, s. 69]

This indicates that the specific legislative provision or section in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **an act passed in 2005**, specifically **Chapter 35** of that year, under **section 69**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The act or section referenced is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date**: 2005
- **Repealing Legislation**: *An Act to amend various statutes* (commonly referred to as "Chapter 35, 2005")
- **Section Repealed**: Section 69 of that act
- **Implication**: Any legal provisions, definitions, rights, obligations, or duties previously established by the repealed section are **no longer valid** under current law. Legal or regulatory references to this section are obsolete and should not be used in current jurisprudence or administrative practice.

### Contextual Interpretation:
The repeated notation suggests that the original legislative text (likely a section of a statute) was either:
- A standalone provision,
- A subsection within a larger act, or
- A regulatory or administrative rule.

Since it is listed multiple times, it may have been part of a larger document or a list of repealed sections, possibly in a legal compilation or statute book.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active or current legal content** associated with the provision in question. It was **fully repealed in 2005** under the authority of *Chapter 35, s. 69*, and therefore **does not apply** in any current legal, administrative, or judicial context.

> ✅ Final Note: This summary is based solely on the provided text. Without the original act or section, the content of the repealed provision cannot be described in detail—only its status and the reason for its removal. To understand what the original section governed, one would need to consult the pre-2005 version of the statute or the explanatory notes in the 2005 repeal act.
