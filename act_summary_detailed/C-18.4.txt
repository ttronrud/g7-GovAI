**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Jewish Heritage Month Act**

The *Canadian Jewish Heritage Month Act* is a legislative measure passed by the Parliament of Canada to formally recognize and celebrate the contributions of Jewish Canadians to the nation’s social, economic, political, and cultural development. The Act establishes **May each year as "Canadian Jewish Heritage Month"** across Canada.

### Background and Purpose

The Act begins with a series of **whereas clauses** that establish the context and rationale for its enactment:

1. **Demographic Significance**: The Jewish population in Canada is estimated at approximately 400,000 people, positioning Canada as the **fourth-largest Jewish community in the world** after Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This underscores the size and significance of the Jewish community in Canada’s demographic and cultural landscape.

2. **Historical Contributions**: The Act acknowledges that Jewish Canadians have made **substantial and enduring contributions** to Canada’s growth and prosperity. These contributions span diverse fields, including business, science, arts, politics, education, and civil society. Despite facing significant historical challenges—including antisemitism, discrimination, and periods of exclusion—Jewish Canadians have persevered and played a vital role in shaping modern Canada.

3. **Cultural and Religious Significance of May**: The month of May holds special meaning for the global Jewish community. It is traditionally associated with **Jewish holidays**, including **Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day)** and **Yom HaZikaron (Day of Remembrance)**, as well as the celebration of **Passover** and **Purim**. Designating May as Canadian Jewish Heritage Month aligns with these observances and provides a meaningful time for reflection, remembrance, and celebration.
