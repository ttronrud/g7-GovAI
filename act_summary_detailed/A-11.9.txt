**Detailed Summary of the *Apprentice Loans Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Apprentice Loans Act* is a Canadian federal statute designed to support eligible apprentices by providing them with access to **non-repayable or income-contingent loans** during their technical training periods. The primary objective is to reduce financial barriers to entry into skilled trades, thereby promoting workforce development, economic mobility, and training participation. The Act establishes a regulatory framework under which the Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) can administer loans, subject to specific conditions, financial safeguards, and oversight mechanisms.

## **Key Definitions and Key Provisions**

---

### **1. Definitions (Section 2)**  
The Act defines several key terms that govern its operation:

- **Eligible Trade**: A trade listed in the *schedule to the regulations*. This list may be updated by regulation and can vary by province.
- **Minister**: Refers to the Minister of Employment and Social Development (MESD), who has primary responsibility for administering the Act.
- **Technical Training Provider**: An institution approved by a province to deliver technical training in designated trades.
- **Apprentice, Apprentice Loan, Borrower, Technical Training, Technical Training Period**: These terms are defined in the *Apprentice Loans Regulations*, which provide operational details.

> *Note: The Act relies heavily on regulations for detailed definitions and procedures.*

---

### **2. Purpose of the Act (Section 1)**  
The central purpose is to **assist eligible apprentices** by making **apprentice loans available** to them. These loans are intended to support apprentices during their training, helping them cover costs associated with education and skill development.

---

### **3. Loan Administration (Section 4)**  
- The **Minister** (or a person authorized by the Minister) may enter into an agreement with an **eligible apprentice** registered in an **eligible trade** to provide an apprentice loan.
- Any terms or conditions that could have a **financial impact on Her Majesty in right of Canada** must be approved by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister and with the **concurrence of the Minister of Finance**.

> This ensures fiscal accountability and prevents unauthorized financial exposure.

---

### **4. Service Provider Agreements (Section 5)**  
- The Minister may enter into agreements with **service providers** (e.g., private or public organizations) to manage the administration of apprentice loans.
- These agreements may cover administrative, operational, or financial aspects as specified in the regulations.
- The service provider must **deposit all repayments and interest income** (collected from borrowers or generated on loan funds) into the **Receiver General’s account** within **two business days** of receipt.

> *Business day*: Any day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday.

> This provision ensures that public funds are properly accounted for and safeguarded.

---

### **5. Suspension or Denial of Loans (Section 6)**  
The Minister may **suspend or deny** loans to all eligible apprentices if there are **compelling reasons to believe** that:
- The loan would **facilitate a violation of this Act or another federal law** by a technical training provider; or  
- The loan would **expose apprentices or the Government to significant financial risk**.

> This allows the Minister to act as a safeguard against fraud, mismanagement, or systemic risk.

---

### **6. Provincial Payments (Section 7)**  
If the Minister determines that:
- Apprentices in a province **cannot access loans** under Section 4;
- The province has a **financial assistance program** for apprentices; and  
- The program’s **purpose is substantially similar** to this Act,

Then the Minister may **pay the province** a sum determined by regulation to support apprentices.

> This promotes equity across provinces and allows for regional cooperation in apprenticeship support.

---

### **7. Interest Suspension Periods (Section 8)**  
To support apprentices financially, the Act includes **multiple interest suspension periods**:

| Period | Interest Status | Principal Repayment Status |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **March 30, 2020 – September 30, 2020** | No interest payable | No principal or interest required to be paid |
| **April 1, 2021 – March 31, 2023** | No interest payable | Principal repayment begins on the **last day of the month** when interest would have started accruing (i.e., the "interest suspension period") |
| **April 1, 2023 onward** | No interest payable (permanent) | No repayment until end of prescribed period |

> **For greater certainty**:  
> - Borrowers are **not relieved** of interest that accrued **before April 1, 2023**.  
> - The transition period (April 1, 2023 – date of regulation change) ensures a smooth shift to full repayment rules.

> *Section 8(1) applies only during the transition period* — after that, no interest is payable.

---

### **8. Termination of Obligations (Section 9)**  
Borrower obligations terminate under the following circumstances:
- **Death of the borrower**  
- **Severe permanent disability** (as defined in regulations), where the borrower is unable to repay the loan and will never be able to do so.

> This provides protection for individuals facing life-changing circumstances.

---

### **9. Loan Limits and Caps (Section 10)**  
- The **total outstanding amount** of apprentice loans under this Act **cannot exceed a prescribed amount**.
- The **Governor in Council** may regulate:
  - The list of eligible trades (including by province)
  - Who qualifies as an eligible apprentice
  - Conditions for loan disbursement
  - Maximum loan amount per apprentice per training period
  - Maximum period after which repayment begins
  - Maximum number of training periods for which a loan can be advanced
  - Income-contingent repayment options
  - Required information in forms or documents
  - Timing of certain actions (e.g., repayment deadlines)

> *Note: Some provisions were repealed in 2022 (e.g., limits on number of training periods)* — indicating evolving policy focus.

---

### **10. Incorporation by Reference (Section 11)**  
Regulations may **incorporate by reference** documents from:
- Standards organizations (e.g., Standards Council of Canada)
- Industrial or trade associations
- Government bodies
- Technical documents (e.g., safety, performance, test procedures)

> These documents can be:
- Adapted in form or reference
- Translated or reproduced
- Jointly produced with other governments for harmonization

> **Accessibility requirement**: All incorporated documents must be **accessible** to the public.

> **Legal protection**: A person is **not liable** for a violation if the referenced document was **not accessible** at the time of the alleged breach.

> **No registration requirement**: Documents incorporated by reference are **not required** to be published in the *Canada Gazette*.

> This allows for flexibility and up-to-date standards without requiring full text duplication.

---

### **11. Loan Forms and Documents (Section 12)**  
- All forms or documents used in connection with loans or Act operations must be:
  - **Determined by the Minister**, or  
  - **Approved by the Minister**

> Ensures consistency, compliance, and transparency.

---

### **12. Liability of Minors (Section 13)**  
- If an apprentice is **not of full age** at the time of the loan:
  - The **loan and interest are recoverable** by the Minister as if the borrower had been of full age.

> This protects the Government from liability in cases where minors take out loans without legal capacity.

---

### **13. Waiver of Requirements (Section 14)**  
On application by an eligible apprentice or borrower, the Minister may waive:
- Deadlines for submitting information  
- Requirements regarding the form or manner of submission

> This promotes **accessibility and equity**, especially for those facing administrative or logistical challenges.

---

### **14. Remedial Action for Errors (Section 15)**  
If the Minister determines that a person was **wrongfully denied** a loan due to an administrative error:
- The Minister may take **remedial action** to place the person in the position they would have been in had the error not occurred.

> This ensures fairness and accountability in the loan process.

---

### **15. Limitation Periods (Section 16)**  
- **No legal action** to recover money under this Act may be taken **after six years** from when the money becomes due and payable.
- However, **money may be recovered**:
  - By **deduction**, **set-off**, or in **Quebec**, by **compensation** against any sum owed by the Government to the borrower or their estate.
- **Acknowledgment of liability**:
  - If a borrower acknowledges debt, the **six-year period starts anew**.
  - If acknowledgment occurs **after** the six-year period, an action may still be brought within **six years** of the acknowledgment.
- The limitation period is **suspended** during any period when legal action is prohibited (e.g., during loan suspension or dispute resolution).
- *Exception*: This does **not apply** to actions related to **judgments, renewals, or enforcement**.

> This provides a balanced approach between protecting borrowers from undue legal pressure and ensuring the Government can recover funds when due.

---

### **16. Compliance and Information Requests (Section 17)**  
- The Minister may issue a **notice** requiring a borrower or related party to provide information or documents.
- Upon compliance, the Minister may
