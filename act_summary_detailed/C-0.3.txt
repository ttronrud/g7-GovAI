**Detailed Summary of the Campobello-Lubec Bridge Act**

---

### **1. Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is formally titled the **Campobello-Lubec Bridge Act**.
- It establishes legal authority for the **construction, operation, and maintenance** of a bridge spanning the **Lubec Channel**, connecting **Campobello Island, New Brunswick**, to the **Town of Lubec, Maine**.
- The primary purpose of the Act is to **approve and authorize** the development of this bridge for the **free use and passage** of persons, vehicles, and goods, including all necessary approaches, roads, and associated infrastructure.

---

### **2. Authorization of Agreement Between Provinces**
- The **Province of New Brunswick** is empowered to enter into an agreement with the **State of Maine** to jointly develop and manage the bridge project.
- This agreement must be **approved by the Governor in Council** (the federal Cabinet) before it can proceed.
- The agreement will govern the **construction, operation, and long-term maintenance** of the bridge and must ensure that the bridge serves the public interest by enabling free and safe passage across the channel.

---

### **3. Construction and Navigation Safeguards**
- The bridge must be constructed in strict compliance with **navigation regulations** established by the **Governor in Council**.
- These regulations are designed to **protect the safety and free flow of maritime traffic** in Lubec Channel, a critical waterway for navigation.
- Prior to construction beginning, the Province must:
  - Submit detailed **plans and drawings** of the bridge to the Governor in Council for review and approval.
  - Provide a **precise map** of the proposed bridge location that includes:
    - Accurate **soundings (depth measurements)** of the channel.
    - The **bed of the channel**.
    - The **location of all existing bridges** in the area.
- The Province must also provide **any additional information** deemed necessary by the Governor in Council to fully understand the project’s scope and impact.

---

### **4. Approval and Modification Requirements**
- **Construction cannot begin** until the Governor in Council has formally approved:
  - The submitted plans and drawings.
  - The final location of the bridge.
- Any **material changes** to the plans, drawings, or bridge location **after construction has commenced** must be approved **in advance** by the Governor in Council.
- This ensures that the project remains aligned with federal safety standards and environmental considerations throughout its development.

---

### **5. Employment of Canadian Labour and Materials**
- To promote **domestic economic participation**, the Act mandates that:
  - **Canadian labour and materials** be used in the construction of the bridge.
  - Specifically, **at least 50%** (as nearly as practicable) of the **total cost** of both labour and materials must be sourced from Canada.
- Before construction begins, the Province must provide **evidence to the Minister of Labour** that:
  - The construction arrangements are structured to ensure **effective compliance** with this 50% requirement.
- This provision supports federal policy goals related to **local employment, economic development, and national economic participation** in infrastructure projects.

---

### **6. Repeal Clause**
- Section of the Act that was originally included (likely related to environmental or administrative provisions) was **repealed in 2012** by **Statute 19, c. 19, section 443**.
- This means that the current version of the Act does **not contain** any provisions that were previously in place and removed by legislative amendment.

---

### **Key Implications and Significance**
- This Act represents a **bilateral infrastructure initiative** between Canada and the United States (via Maine), facilitating cross-border connectivity.
- It emphasizes **federal oversight** in areas of public safety (navigation) and economic policy (labour and materials).
- The requirement for **detailed environmental and navigational planning** ensures that the bridge does not disrupt marine traffic or ecological systems.
- The 50% Canadian content requirement reflects Canada’s interest in **protecting domestic employment and supply chains** in major infrastructure projects.

### **Conclusion**
The **Campobello-Lubec Bridge Act** provides a comprehensive legal framework for the development of a vital cross-channel bridge between New Brunswick and Maine. It balances **federal oversight**, **public safety**, **economic participation**, and **inter-provincial cooperation**. While the Act has been amended (with a 2012 repeal of a section), its core provisions—particularly those regarding approval processes, navigation safety, and Canadian labour use—remain central to the project’s governance and implementation.

This Act is a foundational piece of legislation enabling a long-term solution to improve transportation and economic access between the Canadian and U.S. sides of the Lubec Channel.
