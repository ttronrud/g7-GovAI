**Detailed Summary of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is officially titled the *Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act* and may be cited as such. This legislation is focused on addressing environmental and agricultural challenges in the Prairie provinces of Canada—specifically **Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta**—with the primary goal of rehabilitating degraded farmland affected by **drought and soil drifting (erosion)**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Minister"** refers to the individual appointed by the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) as the **Minister responsible for the purposes of this Act**. This person serves as the central authority overseeing the implementation of the Act.

---

### **3. Establishment of Advisory Committees**
- The **Governor in Council** has the authority to establish **one or more Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Committees** (PFR Committees).
- These committees are **advisory bodies**, and their members serve at the **pleasure of the government** (i.e., they can be removed or replaced at any time).
- Each committee must have **one chairman**, who is appointed by the Minister.
- The **primary mandate** of these committees is to:
  - Advise the Minister on the **most effective methods** for rehabilitating drought-prone and soil-drifting areas.
  - Recommend and promote **sustainable farm practices**, including:
    - Tree culture (afforestation, agroforestry)
    - Water supply systems (irrigation, conservation)
    - Land utilization strategies
    - Land settlement policies (e.g., encouraging responsible land use and development)
  - Make representations or recommendations to the Minister as they deem appropriate.

> *Note:* These committees are not empowered to implement projects directly but provide expert guidance and recommendations.

---

### **4. Compensation and Expenses**
- **No member of an advisory committee receives payment or emolument (salary or benefits)** for their service.
- However, members are entitled to **reimbursement for all actual, reasonable travel and other expenses** incurred in carrying out their duties.

> This ensures that the committees remain independent and free from financial incentives, promoting objective and impartial advice.

---

### **5. Staffing and Employment**
- Any **engineers, clerks, and stenographers** required to support the operations of the Act must be hired in accordance with the **Public Service Employment Act**.

---

### **6. Appointment of Officers and Employees**
- The **Minister** may appoint:
  - A **Director of Rehabilitation**
  - An **Associate Director of Rehabilitation**
  - All other officers and employees needed to carry out the Act
- **Exclusion**: The appointments of members of advisory committees are excluded from this provision.
- **Salaries and expenses** of these appointed officers and employees are **set by the Governor in Council**, not the Minister, ensuring fiscal oversight and accountability.

---

### **7. Regulatory Authority**
- The Governor in Council may make **regulations** as needed to ensure the effective implementation of the Act.
- These regulations can cover administrative procedures, project standards, reporting requirements, or other operational details necessary to achieve the Act’s objectives.

> This provision grants flexibility to adapt to evolving environmental, technical, or economic conditions.

---

### **8. Funding and Expenditure Authority**
- The Governor in Council may **authorize expenditures** up to the amount **appropriated by Parliament each year**.
- This means that the federal government can spend funds under the Act only within the annual budget limits approved by Parliament.
- The funding is used for projects and initiatives related to farm rehabilitation, land management, and infrastructure development.

> This ensures that spending remains within democratic and fiscal boundaries.

---

### **9. Powers of the Minister**

- **Develop, construct, promote, operate, and maintain** any project or scheme under the Act.
- **Enter into agreements** with:
  - Provincial governments
  - Municipalities
  - Private individuals or entities
  - To implement or collaborate on rehabilitation efforts.

> This grants the Minister broad operational authority to drive on-the-ground action.

---

### **10. Financial Oversight: Treasury Board Consent Requirement**
- **No single project or scheme** involving an expenditure **exceeding $15,000 in any fiscal year** may be undertaken without the **prior consent of the Treasury Board**.
- This is a key **fiscal accountability measure**, ensuring that large expenditures are subject to rigorous review and approval by the federal finance and policy body.

> This prevents uncontrolled or unchecked spending and promotes transparency and budgetary discipline.

---

### **11. Annual Reporting to Parliament**
- The Minister is required to **submit an annual report** to Parliament detailing:
  - All activities and decisions made under the Act during the preceding fiscal year.
