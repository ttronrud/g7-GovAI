**Detailed Summary of the National Blood Donor Week Act**

---

**1. Purpose and Context of the Act**

The *National Blood Donor Week Act* is a legislative measure introduced to recognize, promote, and celebrate the vital role of blood donors in Canada. It establishes a national observance to raise awareness, encourage greater participation in blood donation, and honor the altruistic contributions of Canadian donors.

The Act is grounded in several key facts and values:

- **Canada’s blood system is safe and well-managed**: The country’s blood supply is overseen by two not-for-profit organizations — *Héma-Québec* and *Canadian Blood Services*. These organizations ensure that blood is collected, tested, stored, and distributed safely and efficiently, contributing to Canada having one of the safest blood systems in the world.

- **High demand for blood**: Over half of all Canadians will require blood or blood products at some point in their lives — either for themselves or a family member. This underscores the critical need for a consistent and reliable supply of blood.

- **Low donation rates**: Despite this demand, less than 4% of eligible Canadians donate blood annually. This significant gap between need and supply highlights the urgent need for increased public engagement in blood donation.

- **Diverse forms of donation**: Blood donation is not limited to whole blood. It also includes plasma, platelets, and bone marrow — each of which supports different medical treatments and patient needs. The Act acknowledges that every donation, regardless of type, can save up to three lives.

- **Altruism and community impact**: Blood donors are volunteers who give freely and without financial compensation. Their actions represent a profound act of kindness and civic responsibility. The Act emphasizes that donors are the "lifeblood of their communities" and deserve recognition and appreciation.

- **Global recognition**: The World Health Organization (WHO) designates **June 14** as *World Blood Donor Day*, a global observance to honor blood donors and promote donor awareness. Over 192 WHO Member States, 181 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and 50 national blood donor organizations have committed to supporting this day annually.
