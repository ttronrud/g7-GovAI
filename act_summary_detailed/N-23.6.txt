### **Detailed Summary of the Non-smokers’ Health Act**

---

#### **Overview**
The *Non-smokers’ Health Act* (NSHA) is a Canadian federal statute enacted to protect non-smokers from exposure to tobacco and cannabis smoke and emissions from vaping products in work environments. It establishes legal obligations for employers to prevent smoking in workspaces and to designate specific areas where smoking may occur, under strict conditions. The Act applies primarily to indoor workspaces and certain transportation vehicles operating between Canada and foreign countries.

The Act was originally passed in 1989 and has been amended over time to reflect evolving public health concerns, including the rise of vaping and changes in workplace safety standards. It remains a cornerstone of workplace smoking regulation in Canada.

   Employers may designate:

3. **Ventilation Requirements**  
   - For buildings constructed **before January 1, 1990**: Employers must ensure designated smoking rooms meet ventilation standards (as per regulations).
   - For buildings constructed **after December 31, 1989**: **No new smoking rooms** may be designated if they fail to meet ventilation requirements.

4. **Consultation Requirement**  
   Before designating a smoking room or area in a workplace:
   - Employers must **consult** with:
     - The **workplace committee** or
     - The **health and safety representative** (if one exists).
   - If no such representative exists, consultation must occur with **employees** directly involved.

> *Note:* This reflects the principles of worker participation and health and safety governance under the *Canada Labour Code*.

5. **Designation Restrictions on Transportation**  
   - **Aircraft**: Smoking may only be allowed on:
     - Flights **longer than two hours**, or
