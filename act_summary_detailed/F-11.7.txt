**Detailed Summary of the *First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act* (Enacted 2003)**

---

### **Overview**

The *First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act* (FN GST Act), enacted by section 67 of Chapter 15 of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003*, and coming into force on June 19, 2003, is a landmark piece of legislation that grants **First Nations the authority to impose and administer a goods and services tax (GST)**—specifically, a tax on taxable supplies and the bringing of tangible personal property onto First Nation lands.

This Act operates within the broader framework of Canadian federal tax law, particularly the *Excise Tax Act* (ETA), and is designed to **recognize First Nations' self-governance** in economic matters while ensuring that such taxation does not conflict with existing federal exemptions or undermine Indigenous rights.

It establishes a **legal mechanism** for First Nations to create their own tax laws, collect taxes, and share revenues with the federal government through an *administration agreement*, all while respecting the federal exemption under **section 87 of the Indian Act** and other similar tax exemptions.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definitions and Key Terms**

The Act begins with a clear set of definitions that govern its application:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Administration Agreement** | A binding contract between a First Nation and the federal government (or a provincial government, if applicable) that governs how the First Nation's tax law is administered, enforced, and how revenue is shared. |
| **Authorized Body** | The body within a First Nation authorized to enter into an administration agreement (e.g., a council or band council). |
| **Band** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — refers to a group of individuals recognized as a band under that Act. |
| **Governing Body** | The entity identified in *Schedule 1* for a particular First Nation. This body has the legal authority to enact tax laws. |
| **Imported Taxable Supply** | As defined in section 217 of the *Excise Tax Act* — goods or services brought into Canada from outside, subject to GST. |
| **Input Tax Credit (ITC)** | As defined in Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* — a credit available to businesses to offset GST paid on purchases. |
| **Lands of a First Nation** | The land area specified in *Schedule 1* for each First Nation. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of Finance**. |
| **Net Tax** | As defined in Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* — the total tax payable after input tax credits are applied. |
| **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** | Includes Schedules V to X — the core GST regime. This is the primary reference point for tax rules. |
| **Reserve** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — land set aside for First Nations. |

> **Note**: Unless otherwise stated, terms used in Part 1 are interpreted according to subsection 123(1) of the *Excise Tax Act*.

### **2. Mobile Homes and Floating Homes**

- A **mobile home or floating home** is deemed to be **tangible personal property** for the purposes of:
  - Applying GST rules (Part 1 of the *Excise Tax Act*),
  - Any First Nation law governing the movement or use of such property on reserve lands.

> This ensures that mobile homes are subject to the same tax rules as other tangible personal property when brought onto First Nation lands.

---

### **3. Deemed Circumstances from Excise Tax Act**

- If a provision in **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** deems a certain fact to exist (e.g., a supply is made in a particular province), then **that fact is also deemed to exist** for the purposes of determining whether a First Nation law applies.

> This allows First Nations to apply tax rules consistent with federal GST rules, even when those rules are based on geographical or jurisdictional assumptions.

---

### **4. Taxation Despite Exemptions**

- **Despite the exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act** (which generally exempts supplies made on reserve lands), a **tax may still be imposed** under a First Nation law.
- Similarly, **no other federal tax exemption** that is similar to section 87 can prevent the imposition of tax under a First Nation law.

> This is a critical provision — it removes the automatic exemption for supplies on reserve lands and allows First Nations to generate revenue from such activities.

---

### **5. Administration and Enforcement of First Nation Tax Laws**

- A First Nation law (as defined in subsection 11(1) or 12(1)) may be:
  - Administered and enforced by **Her Majesty in right of Canada**,
  - Or by an **agent of the First Nation**, or
  - If administered by a province under a federal-provincial agreement (under the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*), then by the **provincial government**.

> This ensures flexibility in how tax laws are implemented, depending on the governance structure.

---

### **6. Authority to Enact Tax Laws**

- The **governing body** of a First Nation listed in *Schedule 1* may enact a law imposing:
  1. A tax on **taxable supplies** made on the lands of the First Nation;
  2. A tax on the **bringing of tangible personal property** onto First Nation lands from within Canada;
  3. A tax on **imported taxable supplies** made on the lands of the First Nation.

> This gives First Nations significant autonomy over economic regulation on their lands.

---

### **7. Conditions for a Supply to Be Considered "Made on Lands"**

A supply is deemed to be "made on the lands of a First Nation" only if **at least one of the following conditions is met**:

#### **(a) Participation in the Excise Tax Act (Participating Province Rule)**  
If the First Nation’s lands were a **participating province** under the *Excise Tax Act*, then:
- All other First Nations with active tax laws are each treated as **separate participating provinces**,
- The participating provinces listed in *Schedule VIII* of the ETA are considered **non-participating provinces**,
- Then, a supply would be deemed to be made in that province (and thus subject to GST).

> This rule is a technical mechanism to allow tax application based on hypothetical provincial status.

#### **(b) Exemption Not Applied (Tax Would Have Been Payable)**  
If tax under Part IX of the ETA would have been payable **but for**:
- The exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, or
- Any similar federal tax exemption,

then the supply is deemed to be made on the First Nation’s lands.

> This ensures that if a supply would have been taxable under federal rules, it is now taxable under First Nation law.

---

### **8. Special Rule for Motor Vehicles (Lease, Licence, etc.)**

For a **lease, licence, or similar arrangement** involving a **specified motor vehicle**:
- The supply is considered to be made on the First Nation’s lands **only if**:
  - For an **individual recipient**: they **ordinarily reside** on those lands at the time of supply.
  - For a **non-individual recipient** (e.g., a business): the **ordinary location** of the vehicle (as defined in *Schedule IX* of the ETA) is on the First Nation’s lands.

> This prevents tax from being applied to vehicles used elsewhere, unless they are physically present or used on the reserve.

---

### **9. Imported Taxable Supplies on First Nation Lands**

An imported taxable supply is deemed to be made on First Nation lands only if **one of these conditions is met**:

#### **(a) Hypothetical Participation Rule**  
If:
- The First Nation’s lands were the **particular participating province** in subsection 218.1(1) of the ETA,
- All other First Nations with active tax laws are treated as separate provinces,
- The participating provinces in Schedule VIII are non-participating,
- The recipient is **not a selected listed financial institution**,

then the supply is deemed to be made on the First Nation’s lands.

#### **(b) Exemption Not Applied**  
If tax would have been payable under the ETA **but for**:
- The exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act,
- Or any similar exemption,

then the supply is deemed to be made on the First Nation’s lands.

> This ensures that imported goods that would otherwise be exempt are now subject to tax under First Nation law.

---

### **10. Tax on Bringing Property onto First Nation Lands**

A tax may be imposed **only if**:
- The property was **last supplied by sale** within **30 days before** it was brought onto the lands,
- And tax would have been payable under Part IX of the ETA **at a rate other than zero** (i.e., not due to exemption under section 87 or similar).

> This creates a **"last sale" rule** to ensure that only property with a taxable origin is subject to tax.

---

### **11. Exemption from Tax on Bringing Property**

A tax is **not imposed** if:
- The person was **already liable** under a First Nation law or under **section 212 of the Excise Tax Act** before the property was brought onto the lands, or
