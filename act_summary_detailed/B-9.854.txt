### **Conclusion**
The *Budget Implementation Act, 2005* is a comprehensive piece of legislation that translates the 2005 federal budget into concrete financial actions. It demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to:

- Regional equity and northern development,
- Environmental sustainability,
- Indigenous healing,
- Economic resilience in key sectors,
- And intergovernmental cooperation.

While some provisions were short-lived or later repealed, the Act remains a significant milestone in Canada’s fiscal policy, illustrating how targeted, conditional funding can be used to address pressing social, environmental, and economic challenges.

> **Note**: The Act is largely historical in nature, as many of its funding mechanisms were either replaced, expanded, or phased out in subsequent years (e.g., the Green Municipal Fund, the Emission Reduction Incentives Agency). However, its structure and approach influenced later budget implementation acts and regional funding strategies.
