**Detailed Summary of the *Unemployment Insurance Benefit Entitlement Adjustments (Pension Payments) Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Unemployment Insurance Benefit Entitlement Adjustments (Pension Payments) Act* is a Canadian legislative measure enacted to address a specific historical inequity in the unemployment insurance (UI) system. It ensures that certain claimants who had their unemployment benefits reduced or eliminated due to deductions for pension payments—particularly those arising after January 4, 1986—receive fair compensation for the loss of benefits they would have otherwise received.

This Act was introduced to rectify unintended consequences of changes in the *Unemployment Insurance Regulations*, particularly concerning deductions from unemployment benefits when a claimant received pension income (e.g., CPP, provincial pensions, or military/policing pensions).

#### **4. Entitlement Adjustments for Claimants Affected by Pension Deductions**

##### **Situation 1: Initial Claim Before January 5, 1986**
- A claimant made an **initial claim for unemployment benefits before January 5, 1986**.
- Their benefits were **eliminated or reduced** because of deductions under **Sections 57 and 58 of the Regulations as they existed on January 5, 1986**.
- These deductions were made from benefits that were being paid **after January 4, 1986**, on a periodic or lump-sum basis, in lieu of or on account of a pension.

> **Action by the Commission**:
> - The Commission must assess whether the claimant would have been entitled to benefits **had the pension-related deductions not occurred**.
> - If so, the Commission must **calculate and pay the additional amount** of money the claimant would have received.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To compensate claimants who lost UI benefits due to pension deductions that were applied retroactively or inconsistently after January 4, 1986.

---

##### **Situation 2: Claimants Who Obtained Employment After Pension Payments Began**
- The claimant had **benefits eliminated or reduced** due to pension deductions under the same regulations (as of January 5, 1986).
- The claimant **obtained employment after the pension payments began**.
- The claimant accumulated **insurable employment weeks** during that employment while the pension payments were ongoing.
- A **benefit period** was established based on those weeks of employment.
- The claimant **applied to the Commission in writing** (in the approved form and manner) **before the coming into force of this Act or within 12 months after it came into force**, requesting a review of their entitlement.

> **Action by the Commission**:
> - The Commission must determine whether the claimant would have been entitled to benefits **had the pension deductions not occurred**.
> - If so, the Commission must **calculate and pay the additional amount** of money.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To recognize that claimants who re-entered the workforce and began building benefit periods while receiving pensions were unfairly penalized by deductions that were applied in a way that disrupted their eligibility and benefit continuity.

---

#### **5. Termination of Prior Benefit Periods and Establishment of New Benefit Periods**

> **When a claimant makes a new initial claim and requests termination of an old benefit period**:
- The claimant had a **pre-existing benefit period** (from before January 5, 1986) that was affected by pension deductions.
- The claimant has now **accumulated the minimum number of weeks of insurable employment** required to establish a new benefit period.
- The claimant files a **new initial claim** and requests that the **old benefit period be terminated or deemed terminated** on a specific date **after** the minimum required weeks of employment have been accumulated.

> **Result**:
- The **old benefit period terminates or is deemed terminated on the date specified by the claimant** (even if it would have otherwise ended earlier under Section 20(6) of the *Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971*).
- A **new benefit period begins on the first day of the week following the specified termination date**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To allow claimants to start fresh with a new benefit period without being penalized by the continuation of a prior, disrupted benefit period. This promotes fairness and supports individuals who return to work and rebuild their eligibility.

#### **6. Appeals and Legal Framework**
- Decisions made by the Commission under this Act are **appealable in the same manner** as decisions under the *Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971*.
- Sections **94 to 105** of the *Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971* (which govern appeals) apply to appeals under this Act, with appropriate modifications based on context.

#### **7. Payment and Financial Treatment**
- All payments made under this Act are:
  - **Paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
  - **Charged to the Unemployment Insurance Account** at the time of payment.
  - **Deemed to be benefits payable under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Ensures that the financial treatment of these adjustments is consistent with how regular UI benefits are managed and funded.

---

#### **8. Effective Date**
- The Act **comes into force on April 5, 1987**.

### **Key Objectives and Rationale**

1. **Correct Historical Injustice**:
   - Before January 5, 1986, regulations allowed deductions from unemployment benefits when a claimant received pension income.
   - After that date, changes in the regulations (especially in Sections 57 and 58) made it more difficult to receive unemployment benefits, even if the pension was not directly affecting the claimant’s financial status.
   - This Act recognizes that such deductions were **unfair or unjust** in certain cases and provides **financial redress**.

2. **Support for Workers Re-entering the Workforce**:
   - By allowing claimants who re-entered employment to establish new benefit periods, the Act supports job re-entry and encourages labor market participation.

3. **Consistency with Existing Legal Framework**:
   - The Act integrates seamlessly with the *Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971*, preserving administrative and legal continuity.

4. **Fairness in Benefit Calculation**:
   - It ensures that claimants are not penalized for receiving pension income that is legally entitled to them, especially when such income is not directly tied to unemployment.
