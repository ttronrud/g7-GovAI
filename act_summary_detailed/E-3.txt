**Detailed Summary of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA) is a federal statute in Canada that establishes a formal, transparent, and constitutionally grounded process for the periodic readjustment of electoral district boundaries in each province. The primary objective of the Act is to ensure that each electoral district in the House of Commons has a population as close as reasonably possible to the **electoral quota**—that is, the average population per representative—thereby maintaining **equal representation** in Parliament, in accordance with the principle of "one person, one vote."

This Act governs the creation, operation, and finalization of electoral boundaries commissions, their responsibilities, and the procedures by which recommendations are reviewed, debated, and ultimately adopted into law. It operates in conjunction with the *Canada Elections Act* and the *Constitution Act, 1867*, particularly **Section 51**, which mandates that representation in the House of Commons be based on population.

## **Timeline and Trigger for Commission Establishment**

The Act mandates that, **before the earlier of two deadlines**, the Governor in Council must establish a provincial electoral boundaries commission:

1. **60 days after** the Minister receives a certified population return from the Chief Statistician (under subsection 13(1)).
2. **Six months before** the census is conducted (as defined under subsection 19(1) of the *Statistics Act*).

> This ensures that commissions begin work early enough to complete their mandate in time for the next federal election cycle.

## **Structure and Appointment of Commissions**

Each commission consists of **three members**:

### 1. **Chairperson**
- Appointed by the **Chief Justice of the province** from among the judges of the court they preside over.

- The term includes acting chief justices or those performing duties temporarily.

### 2. **Two Other Members**
- Appointed by the **Speaker of the House of Commons** from persons **residing in the province** who are deemed suitable.

## **Commission Responsibilities and Boundaries Rules**

Each commission must prepare a **report** outlining:

- How the province will be divided into electoral districts.
- The boundaries, population, and names of each district.

### **Core Principles for Boundary Drawing**

1. **Population Equality**: 
   - Each district should have a population **as close as reasonably possible** to the **electoral quota** (total province population ÷ number of MPs).
   
2. **Community of Interest or Identity**:
   - Districts should reflect historical or cultural patterns (e.g., language, ethnic, religious, or economic communities).

3. **Manageable Geography**:
   - Especially in **rural, sparsely populated, or northern areas**, districts should be geographically manageable to ensure fair access to services and voting.

---

### **Exceptions to Population Equality**

A commission **may deviate** from the electoral quota if it deems it necessary to:
- Respect community of interest or historical patterns.
- Maintain geographic manageability in remote or rural regions.

> However, such deviations must be **minimal**:
- Population of each district must remain within **±25%** of the electoral quota, **unless the commission views the situation as extraordinary**.
