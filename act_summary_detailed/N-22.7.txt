### **Detailed Summary of the Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of New Brunswick (March 25, 1958)**

This document is an official **ratification and confirmation** of a **Memorandum of Agreement** signed on **March 25, 1958**, between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of the Province of New Brunswick**. It addresses long-standing legal and administrative issues concerning **Indian reserve lands** in New Brunswick, particularly those involving **invalid land grants** and the **ownership of minerals**. The agreement was enacted by Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of New Brunswick, and it takes effect according to its terms.

## **I. Background and Purpose**

### **Historical Context**
- Since the **British North America Act, 1867**, certain lands set aside for Indigenous peoples (specifically "Indian reserves") in New Brunswick were surrendered to the Crown by Indigenous bands.
- Over time, the Crown issued **Letters Patent** under the Great Seal of Canada, purportedly transferring these lands to private individuals.
- However, two **decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council** (the highest court of appeal in Canada at the time) concluded that:
  - Such transfers were **invalid** because they lacked proper authority from the **Province of New Brunswick**.
  - As a result, the **grantees** (private individuals who received the land) hold **defective titles**, leading to **legal uncertainty, hardship, and inconvenience** for both Indigenous communities and the Crown.

### **Objective of the Agreement**
To:
1. **Settle outstanding legal disputes** regarding Indian reserve lands in New Brunswick.
2. **Clarify ownership rights** and eliminate defective titles.
3. **Enable Canada to manage future dealings** with reserve lands effectively.
4. Provide a **clear, legally binding framework** for land transfers, mineral rights, and provincial-territorial responsibilities.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The agreement establishes precise definitions to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Province** | Refers specifically to the Province of New Brunswick. |
| **Reserve Lands** | Specific Indian reserves listed in the Appendix to the agreement. |
| **Patented Lands** | Tracts where Canada accepted surrenders of rights from Indigenous peoples and issued Letters Patent. |
| **Minerals** | Includes salt, oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, fire clays, gypsum, lime, bituminous shale, albertite, and ochres. **Excludes** sand, gravel, and marl. |
| **Indian Act** | The federal law governing Indigenous peoples and reserves (as amended, including the 1952 Revised Statutes). |
| **Surrender** | Refers to the surrender of reserve lands for **sale**, not for other purposes (e.g., for use or development). |
| **Public Highways** | Roads and bridges built by the Province or municipalities for public use and existing at the time of the agreement. |

## **III. Core Provisions of the Agreement**

### **1. Confirmation of Grants (with Exceptions)**
> *"All grants of patented lands are hereby confirmed except in so far as such grants purport to transfer to the grantees any minerals and said minerals are hereby acknowledged to be the property of the Province."*

- **Effect**: All prior Letters Patent conveying reserve lands to private parties are **confirmed** and remain valid **except** where they attempted to transfer **mineral rights**.
- **Critical Exception**: Any mineral rights in these patented lands are **transferred to the Province of New Brunswick**, not to the grantees.
- This resolves the legal defect identified in Privy Council rulings: mineral rights cannot be transferred without provincial authority.

✅ **Outcome**: Grantees retain surface rights, but **mineral rights remain with the Province**, restoring legal integrity and protecting Indigenous interests.

---

### **2. Transfer of Rights from New Brunswick to Canada**
> *"New Brunswick hereby transfers to Canada all rights and interests of the Province in reserve lands except lands lying under public highways, and minerals."*

- **What is transferred**:
  - All rights and interests in **reserve lands** (excluding lands under public highways).
  - **Mineral rights** are explicitly **not** transferred to Canada — they remain with the Province.
- **What is retained by New Brunswick**:
  - Lands **under public highways** (roads, bridges).
  - All **mineral rights** in reserve lands.

✅ **Outcome**: Canada gains **ownership and control** over reserve lands (except those under public roads), enabling it to manage future development, sales, or policy decisions. The Province retains control over **minerals**, which is consistent with its role as a provincial government.

---

### **3. Extinction of a Band**
> *"In the event that a band of Indians in the Province becomes extinct, Canada shall revest in the Province all the rights and interests transferred to it under this agreement in the reserve lands occupied by such band prior to its becoming extinct."*

- A "band" does **not** become extinct by enfranchisement (i.e., when members become citizens or legally integrate into the general population).
- If a band disappears due to death, migration, or other causes, Canada **returns** the land rights to the Province.
- This ensures that **no land remains permanently in federal ownership** if the Indigenous group no longer exists.

✅ **Outcome**: Prevents indefinite federal ownership of land after the extinction of a band. Maintains a balance between federal and provincial responsibilities.

---

### **4. Surrender of Land and Purchase Rights**
> *"Canada shall forthwith notify New Brunswick of any surrender and New Brunswick may within thirty days of receiving such notification elect to purchase the surrendered lands at a price to be agreed upon."*

- When a band surrenders land for sale (under the Indian Act), Canada must **immediately notify** New Brunswick.
- New Brunswick has **30 days** to:
  - Choose to **purchase** the land.
  - Agree on a **price** with Canada.
- If New Brunswick **fails to act within 30 days**, Canada may **sell the land without further consultation**.

> *"Where a surrender is made under the condition that the surrendered lands be sold to a named or designated person at a certain price or for a certain consideration, New Brunswick shall exercise its election subject to that price or consideration."*

- If the surrender includes a **specific buyer and price**, New Brunswick must buy the land **only at that price or consideration**.

✅ **Outcome**: Provides New Brunswick with a **right of first refusal** to purchase surrendered lands, protecting provincial interests. Ensures fair and transparent land transactions.

---

### **5. Arbitration Clause (if no agreement is reached)**
> *"Should Canada and New Brunswick be unable, within thirty days of the date of an election to purchase being made, to reach agreement on the price to be paid by New Brunswick for any surrendered lands, the matter shall be referred to arbitrators as follows:..."*

- If no price is agreed upon within 30 days:
  - Each party appoints **one arbitrator**.
  - The two arbitrators appoint a **third arbitrator**.
  - The **arbitrators’ decision on price is final and binding**.
  - **Costs of arbitration are shared equally** between Canada and New Brunswick.

✅ **Outcome**: Provides a **neutral, enforceable mechanism** to resolve disputes over land value. Prevents prolonged legal battles and ensures fair pricing.

## **IV. List of Reserve Lands (Appendix)**

The agreement specifies **17 named Indian reserves** in New Brunswick. These are detailed by parish, location, and geographic features. Examples include:

- **Bathurst Parish**: Along the Nipisiquit River, near Gloucester Junction.
