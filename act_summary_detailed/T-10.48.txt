**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Belt and Peace River Block Act*, 1930**

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Railway Belt and Peace River Block Act*, enacted on **February 20, 1930**, is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that formalizes the **re-transfer of certain Crown lands** from the **Government of Canada** to the **Province of British Columbia**. This re-transfer is rooted in historical agreements made during the Confederation of Canada in 1871, specifically under the *Terms of Union*, and is driven by both legal and practical considerations — including the completion of a vital railway infrastructure and the need for fair, equitable administration of land in British Columbia.

The Act establishes a comprehensive framework for the transfer of lands known collectively as the **Railway Belt and Peace River Block**, while preserving key federal interests, protecting environmental and cultural resources, and ensuring continuity in financial and administrative obligations.

## **Key Background and Historical Context**

1. **Origins in the Terms of Union (1871)**  
   - Under **Paragraph 11 of the Terms of Union**, British Columbia ceded certain Crown lands to Canada in exchange for:
     - Canada’s obligation to construct a railway connecting British Columbia’s coast to the rest of Canada’s rail network.
     - An annual payment of **$100,000** to the Province from the date of Confederation onward.

2. **The Railway Belt and Peace River Block**  
   - These lands were granted by the Province of British Columbia to Canada as a condition of railway development.
   - The lands became known as the **Railway Belt** (for railway access and right-of-way) and the **Peace River Block** (for broader development and settlement).

3. **Completion of the Railway**  
   - By 1927, the railway connecting British Columbia to the national system was fully operational, fulfilling Canada’s contractual obligation.

4. **Legal and Political Justification for Re-transfer**  
   - A judicial inquiry led by **Justice W. M. Martin** (appointed under the *Inquiries Act*) concluded that while the Province had no *strict legal claim* under the original agreements, the request for land return should be evaluated based on **fairness, justice, and public interest**.
   - Justice Martin recommended that the lands be **re-conveyed to the Province**.

5. **Canada’s Agreement**  
   - Canada agreed to re-transfer the lands under the terms of this Act, recognizing the historical, economic, and administrative benefits to British Columbia.
