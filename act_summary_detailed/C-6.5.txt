### 🏠 3. **Residency Rules**

Residency determines which country has the right to tax an individual or entity’s income.

#### For Individuals:
An individual is deemed a resident of **only one** Contracting State based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home**  
   - If the individual has a permanent home in one State, they are a resident of that State.  
   - If they have a permanent home in **both**, the individual is a resident of the State where their **centre of vital interests** (personal and economic ties) lies.

2. **Centre of Vital Interests**  
   - If the centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if there is no permanent home in either country, the individual is a resident of the State where they have an **habitual abode**.

3. **Habitual Abode**  
   - If the individual has a habitual abode in both or neither country, they are a resident of the State of which they are a **national**.

4. **Dual Nationality**  
   - If the individual is a national of both or neither country, the **competent authorities** of the two States must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

> ✅ This rule ensures that individuals are not taxed in multiple jurisdictions on the same income and prevents double taxation through a clear, objective hierarchy.

#### For Persons Other Than Individuals (e.g., Companies, Trusts):
- If a non-individual is a resident of both countries, the **competent authorities must reach mutual agreement** to determine residency.
- If no agreement is reached, such a person is **deemed not to be a resident of either State** for the purposes of enjoying benefits under the Convention.

> ⚠️ This prevents tax complications arising from corporate or institutional dual residency.

### 🏭 4. **Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

#### Included in PE:
- Place of management  
- Branch  
- Office  
- Factory  
- Workshop  
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any natural resource extraction site  

> ✅ A **building site, construction, assembly, or installation project** constitutes a PE **only if it lasts more than six months**.

#### Excluded from PE (if solely for preparatory or auxiliary purposes):
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods  
- Maintenance of stock for **storage, display, or delivery**  
- Maintenance of stock **for processing by another enterprise**  
- Fixed place for **purchasing goods or collecting information**  
- Fixed place for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**  
- Any combination of the above — **if overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**

> ✅ These exclusions protect businesses from being taxed simply for logistical or administrative functions.

#### Special Rule: Authority to Conclude Contracts
- If a person (not an independent agent) acts on behalf of an enterprise and has **authority to conclude contracts** in a Contracting State, then the enterprise is deemed to have a PE in that State — **unless** the activities are limited to those excluded above.

> 🔍 This ensures that enterprises with significant operational authority in a foreign country are taxed appropriately.

#### Exclusion for Independent Agents
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE merely because it uses a **broker, general commission agent, or independent agent** acting in the ordinary course of business.

> ✅ Prevents tax abuse through use of third-party agents.

#### No PE Due to Control or Ownership
- Merely **controlling or being controlled** by a company in the other country, or carrying on business there, **does not** create a PE.

> ✅ Prevents tax on mere ownership or control.

### 🏡 5. **Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**

#### Key Principle:
- Income derived by a resident of one Contracting State from **immovable property** (including agricultural or forestry income) located in the other State may be taxed in that other State.

#### Definition of Immovable Property:
- Includes:
  - Land and buildings  
  - Property accessory to land  
  - Livestock and equipment used in agriculture/forestry  
  - Rights to variable or fixed payments for working mineral deposits or natural resources  
  - Usufruct (right to use property)  
- **Excludes**: Ships and aircraft

> ✅ This allows the host country to tax income from land-based assets.

#### Scope of Application:
- Applies to:
  - Direct use, letting, or use of immovable property  
  - Alienation (sale or disposal) of such property  
- Applies to:
  - Income from immovable property of an enterprise  
  - Income from immovable property used for **independent personal services**

> ✅ Ensures that income from land-based activities is not double-taxed.

### 💼 6. **Taxation of Business Profits (General Rule)**

#### General Rule:
- Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State are taxable **only in that State**.
- **Exception**: If the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a **permanent establishment (PE)**, then:
  - The profits attributable to that PE may be taxed in the other State.
  - Only the portion of profits attributable to the PE is taxable in the other State.

#### Allocation of Profits:
- Profits attributable to a PE are determined as if the PE were a **separate, independent enterprise**:
  - Engaged in the same or similar activities  
  - Under the same or similar conditions  
  - Dealing independently with other parties

#### Deductible Expenses:
- All **deductible expenses** incurred for the PE — including executive and general administrative costs — are allowed, whether incurred in the host country or elsewhere.

> ✅ Promotes fair and equitable profit allocation.

#### Exclusion:
- **No profit attribution** arises simply from the purchase of goods or merchandise by the PE.

> ✅ Prevents taxation on mere procurement activities.

#### Methodology:
- Profits are determined **year by year** using the same method, unless there is **good and sufficient reason** to change it.

> ✅ Ensures consistency and transparency in profit allocation.

#### Exception:
- Where income is dealt with separately in other Articles (e.g., dividends, interest), those Articles **do not override** this rule.

> ✅ Prevents overlap and double application.
