## 🔹 **Key Provisions and Amendments**

### 1. **Regulatory Reforms on Vaping Products (Excise Act, 2001)**

This section introduces a series of new and modified provisions in the *Excise Act, 2001* to regulate vaping products in Canada, with a focus on **product labeling, manufacturing, importation, and compliance**.

#### ✅ **Effective Dates**
- Most amendments come into force on **October 1, 2022**.
- Some provisions (e.g., related to packaging and stamping) apply to products **packaged or imported on or after October 1, 2022**.

#### 📌 Key Provisions:

|--------|--------|
| **158.35, 158.51–158.53, 158.68, 158.69** | Come into force on **October 1, 2022**. These cover labeling requirements, ingredient disclosures, and compliance obligations for vaping products. |
| **158.41, 158.57, 158.58** | Apply to: <br> - Vaping products **manufactured in Canada and packaged on or after October 1, 2022**; <br> - Products **imported or released into Canada on or after October 1, 2022**; <br> - **Exception**: For products **packaged before October 1, 2022**, the rules apply **only if stamped after the Act receives royal assent** (i.e., after July 2022). <br> - Also applies to products **imported after royal assent but before October 1, 2022**, if stamped upon customs reporting. |
| **158.42–158.47, 158.49, 158.5(2)** | Come into force on **October 1, 2022**, but **do not apply before 2023** for: <br> - Vaping products **packaged before October 1, 2022 and not stamped**; <br> - Vaping products **imported or released before October 1, 2022 and not stamped**. |

#### 📌 Special Interpretation (Paragraphs 158.57 and 158.58)
- In the case of vaping products **manufactured in Canada and packaged before October 1, 2022**, the requirement for a **"vaping product licensee"** to be responsible for compliance is interpreted as:
  - The **packager** (the licensee), or
  - The **later of**:
    - The **beginning of October 1, 2022**, or
    - The **time the product is stamped** (after royal assent).

> This ensures that even pre-October 2022 products are subject to new compliance rules **only if they are stamped after the Act's passage**, providing a transitional mechanism.

### 2. **Repeal of Outdated Legislation**

#### 🚫 **Repealed Acts**
- **Safe Drinking Water for First Nations Act (2013)**

- **Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act**  
  → This law is **repealed**, effectively removing the federal ban on non-Canadians buying residential property in Canada. This change may impact housing markets and foreign investment.

#### 💰 **$750 Million Transfer to Provinces**
- The **Minister of Finance** may make payments to provinces totaling **up to $750 million**.

This section ensures continuity of legal proceedings related to trade complaints under the now-repealed *Special Import Measures Act*.

- If a **complaint** was filed **before the commencement day** (date of royal assent):

- If the **Tribunal** received a request for an **interim review** before the commencement day:
  - The review is **continued or initiated** under the former Act.
- If the Tribunal initiated an **interim review on its own**:
  - It continues under the former Act.

### 6. **Copyright Law Clarification**

- **Sections 6, 6.2(2), 7(1) and (3), and 9 of the Copyright Act** (as amended by sections 276–279) **do not revive copyright** in works that had **already expired before the amendments came into force**.

> This is a critical clarification: **expired copyrights remain expired** — no new rights are granted due to these amendments. This protects public domain works and prevents unintended extension of copyright.
