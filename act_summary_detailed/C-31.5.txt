The **Civil Marriage Act** (SC 2005, c. 21) is a landmark piece of Canadian legislation that legally recognizes same-sex marriage for all couples in Canada. It was enacted in 2005 and came into force on **July 20, 2005**, following a long legal and societal debate over equality, human dignity, and the interpretation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the Act, structured by its key components, legal principles, and implications.

---

## **1. Purpose and Legislative Background**

### **Core Objective**
The primary purpose of the *Civil Marriage Act* is to **extend equal access to marriage for civil purposes to same-sex couples**, in full compliance with the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, particularly **Section 15**, which guarantees equality before and under the law and the right to equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination.

### **Key Justifications (Whereas Clauses)**
- **Section 15 of the Charter** mandates that all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, must be treated equally under the law.
- Courts in most provinces and one territory had already recognized that same-sex couples have a right to marry for civil purposes — a precedent that many same-sex couples relied upon.
- The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that **civil unions do not provide equal access to marriage**, and that such institutions violate the human dignity of same-sex couples, thus breaching the Charter.
- Parliament has **exclusive jurisdiction over marriage** under the Constitution (Section 91(27)), meaning it can legislate on marriage but cannot create a parallel institution like civil unions.
- The Act **does not infringe on freedom of conscience or religion** (Section 2 of the Charter). Religious groups retain the right to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if their beliefs oppose such unions.
- The Act **cannot be justified under Section 33 of the Charter** (the "notwithstanding clause") because denying same-sex couples access to marriage would violate the fundamental principle of equality.

> This means that even if Parliament were to override Charter rights in other areas, it **cannot** do so in this case — because equality in marriage is a core right protected by the Charter.

## **2. Definition of Marriage**

### **Section 1 – Definition of Marriage**
> *"Marriage, for civil purposes, is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."*

- This definition **explicitly removes the traditional gender-based requirement** of marriage as being between a man and a woman.
- It establishes that **marriage is a union between two persons**, regardless of gender.
- The phrase "to the exclusion of all others" reinforces the exclusivity and permanence of marriage, aligning with traditional family values while opening it to same-sex couples.

### **Free and Enlightened Consent**
> *"Marriage requires the free and enlightened consent of two persons to be the spouse of each other."*

- Emphasizes that both individuals must voluntarily and fully understand and agree to enter into marriage.
- Protects against coercion, fraud, or undue influence.
- Reinforces the principle that marriage is a mutual and consensual contract.

## **3. Age and Legal Capacity Requirements**

### **Minimum Age**
> *"No person who is under the age of 16 years may contract marriage."*

- Sets a clear minimum age of 16 for marriage.
- Reflects international standards and child protection principles.

### **Dissolution of Prior Marriages**
> *"No person may contract a new marriage until every previous marriage has been dissolved by death or by divorce or declared null by a court order."*

- Ensures that individuals cannot enter into a new marriage while still legally bound to a previous one.
- Applies to all marriages, whether same-sex or opposite-sex.

## **4. Religious Freedom and Non-Enforcement of Religious Objections**

### **Freedom of Conscience and Religion**
> *"It is recognized that officials of religious groups are free to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs."*

- The Act **explicitly protects religious institutions** from being compelled to perform same-sex marriages.
- Religious leaders and officiants may refuse to conduct such ceremonies based on their beliefs.

### **Protection from Legal Sanctions**
> *"For greater certainty, no person or organization shall be deprived of any benefit, or be subject to any obligation or sanction, under any law of the Parliament of Canada solely by reason of their exercise... of the freedom of conscience and religion..."*

- This clause ensures that **religious groups and individuals cannot face penalties, fines, or legal consequences** simply for refusing to perform same-sex marriages.
- It reinforces that **religious freedom is not diminished** by the law’s recognition of same-sex marriage.

> This balance is critical — it respects both **individual rights** and **religious liberty**.

## **5. Legal Validity of Same-Sex Marriages**

### **Marriage is Not Void or Voidable Due to Sex**
> *"A marriage is not void or voidable by reason only that the spouses are of the same sex."*

- This is a **crucial legal safeguard**.
- A same-sex marriage is treated as **fully valid and binding** under Canadian law, just like a heterosexual marriage.
- It prevents courts from invalidating or declaring same-sex marriages null or void based on gender.

### **Retroactive Application of Validity**
> *"A marriage that would have been valid in Canada if the spouses were domiciled in Canada is valid for the purposes of Canadian law even though either or both of the spouses do not, at the time of the marriage, have the capacity to enter into it under the law of their respective state of domicile."*

- Allows for **retroactive recognition** of same-sex marriages that were valid under the laws of the province where they occurred — even if the couple did not meet the legal requirements (e.g., age or capacity) under the laws of their country of origin.
- This ensures **consistency and fairness** for couples who married abroad under laws that permitted same-sex marriage.

> Example: A couple from the U.S. married in a state that allowed same-sex marriage. Even if the Canadian law at the time did not recognize same-sex marriage, if the marriage would have been valid under Canadian law (e.g., if the couple had been domiciled in Canada), it is now recognized.

### **Effect of Pre-Existing Court Orders**
> *"Any court order, made in Canada or elsewhere before the coming into force of this subsection, that declares the marriage to be null or that grants a divorce to the spouses dissolves the marriage, for the purposes of Canadian law, as of the day on which the order takes effect."*

- Ensures that **prior divorce or nullity orders are respected** and take effect in Canada.
- Prevents legal uncertainty or conflict when a marriage was previously declared invalid.

## **6. Divorce Provisions (Specific to Same-Sex Couples)**

### **Eligibility for Divorce**
> The court of the province where the marriage was performed may grant a divorce if:
1. There has been a breakdown of the marriage (established by the spouses having lived separate and apart for at least one year);
2. Neither spouse resides in Canada at the time of application;
3. Each spouse is residing — and for at least one year immediately before the application, has resided — in a state where divorce is not recognized because that state does not recognize the validity of the marriage.

- This provision **addresses a unique legal challenge**: same-sex couples who live in countries that do not recognize same-sex marriage may find it difficult to obtain a divorce in Canada.
- It allows for **divorce in Canada** even when the spouses are outside the country and the jurisdiction where the marriage was performed does not allow divorce.

### **Consent Requirement**
> *"Despite paragraph (2)(c), the other spouse’s consent is required if that spouse is found in connection with the service of the application."*

- If one spouse is located and can be served, their **consent is required** — unless they are deemed incapacitated, unreasonably withholding consent, or missing.

### **Exemption from the Divorce Act**
> *"For greater certainty, the Divorce Act does not apply to a divorce granted under this Act."*

- This means that **this Act operates independently** of the general Divorce Act.
- It creates a **separate, tailored divorce process** for same-sex couples who face unique geographic and legal challenges.

### **Legal Effect of Divorce**
> *"A divorce takes effect on the day on which the judgment granting the divorce is rendered."*  
> *"On taking effect, a divorce granted under this Act has legal effect throughout Canada."*  
> *"On taking effect, a divorce granted under this Act dissolves the marriage of the spouses."*

- The divorce is **immediately effective** and recognized nationwide.
- It legally ends the marital relationship and removes all rights and obligations tied to marriage (e.g., spousal support, inheritance, property division).

---

## **7. Certification of Divorce**

> *"After a divorce takes effect, the court must, on request, issue to any person a certificate that a divorce granted under this Act dissolved the marriage of the specified persons effective as of a specified date."*

- The certificate is **conclusive proof** of the divorce.
- It is **self-authenticating** — no further proof of signature or authority is needed.
- This simplifies legal processes for individuals seeking to establish the end of a marriage (e.g., for immigration, property, or inheritance).

## **8. Court Procedures and Rules**

### **Definition of "Court"**
- Specifies which courts are responsible for handling marriage and divorce cases in each province:
  - Ontario: Superior Court of Justice  
  - Quebec
