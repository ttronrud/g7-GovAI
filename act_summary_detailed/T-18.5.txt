**Detailed Summary of the *Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada Act* (commonly referred to as the **Transportation Appeal Tribunal Act**) establishes a new, independent tribunal to handle appeals and reviews in the Canadian transportation sector. This Act replaces the former **Civil Aviation Tribunal** (the "former Tribunal") with a broader, more comprehensive body—the **Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada (the Tribunal)**—to ensure a unified, efficient, and expert administrative review process across all federal transportation areas.

The Act came into force in stages, with key provisions effective from **June 30, 2003**, and was designed to modernize and streamline the appeals process in transportation regulation, improve access to justice, and enhance fairness and transparency in administrative decision-making.
