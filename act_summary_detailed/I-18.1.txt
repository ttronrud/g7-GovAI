**Detailed Summary of the Act**

This is a **constitutional and administrative clarification act** passed by the Parliament of Canada, specifically designed to resolve a legal and procedural issue regarding the timing and validity of certain actions taken by Canadian financial institutions in relation to two international environmental funds: the **Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund** and the **Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer**.

---

### **1. Purpose of the Act**

The primary purpose of this legislation is to **ensure legal consistency and validity** of actions taken by Canadian entities (particularly through the International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act) in relation to the GEF Trust Fund and the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund **after November 15, 1994**, even though the specific regulatory order (Order in Council P.C. 1994-1879) that would have authorized those actions had not yet officially come into force at that time.

In essence, the Act **"deems"** that certain actions taken after November 15, 1994 were lawful and compliant with the requirements of Section 3 of the *International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act*, **as if** the relevant Order in Council had taken effect on that date.

### **2. Key Provisions**

#### **Section 1 – Deemed Compliance with Section 3 of the Act**
> *"Every action described in section 3 of the International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act and taken on or after November 15, 1994 in relation to the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund or the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is deemed to have been taken in accordance with that section as if Order in Council P.C. 1994-1879, made under that Act and registered as SOR/94-722, had entered into force on November 15, 1994."*

**Breakdown of this provision:**

- **Scope of actions**: The provision applies only to actions taken **on or after November 15, 1994**, involving:
  - The **Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund**
  - The **Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol**

- **Legal basis**: These actions are governed by **Section 3** of the *International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act*, which sets out the conditions under which financial institutions (such as the Canadian International Development Agency or CIDA) may provide financial assistance to international environmental funds.

- **Order in Council P.C. 1994-1879 (SOR/94-722)**:
  - This was a regulatory instrument issued under the same Act.
  - It established the specific rules and procedures for Canada’s participation in the GEF and the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund.
  - However, it **did not come into force on November 15, 1994** — it was issued earlier but only became effective later.

- **Deemed effectiveness**: The Act **"deems"** that all actions taken on or after November 15, 1994 were lawful and compliant with Section 3 **as if** the Order in Council had been effective on that date.

This is a form of **retroactive legal validation** — it does not change past facts, but it ensures that actions taken after that date are treated as having been taken under the correct legal authority, thereby avoiding legal uncertainty or challenges in court or administrative review.

#### **Section 2 – Limitation of Application**

> *"This Act does not apply to any action taken after Order in Council P.C. 1996-1784, made under the International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act and registered as SOR/96-510, comes into force or is revoked."*

**Breakdown of this provision:**

- The Act **does not apply** to any actions taken **after** the effective date (or revocation) of **Order in Council P.C. 1996-1784 (SOR/96-510)**.

- This means that:
  - If a new regulatory order (P.C. 1996-1784) was issued, and it came into force **after November 15, 1994**, then **this Act does not provide legal validity** to actions taken under that later order.
  - The new order supersedes the earlier one (P.C. 1994-1879), and therefore the "deemed compliance" provision in this Act **does not extend to actions taken under the later order**.

- This ensures **legal continuity and hierarchy**: when a new, more specific or updated regulatory instrument is issued, the earlier retroactive validation does not override the new rules.

---

### **3. Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Risk mitigation**: Before this Act, there was a legal gap — actions taken after November 15, 1994 but before the Order in Council came into force were potentially challenged as being unauthorized. This Act removes that risk by legally affirming their validity.

- **International compliance**: Canada’s participation in global environmental agreements (such as the Montreal Protocol and GEF) requires clear legal authority. This provision ensures that Canada can fulfill its international obligations without facing domestic legal challenges.

- **Administrative clarity**: It provides certainty for Canadian agencies (like CIDA or the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade) about when actions involving these funds are legally permissible.

- **Exclusion of later regulations**: The Act respects the principle of **regulatory evolution** — if a new, more detailed or updated order is issued, it takes precedence, and the earlier retroactive rule does not apply.

### **4. Timeline Context**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| November 15, 1994 | The Act applies to actions taken on or after this date. |
| Prior to November 15, 1994 | Actions are not covered by this Act. |
| Order in Council P.C. 1994-1879 (SOR/94-722) | Issued earlier, but not effective until later — this Act treats it as effective from Nov 15, 1994. |
| Order in Council P.C. 1996-1784 (SOR/96-510) | A later order that supersedes the earlier one. Actions after its effective date are **excluded** from this Act’s scope. |

### **5. Conclusion**

This Act is a **narrow, targeted legislative intervention** designed to:

- **Legally validate** actions taken by Canadian financial institutions in support of two major international environmental funds after November 15, 1994,
- Do so **without requiring new legislation or changes to the original regulatory order**,
- Ensure **legal certainty and compliance** with Canada’s international environmental commitments,
- **Respect the hierarchy of regulatory instruments** by excluding actions governed by later orders (P.C. 1996-1784).

It is not a broad reform or new policy; rather, it is a **technical and administrative fix** to close a legal gap in the implementation of Canada’s international development financial obligations.

---

**In short**:  
*This Act ensures that Canadian actions supporting environmental funds (GEF and Montreal Protocol Fund) from November 15, 1994 onward are legally valid, as if a key regulatory order had taken effect on that date — but only until a later, more recent order comes into force or is revoked.*
