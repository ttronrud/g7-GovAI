**Detailed Summary of the Borrowing Authority Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Borrowing Authority Act* is a legislative framework that establishes and regulates the authority of the **Minister of Finance** to borrow money on behalf of **Her Majesty in right of Canada**. It sets limits on the total amount of debt Canada and its associated entities may accumulate, ensures transparency in borrowing practices, and provides specific exemptions and reporting obligations. The Act operates in conjunction with the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), particularly in relation to borrowing powers and debt issuance.

This Act is not standalone in function but serves as a critical component of Canada’s fiscal oversight system, balancing the need for financial flexibility with the imperative of fiscal responsibility and public accountability.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Citation**: The Act may be cited as the *Borrowing Authority Act*.
  
- **Definitions**:
  - **Agent Corporation**: Defined to have the same meaning as under subsection 83(1) of the *Financial Administration Act*. These are entities (such as agencies or corporations) authorized by the federal government to act on its behalf in financial matters, including issuing securities.
  - **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of Finance**, who holds the primary borrowing authority under this Act.

> This establishes a clear legal basis for who has authority and what entities are included in the borrowing framework.

---

### **2. Borrowing Authority of the Minister**

> *"The Minister, with the authorization of the Governor in Council under subsection 44(1) of the Financial Administration Act and in accordance with that Act, may borrow money on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada, by way of the issue and sale of securities, as defined in section 2 of that Act, or otherwise."*

- The Minister can borrow funds **on behalf of Canada** through:
  - Issuance and sale of **securities** (e.g., bonds, notes),
  - Or other methods (e.g., loans, guarantees).
- Borrowing is **only permitted with prior approval from the Governor in Council**, as required under the *Financial Administration Act*.
- This power is granted under the broader framework of the FAA, which governs the financial operations of the federal government.

> This provision ensures that borrowing is not unilateral but subject to formal governmental oversight.

### **3. Total Borrowing Limit (Section 4)**

> *"Despite section 3 and any other Act of Parliament, but subject to section 6, the total of the following amounts must not at any time exceed $2,126,000,000,000 (i.e., $2.126 trillion):"*

#### **Components of the Limit**:
The total borrowing must not exceed **$2.126 trillion** at any point in time. This cap applies to three categories:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a)** Borrowing by the Minister under section 3 of the *Financial Administration Act* and other borrowing authority Acts listed in the Schedule | Includes all borrowings authorized under the FAA and other borrowing authority statutes (e.g., various Borrowing Authority Acts from 1986–1997). |
| **(b)** Borrowing via Canada Mortgage Bonds (CMBs) guaranteed by the **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** | Excludes: <br> - Borrowings when the Minister purchases CMBs and does **not resell** them (e.g., for temporary liquidity), <br> - Borrowings used solely for temporary liquidity purposes. |
| **(c)** Borrowing by all **agent corporations** (e.g., Crown corporations) via issuance of securities or otherwise | Excludes: <br> - Amounts borrowed **from Her Majesty in right of Canada**, <br> - Amounts deemed borrowed under **other Acts of Parliament**. |

> This cap is a **fiscal floor** designed to prevent excessive national debt accumulation. It is **absolute** — even if other laws allow borrowing, this limit is non-negotiable unless adjusted.

> **Note**: The cap is explicitly stated to **override other Acts of Parliament**, emphasizing its priority in fiscal policy.

### **4. Exemptions from the Cap (Section 4 – Exclusions)**

Certain borrowings are **not counted** in the $2.126 trillion cap:

- **Borrowings under orders made under paragraph 46.1(c) of the FAA** (specifically, during the period **March 23, 2021 – May 6, 2021**) — *except* those made during that window.
- **Borrowings under orders made under paragraph 46.1(a)** for debt related to prior borrowings under 46.1(c) — *except* those related to borrowings made during the March 23 – May 6, 2021 period.

> These exemptions appear to relate to **emergency or pandemic-related borrowing** (e.g., during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis). The exclusion allows temporary flexibility during exceptional circumstances.

> **Important**: The 2021 period (March 23 – May 6) is a **specific exception** — it was likely used to cover urgent liquidity needs during the pandemic.

---

### **5. Exception to the Cap (Section 5)**

> *"The Minister may borrow an amount under an order made under paragraph 46.1(a) or (b) of the Financial Administration Act even if that borrowing causes the maximum amount referred to in section 4 of this Act to be exceeded."*

- This provision allows the Minister to **transcend the $2.126 trillion cap** if borrowing occurs under specific emergency orders (46.1(a) or (b)) of the FAA.
- This is a **critical exception** that enables emergency financing during crises (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters).
- However, such borrowing is **not a permanent override** — it only applies when the Minister acts under these specific provisions.

> This reflects a **risk-based approach**: while the cap is strict, it is designed to be flexible during emergencies.

### **6. Compliance and Oversight (Section 7)**

> *"In the exercise of the Minister’s powers and duties under subsection 14(1) of the National Housing Act in respect of guarantees of Canada Mortgage Bonds by the CMHC, and of his or her powers and duties under subsections 127(2) and (3) of the Financial Administration Act in respect of agent corporations, the Minister must ensure that the maximum amount referred to in section 4 of this Act is not exceeded."*

- The Minister is **legally obligated** to ensure that:
  - CMHC’s guarantees of CMBs do not cause the cap to be exceeded,
  - Agent corporations do not exceed the borrowing limit when acting under their delegated powers.

> This reinforces **fiscal responsibility** in key financial instruments and ensures that even in housing or agency-specific lending, the national debt ceiling is respected.

---

### **7. Reporting Requirements (Section 8)**

The Minister is required to **submit regular reports** to both Houses of Parliament to ensure transparency and accountability.

#### **Reporting Timeline**:
- **First Report**: Within **three years** of the Act coming into force, or within the **next 30 days** if Parliament is not sitting on the last day of that period.
- **Subsequent Reports**: On or before **May 31** of the year following the end of the **third fiscal year** after a previous report was tabled — or within the next 30 days if Parliament is not sitting on that date.

#### **Content of Reports**:
The report must include:
1. The total amount of borrowed money under each of:
   - Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of section 4 (i.e., Minister, CMBs, agent corporations),
2. The total amount of money borrowed under orders made under:
   - Paragraphs 46.1(a) to (c) of the *Financial Administration Act*,
3. **The Minister’s assessment** of whether the $2.126 trillion cap should be **increased or decreased**.

> This reporting requirement ensures **public accountability**, allows for parliamentary scrutiny, and provides a mechanism for **policy review**.

> **Note**: The 2021 repeal of certain reporting items (s. 18) has been removed — the current version includes the assessment of cap adjustment.

> **Exception for 2021 period**: Any borrowings made between **March 23, 2021 and May 6, 2021** under 46.1(c) do **not count** in the calculation of borrowing under paragraph (1)(b) of the report.

> This ensures that pandemic-era borrowing is not double-counted or penalized in the reporting system.
