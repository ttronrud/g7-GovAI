**Detailed Summary of the World Autism Awareness Day Act**

---

**1. Purpose and Context**

The *World Autism Awareness Day Act* is a legislative measure enacted by the Government of Canada to recognize and promote awareness of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across the country. The Act is rooted in a series of recognized societal, health, and international concerns, including:

- The significant impact of autism spectrum disorders on Canadian families.
- The existence of Canada’s healthcare system and social safety net, which are intended to support individuals with disabilities and promote well-being.
- The current inequity in access to autism-related services across different regions of Canada—leading to disparities in care, early intervention, and support.
- The global rise in autism diagnoses, indicating a growing need for awareness, research, and inclusive policies.
- The importance of early diagnosis and intervention in improving outcomes for individuals with autism, enabling greater social participation and self-reliance.
- The fact that autism has no known cure or definitive cause, emphasizing the need for supportive services and societal understanding.
- Canada’s international obligations under the **United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)** and the **United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)**, which affirm that children and persons with disabilities must enjoy full rights, dignity, and opportunities for active community participation.

Additionally, the Act acknowledges the United Nations’ recognition of autism as a global issue. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly formally designated **April 2** as **World Autism Awareness Day**, beginning in 2008. Canada, as a signatory to these international agreements and a member of the United Nations, supports this global initiative and seeks to align national policy with international best practices.
