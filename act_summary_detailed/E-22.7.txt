**Detailed Summary of the *Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act* (ESTMA)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act* (ESTMA) is a Canadian legislative framework designed to **combat corruption** in the extractive sector — namely, the exploration, extraction, and commercial development of oil, gas, and minerals — by enhancing **transparency, accountability, and reporting obligations** for entities involved in these activities.

The Act aligns Canada with international anti-corruption commitments, particularly those under the **United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)** and other global standards. Its primary goal is to **deter and detect illicit payments** made to government officials, public bodies, or state-linked entities, especially those that may be used to influence decisions related to permits, licenses, or contracts.

## **Key Components of the Act**

---

### **1. Definitions**

The Act establishes precise definitions to ensure clarity and consistency across its provisions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Category of Payment** | Includes: taxes (excluding consumption and personal income taxes), royalties, fees (rental, entry, regulatory), production entitlements, bonuses (signature, discovery, production), dividends (non-ordinary), infrastructure improvement payments, and any other prescribed category. |
| **Commercial Development of Oil, Gas or Minerals** | Encompasses exploration/extraction, acquisition of permits/licenses, and any other prescribed activities. |
| **Entity** | A corporation, trust, partnership, or unincorporated organization engaged in commercial development of oil, gas, or minerals in Canada or abroad; or any entity that controls such an organization. |
| **Gas** | Natural gas, including all substances produced with it (e.g., condensate, associated liquids). |
| **Minerals** | All naturally occurring metallic and non-metallic minerals — including coal, salt, quarry materials, rare earths, and precious metals. |
| **Oil** | Crude petroleum, bitumen, and oil shale. |
| **Payee** | Includes: Canadian or foreign governments, intergovernmental bodies, government-established trusts, commissions, corporations, or authorities exercising governmental functions. Also includes any other prescribed payee. |
| **Payment** | Any monetary or in-kind payment made to a payee in relation to commercial development of oil, gas, or minerals, falling within one of the defined categories. |

> **Key Interpretations**:
> - Payments to employees or public office holders of a payee are **deemed to have been made to the payee**.
> - Payments received by non-payee bodies on behalf of a payee are **deemed to have been made to the payee**.
> - If an entity is controlled by another, the **controlling entity is deemed to have made the payment**.
> - The **value of in-kind payments** is the cost to the entity (or fair market value if cost is unascertainable).

### **2. Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The central purpose of ESTMA is to:
- Implement Canada’s international anti-corruption obligations.
- Enhance transparency in the extractive sector.
- Impose **mandatory reporting requirements** on entities regarding payments made to public bodies.
- Deter and detect **corruption**, including acts prohibited under:
  - Sections 119–121 and 341 of the *Criminal Code* (corruption of public officials).
  - Sections 3 and 4 of the *Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act* (CFPOA).

This helps prevent **bribery, kickbacks, and undue influence** in awarding licenses, permits, or contracts.

### **3. Scope of Application**

Sections 9 to 13 apply to entities that meet **one or more of the following criteria**:

#### **Eligible Entities**:
- Entities listed on a Canadian stock exchange.
- Entities with a place of business, operations, or assets in Canada, and that meet **at least two** of the following conditions in **at least one of their two most recent financial years**:
  - Assets ≥ $20 million
  - Revenue ≥ $40 million
  - Average employment ≥ 250 employees
- Any other entity prescribed by regulation.

> **Continuity Rule**: If an entity ceases to meet these criteria before the end of a reporting period (e.g., under section 12 or 13), it remains subject to the reporting obligations **until the end of the applicable period**.

### **4. Reporting Obligations**

#### **Mandatory Reporting Timeline**
- Every entity must submit a **report to the Minister** not later than **150 days after the end of each financial year**.

#### **When Payments Must Be Disclosed**
An entity must disclose payments within a category of payment if:
- The total amount paid to the **same payee** during the year reaches:
  - The **amount prescribed by regulation** for that category; **or**
  - If no amount is prescribed, **$100,000**.

> **Special Rule for Government Bodies**: Payments to a body established to perform governmental functions are **deemed to be payments to the government** for which it acts.

#### **Content of the Report**
- Must include an **attestation** by:
  - A director/officer of the entity, or
  - An independent auditor/accountant
  - Confirming that the information is **true, accurate, and complete**.

#### **Minister’s Authority to Specify Reporting Format**
- The Minister may specify:
  - How payments are organized (e.g., by project, region, or type)
  - The form and structure of the report
- These requirements must be **made publicly available**.

#### **Acceptable Substitutes from Other Jurisdictions**
- If the Minister determines that **another jurisdiction’s reporting requirements** achieve the same transparency goals, those requirements may be accepted as a substitute for ESTMA’s reporting obligations.
- The determination must be in writing and made publicly accessible.
- To qualify:
  - The entity must submit the required report to the **competent authority** in that jurisdiction.
  - Provide a **copy to the Minister** in the form and timeframe required by the jurisdiction.
  - Meet any conditions imposed by the Minister.

#### **Reporting by Parent-Subsidiary Entities**
- If an entity and its **wholly owned subsidiary** are both subject to the Act:
  - The **subsidiary is deemed to have reported** if:
    1. The parent submits a full report including subsidiary payment data.
    2. The subsidiary notifies the Minister in writing that the parent is providing the report.
    3. The subsidiary submits its own report covering any payments not covered by the parent’s report.
