**Detailed Summary of the *Land Titles Repeal Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Land Titles Repeal Act* is a federal statute enacted by Her Majesty in Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. Its primary purpose is to **repeal the federal *Land Titles Act* in respect of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories**, where it has been replaced by **territorial land titles ordinances** that are deemed to be equivalent in substance and function. The Act provides a structured, conditional framework for this repeal, ensuring continuity, legal consistency, and protection for land registration systems, while also addressing transitional financial and indemnity obligations.

---

### **Key Definitions and Scope**  
- **"Territory"** refers to either the **Yukon** or the **Northwest Territories**, depending on context.  
- The Act applies only to these two territories, not to Nunavut or other regions.  
- The repeal process is governed by orders made by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet), which must be consistent with the requirements set out in the Act.

---

### **Repeal Process and Conditions**  

#### **1. Repeal Mechanism**  
- The Governor in Council may, by **order**, repeal the *Land Titles Act* in a Territory **on the same day** that a territorial land titles ordinance comes into force.  
- This ensures a **smooth transition** from the old federal system to the new territorial system without gaps in land registration.

> **Note**: The first such order was issued on July 19, 1993 (Statutory Instrument SI/93-151).

#### **2. Conditions for Repeal (Subsection 3(2))**  
Before repealing the *Land Titles Act*, the Governor in Council must be satisfied that the territorial ordinance meets **three key criteria**:

1. **Derived from the Torrens System**  
   - The new land registration system must be based on the **Torrens system**, which provides a **title registration system** where a certificate of title is a conclusive evidence of ownership (subject to exceptions), and land titles are protected by a statutory registry.

2. **Substantive Similarity to the Old Act**  
   - The new ordinance must be **substantially similar** in content and function to the *Land Titles Act* as it existed **immediately before repeal**.

3. **Specific Provisions Required**  
   These are mandatory, territory-specific requirements:
   - **Northwest Territories**: Must include provisions with the **same effect as subsections 55(1) to (4)** of the old Act.  
     *(These relate to land title registration, transfer, and the rights of parties in land transactions.)*
   - **Yukon**: Must include provisions with the **same effect as sections 55 and 56** of the old Act.  
     *(These cover similar registration and transfer rights.)*
   - **Easements**: Must provide for the **grant and registration of easements** as defined in subsection 80(2) of the old Act.  
     *(This ensures that rights to use land for purposes like utilities or access are legally protected.)*
   - **Caveats**: Must **prohibit the registration of caveats** (legal notices of claims) on land where **no certificate of title has been granted or applied for**.  
     *(This prevents frivolous or speculative claims on unregistered land, maintaining clarity and stability in title.)*

#### **3. Waiver of Conditions**  
- The Governor in Council may **waive any condition** in subsection (2) by order.  
- This provides flexibility, especially in cases where a territorial government has adopted a system that is not fully aligned with the old Act but still provides a functional and fair system.

#### **4. Waiver for Land Claims Agreements**  
- The Governor in Council **must waive** any condition in subsection (2) **to the extent necessary** to implement a **land claims agreement** with any **aboriginal people of Canada**.  
- This recognizes the importance of **aboriginal rights and self-determination** in land governance and allows for tailored land title systems in areas affected by land claims settlements.

### **Protections Against Unauthorized Repeal or Amendment**  

#### **5. Protection of Key Provisions**  
- Despite any other legislation, **the Legislature of Yukon or the Northwest Territories cannot repeal, amend, or render inoperative** any provision described in **paragraph 3(2)(c)** of the Act.  
- This provision ensures that **critical elements of the old land title system** (such as those related to certificates of title, easements, and caveats) **remain in force** even if territorial laws are otherwise changed.  
- This is a **constitutional safeguard** to prevent erosion of land title rights.

#### **6. Extension to Nunavut**  
- The restriction applies to the **Legislature of Nunavut** as well, specifically to laws that correspond to the provisions described in:
  - Subparagraphs **(c)(i)**: Certificates of title  
  - Subparagraphs **(c)(iii)** and **(iv)**: Easements and caveats  
- This ensures consistency across Canada’s territories in protecting land title rights.

---

### **Conclusive Evidence of Title**  

#### **7. Certificates of Title as Conclusive Evidence**  
- A law of the **Yukon, Northwest Territories, or Nunavut** may provide that a certificate of title granted under that law is **conclusive evidence in all courts against Her Majesty** (i.e., the Crown), **subject to the same exceptions** as existed in the *Land Titles Act* before repeal.

> This means that once a certificate of title is issued, it is generally **final and binding**, unless one of the established exceptions applies (e.g., fraud, defective registration, etc.).

#### **8. Variability of Exceptions**  
- The exceptions to the conclusive effect of certificates **may be varied, deleted, or added**, **with the approval of the Governor in Council**.  
- This allows for **flexibility** in adapting the rules to new legal or social realities, while still maintaining oversight and accountability.

### **Financial Transition and Assurance Fund**  

#### **9. Payment to Territorial Governments**  
- When the *Land Titles Act* is repealed in a Territory, the **Minister of Finance** shall pay to the **Government of that Territory** a share of the **assurance fund** (a fund established under section 163 of the old Act to protect landowners from losses due to title disputes).

> The amount paid is **proportional** to the value of transactions involving land in that Territory at the time of repeal.

#### **10. Interest Apportionment**  
- Interest that has accrued on the assurance fund is **apportioned to the Territory** in the **same ratio** as the transactions attributable to that Territory.

> This ensures that the territorial government receives a fair share of the fund’s growth, reflecting its actual land activity.

### **Indemnity Provisions (Risk Protection)**  

#### **11. Indemnity from Government of Canada to Territorial Government**  
- The **Government of Canada** is **indemnified** by the **Government of a Territory** against any claim, action, or proceeding for damages arising from the **administration of the land registration system** in that Territory **after** the repeal of the *Land Titles Act*.

> This protects the federal government from liability for actions taken under the new territorial system.

- **Limitation**: This indemnity applies **only to claims arising after the repeal**.  
- **Limitation on amount**: If the claim arises **before** the repeal, the indemnity is **limited to the amount paid under section 6** (the assurance fund payment).

#### **12. Indemnity from Government of Canada to Territory (for pre-repeal claims)**  
- The **Government of Canada** indemnifies the **Territory** against claims **in excess of the assurance fund payment** that arise **before** the repeal of the *Land Titles Act*.

> This protects the territorial government from financial exposure due to pre-existing administrative issues.

- **Limitation**: The indemnity is limited to the **difference** between the amount awarded in the claim and the amount paid to the Territory under section 6.

#### **13. No Indemnity if Claim is Settled Without Approval**  
- A Government is **not entitled to indemnity** if it has **settled a claim without the approval of the other Government**.  
- This prevents unilateral settlements that could undermine the balance of responsibility between federal and territorial authorities.

#### **14. Funding of Indemnities**  
- All indemnity payments under this section are to be made **out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund**.  
- This ensures that the payments are **funded through regular government revenue**, not from special or discretionary sources.

---

### **Amendments Clause**  
- The Act includes a general **"Amendments"** clause, indicating that future amendments may be made to the Act to adapt to changing circumstances, legal developments, or policy shifts.  
- However, no specific amendments are detailed in the text provided.
