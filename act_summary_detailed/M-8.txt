**Detailed Summary of the *Ministries and Ministers of State Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Ministries and Ministers of State Act* establishes a legal framework for the creation, modification, and termination of **ministries of State** within the federal government of Canada. These are special, temporary, or focused units of the federal public administration created to address specific policy needs that require dedicated leadership and coordination. The Act provides clear procedures for establishing such ministries, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring parliamentary accountability.

It also defines the roles and powers of **ministers of State**—both those who head ministries of State and those who serve in advisory or support roles within existing departments.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority to Establish a Ministry of State**
- **Trigger for Creation**: The Governor in Council (i.e., the Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) may establish a **ministry of State** if it appears that:
  - There is a need for **new and comprehensive policy development**.
  - The matter(s) fall within the **responsibility of the Government of Canada**.
  - A dedicated, focused administrative structure is required to manage such policy formulation effectively.

> This provision allows for flexibility in responding to emerging policy challenges (e.g., climate change, digital transformation, national security) without requiring long-term structural changes or new legislation.

---

### **2. Requirements for a Proclamation Establishing a Ministry of State**
A proclamation establishing a ministry must:
- **Name the ministry** (e.g., Ministry of State for Climate Resilience).
- **Specify the matter or matters** to which the ministry is assigned (e.g., "the development of national strategies for renewable energy").
- **Detail the powers, duties, and functions** of the minister responsible for the ministry in relation to policy development.

> This ensures clarity, transparency, and accountability in defining the scope and responsibilities of the new ministry.

---

### **3. Modification and Termination of a Ministry of State**
- The Governor in Council may:
  - **Change the name** of an existing ministry of State.
  - **Vary any aspect** of the original proclamation (e.g., expand or narrow the policy focus).
  - **Terminate** the ministry at any time, provided there is no ongoing statutory or operational requirement.

> This gives the government flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances or shifting priorities.

---

### **4. Parliamentary Oversight and Approval Process**
This is a critical element of democratic accountability.

#### **Requirement for Parliamentary Approval:**
- Before an order in council authorizing a proclamation under Section 2 or 4 (establishment or amendment) can be issued:
  - The **proposed text of the order** must be **laid before the House of Commons** by a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada.
  - The making of the order must be **approved by a resolution of the House of Commons**.

> This ensures that the creation or modification of a ministry of State is not made unilaterally by the executive branch but is subject to democratic scrutiny and approval.

#### **Debate and Voting Rules:**
- Once laid before Parliament, a **motion** proposing approval of the order must be debated.
- The debate is limited to **no more than seven hours**.
- After that, the question is decided **in accordance with the rules of the House of Commons**.

> This shortens the process while still allowing for meaningful discussion, balancing efficiency with democratic oversight.

---

### **5. Appointment and Role of the Minister of State for a Ministry of State**
- Each ministry of State is headed by a **Minister of State**, appointed by **commission under the Great Seal**.
- The minister:
  - Holds office **during pleasure** (i.e., at the discretion of the Governor in Council).
  - Has **management and direction** of the ministry.
  - Is responsible for **formulating and developing policies** in the area specified in the proclamation.

> This structure provides a clear chain of command and enables focused leadership on specific policy issues.

---

### **6. Appointment of a Secretary**
- The Governor in Council may appoint a **Secretary** to serve as the **chief executive officer** of the ministry.
- The Secretary:
  - Holds office during pleasure.
  - Manages day-to-day operations and implementation of policy decisions.

> This allows for effective administrative management while maintaining ministerial oversight.

---

### **7. Expansion of Powers and Responsibilities**
- In addition to the powers specified in the proclamation, the minister may:
  - Be assigned or transferred **additional powers, duties, or functions** by or under **any Act of Parliament**.
- This enables the ministry to take on broader responsibilities as new legislation or government priorities evolve.

> This flexibility ensures that the ministry can adapt to evolving policy needs and legislative mandates.

---

### **8. Annual Reporting Requirement**
- The minister of State for a ministry of State must submit a **report to Parliament**:
  - **On or before January 31** of the year following the end of each fiscal year.
  - If Parliament is not sitting, the report must be submitted on **any of the first five days after the start of a sitting session** in either House.

> This ensures **transparency and accountability**, allowing Parliament to assess the performance, effectiveness, and outcomes of the ministry’s work.

---

### **9. Role of Non-Head Ministers of State**
- A **Minister of State** (not heading a ministry of State) may be assigned by the Governor in Council to:
  - Assist any minister or group of ministers in carrying out their responsibilities.
  - Exercise or perform powers, duties, or functions assigned to them under any Act of Parliament.

> This allows for **inter-departmental coordination**, enabling ministers to delegate tasks or provide specialized expertise when needed.

---

### **10. Use of Departmental Resources**
- When a Minister of State provides assistance or performs duties:
  - They are entitled to **use the services and facilities** of the relevant department or portion of the federal public administration.

> This ensures operational feasibility and enables effective collaboration across government agencies.

## **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Flexibility** | Allows rapid response to emerging policy issues without creating permanent departments. |
| **Accountability** | Requires parliamentary approval and annual reporting to ensure transparency. |
| **Parliamentary Oversight** | The House of Commons must approve any new or changed ministry, preventing executive overreach. |
| **Temporary Nature** | Ministries of State are not permanent; they can be created, modified, or dissolved at the government’s discretion. |
| **Clear Structure** | Defines roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines for ministers and secretaries. |
| **Interdepartmental Cooperation** | Enables cross-departmental support through designated ministers. |

## **Examples of Potential Use Cases**
- Establishing a **Ministry of State for Digital Transformation** to develop a national digital strategy.
- Creating a **Ministry of State for Indigenous Relations** to advance policy on reconciliation and self-determination.
- Forming a **Ministry of State for Climate Action** to coordinate federal climate policy across sectors.

---

## **Limitations and Constraints**
- **No automatic funding**: The Act does not specify funding mechanisms; budgetary allocation would be determined separately.
- **No permanent status**: Ministries are temporary and may not survive beyond the policy cycle.
- **Dependence on parliamentary approval**: Any creation or change requires legislative endorsement, which may slow implementation.
- **Limited scope**: The ministry is restricted to policy formulation and development, not implementation or operational management.

---

## **Conclusion**
The *Ministries and Ministers of State Act* serves as a **pragmatic and flexible tool** for the Canadian government to respond to complex, urgent, or evolving policy challenges. By enabling the creation of temporary, specialized ministries under clear rules and with strong parliamentary oversight, the Act strengthens both **policy responsiveness** and **democratic accountability**.

It balances the need for executive agility with the essential requirement that such actions be transparent, scrutinized, and accountable to Parliament.

This Act is particularly valuable in times of crisis, innovation, or structural change, where a permanent department may not be justified yet, but a focused policy initiative is urgently needed.
