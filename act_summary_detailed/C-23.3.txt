### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Tourism Commission Act**

The **Canadian Tourism Commission Act** is a federal statute enacted to strengthen Canada’s commitment to the tourism industry by establishing a dedicated, independent body—the **Canadian Tourism Commission (Commission)**—to promote, market, and support Canadian tourism both domestically and internationally. The Act was passed in 2001 and came into force on **January 2, 2001**, with the goal of ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of Canada’s tourism sector.

Below is a comprehensive, structured summary of the key provisions and objectives of the Act:

---

## **I. Background and Purpose (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with three foundational "whereas" clauses that establish the importance of tourism in Canada:

1. **Cultural and Social Identity**: Tourism is vital to Canada’s social and cultural identity and integrity.
2. **Economic Contribution**: The tourism industry plays a crucial role in the economic well-being of Canadians and supports government economic objectives.
3. **Entrepreneurship and Job Creation**: The industry is largely composed of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), making it essential for entrepreneurial development and employment generation.

These clauses underscore the need for a coordinated, strategic, and collaborative approach to tourism policy and promotion.
