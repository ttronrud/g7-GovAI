### **Detailed Summary of the *Carriage by Air Act***  
*(Also known as the *Warsaw Convention* implemented in Canada)*

---

## **Overview**

The **Carriage by Air Act** is a Canadian statute that incorporates and gives legal effect to the **Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air**, commonly known as the **Warsaw Convention (1929)**, and its subsequent amendments through **Protocols**. This Act ensures uniformity and predictability in the rights and liabilities of all parties involved in international air carriage — including carriers, passengers, consignors, consignees, and agents — regardless of the nationality of the aircraft or the countries involved.

The Act applies to **all international air carriage**, whether commercial or gratuitous, and establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing contracts, documentation, liability, and jurisdiction.

## **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

### **1. Citation and Scope**
- The Act is cited as the **Carriage by Air Act**.
- The term **"party"** includes **High Contracting Parties** as defined in **Article 40A of the Warsaw Convention** (Schedule I), which refers to states that have ratified or acceded to the Convention.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that the legal obligations of international air carriers are clearly defined and universally recognized.

---

### **2. Interpretation of "Agent"**
- Any reference to **"agent"** in the English version of Schedule I is **read as "servant or agent"**.
- This broadens the scope to include both employees and authorized representatives of carriers.

> *Implication*: Carriers’ servants and agents are bound by the same rights and liabilities as the carrier itself under the Convention.

---

### **3. Binding Force of the Conventions**
Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the following **three international conventions** (set out in Schedules I, V, and VI) have **full force and effect in Canada** for any carriage by air:

#### **(a) Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air (Schedule I – Warsaw Convention, 1929)**
- Applies to **international carriage** of persons, baggage, and cargo.
- Covers liability of carriers, passengers, consignors, and consignees.
- **Applies regardless of the nationality of the aircraft**.

#### **(b) Convention as Amended by the Protocol of 1952 (Schedule III or III & IV)**
- The 1952 Protocol (and later amendments via Schedules III and IV) modifies the original Warsaw Convention.
- These amendments **extend coverage** and **clarify liability**, especially concerning:
  - Liability for death or bodily injury of passengers.
  - Liability for damage to baggage or cargo.
  - Rules on the use of documents and claims.
- The amended Convention applies to **all international carriage** where the modified rules are relevant.

#### **(c) Convention on the Liability of Carriers for Damage to Cargo (Schedule VI)**
- Focuses on **liability for damage to cargo**.
- Applies to carriage by air where the conditions of Schedule VI are met.
- Also applies **regardless of the nationality of the aircraft**.

> *Key Principle*: The provisions of these conventions **take precedence over Canadian domestic laws** in matters related to carriage by air, even if the carriage is conducted by a foreign carrier or aircraft.

### **4. Certification of Parties by the Governor in Council**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government) may, by **proclamation in the Canada Gazette**, certify:
  - Who are the **parties** to each convention or protocol.
  - The **territories** they are parties to.
  - Whether they have availed themselves of the **Additional Protocol** (Schedule I).
  - Whether they have made declarations under **Protocols III/IV** or **Schedule VI**.

> *Purpose*: Provides clarity on which countries are bound by the Convention and what specific rights or limitations they have accepted.

---

### **5. Interpretation of Territorial Scope**
- Any reference in Schedule I to the "territory of a party" is interpreted as referring to:
  - Territories under the party’s **sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority**, even if the territory is not a sovereign state (e.g., territories under UN administration).

> *Example*: Carriage from a U.S. airport to a French overseas territory would still be considered international under this rule.

---

### **6. Liability for Passenger Death (Article 17)**
- Liability imposed by **Article 17 of Schedule I or Schedule VI** for the **death of a passenger** **replaces** any liability that would otherwise exist under **Canadian law**.
- The **provisions in Schedule II** govern:
  - Who can enforce the claim (e.g., the passenger’s estate, family members).
  - How the claim can be enforced (e.g., through court action).

> *Key Point*: This ensures that passenger deaths due to carrier negligence are covered under a **uniform international standard**, not subject to inconsistent national laws.

---

### **7. Currency Conversion (Article 22)**
- Any sum in **French francs** mentioned in Article 22 of the Convention must be **converted into Canadian dollars** at the exchange rate prevailing on the date the damage is determined by a court.
- The conversion process is:
  1. Convert francs to **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)** at a fixed rate: **1 SDR = 15.075 francs**.
  2. Convert SDRs to **Canadian dollars** using the **rate set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)**.

> *Purpose*: Ensures fair and consistent compensation in Canadian currency, avoiding fluctuation issues during claims.

---

### **8. Jurisdiction and Submission to Canadian Courts**
- **Parties to the Warsaw Convention who have NOT availed themselves of the Additional Protocol** are **deemed to have submitted** to the **jurisdiction of Canadian courts** under **paragraph 4(2)(a) of the State Immunity Act**.
- **Parties to the Convention in Schedule VI** (cargo liability) are **deemed to have submitted** to Canadian jurisdiction under **Article 33**, unless they have made a declaration to the contrary.

> *Significance*: This allows passengers, consignors, or claimants to bring legal actions in **Canadian courts** to enforce rights under the Convention, even if the carrier is from another country.

---

### **9. Application to Domestic Carriage (via Orders or Regulations)**
- The Governor in Council may issue **orders or regulations** that apply the provisions of:
  - Schedule I, V, or VI
  - Section 2 of the Act
  to **non-international carriage** (i.e., domestic flights) **if specified** in the order or regulation.
- Such applications may include **exceptions, adaptations, or modifications** tailored to domestic operations.

> *Note*: This allows flexibility in applying international rules to domestic air transport, though only if authorized by the government.

---

### **10. Amendments to the Warsaw Convention (Schedule I)**
- In this Act, **references to Schedule I** are interpreted as if the Convention were **amended by the 1952 Protocol (Schedule III)** or by **Schedules III and IV** — **depending on the nature of the carriage**:
  - For **international carriage**: applies the Convention as amended by the 1952 Protocol.
  - For **non-international carriage (domestic)**: applies the Convention as amended by Schedules III and IV.

> *Rationale*: Reflects the evolution of international air law and ensures modern rules (e.g., on liability for injuries) apply to current practices.

### **11. The Warsaw Convention (Schedule I) – Core Provisions**

#### **Definition of "International Carriage"**
- Applies when:
  - The **place of departure and destination** are in **two High Contracting Parties**, or
  - Both are within the **same party**, but there is an **agreed stopping place** in a territory under another Power’s sovereignty (even if that Power is not a party to the Convention).
- A carriage with **no agreed stopping place** within a single country is **not considered international**.

> *Example*: A flight from Toronto to Montreal with a stop in Quebec is not international, but a flight from Toronto to Paris with a stop in Brussels (a non-signatory) may still be international if the parties agree on the stop.

#### **Multiple Carriers (Chain of Carriers)**
- A series of successive air carriers performing a journey is treated as **one undivided carriage** if:
  - The parties consider it a **single operation**.
  - It is governed by a single contract (or series of contracts).
- The international character is **not lost** if one segment is entirely within a single country.

> *Purpose*: Prevents fragmentation of liability and ensures consistency in claims.

### **12. Required Documentation**

#### **(a) Passenger Ticket**
- Must contain:
  - Place and date of issue
  - Place of departure and destination
  - Agreed stopping places (carrier may alter them in emergencies — no loss of international character)
  - Name and address of carrier(s)
  - Statement that carriage is subject to liability rules under the Convention
- **Absence or irregularity of the ticket** does **not invalidate** the contract.
- However, if the carrier **accepts a passenger without a ticket**, they **cannot benefit from any provisions that limit or exclude liability**.

#### **(b) Baggage Check**
- Must be **
