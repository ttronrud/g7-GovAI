**Detailed Summary of the Weights and Measures Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Weights and Measures Act* is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation in Canada that establishes standards, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and fairness of measurements used in trade. Its primary objective is to protect consumers, promote fair business practices, and maintain uniformity in the measurement of goods and services across Canada.

The Act defines key terms, establishes the legal framework for approved measuring devices, mandates the use of standardized units of measurement, and provides for inspection, enforcement, and penalties where necessary. It also outlines procedures for the calibration and certification of standards and grants authority to the federal government to adapt to technological changes.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Dealer / Trader** | Any individual or entity engaged in selling, importing, leasing, or lending devices used in trade. |
| **Device** | Any instrument used to measure mass, weight, volume, length, area, temperature, or time — including attached equipment that affects accuracy. |
| **Inspector** | A designated official authorized to verify compliance with the Act. |
| **Local Standard** | A standard designated by the Minister to be used in trade, calibrated and certified against a reference standard. |
| **Reference Standard** | A high-accuracy standard certified by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), used to calibrate local standards. |
| **Measure (as verb/noun)** | Includes "weigh" or "weight" — refers to the act or quantity of measurement. |
| **Measuring Machine** | Any machine measuring length, area, volume, capacity, temperature, or time. |
| **Weighing Machine** | A machine that measures mass or weight. |
| **Static Measure** | A fixed-measure device (e.g., a bottle or container) with no moving parts that could affect accuracy. |

## **Core Provisions and Functions**

### **1. Approval of Devices for Trade (Section 3)**

- The **Minister** may approve devices, classes, types, or designs of devices for use in trade **based on regulations**.
- During evaluation, the Minister may grant **temporary approval** with specific conditions and time limits.
- Approval ensures that devices meet required accuracy standards and are suitable for commercial use.

> *Purpose*: Prevents the use of inaccurate or untested measuring equipment in commerce.

---

### **2. Standard Units of Measurement (Section 7)**

- All units of measurement in Canada must be based on the **International System of Units (SI)** established by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).
- The **basic, supplementary, and derived units** (e.g., meter, second, kilogram) are defined in **Parts I–III of Schedule I**.
- **Customary units** (e.g., inches, pounds, gallons) are permitted under **Part IV of Schedule I**, as commonly used alongside SI units.
- **Prefixes** (e.g., kilo-, milli-, centi-) for multiples/submultiples are defined in **Part V of Schedule I**.
- **Canadian units** (e.g., "acre," "furlong") are listed in **Schedule II**, with defined symbols and abbreviations.
- **Exception**: In Quebec, **seigneurial land** may still be described using traditional units (Schedule III), preserving historical legal practices.

> *Purpose*: Ensures consistency and clarity in measurement across sectors and regions.

---

### **3. Amendments to Measurement Schedules (Governor in Council Powers)**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may:
  - Add or delete units or prefixes in Schedules I–V.
  - Add or remove Canadian units in Schedule II.
  - Add symbols or abbreviations.
  - Delete existing symbols/abbreviations.
- **Critical Restriction**: Amendments to Schedule II **cannot alter the ratio** between units (e.g., cannot change 1 acre = 4047 m²).

> *Purpose*: Maintains stability in legal and commercial measurements, prevents unintended distortions.

---

### **4. Prohibition on Unauthorized Units (Section 8)**

- No person may use a unit of measurement **unless**:
  - It is listed in **Schedule I or II**, or
  - It is **authorized by regulation**.
- This prevents the use of unofficial or misleading units in trade.

> *Purpose*: Prevents fraud, deception, and inconsistent pricing.

---

### **5. Requirements for Devices in Trade (Section 9)**

- Every trader must:
  - Use only **approved devices**.
  - Have the device **examined and certified** by an inspector to confirm compliance with accuracy requirements.
- For **non-static measures**, the device must be certified by an inspector.
- **Static measures** (e.g., pre-packaged containers) are exempt from certification if they are inherently fixed and do not allow adjustment.

> *Purpose*: Ensures all commercial measuring tools are accurate and reliable.

---

### **6. Accuracy of Quantities in Trade (Section 10)**

- Commodity quantities must be:
  - Stated **accurately within prescribed error limits**.
  - Expressed in **clear, standardized units** (length, area, volume, capacity, mass, or weight).
- Applies to:
  - The commodity itself,
  - The packaging, or
  - Shipping documents (e.g., bills of lading).
- **Exception**: Applies only to commodities that are not already packaged or labeled under another federal law.

> *Purpose*: Protects consumers from misrepresentation and ensures transparency in pricing.

### **7. Regulatory Authority (Section 10 – Governor in Council Powers)**

The Governor in Council may make detailed regulations covering:

| Regulation Area | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Application process** | How to apply for device approval. |
| **Expiry dates** | Devices must be capable of measuring SI units after a certain date. |
| **Temperature scales** | Establishes official scales and their uses. |
| **Inspector duties** | How inspectors conduct examinations and verify compliance. |
| **Lot/shipment verification** | How to determine if a quantity meets accuracy standards. |
| **Adjustment requirements** | When a device must be examined after repair, alteration, or adjustment. |
| **Device location reporting** | Traders must report where devices are located. |
| **Seal/removal reporting** | Must report breaking or removing seals or markings. |
| **Design and performance specs** | Devices must conform to technical specifications before approval. |
| **Geographic phase-outs** | Prohibits use of non-SI units in specific areas or timeframes. |
| **Seizure and forfeiture** | Procedures for detaining or forfeiting non-compliant goods. |

- Interested parties are given a **reasonable opportunity to make representations**.
- If a regulation was previously published (even after amendments), it does not need to be re-published.

> *Purpose*: Ensures transparency, public input, and accountability in rule-making.

---

### **9. Temporary Use of Non-Standard Units (Section 10 – Subsection m)**

- The Minister may authorize the use of **non-standard units** where **new technologies** require them (e.g., digital or AI-based measurement systems).
