**Detailed Summary of the *Health of Animals Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Health of Animals Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to protect both animal and human health by regulating the movement, handling, and management of animals and animal-related products. It establishes strict controls on the presence, spread, and transmission of diseases and toxic substances affecting animals, and ensures that such risks are mitigated through reporting, inspection, quarantine, and enforcement mechanisms.

The Act applies to all animals—including embryos and fertilized eggs—and covers their by-products, food, and products such as milk, eggs, and veterinary biologics. It also includes provisions for international trade, movement within Canada, and the prevention of disease outbreaks.
