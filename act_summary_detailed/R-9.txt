**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mint Act**

### **Overview**
The *Royal Canadian Mint Act* establishes the legal framework for the operations, governance, and functions of the **Royal Canadian Mint (Mint)**, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the production and management of Canadian coins. The Act defines the Mint’s purpose, structure, powers, financial arrangements, and regulatory oversight. It also outlines the rules governing coin design, composition, circulation, and non-circulation issues.
