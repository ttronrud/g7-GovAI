#### **3. Residency Rules**

Residency is a foundational concept in determining where income is taxable. The Act provides detailed rules for determining residency for individuals and companies.

##### **For Individuals:**
An individual is considered a resident of a Contracting State if they have:
- A **permanent home** (domicile, residence, place of management, registration, or incorporation).
- **Exception**: Individuals not taxed only on income from sources within the State are excluded.

If an individual is a resident of both countries:
1. **Centre of vital interests** (personal and economic ties) determines residency — if shared, the state with closer ties wins.
2. If no such centre can be determined or no permanent home exists, residency is assigned to the state where the individual has an **habitual abode**.
3. If habitual abode exists in both or neither, residency is assigned to the **nationality** of the individual.
4. If the individual is a national of both or neither, the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue through mutual agreement.

##### **For Companies:**
A company is a resident of only one country:
- If it is a national of one country → resident of that country.
- If it is a national of neither → resident of the country where its **place of effective management** is located.

##### **For Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships):**
- The competent authorities must resolve residency by mutual agreement.
- In the absence of agreement, such persons are **not entitled** to any tax relief or exemption under the Convention.

#### **4. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise conducts business. This is critical in determining where profits are taxed.

##### **What Constitutes a PE:**
- Place of management
- Branch, office, factory, workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other natural resource exploration/exploitation site

> **Important**: A building site, construction project, or supervisory activity **only constitutes a PE if it lasts more than 12 months**.

##### **Exclusions from PE Status:**
The following activities do **not** constitute a PE:
- Use of facilities solely for **storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of goods stock for **storage, display, or delivery**.
- Maintenance of stock for **processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place used only for **purchasing goods or collecting information**.
- Fixed place used only for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**.

> **Exception**: If the overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary, it still does not constitute a PE.

##### **Special Rule for Agents**:
- An individual acting on behalf of an enterprise with **authority to conclude contracts** is deemed to have a PE in the host country **unless** their activities are limited to those excluded above.

##### **Special Rule for Insurance Enterprises**:
- An insurance company of a Contracting State is deemed to have a PE in the other country **if it collects premiums or insures risks in that country**, **except** in the case of reinsurance.

> **Note**: Control or business activity through a PE **does not** automatically create a PE for the other company.

#### **5. Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**

Income derived from **immovable property** (real estate) located in the other country may be taxed in that country.

##### **Definition of Immovable Property**:
Includes:

- Property accessory to real estate
- Livestock and equipment used in agriculture or forestry
- Rights to mineral deposits, natural resources
- Usufruct rights
- Payments for working or rights to work in natural resources

##### **Applicability**:
- Income from **direct use, letting, or alienation** of immovable property.

#### **6. Taxation of Profits of Enterprises**

General rule:
- Profits of an enterprise are taxable **only in the State of residence** of the enterprise.
- **Exception**: If the enterprise carries on business in the other country through a **permanent establishment**, then profits attributable to that PE may be taxed in the other country.

##### **Attribution of Profits to a PE**:
- Profits are attributed to the PE as if it were a **separate, independent enterprise** under similar conditions.
- The attribution is based on **expected profits** under market conditions.

##### **Deductible Expenses**:
- All expenses incurred for the PE are deductible, including executive and administrative costs.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Royalties, fees, commissions, or interest paid to the head office or other offices **for use of patents, management, or services**.
  - **Exception**: Interest payments are allowed only in the case of **banking enterprises**.

> **No profit attribution** occurs simply because the PE purchases goods or merchandise.

##### **Annual Methodology**:
- Profits are determined **year by year** using the same method unless there is **good and sufficient reason** to vary it.

> **Note**: If income is already covered under other articles (e.g., dividends, royalties), those articles are not affected.

#### **7. Profits from Ships and Aircraft in International Traffic**

General rule:
- Profits from operating ships or aircraft in **international traffic** are taxable **only in the home country** of the enterprise.

#### **8. Transfer Pricing and Related Party Transactions**

This section addresses situations where **related enterprises** (same owners or management) operate under **unequal or non-market terms**.

##### **Key Provisions**:
- If one enterprise controls or is controlled by another, or if the same persons control both, and commercial or financial conditions differ from those between independent enterprises:
  - Any income that would have accrued to one enterprise but was **diverted due to non-market conditions** may be included in the income of the enterprise and taxed accordingly.

- If a country includes income in its tax base that was previously taxed in the other country, and such income would have accrued to the first country under market conditions:
  - The other country must make an **appropriate tax adjustment** to avoid double taxation.

> **Adjustment Limitations**:
- The tax change **cannot occur after five years** from the end of the year in which the income would have accrued.
- The adjustment must be made within the time limits provided by national law.

> **Exemption**: These rules **do not apply** in cases of **fraud, wilful default, or neglect**.
