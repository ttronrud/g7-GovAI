**Detailed Summary of the *Main Point of Contact with the Government of Canada in Case of Death Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Main Point of Contact with the Government of Canada in Case of Death Act* is a legislative measure introduced to improve support and streamline access to government services for individuals who have recently lost a loved one. Specifically, it designates the **Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)** as the **primary and central point of contact** for Canadians dealing with matters related to the use of a deceased person’s **social insurance number (SIN)**.

This Act aims to eliminate the need for bereaved individuals to communicate directly with multiple government agencies or departments that may have access to information about the deceased, thereby reducing confusion, administrative burden, and emotional distress during a difficult time.

---

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### **1. Purpose and Background**
- The Act recognizes that when a Canadian citizen or resident dies, various government entities (e.g., employment insurance, health benefits, pensions, tax records) may need to access information about the deceased.
- Currently, notification of death may trigger communications with multiple departments, leading to fragmented and inefficient service delivery.
- The Act seeks to **centralize this process** by making DESD the **main point of contact** for all such matters involving the deceased person’s SIN.

> *“Whereas the Department of Employment and Social Development offers Canadians a point of access to a wide range of government services...”*  
> This establishes DESD’s existing role as a gateway to services and positions it to serve as a unified hub during bereavement.

#### **2. Designation of DESD as the Main Point of Contact**
- **Section 2**: The Minister of Employment and Social Development must implement measures to ensure that DESD becomes the **main point of contact** with the Government of Canada regarding the use of a deceased person’s social insurance number.
- This means:
  - No individual (e.g., a family member or beneficiary) will need to reach out to multiple federal departments or institutions individually.
  - All relevant information about the deceased person’s SIN — such as eligibility for benefits, claims, or access to records — will be managed through DESD.
- The goal is to **simplify, unify, and humanize** the process of dealing with a death in relation to government services.

> *“so that no person is required to communicate directly with all persons to whom information about that deceased citizen or resident may be made available under subsection 28.2(5) or subsection 35(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.”*

---

#### **3. Role of the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC)**
- **Section 3**: Upon receiving notification of a death, the CEIC must provide information about the deceased person (if permitted under law) to other persons or institutions, **only if such disclosure is allowed under subsection 28.2(5)** of the DESD Act.
- The disclosure must be **subject to the same conditions** that would apply if the CEIC were making the information available directly under that subsection.
- This ensures that:
  - Access to information is governed by privacy and legal safeguards.
  - The CEIC does not act independently but follows established rules and limitations.

---

#### **4. Role of the Minister of Employment and Social Development**
- **Section 4**: If the Minister may disclose information about the deceased person (specifically regarding the use of their SIN) to a **federal public officer or minister of a prescribed federal institution** (e.g., Health Canada, Canada Revenue Agency, etc.), the Minister must do so under **subsection 35(1)** of the DESD Act.
- Again, disclosures are subject to the **same conditions** as those specified in subsection 35(1).
- This ensures consistency in how information is shared across institutions and maintains compliance with privacy and legal standards.

> *Note:* Subsection 35(1) allows certain federal institutions to receive information about a deceased person’s SIN for administrative or operational purposes — such as processing claims or updating records.

---

#### **5. Legal Effect of Information Sharing**
- **Section 5**: For the purposes of subsections 28.2(6) and 35(2) of the DESD Act, any information provided to a person under Sections 3 or 4 (i.e., via CEIC or Ministerial disclosure) is **deemed to have been obtained** under subsections 28.2(5) or 35(1), respectively.
- This is a critical legal mechanism that:
  - Validates the legitimacy of disclosures.
  - Ensures that the receiving party (e.g., a hospital, pension provider, or tax office) can legally rely on the information as if it were obtained through the formal channels of the DESD Act.
  - Provides legal clarity and reduces the risk of disputes over the origin or validity of information.

---

#### **6. Regulatory Authority**
- **Section 6**: The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **regulations** to implement the purposes and provisions of this Act.
- These regulations may include:
  - Specific procedures for notifying death.
  - Guidelines on what types of information can be shared.
  - Protocols for verifying identity or eligibility of beneficiaries.
  - Timeframes for responses or actions.
- This allows flexibility in adapting the Act to evolving administrative needs and technological developments.

---

#### **7. Reporting Requirements**
- **Section 7**: The Minister of Employment and Social Development must submit an **annual report** on the implementation of the measures required under Section 2.
- The report must be:
  - Prepared after the end of each fiscal year.
  - Laid before **each House of Parliament** in the **following fiscal year**.
- This ensures:
  - Accountability and transparency.
  - Public oversight of how effectively the government is fulfilling its commitment to simplify bereavement-related services.
  - Opportunities for parliamentary review, feedback, and potential improvements.
