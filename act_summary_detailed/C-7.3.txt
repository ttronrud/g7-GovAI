### **Detailed Summary of the *Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act***  

The *Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act* (CNMCA Act) is a comprehensive piece of legislation enacted by Parliament to establish, manage, and protect a representative and ecologically sound system of marine conservation areas across Canada. The Act reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem integrity, Indigenous rights, sustainable use of marine resources, and international environmental cooperation. Below is a detailed, structured summary of the Act’s key provisions, purpose, structure, and implications.

---

## **I. Purpose and Policy Foundations**

The Act is grounded in several foundational principles and concerns:

1. **Protection of Natural Ecosystems**  
   The protection of self-regulating, natural marine ecosystems is central to maintaining biological diversity and ecological resilience.

2. **Precautionary Principle**  
   Canada commits to applying the precautionary principle—meaning that where there are threats of environmental damage, lack of scientific certainty should not be used as a justification for delaying preventive actions.

3. **Representative Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**  
   The Act establishes a national system of marine conservation areas (MCAs) that are:
   - Representative of Canada’s major ocean regions: the **Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific Oceans**, and the **Great Lakes**.
   - Of sufficient **extent and configuration** to maintain healthy, functioning marine ecosystems.

4. **International Commitment**  
   Canada affirms its role in contributing to a **global network of representative marine protected areas**, aligning with international biodiversity goals (e.g., the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Aichi Targets, and the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework).

5. **Ecosystem-Based Management**  
   Management must consider the full ecosystem—including **submerged lands, water column, and living organisms**—to ensure structural and functional integrity.

6. **Sustainable Use and Community Benefits**  
   The Act recognizes that marine ecosystems support the **social, cultural, and economic well-being** of coastal communities. It provides opportunities for:
   - Ecologically sustainable use of marine resources.
   - Economic benefits to coastal populations.
   - Cultural appreciation and education about Canada’s marine heritage.

7. **Inclusion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**  
   The Act explicitly recognizes and incorporates **traditional ecological knowledge**, particularly **Aboriginal ecological knowledge**, in planning, management, and decision-making.

8. **Stakeholder Engagement**  
   The Act mandates meaningful involvement of:
   - Federal and provincial ministers and agencies
   - Coastal communities
   - Aboriginal organizations and governments
   - Bodies established under land claims agreements

## **II. Key Definitions**

The Act provides clear definitions essential to its implementation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Ecosystem** | A dynamic complex of animal, plant, and microorganism communities interacting with their non-living environment as a functional unit. |
| **Marine Conservation Area (MCA)** | A national marine conservation area named and described in **Schedule 1**. |
| **Reserve** | A national marine conservation area reserve named and described in **Schedule 2**, established where aboriginal rights are recognized. |
| **Enforcement Officer** | A person designated under section 19 or belonging to a class so designated. |
| **Marine Conservation Area Warden** | A person designated under section 18. |
| **Minister** | The Minister responsible for the **Parks Canada Agency**. |
| **Public Lands** | Lands (including submerged lands) owned by Her Majesty in right of Canada or subject to government disposal, regardless of provincial agreements. |
| **Waste or other matter** | Waste or matter listed in **Schedule 5** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*. |

> *Note: The reference to "disposal" is defined under the CEP Act without reference to the sea (i.e., land-based disposal).*

## **III. Establishment and Amendment of Marine Conservation Areas and Reserves**

### **A. Creation of MCAs and Reserves**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may establish or enlarge MCAs or reserves by **amending Schedule 1 or 2** via order.
- Creation requires:
  1. **Clear title or unencumbered ownership** by Her Majesty in right of Canada (except in the EEZ, where title is not required).
  2. **Provincial consent** if the area includes lands administered by a province—provinces must agree to transfer control to federal jurisdiction.
  3. **Compliance with land claim agreements** if aboriginal rights are involved.

### **B. Removal or Modification of Areas**
- **MCAs**: Removal of any portion is **prohibited unless**:
  - A court finds the Government lacks clear title to the land.
  - The removal is authorized by an order from the Governor in Council.
- **Reserves**: Can be removed or altered **only if**:
  - A land claim is settled, and the settlement includes such a change.
  - A court finds lack of title.

> ⚠️ **No removal of any portion of a marine conservation area or reserve is allowed without a formal process**, ensuring stability and permanence of these protected zones.

## **IV. Public Consultation and Parliamentary Oversight**

Before any amendment to Schedule 1 or 2 is made:
1. The proposed amendment must be **laid before both Houses of Parliament**.
2. A **report must accompany the amendment**, including:
   - List of consulted organizations and individuals, with dates and summaries of feedback.
   - Agreements reached.
   - Assessments of mineral and energy resources.
   - An **interim management plan** outlining:
     - Management objectives
     - Zoning plan
     - Ecosystem protection measures
     - Human use and public access

3. The **standing committee** on marine conservation areas (or a designated committee) has **30 sitting days** to review and potentially **disapprove** the amendment.

4. If no disapproval motion is passed within **31 days**, the amendment may proceed.

5. If either House passes a disapproval motion, the amendment **cannot proceed**.

> This ensures **democratic accountability**, **public transparency**, and **inclusion of diverse perspectives**, especially Indigenous and coastal communities.

## **V. Application of Ontario Water Laws in Marine Conservation Areas**

A unique and significant provision applies **only to Ontario**:

- The **Ontario Water Resources Act (OWRA)** and related laws (including the *Environmental Bill of Rights*) govern **water taking and water transfer** within marine conservation areas in Ontario.
- This includes:
  - Administration and enforcement of water laws
  - Orders by provincial officers or Directors
  - Hearings by the Environmental Review Tribunal and appeals

> However, **marine conservation area wardens and enforcement officers are NOT responsible** for enforcing these provisions.

- **Ontario authorities** (e.g., provincial officers, Directors, Tribunal) retain enforcement powers.
- The **Superintendent of the MCA cannot issue permits** for water taking or transfer within the area.
- **Section 12 (prohibition on certain activities)** does not apply to water-related activities conducted under valid Ontario permits.

> This provision ensures that **critical water management decisions** are made within the provincial legal framework, while respecting the distinct ecological and hydrological context of Ontario’s marine areas.

> *Note: The Statutory Instruments Act does not apply to these Ontario water regulations in MCAs, ensuring flexibility in regulation-making.*
