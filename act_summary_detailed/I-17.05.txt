### 🔹 **5. Approval Requirements for Construction or Alteration**
#### Core Principle:
> **No person may construct or alter an international bridge or tunnel without prior approval from the Governor in Council.**

#### Process:
1. An **application must be submitted to the Minister** for approval by the Governor in Council.
2. The Minister may, if necessary, **consult** with:
   - Other levels of government (provincial, territorial) with jurisdiction over the site.
   - Any person with a **direct interest** in the project.
3. Applicants must provide:
   - All documents and information required under **Ministerial guidelines**.
   - Any additional information requested after submission.
4. **Guidelines are not statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act* — they are administrative tools, not subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

#### Governor in Council Authority:
- May **approve** the project **subject to terms and conditions**.
- May **vary, rescind, or impose new conditions** at any time.
- All parties subject to conditions must **comply fully**.

#### Enforcement Powers (if Unauthorized Construction Occurs):
If construction or alteration occurs without approval:
- The Minister may:
  - Order the person to **cease work**.
  - Order the **owner to remove or alter** the structure.
  - If the owner fails to comply, the Minister may **remove, destroy, and dispose of** the bridge/tunnel and its materials.
- **Costs incurred** by the Minister (after deducting proceeds from disposal) are **recoverable as a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> This creates a strong **enforcement mechanism** to prevent unauthorized development.
