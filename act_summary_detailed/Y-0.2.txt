**Detailed Summary of the *Yale First Nation Final Agreement Act***

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

The *Yale First Nation Final Agreement Act* is a federal statute enacted by the Parliament of Canada to **ratify and give legal effect** to the **Yale First Nation Final Agreement**, a comprehensive treaty and land claims agreement between:

- The **Yale First Nation** (a First Nations community in British Columbia),
- The **Government of Canada**, and  
- The **Government of British Columbia**.

This Act is grounded in the **Constitution Act, 1982**, which recognizes and affirms the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada. The central goal of the Act is to **achieve reconciliation** between the Crown and the Yale First Nation—acknowledging the historical presence and rights of Aboriginal peoples and establishing a new, respectful, and mutually beneficial relationship.

The Act emphasizes that **reconciliation is best achieved through negotiation**, a principle affirmed by Canadian courts. The final agreement was the result of sustained, collaborative negotiations among the three parties.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Act**

#### **A. Legal Status of the Agreement**
- The **Agreement is recognized as both a treaty and a land claims agreement** under **Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- It is **approved, given effect, and declared valid** and has the **full force of law**.
- The Agreement is **binding on all persons and bodies**, and any individual or entity must:
  - Exercise the powers, rights, privileges, and benefits granted by the Agreement, and
  - Perform the duties and be subject to the liabilities imposed by it.

#### **B. Supremacy of the Agreement**
- The **Agreement prevails over any federal law** to the extent of any inconsistency.
- This Act **prevails over any other federal law** where there is a conflict between them.
- This ensures that the terms of the Agreement take precedence in matters involving the Yale First Nation, including land, governance, rights, and economic development.

#### **C. Financial Obligations**
- Any **monetary obligations** of the Government of Canada under **Chapter 19 of the Agreement** (e.g., funding for infrastructure, services, or self-governance) must be **paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada.

#### **D. Land Ownership**
- On the **effective date of the Agreement**, the **Yale First Nation owns the estate in fee simple** (i.e., full, unconditional ownership) of the land designated in **Chapter 12 of the Agreement**.
- This establishes **full title and control** over the land, a significant step toward self-determination and land-based sovereignty.

#### **E. Tax Treatment Agreement**
- The **Tax Treatment Agreement** (a separate instrument) is:
  - Approved, given effect, and declared valid during its period of effectiveness.
  - **Not part of the main Agreement**.
  - **Not a treaty or land claims agreement** under Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
- This distinction is important because it means the tax provisions do not trigger the same constitutional protections or obligations as the main Agreement.

#### **F. Fisheries and Harvest Rights**
- Despite **Section 7 of the Fisheries Act**, which typically restricts Indigenous fishing rights, the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** may enter into and implement the **Harvest Agreement** (referenced in Section 8.2.1 of the Agreement).
- This allows the Yale First Nation to exercise **traditional fishing rights** in a regulated and sustainable manner.
- However, like the Tax Treatment Agreement, the **Harvest Agreement is not a treaty or land claims agreement** under the Constitution Act, 1982.

#### **G. Removal of the Indian Act**
- The **Indian Act does not apply** to:
  - The Yale First Nation,
  - Its members,
  - Its Government,
  - Public institutions, or
  - Corporations
  —**as of the effective date of the Agreement**.
- This is a major step toward **self-governance and autonomy**, removing federal regulatory control over daily governance and legal matters.
- **Exception**: The Indian Act remains in force **only for the purpose of determining whether an individual is an "Indian"** under federal definitions.

#### **H. Legal Authority of Yale First Nation Laws**
- Laws made by the Yale First Nation (including bylaws, regulations, or policies) are **not considered statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.
- This means that **Yale First Nation laws are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny or review** in the same way as federal or provincial statutes, reinforcing their **autonomy and legal standing**.

#### **I. Application of British Columbia Laws**
- Where a **law of British Columbia does not apply by its own force** to the Yale First Nation (due to the federal government’s exclusive legislative authority under **Class 24 of Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867**), that law **applies by virtue of this Act**, in accordance with the Agreement.
- This ensures that the Yale First Nation is not excluded from provincial laws that are otherwise applicable, while still respecting the federal government’s authority over Indigenous affairs.

#### **J. Judicial Notice and Publication**
- The **Agreement and the Tax Treatment Agreement** must be:
  - **Published by the Queen’s Printer**.
  - **Taken as judicial notice** in all courts and tribunals—meaning courts are required to treat them as authentic and binding documents without needing to prove their existence or authenticity.
- A **copy published by the Queen’s Printer is evidence of the agreement and its contents**.
- A copy that purports to be published is deemed to be so published **unless proven otherwise**.
- Similarly, **Yale First Nation laws** are taken as judicial notice, and a copy deposited in a public registry (as per Section 3.6.1a of the Agreement) is **evidence of that law**.

#### **K. Regulatory Authority**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **orders and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement or the Tax Treatment Agreement.
- This provides a mechanism for administrative and operational implementation, including setting standards, procedures, or timelines.

#### **L. Effective Date of Certain Provisions**
- **Chapters 25 and 26 of the Agreement** (which likely relate to governance, financial management, or economic development) are **deemed to have effect as of February 5, 2010**, despite the Agreement’s formal effective date.
- This ensures that key governance and operational provisions are in place from the beginning of implementation.

#### **M. Judicial Review and Consultation Requirements**
- In any **judicial or administrative proceeding** involving:
  - The **interpretation or validity of the Agreement**, or
  - The **validity or applicability of this Act**, or
  - Any **Yale First Nation law**
  
  —the party raising the issue **must first serve written notice** on:
  - The **Attorney General of Canada**,
  - The **Attorney General of British Columbia**, and
  - The **Yale First Nation**.

- The notice must include:
  - A description of the proceeding,
  - The specific issue,
  - The date on which the issue will be argued,
  - Particulars showing the point to be argued,
  - And must be served **at least 14 days before the hearing**, unless the court or tribunal allows a shorter period.

- In such proceedings, **all three parties (the AGs and the Yale First Nation)** may **appear and participate as full parties**, with **equal rights** to present arguments and evidence.

- This provision ensures **meaningful consultation**, promotes **consensus**, and prevents unilateral judicial interpretation that could undermine the Agreement.

> **Note**: This requirement does not require an oral hearing to be held, even if one is not otherwise required.

### **3. Implementation and Enactment**

- The **provisions of this Act (except Section 18)** come into force on a day or days to be **determined by order of the Governor in Council**.
- Section 18 is specifically excluded from coming into force, suggesting it may deal with transitional or administrative matters that are not immediately operational.

> **Note**: The Act is not in force immediately. Its operation is contingent on a formal order from the federal government.
