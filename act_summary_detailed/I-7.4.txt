## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Agreement Between Canada and Nova Scotia Regarding Indian Reserve Lands**

### **1. Purpose and Context of the Agreement**

This agreement is a formal **ratification and confirmation** of a prior understanding between the Government of Canada and the Government of Nova Scotia concerning the status, ownership, and future management of **Indian reserve lands** in Nova Scotia.

#### Background:
- Since 1867 (under the British North America Act), certain lands originally set aside for Indigenous peoples (specifically, "Indian reserves") have been **surrendered to the Crown** by Indigenous bands.
- Over time, the Crown issued **Letters Patent** (legal instruments under the Great Seal of Canada) conveying these surrendered lands to private individuals.
- However, two decisions by the **Judicial Committee of the Privy Council** (the highest court of appeal for Canada at the time) concluded that such conveyances were **invalid** because they were made without the **explicit authority of the Province of Nova Scotia**.
- As a result, the grantees of these lands hold **defective titles**, which creates legal uncertainty, hardship, and inconvenience for both Indigenous communities and the Crown.

#### Objective:
To **settle outstanding legal and administrative issues** related to Indian reserves in Nova Scotia and to establish a clear, legally sound framework for Canada’s future dealings with reserve lands, including:
- Clarifying ownership rights,
- Resolving title defects,
- Establishing procedures for land surrenders and sales,
- Protecting Indigenous rights and interests.

### **2. Key Definitions in the Agreement**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the agreement defines several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Province** | Refers specifically to the Province of Nova Scotia. |
| **Reserve Lands** | The Indian reserves in Nova Scotia as listed in the **Appendix** to the agreement. |
| **Patented Lands** | Tracts of land where the Crown accepted surrenders from Indigenous peoples and issued Letters Patent to private parties. |
| **Minerals** | Includes salt, oil, natural gas, fire clays, coal, bituminous shale, uranium, ochres, and other mineral deposits found in soil or rock. **Excludes** sand, gravel, and marl. |
| **Indian Act** | The primary federal legislation governing Indigenous peoples in Canada, as revised and amended over time. |
| **Surrender** | Refers specifically to the **sale of reserve lands** under the Indian Act. Does **not** include surrenders made for non-sale purposes (e.g., for use or development). |
| **Public Highways** | Roads and bridges built by the Province or municipalities for public use and existing at the time the agreement comes into force. These are **excluded** from the transfer of rights. |

---

### **3. Key Provisions of the Agreement**

#### ✅ **(1) Confirmation of All Grants (with Exceptions)**
- All **grants of patented lands** are **confirmed** (i.e., legally recognized and upheld).
- **Exception**: Any grant that purports to transfer **mineral rights** to grantees is **invalid**.
  - Minerals are explicitly **acknowledged as the property of the Province of Nova Scotia**, not the grantees.

> 🔍 *This provision ensures that despite past flawed conveyances, the legal status of the land remains intact, but Indigenous communities retain ownership of mineral rights.*

---

#### ✅ **(2) Transfer of Rights from Nova Scotia to Canada**
- The **Province of Nova Scotia transfers to Canada** all rights and interests in **reserve lands**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Lands **under public highways** (i.e., roads and bridges).
  - **Mineral rights** (as defined above).

> 💡 *This means Canada gains full control over the surface rights and use of reserve lands, while the Province retains ownership of subsurface minerals and infrastructure rights.*

---

#### ✅ **(3) Restoration of Rights Upon Extinction of a Band**
- If an **Indigenous band becomes extinct** (i.e., no living members remain), then:
  - Canada shall **revest** (return) all rights and interests transferred under this agreement **back to the Province of Nova Scotia**.
  - This applies only to the reserve lands occupied by that band **prior to extinction**.

> ⚠️ *Important clarification*: A band does **not** become extinct by **enfranchisement** (i.e., when members become citizens of Canada and lose status). Enfranchisement does not trigger extinction.

> 🛡️ *This provision protects the long-term interests of Indigenous communities and prevents the loss of reserve land rights due to band dissolution.*

---

#### ✅ **(4) Application of Mining Regulations**
- The **mining regulations** made under the **Indian Act** apply to:
  - Prospecting,
  - Mining,
  - Any other dealings with minerals in:
    - Unsurrendered reserve lands,
    - Lands reserved in past patents.
- All payments (rents, royalties, or fees) collected from mining activities must be:
  - Paid to the **Receiver General of Canada**,
  - For the **use and benefit of the Indigenous band or individuals** whose reserve lands the minerals are derived from.

> 💼 *This ensures that Indigenous communities benefit financially from mineral development on their lands, even if the surface rights are held by Canada.*

---

#### ✅ **(5) Procedure for Land Surrender and Purchase**

When a band surrenders land for sale under the Indian Act:

1. **Canada must immediately notify Nova Scotia** of the surrender.
2. **Nova Scotia has 30 days** to:
   - Elect to **purchase** the surrendered lands at a price to be agreed upon.
3. **If Nova Scotia does not exercise its right to buy within 30 days**, Canada may **sell the land without further consultation**.
4. **If the surrender is conditional** (e.g., "sold to a named person at a certain price"), Nova Scotia must make its purchase **subject to that price or consideration**.

> 🔍 *This creates a balanced process: Nova Scotia has a chance to buy land at fair value, but Canada is not bound to wait indefinitely.*

---

#### ✅ **(6) Arbitration in Case of Dispute Over Purchase Price**

If Canada and Nova Scotia **cannot agree on a price** within 30 days of the election to purchase:

- Each party appoints **one arbitrator**.
- The two arbitrators then jointly appoint a **third arbitrator**.
- The **arbitrators’ decision on price** is:
  - **Final and binding**.
- **Costs of arbitration** are shared equally between Canada and Nova Scotia.

> 🏁 *This ensures a neutral, fair, and legally enforceable resolution mechanism to prevent disputes over land value.*

---

### **4. Signature and Ratification**

The agreement was signed on behalf of both governments by:

- **Canada**:  
  The Honourable **Ellen L. Fairclough**, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration  
  (in the presence of E.S. Rump and Ellen L. Fairclough)

- **Nova Scotia**:  
  The Honourable **R. Clifford Levy**, Minister of Lands and Forests  
  (in the presence of M. Patricia Crocker and R. Clifford Levy)

> ✅ The agreement is **ratified by Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Nova Scotia** before it takes effect.

---

### **5. Specific Land References (Appendix)**

The agreement references specific parcels of land in Nova Scotia, which are part of the reserve lands included in the agreement:

- **Parcel 1**: A parcel of land on **both sides of the Pomquet River**, **one mile west of Heatherton**.
- **Parcel 2**: Two parcels of land, approximately **2 miles east of Heatherton**, located on the **south side of Highway No. 4**.

> 🔎 These parcels are included in the definition of "reserve lands" and are subject to the full terms of the agreement — including transfer of rights, mining regulations, and potential future sale procedures.
