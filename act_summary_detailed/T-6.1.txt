**Detailed Summary of the *Telesat Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Telesat Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act* (commonly referred to as the "Telesat Act") is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada in 1992 to facilitate the **reorganization and divestiture of Telesat Canada**, a national satellite telecommunications corporation. The Act was designed to transition Telesat from a government-owned entity into a commercially viable, privately operated corporation while ensuring continuity of its operations and compliance with corporate and regulatory frameworks.

The Act was introduced in the context of broader privatization efforts in Canada during the 1990s, particularly under the government's strategy to reduce public ownership in key infrastructure sectors and promote market-based solutions.

### **2. Transfer of Shares to the Minister**

- **Section 4**:
  - The common shares of Telesat held by:
    - **Her Majesty in right of Canada** (represented by the Minister of Finance), and
    - **Canadian National Railway Company (CNRC)**  
    are **transferred to the Minister**.
  - The Minister is **authorized to acquire** these shares.
  - The transferred shares are **registered in Telesat’s books** in the name of the Minister and are **held in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> This ensures that while the shares are physically transferred to the Minister, they remain under public trust and are not privately owned.

- **Exemptions from Telesat Canada Act**:
  - Sections 20, 26(1) and (2), and 27(2) of the *Telesat Canada Act* do **not apply** to the shares transferred under this section.

---

### **3. Disposal of Shares by the Minister**

- The Minister may:
  - **Sell or otherwise dispose of** the shares transferred under Section 4;
  - Enter into **any agreement or arrangement** necessary or incidental to such disposal.

> The disposal is subject to **terms and conditions approved by the Governor in Council**.

---

### **4. Payment to Canadian National Railway Company (CNRC)**

- If the Minister sells shares under Section 4(1), it is authorized to:
  - Pay out of the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** to CNRC an amount equal to the **proportion** of net proceeds from the sale that corresponds to the number of shares transferred to the Minister under Section 4(2) relative to the total number of shares transferred under Section 4.

> This provides a financial return to CNRC for its ownership stake in Telesat.

---

### **5. Debt Servicing and Reduction Account (Conditional Provision)**

- If **Bill C-21** (An Act relating to the accounting of certain payments for the servicing and reduction of the debt of Canada) is assented to during the third session of the 34th Parliament:
  - Any **excess net proceeds** from a share sale (excluding the amount paid to CNRC under Section 4(2)) over the **value of the shares as shown in Canada’s financial accounts before the sale** will be **credited to the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account** established by Bill C-21.

> This provision links the proceeds of the divestiture to national debt management, ensuring that surplus funds support public debt reduction.

---

### **6. Application for Certificate of Continuance**

- **Immediately upon coming into force**, Telesat must submit an application for a **certificate of continuance** under **Section 187 of the CBCA** to the Minister for approval.
- Upon Ministerial approval, Telesat must submit the approved application to the **Director of Corporate Affairs** (the regulatory body overseeing corporate continuity).
- The application is **deemed to have been made under Section 187(1) of the CBCA**, giving it legal effect under the CBCA framework.

> This ensures that Telesat continues as a legally recognized corporation under the CBCA, transitioning from the old *Telesat Canada Act*.

    - Apply for continuance of Telesat in another jurisdiction;
    - Dissolve Telesat.
- **No winding-up or solvency proceedings**:
  - No law relating to solvency or winding-up applies to Telesat.

  - Establish and operate **satellite telecommunication systems** providing commercial services between locations in Canada, and **to and between other locations** (subject to intergovernmental arrangements);
  - Supply **satellite systems and components** commercially in Canada;
  - Provide **services related to development, implementation, and operation** of such systems.

> The language is broad and **non-restrictive**, meaning Telesat is not limited in the types of services it can offer.

> Importantly, **nothing in this section limits Telesat’s capacity, rights, powers, or privileges**, nor imposes business restrictions.

---

### **9. Name and Legal Continuity**

- Despite transitioning to the CBCA framework:
  - Telesat may **continue to use the name "Telesat Canada"** on and after the date it becomes a corporation under the CBCA.
  - This preserves brand identity and public recognition.

> This provision ensures continuity of public trust and operational identity.

### **10. Repeal of the *Telesat Canada Act***

- The *Telesat Canada Act* is **repealed on the day Telesat becomes a corporation under the CBCA**.
- The **Director of Corporate Affairs** is not required to comply with **Section 187(6)** of the CBCA (which normally requires notice of continuation).
- However, upon issuing the certificate of continuance, the Director must **publish a notice in the Canada Gazette**:
  - Stating the date of issuance of the certificate;
  - Stating the date on which the *Telesat Canada Act* is repealed.

> This provides public transparency and formalizes the transition.

> *Note*: This notice was published on **March 27, 1992**, in *Canada Gazette Part I, Volume 126, page 1539*.

---

### **11. First Shareholder Meeting After Divestiture**

- The **first annual meeting of shareholders** of Telesat must be held **not later than six months after the divestiture date**.

---

### **12. Director Continuity and Transition**

- Directors of Telesat who held office **immediately before** the date Telesat became a CBCA corporation **continue in office** according to their original terms.
- However, **they cease to hold office at the close of the first annual meeting of shareholders after the divestiture date**, unless re-elected at that meeting.

> This creates a transition period, ensuring stability while allowing for democratic renewal of the board.

> *Note*: This section was **repealed before coming into force in 2008**, suggesting it was phased out as part of governance reforms.

### **13. No Compensation or Claims for Former Directors**
