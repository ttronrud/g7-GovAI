**Detailed Summary of the *Western Grain Transition Payments Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Western Grain Transition Payments Act* is a federal legislation enacted to provide financial support to farmers in specific western Canadian regions who were engaged in grain farming prior to a significant shift in agricultural policy or market conditions—specifically, in the early 1990s. The Act establishes a structured framework for distributing transition payments to eligible farmers based on ownership of farmland in designated areas, with a focus on compensating for economic disruptions related to changes in grain marketing, transportation, and market access.

The primary objective of the Act is to **assist farmers in transitioning from traditional grain farming operations**—particularly those affected by declining market access, rising transport costs, or shifts in agricultural policy—by providing financial compensation that reflects the productivity and geographic remoteness of their farmland.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Eligible Area**  
   - Comprises the provinces of:
     - Manitoba  
     - Saskatchewan  
     - Alberta  
     - Specific parts of British Columbia:  
       - The Peace River District  
       - The Creston-Wynndel Areas  
   - This region was identified as historically significant for grain production and was targeted due to its vulnerability to transportation and market challenges.

2. **Farmland**  
   - Land on which:
     - An annual crop of grain was cultivated during **1994**, **or**
     - Was in **summer fallow in 1994** but cultivated an annual grain crop in **1993**  
   - This definition ensures that only land with a documented history of grain cultivation in the preceding two years is eligible.

3. **Grain**  
   - Defined under **Section 181.1 of the National Transportation Act, 1987**.  
   - This refers to major cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye, which are subject to national transportation regulations and are central to the grain trade.

4. **Minister**  
   - Refers to the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** of Canada.  
   - Responsible for administering the application process, reviewing eligibility, and making payment decisions.

5. **Own (in respect of farmland)**  
   - Means holding the **fee simple interest** in the farmland.  
   - Unless otherwise prescribed by regulation, ownership is defined as full legal ownership.  
   - *Prescribed* means as defined or modified by regulations made under **Section 6** by the Governor in Council.

6. **Prescribed**  
   - Applies only to regulations made by the **Governor in Council** under Section 6 of the Act.  
   - Allows flexibility in defining specific ownership interests or criteria.

### **Eligibility and Application Process**

- **Eligibility**:  
  A person must have **owned farmland in the eligible area as of February 28, 1995**, at the start of the transition period.

- **Application Requirements**:  
  - Must be submitted in a **form approved by the Minister**.  
  - Must be received by the Minister **no later than September 15, 1995**, or any later date set by the Governor in Council.  
  - The Minister may require **proof of ownership** of the farmland to verify eligibility.

- **Payment Conditions**:  
  The Minister may grant:
  - An **interim transition payment** (partial payment during the process)
  - A **final transition payment** (full payment upon completion of review)

  Only if the Minister is satisfied that:
  - The applicant owned farmland in the eligible area on **February 28, 1995**, and  
  - The applicant meets all **prescribed criteria and conditions**.

### **Payment Structure and Calculation**

1. **Total Funding Limit**:  
   - The total amount of all transition payments **cannot exceed CAD 1.6 billion**.

2. **Apportionment of Funds**:
   - **16.10%** → Manitoba (farmland)  
   - **56.42%** → Saskatchewan (farmland)  
   - **27.48%** → Alberta and parts of British Columbia (Peace River District and Creston-Wynndel Areas)

   > This apportionment reflects the relative size and historical significance of grain production in each region, with Saskatchewan receiving the largest share due to its dominant role in western grain production.

3. **Calculation Basis**:
   - Payments are calculated based on:
     - The **productivity** of the farmland (e.g., yield potential, soil quality)
     - The **distance from port** (transportation cost implications)
   - The **Governor in Council** may regulate which **port** is used to determine distance from farmland.

4. **Funding Source**:  
   - The **1.6 billion CAD** is **appropriated** and paid from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** as required.

### **Tax Treatment of Transition Payments**

Under the *Income Tax Act*, the tax treatment of transition payments depends on the nature of the farmland and how it is used:

#### **Case (a)**: Farmland is capital property of the applicant  
- The payment is treated as an **amount required to be deducted** under **subsection 53(2)** of the Income Tax Act.  
- This deduction is applied to **compute the adjusted cost base (ACB)** of the farmland **after** the payment is received.

#### **Case (b)**: Farmland was capital property immediately before disposition  
- If the farmland is **disposed of before** the payment is received, the payment is treated as an amount required to be deducted to compute the **adjusted cost base immediately before the disposition**.

#### **Case (c)**: Neither (a) nor (b) applies  
- The payment is considered **assistance received in the course of earning income from a business or property**.  
- It is treated as relating to:
  - The **cost of the property**, or  
  - An **outlay or expense** incurred in operating the business.

#### **Equitable Arrangement (Paragraph 6(c))**  
- If part of a transition payment is paid to a **lessee** (a person or partnership leasing the farmland), that portion:
  - Is **included in the lessee’s income** for the taxation year in which it is received.
  - Is **not counted as a transition payment received by the applicant** for tax purposes under (a), (b), or (c).

> This provision ensures that payments made to tenants are not double-counted and that the tax treatment aligns with the actual economic distribution of the benefit.

### **Regulatory Authority**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has broad power to make regulations to implement the Act, including:

- Defining what constitutes an **interest in farmland** for the purpose of "own" (e.g., leasehold, joint ownership, etc.)
- Establishing **eligibility criteria** for applicants
- Setting **conditions** for receiving payments, including:
  - Requirement to enter into an **equitable arrangement** with any lessee of the farmland
- Determining **how interim and final payments are calculated**, including:
  - Which **port** to use when calculating distance from farmland
  - How productivity is measured or weighted

> This regulatory flexibility allows the government to adapt the program to changing economic, geographic, or agricultural realities.
