**Detailed Summary of the Government Corporations Operation Act**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is titled the **Government Corporations Operation Act** and may be cited accordingly. It establishes the legal framework governing the operation, structure, and responsibilities of certain government corporations in Canada.

---

### **2. Definition of "Corporation"**
- A "corporation" under this Act refers to:
  - A company incorporated under **Part I of the Canada Corporations Act (C-32)**, or  
  - A corporation incorporated under the **Canada Business Corporations Act**, provided that **all issued shares are owned by or held in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- **Exception**: For companies incorporated under Part I of the Canada Corporations Act, shares necessary to qualify other individuals as directors are **not excluded** from the ownership requirement.

> This definition ensures that only entities fully owned or controlled by the Government of Canada are considered "corporations" under this Act.

---

### **3. Corporate Status as an Agent of Her Majesty**
- **Every corporation is, for all purposes, an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This means that:
  - The corporation acts on behalf of the federal government.
  - It is legally and administratively accountable to the Crown.
  - Its actions are considered to be governmental in nature, even though it may operate with a degree of autonomy.

> This provision establishes a strong link between the corporation and the federal government, reinforcing its role as a public entity.

---

### **4. Authority to Employ Officers and Employees**
- A corporation has the **absolute authority** to:
  - Employ officers and employees as it deems necessary to conduct its operations.
  - Determine the **conditions of employment**, including job duties, responsibilities, and working hours.
  - Set **remuneration (salary, bonuses, etc.)** for such officers and employees.
- **Payment of remuneration** is the responsibility of the corporation itself.

> This grants corporations significant operational flexibility in staffing and compensation, unlike traditional public service bodies where employment conditions are more strictly regulated.

---

### **5. Control and Supervision**
- The corporation **exercises full control and supervision** over its officers and employees.
- This implies that:
  - The corporation has the authority to hire, discipline, promote, or terminate employees.
  - Management decisions are made internally, without interference from the federal government in day-to-day personnel matters.

> This reflects a degree of autonomy in human resource management, while still maintaining the corporation’s status as a Crown agent.

---

### **6. Exemption from Public Service Superannuation Act**
- The **Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)** does **not apply** to officers and employees of a corporation.
- However, **each corporation may establish and support**:
  - A **pension fund**
  - A **group insurance plan**
  - Or other **pension or superannuation arrangements**  
    (for the benefit of officers, employees, and their dependants)

#### **Eligible Dependents Include**:
- Spouse
- Common-law partner
- Children
- Any other relative of the officer/employee
- Any child or relative of the spouse or common-law partner

> This allows corporations to design tailored retirement and insurance benefits, independent of the standard public service pension system.

#### **Continuation of Existing Arrangements**
- A corporation may **continue** any pension or superannuation fund, plan, or arrangement that existed on **July 26, 1946**, with the **approval of the Governor in Council**.

> This ensures continuity of benefits for long-standing employees and protects institutional stability.

---

### **7. Definition of "Common-Law Partner"**
- A **common-law partner** is defined as:
  > A person who is cohabiting with the individual in a conjugal relationship and has done so for a period of **at least one year**.

> This definition aligns with modern legal standards and recognizes same-sex and non-traditional family structures.

---

### **8. Continuity of Public Service Superannuation Contributions**
- A person who was **a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act** immediately before joining a corporation **continues to be a contributor** under that Act during employment with the corporation.
- Their **service with the corporation is counted as pensionable service** under the PSSA.

> This ensures that individuals transitioning from traditional public service roles to corporate employment retain their pension rights and service history.

---

### **9. Eligibility for Re-appointment in Public Service**
- If an individual is **retired from a corporation for any reason other than misconduct**, they are **eligible for re-appointment** in the public service.

> This provides a pathway for experienced public servants to return to government employment, promoting continuity and career flexibility.

---

### **10. Exemption for Employees Hired on or After January 1, 1954**
- **Subsections 8(2) and (3)** do **not apply** to individuals who:
  - Are hired by a corporation **on or after January 1, 1954**, and
  - Would have been covered by subsections (2) and (3) **if not for this exception**.
- For these individuals:
  - They are **deemed to have ceased to be employed in the public service** as of the date of their employment.
  - They are **deemed to have ceased to be contributors** under the Public Service Superannuation Act at that date.

> This reflects a policy shift to distinguish between older public servants and newer hires, ensuring that post-1954 employees are not automatically entitled to public service benefits.

---

### **11. Continuation of Public Service Benefits (Non-Salary)**
- Any person who:
  - Held a position in the public service **at the time of employment** with a corporation, or
  - Was an employee within the meaning of the **Public Service Employment Act**,  
  continues to be **eligible for all benefits** (except salary) that they would have received had they remained in public service.

> This includes benefits such as:
  - Health coverage
  - Leave entitlements
  - Retirement benefits (under applicable plans)
- However, **salary is not included** in these benefits.

> This protects the rights of individuals transitioning into corporate roles while recognizing the public service nature of their prior employment.

---

### **12. Application of the Government Employees Compensation Act**
- The **Government Employees Compensation Act (GEC Act)** applies to officers and employees of a corporation.
- For the purposes of the GEC Act, such officers and employees are **deemed to be employees in the federal public administration**.

> This ensures that corporate employees are covered under the same workplace injury and compensation protections as traditional public servants, including access to compensation for work-related injuries or illnesses.

---

### **13. Effective Date and Proclamation Requirements**
- This Act **only applies to a corporation from the date of a proclamation issued by the Governor in Council** declaring it applicable.
- The Governor in Council may issue a proclamation at any time to:
  - **Declare the Act applicable** to a corporation (initiating its operation under the Act).
  - **Declare that the Act ceases to apply** to a corporation (terminating its status under the Act).

> This gives the federal government control over when corporations come into or exit the scope of this legislation.

---

### **14. Termination of Agency Status**
- Upon the effective date of a proclamation under section 6 (declaring the Act no longer applicable):
  - The corporation **ceases to be an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
  - However, **no rights acquired under subsections 5(2), (3), or (5)** (i.e., pension rights, re-appointment rights, or benefit entitlements) are affected or lost.

> This preserves the legal rights and benefits of individuals who were employed during the period the corporation operated under the Act, even after the corporation is no longer recognized as a Crown agent.
