**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Serbia Tax Convention Act, 2013***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–Serbia Tax Convention Act, 2013* is the enabling legislation in Canada that gives legal force and effect to the **Canada–Serbia Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital**, signed on October 31, 2013, and entered into force on that date (as noted in the *Canada Gazette*).

This Act establishes the legal framework under which the tax treaty between Canada and the Republic of Serbia operates in Canada. Its primary purpose is to **prevent double taxation** of income and capital gains, ensure **tax fairness**, and promote **economic cooperation** between the two countries by clarifying the rules governing the taxation of individuals and enterprises.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definition and Legal Status of the Convention**

- **"Convention"** refers to the bilateral tax treaty between Canada and the Republic of Serbia, as set out in **Schedule 1**, as amended by the **Protocol in Schedule 2**.
- The Convention is **approved and has full legal force in Canada** during the period it is in force under its own terms.
- In case of **inconsistency** between:
  - This Act or the Convention and **any other Canadian law**,
  - The Convention and the **Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act (ITCIA)**,
  
  → The **Convention and this Act prevail** over conflicting domestic laws to the extent of the inconsistency.  
  → However, the **Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act prevails** over the Convention if there is a conflict.

> *Note:* This ensures that the treaty terms take precedence in tax matters, while allowing for harmonization through established interpretation rules.

### **2. Regulatory and Notification Powers**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** may make **regulations** necessary to implement the Convention or give effect to its provisions.
- The **Minister of Finance** must publish a **notice in the Canada Gazette** within **60 days** of:

  - Or terminating.

> This ensures transparency and public awareness of key tax treaty milestones.

### **5. Determination of Residency**

Residency is a key factor in determining which country has taxing rights.

#### For **Individuals**:
An individual is deemed a resident of **only one** of the two countries based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home**  
   → If the individual has a permanent home in one country, they are deemed a resident of that country.  
   → If in both, residency is assigned to the country where the individual’s **personal and economic relations are closer** ("centre of vital interests").

2. **If centre of vital interests cannot be determined**  
   → Residency is assigned to the country where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **If habitual abode is in both or neither**  
   → Residency is assigned to the country of **nationality**.

4. **If individual is a national of both or neither**  
   → The competent authorities must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

> This hierarchy ensures a fair and predictable method for determining residency, especially for dual nationals or those with international ties.

#### For **Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, partnerships)**:
- If a person (e.g., a company) is a resident of both countries:
  - The competent authorities must resolve residency via **mutual agreement**.
  - In the absence of agreement, **no tax relief or exemption** under the Convention applies.
  - Factors considered: place of effective management, incorporation, and other relevant criteria.

> This prevents ambiguity and ensures that tax treatment is consistent and enforceable.

### **6. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

#### Examples of PEs:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any natural resource exploration/exploitation site

#### Exceptions (PEs are NOT considered if):
- Facilities are used **only for storage, display, or delivery** of goods.
- Stock is maintained **solely for storage, display, or delivery**.
- Stock is maintained **solely for processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place is used **only for purchasing goods or collecting information**.
- Fixed place is used **only for preparatory or auxiliary activities**.
- Any combination of the above, **as long as the overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**.

> These exclusions prevent abuse of the PE concept for tax avoidance.

#### Special Rule:
- If a person (not an independent agent) has **authority to conclude contracts** on behalf of an enterprise in a Contracting State, then the enterprise is deemed to have a PE in that State **regardless of whether a physical office exists**, **unless** the activities are limited to those listed above (which would not constitute a PE).

> This protects businesses from being taxed merely because they have a representative with contractual authority.

#### Exclusion for Agents:
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE simply because it uses a **broker, general commission agent, or independent agent** acting in the ordinary course of business.

> This prevents tax on routine business intermediaries.

#### No PE due to Control:
- Merely **controlling or being controlled by** a company in the other country **does not** create a PE.

> This prevents tax on mere ownership or control relationships.

### **7. Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**

#### Key Provisions:
- Income from **immovable property** (including agricultural or forestry income) located in the other country **may be taxed in that country**.
- **Immovable property** includes:
  - Property accessory to land
  - Livestock and equipment used in agriculture/forestry
  - Rights under general land laws (e.g., usufruct)
  - Rights to variable/fixed payments for working mineral deposits or natural resources
- **Excluded**: Ships and aircraft (not considered immovable property)

> This allows the host country to tax income from property located within its borders.

#### Application:
- Applies to:
  - Direct use, letting, or use in any form of immovable property
  - Income from enterprises using immovable property
  - Income from independent personal services performed on such property

> This ensures that income from property is not double-taxed.

---

### **8. Taxation of Enterprise Profits**

#### General Rule:
- Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State are **taxable only in that State**.
- **Exception**: If the enterprise carries on business in the other country through a **permanent establishment (PE)**, then profits attributable to that PE may be taxed in the other country.

#### How Profits Are Attributed to a PE:
- Profits are attributed to the PE as if it were a **separate, independent enterprise** engaged in the same or similar activities under similar conditions.
- This is known as the **"arm’s length" or "separate enterprise" principle**.

#### Deductions:
- Expenses incurred for the PE (including executive and general administrative expenses) are **deductible**, whether incurred in the PE country or elsewhere.

> This ensures that the PE is taxed fairly and with proper cost recovery.
