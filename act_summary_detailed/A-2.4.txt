The provided text appears to be a **draft or excerpt of a legislative act** related to internal trade in Canada, but it is **incomplete and largely redundant**. Specifically, the section begins with a preamble stating that the Government of Canada and the provincial and territorial governments have entered into an **Agreement on Internal Trade**, and that reducing barriers to the free movement of **persons, goods, services, and investments** is essential for a competitive, efficient, and stable domestic market.

However, the actual **enactment ("NOW, THEREFORE")** is followed by **19 repeated lines** stating:

> [Repealed, 2017, c. 33, s. 228]

This indicates that the provisions of the act in question were **repealed (officially canceled or replaced)** by **Bill C-33, 2017**, specifically **Section 228**, which was part of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017*.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Context and Purpose**
- The original intent of the proposed act was to establish a **national framework for internal trade** across Canada.
- It aimed to **remove or reduce barriers** to the free movement of:
  - **Goods** (products and services)
  - **Services** (e.g., professional services, financial services)
  - **Investments** (e.g., cross-border business investments)
  - **Persons** (e.g., labor mobility, workforce movement)
- The goal was to create a **unified, open, and efficient domestic market**, enhancing:
  - Business competitiveness
  - Economic efficiency
  - Sustainable development
  - National economic resilience

#### 2. **Key Provisions (as implied, though not fully detailed)**
Although the actual legislative text is missing, based on the preamble and common understanding of Canada’s internal trade policy, the intended provisions likely included:
- Harmonization of regulations across provinces and territories
- Elimination of non-tariff barriers (e.g., differing labeling, safety standards, licensing requirements)
- Streamlined permitting and compliance processes
- Enhanced cooperation between federal, provincial, and territorial governments
- Mechanisms for dispute resolution and enforcement

#### 3. **Legal Status and Repeal**
- The act was **never fully enacted** in its original form.
- It was **repealed in 2017** by **Section 228 of Bill C-33**, which became part of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017*.
- The repeal means that the specific legislative framework proposed in the draft act **no longer exists** in Canadian law.
- This repeal may reflect a shift in policy priorities—such as focusing on **federal-provincial fiscal relations**, **regulatory modernization**, or **economic diversification**—rather than pursuing a comprehensive internal trade agreement through direct legislation.

#### 4. **Why Was It Repealed?**
Possible reasons include:
- The federal government determined that internal trade issues were better addressed through **sector-specific regulations**, **regulatory reform initiatives**, or **intergovernmental agreements** rather than a standalone act.
- Concerns about **regulatory overreach** or **provincial sovereignty**.
- The complexity of harmonizing diverse provincial regulations across Canada made a broad legislative approach impractical.
- The 2017 budget context emphasized **fiscal responsibility and targeted spending**, not broad trade liberalization.

#### 5. **Current Status of Internal Trade in Canada**
- While the specific act has been repealed, the **principles of internal trade** remain relevant.
- Canada continues to pursue internal trade through:
  - **Interprovincial and interterritorial cooperation** (e.g., through the *Internal Trade Committee* or *Interprovincial Trade Working Group*)
  - **Regulatory modernization** (e.g., the *Regulatory Impact Analysis* process)
  - **Sectoral initiatives** (e.g., in agriculture, energy, health, and digital services)
- The **2021–2023 Internal Trade Strategy** (launched by the federal government) reflects ongoing efforts to reduce barriers, though not through a new standalone act.

### Conclusion

The document you provided is a **repealed draft act** that proposed to establish a comprehensive framework for internal trade across Canada. While it had strong policy goals—promoting free movement of goods, services, persons, and investments—the act was **officially repealed in 2017** under **Section 228 of Bill C-33**. As such, it is **no longer part of Canadian law**.

Despite its repeal, the underlying vision of a more integrated and efficient Canadian domestic market remains a priority, and efforts to reduce trade barriers continue through **cooperative policies, sectoral reforms, and intergovernmental dialogue** rather than through a single legislative act.

> ✅ **Final Note**: This summary is based on the provided text and known Canadian policy developments. The absence of substantive provisions in the enacted section confirms that the act was not implemented and was instead repealed.
