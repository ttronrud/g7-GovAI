The Act enacts four distinct tax treaties (conventions), each with its own full text and supporting schedules:

   - Establishes a framework for avoiding double taxation and preventing tax avoidance between Canada and Namibia.  
   - Includes provisions on income taxation (e.g., dividends, interest, royalties), capital gains, and tax residency.  
   - Schedules 1 and 2 provide detailed technical provisions and definitions.

2. **Canada–Serbia Tax Convention Act, 2013**  
   - Addresses tax treatment of income and capital gains between Canada and Serbia.  
   - Covers issues such as taxation of employment income, pensions, and capital gains.  
   - Includes mechanisms for resolving disputes and mutual assistance in tax matters.

   - Addresses taxation of income from employment, self-employment, business, and capital.  
   - Includes provisions on tax residency, tax credits, and mutual legal assistance.

> Each of these conventions is formally enacted as a standalone Act, with **Schedules 1 to 4** containing the full text of the respective treaty and its annexes (e.g., definitions, tax rates, exceptions).

---

##### **(B) Approval and Legal Force of the Protocol and Agreement (Schedule 5)**
- The **Protocol and Agreement** set out in **Schedule 5** are approved and given **full legal force in Canada** during the period they are in force.
- These instruments were entered into on **December 10, 2013**, and entered into force on that date.
- The **Minister of Finance** is required to:
  - Publish a **notice in the Canada Gazette** within **60 days** of the entry into force of the Protocol and Agreement.
- This ensures public awareness and legal transparency.

> **Note:** The Protocol and Agreement are related to the **Canada–Swiss Double Taxation Convention**, specifically the **Amending Protocol of October 22, 2010**, and its interpretation.

---

##### **(C) Effective Date of Key Provisions (Sections 6 to 8)**
- Sections 6 to 8 of the Act come into force on **January 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the Protocol and Agreement in Schedule 5 enter into force**.
- Since the Protocol and Agreement entered into force on **December 10, 2013**, these sections take effect on **January 1, 2014**.
- This phased implementation allows time for administrative and legal systems to adapt to the new obligations.

> **Note:** These sections likely relate to procedural rules, information exchange mechanisms, or administrative assistance provisions under the tax conventions.

---

##### **(D) Approval and Legal Force of the Supplementary Convention (Schedule 6)**
- The **Supplementary Convention** in **Schedule 6** is approved and given legal force in Canada during the period it is in force.
- It was in force from **October 31, 2013**.
- The Minister of Finance must publish a notice in the *Canada Gazette* within **60 days** of its entry into force.

> This Supplementary Convention supplements the **1997 Berne Convention between Canada and Switzerland** (on avoidance of double taxation), particularly in areas such as information exchange and administrative assistance.

---

##### **(E) Precedence of the Switzerland Convention (Berne 1997, as amended)**
- **For greater certainty**, the provisions of the **Convention between Canada and Switzerland (1997)**, as amended by:
  - The **Amending Protocol of October 22, 2010**, and
  - The **Supplementary Convention in Schedule 6**,  
  **prevail over any conflicting provisions** in other Canadian tax laws or other treaties.
- This ensures that the Canada–Switzerland tax agreement takes priority when there is inconsistency.

> This provision is critical in resolving potential conflicts between different tax treaties and ensures consistency in how tax obligations are interpreted in Canada.

---

##### **(F) Application of Section 19 of the Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act**
- Section 19 of the *Act to implement conventions between Canada and Morocco, Pakistan, Singapore, Philippines, Dominican Republic, and Switzerland* applies to the **Canada–Switzerland Convention (1997)** as amended.
- This means that the **interpretative rules** (e.g., on tax residency, information exchange, or administrative assistance) established in that section govern the application of the Switzerland Convention in Canada.

> This reinforces the legal framework for interpreting tax treaties, particularly in areas involving mutual assistance and tax residency.

---

#### **3. Clarification on Article 25 of the Canada–Switzerland Convention (Administrative Assistance)**

This section includes a **formal diplomatic agreement** between Canada and Switzerland regarding the interpretation of **Article 25** of the 1997 Double Taxation Convention, which governs **requests for administrative assistance** (e.g., information from tax authorities).

##### **Background of the Proposal**
- The Swiss Federal Council proposed a clarification to **subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 of the Interpretative Protocol** to Article 25.
- The original requirement (clauses i and v) mandates:
  - The requesting state must provide the **name and address** of the person under examination.
  - The requesting state must provide the **name and address** of any person believed to have the information.
- The Swiss government argued that these requirements are intended to **prevent "fishing expeditions"** (unauthorized or overly broad information requests).

##### **Key Clarification**
Despite these procedural requirements, **a requested state (Canada) must comply with a request for administrative assistance if the requesting state provides**:
1. **Identification of the person under examination or investigation** — this can be done through alternative means (e.g., account number, tax identification number, or other identifying data), not necessarily name and address.
2. **Name and address of any person believed to possess the requested information**, to the extent known.

> This clarification ensures that **effective tax cooperation is not hindered** by overly strict identification requirements, while still maintaining safeguards against abuse.

##### **Final Agreement**
- Canada confirmed that the proposal is acceptable.
- The **joint letter** from Canada and Switzerland constitutes a **binding agreement** on the interpretation of Article 25.
- The agreement **enters into force** on the date when both governments notify each other that internal measures have been completed.
- It **takes effect from the date of entry into force of the Amending Protocol (October 22, 2010)**.

> This agreement enhances the practicality and effectiveness of information exchange between Canada and Switzerland in tax matters.
