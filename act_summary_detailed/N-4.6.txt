   The Act begins with a solemn recognition of the tragic event that occurred on **December 6, 1989**, when **fourteen women were killed** in a violent, targeted attack at the University of Montreal. The attack, which involved the use of a machete and firearms, was carried out by a man who had a personal vendetta against the women. The victims were students, many of whom were from marginalized or vulnerable backgrounds. The incident was widely condemned as a horrific example of gender-based violence and a profound violation of women's safety and dignity.

2. **Denunciation of Violence Against Women**  
   The Act explicitly affirms that violence against women is unacceptable and must be condemned. It recognizes that such violence is not only a crime but also a societal failure—rooted in patriarchal norms, gender inequality, and systemic neglect. By denouncing violence, the Act aims to reinforce the moral and legal responsibility of the Canadian state and society to protect women and girls.

3. **National Reflection and Prevention**  
   The Canadian people, through the democratic process, have expressed a desire to **reflect on the 1989 tragedy** and to learn from it. This reflection is not merely commemorative; it is intended to serve as a catalyst for **preventing future acts of violence against women**. The Act underscores that remembrance must be linked to action—specifically, to policy change, public awareness, and structural reforms aimed at eliminating gender-based violence.
