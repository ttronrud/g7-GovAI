**Detailed Summary of the *Protecting Air Service Act* (Canada, 2012)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Protecting Air Service Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted in 2012 to prevent disruptions to air service operations during a labor dispute between **Air Canada** and two major unions: the **International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)** and the **Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA)**. The Act was introduced in response to a stalemate over a collective agreement that had expired on **March 31, 2011**, and to ensure the continuity of essential air transportation services during the period of unresolved negotiations.

The Act is structured into two distinct parts, each addressing a different union (IAM and ACPA), reflecting separate labor disputes. Despite their differences in union representation, both parts share a common framework designed to **suspend strikes and lockouts**, **require the resumption of operations**, **protect employees from retaliation**, and **facilitate a final resolution through binding arbitration**.

### **3. Suspension of Strikes and Lockouts (General Principle)**

**Condition**:  
If, *before* the coming into force of the Act:
- The employer has **not declared or caused a lockout**, and  
- The union has **not declared or authorized a strike**,  

Then upon the **coming into force** of the Act:
- The employer’s right to declare or cause a lockout is **suspended**.
- The union’s right to declare or authorize a strike is **suspended**.
- **Employees are prohibited from participating in a strike**.

> ⚠️ This suspension applies until the **collective agreement is extended** (see below).

---

### **4. Obligations to Resume Air Service and Employee Duties**

Upon coming into force:
- **Air Canada must continue or resume air service operations without delay**.
- **Every employee must continue or resume their duties without delay**, when required.

> This provision ensures that the airline maintains essential services and that employees return to work promptly, preventing service disruptions.

---

### **5. Prohibitions on Retaliation and Interference**

#### For the **Employer and its Officers/Representatives**:
- **Prohibited actions**:
  - Impeding any employee from complying with their duty to resume work.
  - Discharging or disciplining any employee **because** they participated in a strike *before* the Act came into force.

#### For the **Union and its Officers/Representatives**:
- **Mandatory actions**:
  - Must **immediately notify employees** of the resumption of operations and their duty to return to work.
  - Must **take reasonable steps to ensure compliance** with work obligations.
  - Must **refrain from any conduct** that could discourage employees from complying.

> These provisions protect both employee rights and operational stability by preventing retaliation and promoting cooperation.

---

### **6. Extension of the Collective Agreement**

- The term of the collective agreement is **extended** to include:
  - The period from **April 1, 2011**, to the day a **new collective agreement** is signed and comes into effect.

> This extension makes the expired agreement **effective and binding** during this period, even though it had technically expired.

> **Important**: Despite any provisions in the original agreement or the Canada Labour Code, the extended agreement remains valid and enforceable during this period.

---

### **7. Prohibition on Future Strikes or Lockouts**

Until the collective agreement expires (as extended):
- **No lockout** may be declared by the employer against the union.
- **No strike** may be declared or authorized by the union against the employer.
- **No employee may participate in a strike**.

> This creates a **de facto moratorium** on industrial action, ensuring stability in operations.

---

### **8. Final Offer Arbitration Process (Core Mechanism)**

This section outlines a structured arbitration process to resolve outstanding issues in the collective agreement.

#### **Appointment of Arbitrator**
- The **Minister of Labour** appoints an arbitrator deemed appropriate.
- The arbitrator has **all powers and duties** under:
  - Paragraphs 60(1)(a) and (a.2) to (a.4) of the Canada Labour Code.
  - Section 61 of the Canada Labour Code (final offer arbitration).

#### **Submission Requirements (within time and manner specified by the arbitrator)**
Each party (employer and union) must submit to the arbitrator:
1. A list of **matters in agreement** as of a date set by the arbitrator, with proposed contractual language.
2. A list of **matters still in dispute** as of that date.
3. A **final offer** (proposed settlement) on the disputed matters, including proposed contractual language that can be incorporated into a new agreement.

> The final offer must be practical and capable of being integrated into a new collective agreement.

#### **Arbitrator’s Decision Timeline**
- Within **90 days** of appointment (or a longer period if specified by the Minister), the arbitrator must:
  - Determine matters in agreement.
  - Determine matters in dispute.
  - **Select one final offer** (either employer’s or union’s).
  - Issue a **final decision** and forward a copy to the Minister, employer, and union.

> ⚠️ *Exception*: If one party fails to submit a final offer, the arbitrator selects the final offer from the other party.

#### **Guiding Principles in Selection**
The arbitrator must consider:
- The **tentative agreement reached on February 10, 2012**.
- The **conciliation commissioner’s report dated February 22, 2012**.
- The need for terms and conditions that are:
  - **Consistent with those in other airlines** (to ensure competitiveness).
  - **Flexible enough** to ensure:
    - The **short- and long-term economic viability and competitiveness** of Air Canada.
    - The **sustainability of the employer’s pension plan**, including any short-term funding pressures.

> This ensures that the final agreement is not only fair but also financially sustainable for the airline.

#### **Nature of the Arbitrator’s Decision**
- The decision must be **drafted as a new collective agreement**.
- It should **incorporate the agreed-upon language** and the selected final offer.
- The decision is **effective and binding** from the date it is made.

> Even though it is a new agreement, the **Canada Labour Code applies to it as if it were entered into under normal procedures**.

---

### **9. Flexibility in Implementation**

- The new collective agreement may provide that **any provisions take effect before or after** the date the agreement becomes effective.
- The parties are **free to amend** any provision of the new agreement (except the **term of the agreement**) at any time before or after the agreement is finalized.
- This allows for negotiation and adjustment without invalidating the final arbitration decision.

---

### **10. Preemption of Judicial Review**

- **No court action** may be taken to:
  - Question the **arbitrator’s appointment**.
  - Review, prohibit, or restrain the **arbitrator’s decision or proceedings**.

> This ensures **arbitration finality** and prevents judicial interference, reinforcing the neutrality and authority of the process.

---

### **11. Early Agreement Clause**

- If, **before the arbitrator makes a decision**, the employer and union **enter into a new collective agreement**:
  - The arbitrator’s duties **cease immediately** upon the new agreement’s entry into force.
  - The new agreement is treated as if it had been negotiated and ratified under the Canada Labour Code.

> This provides a **flexible exit route** from the arbitration process if both parties reach a mutual agreement.

---

#### **Individual Offences**
- Anyone who violates a provision of the Act is guilty of an offence punishable on **summary conviction**.
- **Fine per day** of the offence:
  - **$50,000** if the person was acting as an officer/representative of the employer, IAM, or ACPA.
