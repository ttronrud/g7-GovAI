**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act* (CITTA) establishes and governs the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (Tribunal)**, an independent body responsible for addressing trade-related disputes involving imports into Canada. The Tribunal plays a key role in assessing whether certain imported goods are causing or threatening to cause **serious injury** to domestic producers of like or directly competitive goods — a central concern in Canada’s trade policy and anti-dumping or countervailing duty frameworks.

This Act provides the legal foundation for the Tribunal’s structure, membership, powers, duties, procedural rules, and relationships with federal institutions such as the Minister of Finance and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). It also includes provisions related to specific trade agreements (e.g., CUSMA, CPTPP, CCFTA, etc.) and defines key legal terms such as "serious injury," "threat of serious injury," and "principal cause."

5. **Specific Inquiries on Tariff Benefits**  
   The Tribunal is mandated to conduct inquiries into whether **tariff benefits** under various free trade agreements are causing or threatening serious injury to domestic producers. These include:

   | Agreement | Tariff Reference | Inquiry Focus |
   |--------|------------------|---------------|
   | **Canada–Israel FTA** | Israel Tariff | Whether Israel-tariff-entitled goods are causing serious injury due to increased imports. |
   | **Chile** | Chile Tariff (non-textile/apparel) | Whether increased imports under Chile Tariff constitute a *principal cause* of serious injury or threat. |
   | **Colombia** | Colombia Tariff | Whether increased imports (absolute or relative to domestic production) constitute a *principal cause* of serious injury or threat. |

   | **Panama** | Panama Tariff | Same assessment framework. |
   | **Peru** | Peru Tariff | Same assessment framework. |

> In each case, the Tribunal must determine whether the **tariff benefit alone** constitutes a **principal cause** of serious injury — meaning it is no less important than any other factor contributing to injury.

> **Principal Cause**: An important cause that is no less significant than any other cause of serious injury or threat.

> These inquiries are triggered only when the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister**, refers the matter to the Tribunal.
