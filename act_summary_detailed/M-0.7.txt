**Detailed Summary of the Marine Liability Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Marine Liability Act* is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation that governs liability in maritime incidents involving injury, death, property damage, and loss of earnings. It establishes the legal framework for claims arising under Canadian maritime law, particularly in relation to navigation, shipping, and the operation of vessels. The Act balances the need to provide compensation to victims and their dependents with the protection of shipowners and operators from excessive liability through limits on liability and contribution mechanisms.

The Act is structured into several parts and divisions, each addressing specific aspects of maritime liability, including:

- **Dependant claims** (for injuries or deaths)
- **Liability limits** under international conventions
- **Contribution and indemnity** between parties
- **Jurisdiction and procedural rules**
- **Application of international treaty obligations**

## **Part II: Dependents’ Rights in Injuries or Death**

This section establishes the right of **dependants** of injured or deceased persons to claim compensation from those responsible for the injury or death.

### **Definition of “Dependant”**
A dependant is someone who had a close familial or conjugal relationship with the injured or deceased person at the time of the incident. This includes:
- **Family members**: sons, daughters, stepchildren, grandchildren, adoptive parents, or individuals who stood in place of a parent.
- **Spouse or cohabiting partner**: Must have lived together in a conjugal relationship for at least one year.
- **Siblings, parents, grandparents, step-parents, or adoptive parents**.

> *Note: The definition is broad to protect individuals who rely on the injured/deceased person financially or emotionally.*

### **Applicability**
- Applies to claims under **Canadian maritime law** as defined in the *Federal Courts Act*, or any other Canadian law related to navigation and shipping.

### **Right to Sue**
- If a person is injured due to the **fault or neglect** of another, their dependants may sue in a court of competent jurisdiction for losses resulting from the injury.
- If a person dies due to the fault or neglect of another, their dependants may sue for losses resulting from the death — even though the deceased would have been entitled to damages had they lived.

### **Types of Damages**
Damages may include:
1. **Loss of guidance, care, and companionship** — compensation for the emotional and practical loss the dependant reasonably expected from the injured or deceased person.
2. **Payments made by public authorities** — such as government benefits or insurance payments made to the injured/deceased or their dependants, which the dependant may recover (subject to subrogation).

> *Note: The court may not consider future insurance premiums or payments upon death when assessing damages.*

### **Apportionment of Liability**
- Damages are subject to any **apportionment** (i.e., division of fault) under Part 2.
- Damages may be awarded **proportionally** to each dependant’s loss.
- The court determines the **shares** of the award and divides the amount accordingly.

### **Payment into Court**
- A defendant may **pay money directly into court** to compensate all dependants without specifying individual shares.
- This allows for a streamlined process and avoids disputes over division.

### **Protection for Minors or Disabled Individuals**
- The court may **postpone** payment to dependants under 18 or under legal disability.
- Payments may be made from the amount paid into court under Section 8.
- The court may issue any order deemed in the **interest of the minor or disabled person**.

### **Who Can Bring the Action?**
- The action is **for the benefit of dependants**.
- For a deceased person, the action must be brought by:
  - The **executor or administrator** of the estate.
  - **If no executor or administrator exists**, or if no action is brought within **six months of death**, any or all dependants may bring the action.
- The procedure is treated as if brought by an executor or administrator, with necessary adaptations.

### **Procedural Requirements**
- The claimant must:
  - Take **reasonable steps to identify and join all entitled dependants** as parties.
  - Clearly state the **grounds of claim** for each dependant on whose behalf the action is brought.

### **Consolidation of Claims**
- Multiple claims for the same injured or deceased person may be **consolidated into one action** or tried together in the same court upon application by any party.

### **Court Discretion**
- If multiple dependants bring claims, the court may make any **order or determination it deems just**.

### **Limitation Periods**
- Actions must be commenced within **two years** of:
  - The **cause of action arising** (for injuries).
  - The **date of death** (for deaths).

> *Note: This is a strict limitation period — claims beyond this timeframe are barred.*

### **Earnings Included**
- “Earnings” includes **freight, passage money, and hire**, which may be part of the damages in cases of loss of income due to injury or death.

## **Part III: Liability for Fault or Neglect (Joint and Several Liability)**

This section governs how liability is apportioned when more than one party is at fault.

### **Fault and Liability**
- Where loss results from the **fault or neglect of two or more persons or ships**, their liability is **proportional** to the degree of fault or negligence.
- If fault cannot be determined, liability is **equal**.

### **Joint and Several Liability**
- Faulty parties are **jointly and severally liable** to the victim(s) — meaning the injured party can recover the full amount from any one of them.
- However, **between themselves**, they are liable to **contribute or indemnify** each other in proportion to their fault.

> *Example:* If Ship A and Ship B collide, both are liable to the victim, but Ship A is 60% at fault and Ship B 40%. The victim may recover from either, but Ship A must pay 60% of the damages, and Ship B 40%.

### **Exclusion of Joint and Several Liability in Certain Cases**
- If **two or more ships** cause loss to one another (e.g., cargo damage), their liability to **make good the loss is not joint and several** — they are only liable to contribute among themselves.

### **Liability Includes Responsibility of Persons**
- A reference to a ship’s liability includes **any person responsible for navigation, management, or fault** — not just the owner.

### **Right to Claim Contribution or Indemnity**
A person who suffered loss may seek contribution or indemnity from another party at fault by:
1. **Adding the other party** to an ongoing proceeding (court, tribunal, or arbitration).
2. **Starting a new proceeding** in court or tribunal.
3. **If the other party has settled with the claimant**, the claimant may continue or commence a proceeding to claim contribution.

> *Important:* The court or tribunal may **deny damages or adjust the amount** if it finds the settlement was **unreasonable**.

### **Time Limit for Contribution Claims**
- A claim for contribution or indemnity must be made **within one year** of:
  - The **date of judgment**, or
  - The **date of settlement agreement**.

> *Note:* This claim is **not barred** by any limitation periods or notice requirements that apply to the original claim.
