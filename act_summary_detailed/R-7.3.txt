**Detailed Summary of the *Restoring Rail Service Act*, 2012**

---

### **Overview**

The *Restoring Rail Service Act* (2012) is a Canadian federal statute enacted to address a critical disruption in rail service operations caused by a prolonged labor dispute between the **Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)** and the **Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC)**. The Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons and came into force on **June 1, 2012**.

Its primary objective is to **restore and maintain essential rail service operations** by ensuring that employees return to work and that no further disruptions occur—such as strikes or lockouts—during a legally defined transitional period. It also establishes a structured, neutral arbitration process to resolve outstanding disputes over collective agreements, thereby preventing further industrial action.

### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Title**: The Act is known as the *Restoring Rail Service Act*.
- **Key Definitions**:
  - **Arbitrator**: An individual appointed under subsection 8(1) to resolve disputes over collective agreements.
  - **Collective Agreement**: Any agreement between CPR and the TCRC that expired on **December 31, 2011**.
  - **Employee**: A person employed by CPR and bound by a collective agreement.

> *General Rule*: Unless otherwise stated, terms used in the Act have the same meaning as in **Part I of the Canada Labour Code**.

---

### **2. Immediate Restoration of Rail Service (Section 3)**

Upon coming into force:
- The **employer (CPR)** must **continue or resume rail service operations without delay**.
- Every **employee** must **continue or resume their duties without delay**, if required.

👉 This provision ensures that essential transportation services are not interrupted due to ongoing industrial action.

---

### **3. Prohibition of Dismissals or Disciplinary Actions (Section 4)**

It is **prohibited** for:
- The employer or any of its officers/representatives to:
  - Impede an employee from complying with their work duties after the Act comes into force.
  - Discharge or discipline any employee **because** they participated in a strike **before** the Act came into force.

👉 This protects employees from retaliation for prior strike activity, ensuring a safe return to work.

---

### **4. Union Responsibilities (Section 5)**

The union and its officers must:
- **Immediately notify employees** that rail service will resume and that employees are required to return to work.
- Take **all reasonable steps** to ensure employees comply with the duty to return to work.
- **Refrain from any conduct** that might discourage or discourage employees from complying (e.g., public statements or campaigns).

👉 This promotes cooperation and avoids undermining the restoration of service through internal pressure or misinformation.

---

### **5. Extension of Collective Agreements (Section 6)**

- The term of each expired collective agreement is **automatically extended** to include the period from **January 1, 2012**, until a **new collective agreement** comes into effect.
- The extended agreement is:
  - **Effective and binding** on both parties, even if it contradicts earlier terms in the original agreement or the Canada Labour Code.
  - **Treated as if it were the original term of the agreement**, so that Part I of the Canada Labour Code applies to the extended period as if it were the original term.

👉 This prevents immediate breakdown of employment rights and provides legal continuity during the transition.

---

### **6. Prohibition of Strikes and Lockouts (Section 7)**

Until the new collective agreement is finalized:
- **No lockout** can be declared by the employer or its representatives.
- **No strike** can be declared or authorized by the union or its representatives.
- **No employee** in the affected bargaining unit may participate in a strike.

👉 This creates a **temporary freeze on industrial action**, ensuring stability and uninterrupted rail service.

---

### **7. Arbitration Process (Section 8)**

- The **Minister of Labour** must appoint an **arbitrator** for each expired collective agreement.
- The arbitrator will be responsible for resolving **all disputes** related to the amendment or revision of the collective agreement that were in dispute at the time of appointment.

#### Powers of the Arbitrator:
- Has all powers and duties of an arbitrator under:
  - Paragraphs 60(1)(a) and (a.2) to (a.4)
  - Section 61 of the **Canada Labour Code**
- Must deliver a decision **within 90 days** of appointment (or a longer period approved by the Minister).
- Must submit a **report to the Minister** detailing the decision.

👉 This establishes a neutral, legally binding process to resolve disputes without further strikes or lockouts.

---

### **8. Incorporation of Arbitrator’s Decision into the Collective Agreement (Section 9)**

From the day the arbitrator reports to the Minister, the collective agreement is **deemed amended** to include:
1. Any agreement reached **before** the arbitrator was appointed.
2. Any agreement reached **after** the appointment but **before** the report is submitted.
3. The **arbitrator’s final decision** on the disputed matters.

👉 This ensures that all parties are bound by a clear, legally enforceable agreement that reflects compromise and resolution.

---

### **9. Judicial Immunity and Non-Reviewability (Section 10)**

- **No court action** may be taken to:
  - Question the **appointment of the arbitrator**.
  - Review, prohibit, or restrain any **arbitrator’s decision or proceeding**.

👉 This provides strong legal protection to the arbitration process, ensuring finality and preventing judicial interference.

---

### **10. Termination of Arbitration if New Agreement is Reached (Section 11)**

- If the parties reach a **new collective agreement** before the arbitrator reports:
  - The arbitrator’s duties **cease immediately** upon the new agreement’s entry into force.
  - The arbitration process is terminated.

👉 This allows flexibility for the parties to negotiate a new deal without being forced into arbitration.

---

### **11. Effect of Arbitrator’s Decision (Section 12)**

- The arbitrator’s decision:
  - Is treated as a **new collective agreement** between the parties.
  - Is **effective and binding** from the day it is made.
  - Is subject to the **same rules** as a new collective agreement under Part I of the Canada Labour Code (e.g., minimum standards, working conditions, etc.).

👉 This gives the decision full legal standing and enforceability.

---

### **12. Flexibility in Effective Dates (Section 13)**

- A new collective agreement may specify that **certain provisions** take effect:
  - **Before** or **after** the agreement becomes effective.
  - This allows for phased implementation of changes.

👉 This enables practical and phased adjustments to work rules.

---

### **13. Amendment Rights (Section 14)**

- The parties are **free to amend** any provision of the new collective agreement **except** the term of the agreement.
- Amendments must be given effect as per the agreement.

👉 This preserves flexibility in negotiating terms while protecting the stability of the agreement’s duration.

---

### **14. Cost Recovery (Section 15)**

- All costs incurred by the Crown (Her Majesty in right of Canada) for:
  - Appointing the arbitrator
  - Performing the arbitrator’s duties
- Are **debts due to the Crown**.
- May be **recovered in equal parts** from the **employer (CPR)** and the **union** in any competent court.

👉 This ensures that the government bears the administrative cost of resolving the dispute and recovers it fairly from both parties.

---

    - **Up to $1,000** in all other cases.
  - Fine is assessed **per day or part of a day** the offence continues.

- **Corporate Offence**:
  - If the **employer or union** violates the Act:
    - Guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.
    - Fine: **Up to $100,000 per day or part of a day** the violation continues.

👉 These penalties serve as strong deterrents against violations such as lockouts, strikes, or retaliation.

---

### **16. No Imprisonment for Non-Payment (Section 17)**

- Despite **section 787(2) of the Criminal Code**, **no term of imprisonment** may be imposed for failure to pay a fine under Section 14.

👉 This emphasizes a **financial enforcement model** rather than criminal penalties.

---

### **17. Enforcement of Fines (Section 18)**

- If a person is convicted under Section 14 and the fine is not paid:
  - The **prosecutor may file the conviction** as
