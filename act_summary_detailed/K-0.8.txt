### **Detailed Summary of the Kingsmere Park Act, 1951**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose of the Act**

The *Kingsmere Park Act, 1951* (c. 18) is a statutory instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada to fulfill the wishes of **William Lyon Mackenzie King**, the country’s tenth Prime Minister (1921–1926, 1926–1930, 1935–1948), who passed away in 1950. 

Although Mackenzie King did not leave a formal will in the conventional sense, the Act is based on a **personal bequest** expressed in his **last will and testament**, specifically regarding the transfer of his family’s estate at **Kingsmere, Quebec**—a 500-acre property located in the province of Quebec. This property, known as **Kingsmere Park**, was bequeathed to the **Government of Canada** not as private land, but as a **public park in trust** for the benefit of Canadian citizens.

The primary purpose of the Act is to **establish a legal framework** for the administration, preservation, and use of Kingsmere Park in accordance with the specific intentions expressed by Mackenzie King in his will.
