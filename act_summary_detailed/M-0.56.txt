## **Core Provisions and Functions**

### **1. Insurance/Reinsurance by the Minister**
- The **Minister of Transport** may enter into agreements (either directly or through a person or association) to **insure or re-insure vessels or cargo** against war risks.
- These agreements may be structured in any form and include terms and conditions as prescribed by **regulations** or approved by the **Governor in Council**.
- The purpose is to **prevent vessel layups** and **ensure uninterrupted commerce** due to lack of private insurance coverage during times of conflict.

> 🔍 *This provision ensures that even if private insurers withdraw from war risk coverage, the government can step in to maintain maritime stability.*

### **2. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**
The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make regulations to implement the Act. These regulations may cover:
- The types of insurance or reinsurance allowed under the Act;
- The form, terms, and conditions of agreements;
- The **definition of cargo**, including:
  - Specific or general classifications;
  - When cargo begins or ends (e.g., at loading/unloading, at port entry/exit);
- The **designation of countries** where vessels may be registered for coverage under the Act (under paragraph (c) of the vessel definition).

> ⚖️ *This regulatory power allows flexibility to adapt to changing global security conditions and evolving maritime trade patterns.*

### **3. Establishment and Funding of the Marine War Risks Insurance Account**

- A **dedicated account** is created within the accounts of Canada — the *Marine War Risks Insurance Account*.
- Funds are credited to this account from:
  1. **Premiums and other moneys** collected from insurance or reinsurance agreements under the Act;
  2. **Appropriations** made by Parliament;
  3. **Direct credits** authorized by the Minister under Section 6.

> 💡 *This ensures a stable and legally sanctioned pool of funds to cover claims and administrative costs.*

### **4. Payment of Losses and Expenses**
- All payments made under the Act — including:
  - Losses due to war risks;
  - Costs of claims;
  - Return of premiums;
  - Administrative expenses —
  are to be paid **out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund** (Canada’s main government fund).

- These payments are then **charged to the Marine War Risks Insurance Account** (i.e., the account "earns" the cost through a charge mechanism).

> 📉 *This ensures that the financial burden of claims is covered by public funds, with proper accounting and oversight.*

---

### **5. Management of Account Balance**
- If the Minister determines that the **balance in the Account is insufficient** to meet obligations (i.e., claims or future liabilities), he may:
  - **Direct additional amounts to be credited** to the Account;
  - At any time, **recharge previously credited funds** to the Account if necessary.

> 🔄 *This provides operational flexibility to maintain financial stability during periods of high risk or unexpected claims.*

### **6. Audit and Oversight by the Auditor General**
- The **Auditor General of Canada** is responsible for auditing the Marine War Risks Insurance Account and all related transactions.
- Audits must be conducted at such times and in such manner as the Auditor General deems appropriate.
- The Auditor General must submit a **detailed report to Parliament** within:
  - **Three months** after completing the audit, or
  - **Thirty days** after the start of the next parliamentary session (if Parliament is not in session).

> 📚 *The report must include findings and recommendations, with due regard to public interest and national security.*

> 🔐 *This ensures transparency, accountability, and public trust in the use of public funds for war risk insurance.*
