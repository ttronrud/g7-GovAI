**Detailed Summary of the *Northern Canada Power Commission (Share Issuance and Sale Authorization) Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Northern Canada Power Commission (Share Issuance and Sale Authorization) Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted in 1988 to restructure the financial and operational framework of the **Northern Canada Power Commission (Corporation)**. It enables the transformation of certain government debts into shares and promissory notes, facilitates the transfer of assets and liabilities, and authorizes the sale of these instruments to the Government of the Northwest Territories (NWT). The Act also provides for the continuation of the Corporation as a corporate entity with share capital, under the laws of the Northwest Territories.

This Act is part of a broader effort to improve the financial sustainability and operational autonomy of the Northern Canada Power Commission, which was established to develop and manage power generation and transmission infrastructure in northern Canada—particularly in the Northwest Territories.

  - **Agreement**: A legally binding agreement between the **Minister of Northern Affairs** and the **Government of the Northwest Territories**, established under Section 7. This Agreement governs all aspects of share issuance, debt conversion, land use, and transfer of rights.
  - **Corporation**: Refers to the **Northern Canada Power Commission**, a corporation without share capital under the *Northern Canada Power Commission Act*, now being restructured to have share capital.
  - **Minister**: The **Minister of Northern Affairs**, responsible for overseeing the implementation of this Act and related agreements.

#### **2. Conversion of Debt into Shares**
- The Corporation has a **debt of C$96,128,838.43** owed to Her Majesty.
- **Forty-three million, one hundred twenty-eight thousand, eight hundred thirty-eight dollars and forty-three cents (C$43,128,838.43)** of this debt is **converted into shares** of equivalent value.
- The conversion follows the terms and conditions outlined in the **Agreement**.
- These shares are issued to the **Minister**, who holds them **in trust for Her Majesty**.

> This provision effectively transforms a government liability into equity, allowing the Corporation to raise capital through share issuance while maintaining fiscal accountability.

---

#### **3. Debt Conversion into Promissory Note**
- The remaining **fifty-three million dollars (C$53,000,000)** of the original debt is converted into a **promissory note payable to the Receiver General**.
- This note serves as a formal financial instrument, ensuring that the government retains a claim on future repayment or liquidation of the Corporation’s assets.

> This dual approach—shares for part of the debt, a promissory note for the remainder—provides a balanced financial structure between equity and debt instruments.

---

#### **4. Transfer of Property and Liabilities**
- All **property, rights, and interests** of Her Majesty held in the name of the Corporation and used in its operations in the Northwest Territories are **transferred to the Corporation**.
- All **outstanding liabilities and obligations** incurred by the Corporation in connection with its operations are also **transferred to the Corporation**.

> This ensures that the Corporation becomes fully responsible for its operations, assets, and financial obligations, removing the Crown from direct operational involvement.

---

#### **5. Authority to Sell or Lease Territorial Lands**
- **Notwithstanding** certain restrictions in the *Territorial Lands Act* (specifically paragraph 19(f)), the **Minister may sell, lease, or grant licenses or easements** over **territorial lands** under the Minister’s control, management, or administration.
- Such actions are permitted **on terms and conditions specified in the Agreement**.

> This provision grants significant flexibility to the federal government in managing land use in the NWT, particularly for infrastructure development related to power projects.

---

#### **6. Sale of Shares and Promissory Note to the NWT**
- The Minister may, with **approval of the Governor in Council**, enter into an agreement to:
  - **Sell the shares** issued under Section 4 (the converted debt shares) to the **Government of the Northwest Territories**.
  - **Assign the promissory note** (from Section 5) to the NWT government.

> This is a critical step in transferring ownership and financial control from the federal government to the territorial government, promoting local ownership and accountability.

---

#### **7. Authority to Execute Agreements and Governance**
- The Minister may direct the Corporation to:
  - Execute the Agreement and any related documents.
  - Pass, approve, amend, or ratify by-laws, resolutions, authorities, or similar instruments.
  - Perform any other actions necessary or incidental to implementing this Act or the Agreement.

> This grants the Minister broad executive authority to ensure the Corporation functions efficiently and in alignment with federal policy.

---

#### **8. Budgetary Treatment of Value Discrepancy**
- **Notwithstanding** the *Financial Administration Act*, the difference between:
  - The **recorded value** of the shares and promissory note in Canada’s accounts, and  
  - The **actual proceeds** received from their sale or assignment to the NWT,
  is **written off as a budgetary expenditure** and **deleted from Canada’s accounts**.

- This amount must be:
  - Reported in the **Public Accounts** for the fiscal year in which it occurs.
  - Submitted in a form approved by the **Treasury Board**, in accordance with *section 18(6)* of the *Financial Administration Act*.

> This ensures that the financial impact of the transfer is transparent and properly accounted for, even though the value difference is not recorded as a revenue or expense in traditional accounting.

> **Important Note**: This write-off does **not require** the Corporation to adjust its internal financial records for the value of the shares or promissory note.

---

#### **9. Continuity of the Corporation’s Legal Status**
- The Corporation is **continued as a corporation with share capital**, governed by the **laws of the Northwest Territories** as if it had been incorporated under those laws.
- This establishes legal continuity and allows the Corporation to operate under territorial jurisdiction, enhancing its legitimacy and operational efficiency in the region.

> This is a significant shift from its original status as a corporation without share capital.

---

#### **10. Employment Continuity**
- The employment of employees of the Corporation **before and after the coming into force** of this Act is deemed **continuous**.
- This protects existing staff from disruption and ensures stability during the transition period.

> This provision supports workforce continuity and reduces administrative and human resource costs during restructuring.

---

#### **11. Exemption from Water and Waste Fees**
- The Minister may, with **approval of the Governor in Council**, issue an order exempting the Corporation from:
  - Paying **fees for the right to use waters** or
  - Depositing **waste under a licence** under:
    - The *Northwest Territories Waters Act*, or
    - Part 1 of the *Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act*.

> This exemption facilitates the Corporation’s ability to operate power infrastructure without facing regulatory or financial barriers related to water rights or waste disposal.

---

#### **12. Commencement and Repeal/Amendment Notes**
- The Act comes into force on a day or days to be **fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- **Note**: The Act came into force on **May 5, 1988** (as indicated in the note, SI/88-84).
- Any **orders made under Section 12** of the original Act before this Act came into force **continue in force** as if they had been made under the amended version.

> This ensures legal continuity and avoids disruption in ongoing operations.
