### **Detailed Summary of the First Nations Fiscal Management Act**

---

#### **Overview and Context**

The *First Nations Fiscal Management Act* (FNFMA) is a landmark piece of federal legislation introduced by the Government of Canada in response to **Call to Action 44** of the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC)** and aligned with key principles of the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** — particularly **Articles 3 to 5, 20, 21, and 23** — which emphasize Indigenous self-determination, economic development, and economic reconciliation.

This Act recognizes that Indigenous peoples historically developed sophisticated economic systems based on **shared resources, trade, taxation, and community governance**, including the use of terms like *“taksis”* (a Chinook word meaning tax or sharing). The Act aims to modernize and institutionalize these traditional practices by enabling First Nations to establish **local revenue systems**, manage their own **taxation**, and exercise greater **financial autonomy** over reserve lands and communities.

## **Key Objectives of the Act**

1. **Promote Economic Self-Determination**
   - Empowers First Nations to create and manage their own **local revenue laws**, including property taxes, service fees, and development cost charges.
   - Enables First Nations to use local revenues for infrastructure development, service delivery, and economic growth.

2. **Recognize Inherent Rights to Self-Government**
   - Supports the inherent right of First Nations to govern themselves, including in financial and fiscal matters.
   - Does not define or prescribe the scope of self-government; instead, it provides a **framework for negotiation and implementation**.

3. **Establish a Comprehensive Fiscal Framework**
   - Creates institutions and processes to support transparent, accountable, and community-driven financial management.
   - Includes mechanisms for **taxation, borrowing, enforcement, consultation, and oversight**.

4. **Support Economic Reconciliation**
   - Aims to close the economic gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities by enabling Indigenous communities to generate and retain revenue.

5. **Preserve Traditional Practices**
   - Acknowledges historical Indigenous economic systems, such as shared ownership, community-based taxation, and inter-linguistic trade networks.

### **2. Recognition of First Nations Jurisdiction Over Property Taxation**

- First Nations can create **property taxation laws** for lands and interests within their reserves.
- These laws allow for:
  - Assessment of land value
  - Determination of tax rates
  - Collection of taxes for services (e.g., water, waste, recreation)
  - Imposition of **development cost charges** (fees for new construction)

> This reflects a long-standing initiative from 1988 when First Nations sought to gain jurisdiction over real property taxation — a right now formally recognized.

### **3. Legal Process for Making Local Revenue Laws**

To ensure transparency and community input, the process for creating local revenue laws is **rigorous and participatory**:

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Notice and Public Consultation (30 days minimum)**  
   Before making a law:
   - Publish a notice in the *First Nations Gazette*
   - Post it publicly on reserve lands
   - Send it via mail or electronic means to the **First Nations Tax Commission (FNTC)**

2. **Public Representation Period**  
   - Written representations can be submitted to the council within the 30-day period.
   - If a public meeting is scheduled, it must be advertised.

3. **Council Review**  
   - The council must consider all representations.
   - Must review the law before finalizing it.

4. **Submission to the First Nations Tax Commission (FNTC)**  
   - All proposed laws must be submitted to the FNTC for **approval**.
   - Laws must include:
     - Description of lands and interests affected
     - Assessment methods
     - Services funded by revenues
     - Details of prior consultation
     - Evidence of lawful passage through council procedures

5. **FNTC Approval Required**  
   - A law **does not take effect until approved** by the FNTC.
   - The law comes into force on the **later of**:
     - The day specified in the law
     - The day after FNTC approval

6. **Appeal Procedures**  
   - Laws must include clear appeal mechanisms for tax assessments.
   - Fixed rates of remuneration and terms of office for appeal officers are required.

7. **Judicial Notice**  
   - In court proceedings, a local revenue law may be taken as **judicially noticed** — meaning it is presumed true without needing proof.

8. **Exemptions for Minor Amendments**  
   - The FNTC may exempt a First Nation from full consultation requirements if the amendment is deemed **not significant**.

### **4. Borrowing Authority and Financial Management**

- First Nations may **borrow money** from the **First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA)**, with borrowing secured by:
  - Local revenues
  - Other revenues (e.g., royalties, dividends, lease income)

- Borrowing is subject to:
  - Approval by the FNFA
  - Conditions set by regulation
  - Oversight by the FNFM Board

- **Secured Revenues Trust Account**:
  - Funds are held jointly by the FNFA and the First Nation.
  - Ensures revenues are available for debt servicing and development.

- **Intermediate Account**:
  - Used to temporarily hold revenues before transfer to the secured trust account.

> This allows First Nations to access capital markets using their own revenues as collateral — a model used by other provincial governments.

---

### **5. Enforcement Powers**

First Nations are empowered to enforce local revenue laws, including:

- **Creation of liens or legal hypothecs** (in Quebec: prior claims)
- **Imposition and recovery of interest and penalties** on unpaid taxes
- **Seizure and sale of personal property** (excluding dwellings)
- **Discontinuance of services** (e.g., water, waste) if taxes are unpaid
- **Recovery of enforcement costs**

> However, **no enforcement measures** are allowed for offences punishable on summary conviction (as defined in the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act).

> If a First Nation has adopted a **land code** under the Framework Agreement, it may use enforcement measures provided in that code.

> If taxes are unpaid for **more than two years**, the First Nation may **assign rights or interests** in reserve land to recover the debt — subject to regulation.

---

### **6. Financial Administration and Governance**

- The **council** may pass laws on:
  - Financial administration (budgeting, accounting, reporting)
  - Delegation of powers to bodies or individuals
  - Co-management arrangements (with government or third parties)

- These laws must be **approved by the First Nations Financial Management Board (FNFM Board)** to ensure accountability.

- The **FNFM Board** ensures:
  - Compliance with financial standards
  - Transparency in financial operations
  - Support for co-management and third-party management models

---

### **7. Exemptions and Special Provisions**

- **FNTC Exemptions**: Minor amendments to laws may be exempted from full consultation.
- **No Statutory Instruments Act Applies**: Local revenue laws and certain financial laws are **not subject to the Statutory Instruments Act**, allowing greater flexibility and faster implementation.
- **No Requirement for Capital Assets to Be on Reserve Lands**: Capital infrastructure (e.g., hospitals, roads) does not have to be located on reserve lands — promoting broader regional development.
