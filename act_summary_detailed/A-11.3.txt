### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is formally titled: *The Anishinabek Nation Education Agreement Act*.
- It serves to **legalize, implement, and enforce** the Anishinabek Nation Education Agreement, which is a foundational agreement between the Government of Canada and the Anishinabek Nation (a collective of First Nations including the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi peoples).

---

#### **2. Definitions**
The Act defines key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agreement** | Refers to the Anishinabek Nation Education Agreement signed on August 16, 2017, including all amendments made to it. |
| **Band** | Has the same meaning as in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*—a recognized Indigenous community with status under federal law. |
| **Constitution** | A constitution ratified by a participating First Nation in accordance with the Agreement. |
| **Education** | Includes all education programs and services from junior kindergarten through the end of secondary school in Ontario. |
| **First Nation Law** | Laws created under Section 7 of this Act (i.e., laws made by participating First Nations in accordance with the Agreement). |
| **Participating First Nation** | A band listed in the Schedule to the Act. |
| **Student** | Defined in Section 1.1 of the Agreement—typically refers to children and youth enrolled in education programs on reserve. |

> These definitions provide clarity and consistency in interpreting the rights and responsibilities of parties involved.

#### **3. Supremacy of the Agreement**
- **In case of conflict**: The Agreement **prevails over any conflicting provision** in:
  - Acts of Parliament
  - Regulations made under Acts of Parliament
- This principle ensures that the Agreement takes precedence in matters related to education, even if it contradicts existing laws or regulations.
- However, **this supremacy is limited**:
  - The *Anishinabek Nation Governance Agreement Act* takes precedence over this Act (and its regulations) in cases of inconsistency.
  - This reflects a hierarchy of agreements, where governance matters are governed by a separate, overarching agreement.

---

#### **4. Applicability**
- The Act applies to **every participating First Nation** as defined in the Schedule.
- It is binding on all persons and bodies, meaning it can be relied upon in legal and administrative contexts.

---

#### **5. The Agreement is Not a Treaty**
- The Act explicitly states that the Agreement is **not a treaty** under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*.
- This distinction is important because:
  - Treaties have constitutional status and are protected under Section 35.
  - This Agreement is not considered a treaty, but rather a **modern, negotiated, self-governance agreement** based on mutual consent and partnership.

---

#### **6. First Nation Authority Over Education**
- A participating First Nation may, **to the extent permitted by the Agreement**, make **laws regarding education** that apply on its reserve.
- These laws are known as **First Nation Laws** and are created under Section 7 of the Act.
- These laws are **not subject to the Indian Act’s general provisions** once enacted.

> **Critical Provision**:  
> When a First Nation enacts a law under this Act, **Sections 114(1), 115, and 117 of the Indian Act cease to apply** to that First Nation.  
> This removes barriers such as restrictions on education funding, student enrollment, or control over education delivery—enabling true self-determination.

---

#### **7. Obligation to Provide Education**
- Participating First Nations are **required to provide or make provision for education** for their students, in accordance with the Agreement.
- The education must, **if practicable**, be **comparable to the public school system in Ontario**.
- This ensures that students can **transfer seamlessly** between reserve-based education and public schools without academic penalties or loss of credits.

> This provision promotes equity and access, especially for youth who may need to move to urban areas for post-secondary education or employment.

---

#### **8. Establishment of the Kinoomaadziwin Education Body**
- A **corporation without share capital**, named the **Kinoomaadziwin Education Body**, is established to support the delivery of education under the Agreement.
- The name "Kinoomaadziwin" means "the way of learning" or "the path of knowledge" in Anishinabek languages—highlighting cultural and linguistic significance.
- The **powers, duties, functions, role, and composition** of the body are determined **in accordance with the Agreement**, not by this Act alone.
- The body acts as a central entity to:
  - Provide educational oversight
  - Support curriculum development
  - Coordinate resources and programs
  - Ensure compliance with the Agreement

---

#### **9. Regional Education Councils**
- Participating First Nations may, **jointly or individually**, establish a **Regional Education Council**.
- Purpose: To promote **coordination, collaboration, and shared best practices** in education across multiple reserves.
- The powers, duties, and structure of such councils are determined **by the participating First Nations** that establish them.
- Encourages regional cooperation and economies of scale in education delivery.

---

#### **10. Local Education Authorities**
- A participating First Nation may establish a **Local Education Authority (LEA)** to support its own education responsibilities.
- The LEA can assist in:
  - Implementing education policies
  - Making First Nation laws
  - Managing day-to-day operations
- The **powers, duties, and structure** of the LEA are defined **by the First Nation that establishes it**, in accordance with the Agreement.
- This allows flexibility in governance models while maintaining accountability and cultural relevance.

---

#### **11. Judicial Notice and Evidence of First Nation Laws**
- Once a First Nation law is **registered in the official registry** of laws maintained by the First Nation (as per the Agreement), it is **taken as judicially noticed**.
- In legal proceedings, **a certified copy** of the law (signed by an authorized person) is sufficient as evidence—**no proof of signature or official capacity is required**.
- This streamlines legal processes and ensures that First Nation laws are recognized and respected in courts.

> **Important Note**:  
> First Nation laws are **not considered statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.  
> This means they are not subject to the same review or approval processes as other government regulations, reinforcing their status as self-determined laws.

---

#### **12. Regulatory Powers of the Governor in Council**
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has the authority to:
  - Make **regulations or orders** necessary to implement the Act, the Agreement, or related agreements.
  - **Add** a First Nation to the Schedule (list of participating First Nations) if the Governor is satisfied that:
    - The First Nation has **ratified the Agreement** in a manner consistent with the Agreement.
    - The First Nation has a **valid constitution**.
  - **Amend or remove** a First Nation from the Schedule if consent has been obtained in a manner consistent with the Agreement.

> This power allows for flexibility and adaptation as new First Nations join or existing ones exit the framework.

---

#### **13. Effective Date**
- **All provisions of the Act (except Section 19)** come into force on **April 1, 2018**.
- Section 19 (which likely addresses transitional or administrative matters) may have a different effective date or be subject to further implementation.
