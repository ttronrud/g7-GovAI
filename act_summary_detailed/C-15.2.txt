The provided text appears to be the **prologue (or preamble)** of a Canadian federal act, specifically intended to establish a framework for environmental assessment, but **the actual legislative provisions (the "enacts as follows" section) are completely missing**—in fact, the entire body of the act is replaced by repeated references to repeal.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Context and Purpose (Whereas Clauses):**
The preamble outlines the foundational motivations behind the proposed legislation:

- **Sustainable Development**: The Government of Canada aims to achieve sustainable development by conserving and enhancing environmental quality while promoting economic development that does not compromise environmental values.
  
- **Role of Environmental Assessment (EA)**: Environmental assessment is recognized as a key tool to integrate environmental considerations into planning and decision-making processes. It ensures that environmental impacts are proactively evaluated and addressed.

- **Government Commitment**: The government is committed to:
  - Leading nationally and internationally in preventing environmental degradation.
  - Ensuring that economic development is compatible with Canadians’ high regard for environmental quality.
  - Facilitating **public participation** in environmental assessments.
  - Providing **access to information** used in environmental assessments so that the public can understand and engage with decisions.

These clauses reflect a strong policy orientation toward environmental protection, transparency, and public accountability.

#### 2. **Legal Enactment Clause:**
> "NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"

This is the standard legal structure used to begin a statute. It indicates that the act is being formally passed by Parliament.

#### 3. **Critical Issue: The Act Is Repealed**
Despite the preamble, the actual provisions of the act are **not present**. Instead, the section following "enacts as follows" consists of **300 identical lines** stating:

> [Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 66]

This means:
- The entire act (or its provisions) was **officially repealed** on **April 18, 2012**, under **Bill C-19**, the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012*.
- Section 66 of that bill specifically **repealed** the previous environmental assessment legislation (which was likely the *Environmental Assessment Act, 1990* or a similar predecessor).
- The repeal was part of a major reform to modernize Canada’s environmental assessment system.

#### 4. **What Happened to the Act?**
The act described in the preamble **was never enacted as a standalone statute** because:
- It was **repealed in 2012**.
- The modern framework for environmental assessment in Canada now operates under the **Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) 2012**, which replaced the old act and introduced significant improvements, including:
  - A more transparent and accessible process.
  - Enhanced public participation.
  - A focus on sustainability and climate change.
  - Streamlined decision-making with clearer thresholds for project review.

### Conclusion:

✅ **Summary in One Paragraph:**

The provided text is the **preamble to a proposed environmental assessment act**, expressing the Government of Canada’s commitment to sustainable development, environmental protection, public participation, and transparent decision-making. However, the actual legislative provisions are missing, and the entire act is **repealed**—specifically under **Section 66 of Bill C-19 (2012)**—meaning that this legislation was **never enacted**. Instead, it was replaced by the **Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) 2012**, which now governs environmental assessment in Canada. Therefore, the document reflects the **intent** behind modern environmental policy, but not a functioning, active law.

---

### Key Takeaway:
> This is **not a current or active law**. It is a **repealed draft or preamble** that illustrates the policy goals behind Canada’s environmental assessment reforms, which were fully implemented under the **CEAA 2012**.
