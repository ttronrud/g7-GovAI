**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Development Corporation Reorganization Act* (1985)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Development Corporation Reorganization Act* (often referred to as the **CDCA Reorganization Act**) was enacted on **December 20, 1985**, to restructure and re-establish the **Canada Development Corporation (CDC)** under a new legal framework. This Act replaced the original *Canada Development Corporation Act* and provided a comprehensive reorganization of the CDC’s corporate structure, governance, share issuance, ownership constraints, and regulatory oversight. The Act was designed to ensure transparency, prevent concentration of control, and maintain government oversight while enabling the CDC to function as a stable, publicly accountable development entity.

The Act came into force on **December 20, 1985**, and the **certificate of continuance** for the CDC was officially issued on **May 1, 1986**, as noted in the Canada Gazette. The Act was subsequently repealed in its entirety upon the issuance of the certificate of continuance, with its provisions being fully implemented through the new corporate structure.
