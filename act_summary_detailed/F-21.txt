**Detailed Summary of the Fisheries Development Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Fisheries Development Act* is a Canadian federal statute designed to promote the sustainable and efficient development of Canada’s fisheries sector. It empowers the federal government to support innovation, infrastructure improvement, and technological advancement in fishing and fishery product handling, while also enabling collaboration with provincial governments and private entities. The Act emphasizes economic efficiency, resource conservation, and the modernization of fishery operations through targeted investments and research.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Fishery Products**  
   Includes all fishery resources and any products derived from them (e.g., processed seafood, fishmeal, fish oil, frozen fish, etc.). This broad definition ensures that both raw and value-added outputs are covered under the Act’s scope.

2. **Fishery Resources**  
   Encompasses:
   - Fish
   - Molluscs (e.g., clams, oysters)
   - Crustaceans (e.g., shrimp, crabs)
   - Marine mammals (e.g., seals, whales)
   - Marine plants (e.g., seaweed, kelp)

   This comprehensive definition reflects the diversity of marine ecosystems and supports holistic management of marine resources.

3. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**, who is responsible for administering the Act and making decisions regarding projects and agreements.

### **Core Objectives and Authorities of the Minister**

The Minister has broad authority to undertake projects aimed at advancing Canada’s fisheries sector through the following key areas:

#### 1. **Efficient Exploitation and Exploration of Resources**
   - Promote more efficient use of existing fishery resources.
   - Explore and develop **new fishery resources** and **new fisheries** (e.g., deep-sea fishing, aquaculture, or underutilized species).

#### 2. **Introduction of Modern Fishing Technology**
   - Introduce and demonstrate to fishermen:
     - New types of **fishing vessels**
     - **Fishing equipment** (e.g., sonar, nets, traps)
     - **Fishing techniques** (e.g., selective gear, reduced-impact methods)

   This supports innovation, improves catch efficiency, and helps reduce environmental impact.

#### 3. **Development of Fishery Products and Processing Infrastructure**
   - Support the development of **new fishery products** (e.g., value-added seafood, functional foods).
   - Improve the **handling, processing, and distribution** of fishery products to enhance shelf life, quality, and market access.

---

### **Collaborative Project Agreements**

The Act allows for joint ventures between the federal government and other parties:

#### 1. **With Provinces**
   - The Minister may enter into an agreement with any province to **jointly undertake** a project authorized under subsection (1).
   - These collaborations can include shared funding, shared responsibilities, and shared benefits.

#### 2. **With Provincial Governments for Cost Contributions**
   - With **Governor in Council’s approval**, the Minister may enter into an agreement with a province for the **payment of contributions** to the province for the cost of a project undertaken by the provincial government or its agencies.
   - This mechanism allows provinces to share in federal investment while ensuring accountability and cost-sharing.

#### 3. **With Private Persons or Entities**
   - The Minister may enter into agreements with individuals or organizations to:
     - Jointly undertake a project (e.g., a new fishing vessel or processing plant), or
     - Receive **contributions** (payments) for the cost of projects carried out by private parties.

   This fosters private sector participation and innovation.

---

### **Economic Research and Studies**

To ensure that projects are economically viable and strategically sound, the Minister may:

- Conduct **economic studies** alone or in partnership with:
  - Provincial governments or agencies
  - Universities or educational institutions
- Coordinate such studies with similar research being conducted across Canada to avoid duplication and ensure national consistency.

This ensures that development initiatives are based on sound economic analysis and data-driven decision-making.

---

### **Utilization of Government Resources**

The Minister is required to **maximize the use of existing government services and facilities** when carrying out projects or studies. This promotes cost-effectiveness and interdepartmental efficiency by leveraging shared infrastructure (e.g., laboratories, data systems, logistics networks).

---

### **Funding and Financial Support (Payments by the Minister)**

With **Governor in Council’s approval**, the Minister may make payments for specific infrastructure and operational improvements, including:

| Type of Payment | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|
| **Construction and equipment of commercial cold storages** | For preserving fishery products (e.g., refrigerated storage for fish). |
| **Modification of existing cold storages or bait freezing facilities** | To improve suitability for preserving fishery products. |
| **Construction, modification, conversion, and equipment of fishing vessels** | To modernize fleets with better efficiency, safety, and sustainability. |
| **Construction and equipment of commercial ice-making and ice-storing facilities or fish-chilling facilities** | To improve productivity in commercial fishing operations. |

These payments are intended to reduce post-harvest losses, increase product quality, and boost overall productivity in the fishing industry.

---

### **Requirements for Agreements (Section 3(2), (3), and (4))**

All agreements involving financial contributions must clearly specify:

1. **Cost Sharing**
   - The **proportions of project costs** to be borne by the Minister and the province (or private party).
   - The **timing of payments** (when funds are due).

2. **Responsibility for Operation and Maintenance**
   - Who is responsible for managing, operating, and maintaining the project or its components.

3. **Revenue Sharing**
   - The **proportions of revenues** generated by the project that will be shared between the Minister and the province (or other parties).

4. **Operational Terms and Charges**
   - Conditions governing how the project operates.
   - Any **fees or charges** that may be levied on users who benefit from the project (e.g., fishermen or processors).

These provisions ensure transparency, accountability, and equitable distribution of benefits.

---

### **Establishment of Advisory Committees**

- The Minister may establish **advisory committees** as needed to provide expert input on fisheries development projects.
- Members are entitled to:
  - Be paid for attending meetings (amounts set by the Governor in Council).
  - Receive **reasonable travel and living expenses** when required to perform duties outside their ordinary residence.

This ensures expert oversight and stakeholder engagement in decision-making.

---

### **Parliamentary Oversight and Appropriation Requirement**

- **No agreement involving financial payments by the Minister has legal force until Parliament has appropriated funds** for the commitment.
- This requirement ensures that all expenditures are subject to **fiscal accountability and democratic approval**.
- It prevents the Minister from committing funds without parliamentary authorization.

---

### **Regulatory Authority (Governor in Council)**

The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make regulations to:

1. **Prescribe eligibility and limits** for payments under Section 5:
   - Who qualifies to receive payments.
   - Maximum amounts per payment.
   - Terms and conditions (e.g., eligibility criteria, reporting requirements).

2. **Mandate required elements in agreements** under Section 3(4):
   - Specify what information must be included in agreements (e.g., timelines, revenue splits, performance metrics).

3. **Address other matters** deemed necessary or desirable for implementing the Act effectively.

These regulations provide flexibility and practicality in administration while maintaining oversight and consistency.

---

### **Reporting Obligations**

- The Minister is required to submit a **comprehensive annual report to Parliament** detailing:
  - The operations of the Act during the fiscal year.
  - The performance and outcomes of projects and agreements established under the Act.

This ensures **transparency, accountability, and public scrutiny** of federal investments in fisheries development.

### **Key Principles and Impacts**

| Principle | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Sustainability & Efficiency** | Encourages smarter use of fishery resources and reduces overfishing. |
| **Innovation & Technology Adoption** | Drives modernization of fishing fleets and processing methods. |
