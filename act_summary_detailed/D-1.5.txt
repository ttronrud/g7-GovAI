## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Déline Final Self-Government Agreement Act**

### 📌 **Overview**
The *Déline Final Self-Government Agreement Act* is a federal statute enacted by Parliament of Canada to **ratify and give legal effect** to the **Déline Final Self-Government Agreement (Déline Agreement)** — a landmark self-government agreement between the **Déline First Nation Band**, the **Déline Land Corporation**, the **Government of Canada**, and the **Government of the Northwest Territories**.

This Act is grounded in the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights under the *Constitution Act, 1982*, and specifically implements the self-government provisions of the broader *Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement*.

## 🔑 Key Provisions and Their Significance

---

### 1. **Constitutional Basis: Treaty Status**
> *"The Déline Agreement is a treaty within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982."*

- The Déline Agreement is **recognized as a treaty** under Canadian constitutional law.
- This means it is **binding on the federal government**, and its rights and obligations are protected under the **principles of section 35** of the *Constitution Act, 1982*, which affirms Aboriginal and treaty rights.
- As such, it is **subject to constitutional protection** and cannot be unilaterally overridden without due process.

---

### 2. **Approval, Validity, and Legal Force**
> *"The Déline Agreement is approved, given effect and declared valid and has the force of law."*

- The Act formally **ratifies** the Déline Final Self-Government Agreement, which was **approved by the Déline First Nation Band** through a vote held on **March 10–12, 2014**.
- The agreement is now **legally binding and enforceable** across all levels of government and legal institutions in Canada.

---

### 3. **Binding Effect on All Parties and Persons**
> *"For greater certainty, a person or entity has the powers, rights, privileges and benefits conferred on the person or entity by the Déline Agreement and must perform the duties, and is subject to the liabilities, imposed on the person or entity by the Déline Agreement."*

- The agreement is **binding on all individuals, organizations, and institutions** involved or affected by it.
- This includes **non-parties** who may be subject to its provisions (e.g., through administrative or judicial processes).

---

### 4. **Precedence Over Federal Laws**
> *"Subject to section 6, the Déline Agreement prevails over this Act and any other federal law to the extent of any inconsistency between them."*  
> *"Subject to section 7, this Act prevails over any other federal law to the extent of any conflict between them."*

- The Déline Agreement **takes precedence** over any conflicting federal legislation.
- However, this **does not apply universally** — it is **subject to section 6**, which gives priority to the *Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act* and the *Sahtu Agreement* in cases of inconsistency.

> **Key Exception**:  
> *"The Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act and the Sahtu Agreement prevail over the Déline Agreement to the extent of any inconsistency between that Act and the Déline Agreement or between the Sahtu Agreement and the Déline Agreement."*  
> *(Same applies to the Sahtu Acts vs. this Act or Déline law.)*

- This ensures that **conflicts between the Sahtu Agreement and the Déline Agreement are resolved in favor of the Sahtu framework**, reflecting the broader land claim settlement and the principle of **non-overlapping jurisdiction** in treaty rights.

---

### 5. **Legal Status of the Déline Got’ine Government**
> *"The Déline Got’ine Government is a legal entity and has the capacity, rights, powers and privileges of a natural person."*

- The **Déline Got’ine Government** (a self-governing body established under Chapter 3 of the Déline Agreement) is recognized as a **fully independent legal entity**.
- It has the **same legal capacity** as a natural person (e.g., can enter contracts, own property, sue or be sued).
- This establishes **full autonomy** in governance, including decision-making authority over local affairs.

---

### 6. **Déline Law and Its Legal Force**
> *"Déline law that is made in accordance with the Déline Agreement has the force of law."*

- Any law created by the Déline Got’ine Government (called "Déline law") is **legally binding** and **equally valid** as federal or provincial legislation.
- Déline law is **not a statutory instrument** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*, meaning it does **not require prior approval or publication** in the same way as other government regulations.

> *Note:* Déline law is **registered in a public registry** (as per section 3.7 of the Déline Agreement), and **copies of registered laws are admissible as evidence** in court.

---

### 7. **Exemption from the Indian Act**
> *"Subject to 2.8 of the Déline Agreement, the Indian Act does not apply to the Déline Got’ine Government or to Déline First Nation Citizens as of the day on which section 4 comes into force."*

- The **Indian Act** (a federal law governing Indigenous peoples) is **exempted** from applying to:
  - The **Déline Got’ine Government**
  - **Déline First Nation Citizens**
- This is a **major step toward self-determination**, allowing the community to govern itself without federal oversight or restrictions under outdated legislation.
- The exemption is **conditional** on the terms of section 2.8 of the Déline Agreement.

---

### 8. **Tax Treatment Agreement**
> *"The Déline Tax Treatment Agreement is approved, given effect and declared valid and has the force of law during the period that it is in effect."*

- A separate **tax agreement** (not part of the main treaty) governs how income, property, and tax obligations are treated for the Déline community.
- This agreement is **valid and enforceable** during its term but is **explicitly excluded** from being:
  - A treaty under section 25 or 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*
  - A land claims agreement
- This distinction ensures that tax matters are treated separately from constitutional or land rights issues.

---

### 9. **Judicial Notice and Evidence**
> *"Judicial notice must be taken of the Déline Agreement and the Déline Tax Treatment Agreement."*  
> *"A copy of the agreement published by the Queen’s Printer is evidence of its contents."*

- Courts are **required to recognize** the Déline Agreement and Tax Treatment Agreement as **established facts** (judicial notice).
- Any **officially published copy** of the agreement (by the Queen’s Printer) is **presumed authentic** and **admissible as evidence** unless proven otherwise.

> Same applies to **Déline laws** registered in the public registry — they are **presumed valid and authentic**.

---

### 10. **Jurisdiction and Judicial Review**
> *"The Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for judicial review of the decisions of the Déline Got’ine Government or its institutions, except if an agreement made in accordance with 22.2.2 of the Déline Agreement provides otherwise."*

- The **Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories** has **exclusive jurisdiction** over judicial review of decisions made by the Déline Got’ine Government or its institutions.
- This prevents federal courts from interfering in local governance matters unless a **specific agreement** (e.g., under section 22.2.2) allows for alternative jurisdiction.

> *Note:* This ensures **local accountability** while respecting the **autonomy of the community**.

---

### 11. **Pre-Decision Notice Requirement (For Legal Interpretation)**
> *"If an issue arises in any judicial or administrative proceeding in respect of the interpretation, validity or applicability of the Déline Agreement, of this Act, of the Act of the legislature of the Northwest Territories that gives effect to the Déline Agreement or of any Déline law, then the issue must not be decided until the party raising the issue has served notice on the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of the Northwest Territories and the Déline Got’ine Government."*

- Before any legal challenge to the Déline Agreement or its implementation can proceed:
  - The party must **serve a formal notice** at least **14 days before the hearing**.
  - The notice must include:
    - Description of the proceeding
    - Subject matter of the issue
    - Date when the issue will be argued
    - Specific points to be argued
- This **ensures meaningful consultation** with all key stakeholders (federal, territorial, and community governments).
- The **Attorney General of Canada**, **Attorney General of the Northwest Territories**, and the **Déline Got’ine Government** have the right to **participate as parties** in such proceedings.

> *Note:* This provision is designed to **prevent unilateral legal challenges** and promote **collaborative governance**.
