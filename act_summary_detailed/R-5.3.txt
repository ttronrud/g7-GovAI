The provided text is a section of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, specifically the **Air Regulations Act (or a related enabling statute)**, enacted on **June 26, 1970**. This Act serves as a **legal continuity and retroactive validity mechanism** for certain air regulations and administrative actions that were previously issued under the authority of older regulations, now being consolidated or amended through Orders in Council.

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the key provisions and their legal significance:

---

### **1. Deemed Authorization of Air Regulations and Amendments**

> *"The Air Regulations and amendments thereto referred to in each Order in Council listed in Column I of the Schedule shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made or revoked, as the case may be, by the Minister of Transport with the approval of the Governor in Council on the date set out in Column II of the Schedule opposite the Order in Council whereby those Regulations or amendments were purportedly made, approved or revoked."*

#### **Summary:**
- This provision establishes **retroactive legal validity** for certain Air Regulations and amendments.
- Regulations or amendments that were previously issued via **Orders in Council** (a form of executive action requiring ministerial and cabinet approval) are **treated as if they were formally made or revoked** by the **Minister of Transport**, with the **approval of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet), on the **specific date** listed in the Schedule.
- The date specified in Column II of the Schedule is the **effective date** for the regulation or amendment under the new legal framework.

#### **Purpose:**
- To provide **legal certainty and consistency** by ensuring that prior Orders in Council are treated as having been made under the formal authority of the Minister of Transport and Cabinet.
- Avoids uncertainty about whether a regulation was validly issued under the proper statutory authority.
- Enables the use of these regulations in administrative, judicial, and enforcement contexts as if they were formally enacted under the Aeronautics Act.

### **2. Retroactive Validity of Pre-Act Orders, Directions, and Documents**

> *"Every order, direction and document purporting to have been made or issued before the coming into force of this Act under the authority of any regulation or amendment referred to in section 1 shall be deemed for all purposes to have had the same force and effect as if it had been made or issued, on the day on which it was purported to have been made or issued, under the authority of a regulation or amendment made by the Minister of Transport with the approval of the Governor in Council pursuant to section 4 of the Aeronautics Act."*

#### **Summary:**
- Any **pre-existing orders, directions, or documents** issued before the Act came into force — which were based on prior regulations or amendments — are **deemed valid and effective** as if they were issued under the **formal authority** of the Minister of Transport with Cabinet approval.
- The **effective date** of such pre-Act documents remains unchanged — they are treated as having been issued on the day they were originally issued.
- The legal basis for their validity is now **recharacterized** as being under the authority of a regulation made under **section 4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

#### **Purpose:**
- Ensures **continuity of administrative operations** in the aviation sector.
- Prevents the invalidation of past decisions or actions due to the coming into force of a new law.
- Maintains the **legal enforceability** of prior decisions, even if they were issued under a different or less formal authority.

### **3. Retroactive Validity of Pre-Act Actions and Acts**

> *"Every action and every act purporting to have been taken or performed before the coming into force of this Act under the authority of any regulation or amendment referred to in section 1 shall be deemed for all purposes to have had the same force and effect as if it had been taken or performed, on the day on which it was purported to have been taken or performed, under the authority of a regulation or amendment made by the Minister of Transport with the approval of the Governor in Council pursuant to section 4 of the Aeronautics Act."*

#### **Summary:**
- This provision extends the retroactive validity to **actions and acts** (such as enforcement actions, inspections, licensing decisions, or operational decisions) taken before the Act came into force.
- These actions are treated as having been taken under the **formal authority** of the Minister of Transport with Cabinet approval.
- The **timing and validity** of these actions are preserved as if they were authorized under the current legal framework.

#### **Purpose:**
- Provides **legal protection** to past administrative and operational decisions.
- Ensures that no administrative or enforcement action is rendered invalid simply because it was issued under a different regulatory framework or authority.
- Maintains **stability and predictability** in aviation governance.

### **4. Judicial Proceedings Before the Act Came Into Force**

> *"Any proceedings before a court of competent jurisdiction that were commenced before the 27th day of May, 1970, and that were not finally disposed of before that day, in which the validity of any regulation referred to in section 1 or of any order, direction, document, action or act referred to in section 2 is in issue or has been called into question, may be dealt with and disposed of in all respects as if this Act had not come into force, but no decision, order or judgment in any such proceedings shall operate or have effect so as to render invalid, otherwise than for the purposes of those proceedings, any regulation, order, direction, document, action or act that, by virtue of section 1 or 2, would otherwise be valid."*

#### **Summary:**
- This is a **critical judicial continuity clause**.
- If a **court case** was **started before May 27, 1970**, and **not concluded by that date**, and it raises a challenge to the **validity of a regulation or administrative action** referenced in sections 1 or 2, then:
  - The **proceeding may be handled as if the Act had not come into force**.
  - That is, the court can **apply the law as it existed before the Act**, without being bound by the new retroactive rules.
- However, **no court decision, order, or judgment** from such a proceeding can:
  - **Render invalid** any regulation, order, document, action, or act that would otherwise be valid under sections 1 or 2.
  - The **validity of those pre-Act actions is preserved** in law, even if challenged in court.

#### **Purpose:**
- Protects **existing legal rights and administrative decisions** from being undermined by judicial rulings that may be based on the new Act.
- Prevents **"retroactive invalidation"** of valid prior actions due to litigation.
- Ensures that **judicial decisions do not create legal uncertainty** about the validity of past regulatory or administrative acts.

### **Key Legal Principles Underlying the Act**

1. **Legal Continuity (Continuity of Law):**  
   The Act ensures that the **legal framework for aviation regulation remains stable** even when new legislation is introduced. It prevents a "regulatory gap" or "legal vacuum" by treating past actions as if they were made under the current authority.

2. **Retroactive Validity:**  
   Pre-existing regulations and actions are **not invalidated** just because a new law came into force. Instead, they are **recharacterized** as having been made under the proper statutory authority.

3. **Judicial Non-Precedent Effect:**  
   Courts are **not empowered** to strike down valid pre-Act actions, even if those actions are challenged. This protects the **integrity of administrative decisions**.

4. **Preservation of Administrative Authority:**  
   The Minister of Transport is given **deemed authority** to issue regulations, ensuring that the government can maintain control over aviation policy without needing to revalidate every past decision.

### **Effective Date and Context**

- **Act in force on assent: June 26, 1970**  
  This means the Act was approved by Parliament on that date, and its provisions came into effect on that day.

- **Reference to May 27, 1970**  
  This is a critical cutoff date for judicial proceedings — any case started before that date and not concluded by then is treated as if the Act had not been enacted.

- **Section 4 of the Aeronautics Act**  
  This section likely grants the Minister of Transport the power to make regulations with Cabinet approval. The Act ensures that all prior Orders in Council are treated as having been made under that authority.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Act is a **critical piece of regulatory continuity legislation** designed to:

- Legally validate **prior air regulations and administrative actions** issued under Orders in Council.
- Ensure **stability and predictability** in the aviation regulatory environment.
- Protect **existing rights and decisions** from being invalidated due to new legislation.
- Provide **judicial protection** for valid pre-Act actions, even in ongoing litigation.

It functions as a **"legal bridge"** between older, less formal regulatory mechanisms and a modern, more formalized system of aviation governance under the Aeronautics Act. Without such provisions, the introduction of new laws could have led to widespread invalidation of past decisions, causing operational disruption and legal uncertainty.

---

**In short:**  
This Act ensures that **all prior aviation regulations and administrative actions are treated as valid and lawful**, as if they were made under the formal authority of the Minister of Transport with Cabinet approval — even though they were originally issued under Orders in Council. It also protects
