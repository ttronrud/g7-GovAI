**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Commercial Bank Financial Assistance Act**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is formally titled the **Canadian Commercial Bank Financial Assistance Act** and may be cited accordingly. This title reflects its purpose: to provide financial support to the Canadian Commercial Bank (CCB), a historical institution in Canada’s financial sector.

---

### **2. Purpose and Basis of the Act**
The Act is enacted by **Her Majesty, on the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada**, indicating it is a federal statute passed through the standard legislative process. Its primary objective is to enable the Canadian government—specifically through the Minister of State (Finance)—to provide **financial assistance** to the Canadian Commercial Bank.

This assistance is grounded in a **Memorandum of Intent (MOI)** tabled in the House of Commons on **March 28, 1985**, and recorded as **sessional paper number 331-7/11**. The MOI outlines the general framework and key points of agreement between the government and the Canadian Commercial Bank, including areas of mutual interest and objectives for financial cooperation. While the MOI contains detailed points, this Act does not fully implement them; rather, it authorizes the government to act on those points of agreement and other matters that were agreed upon *in principle*.

### **3. Authority to Enter into Agreements**
The **Minister of State (Finance)** is granted broad authority to enter into **one or more agreements** with the Canadian Commercial Bank. These agreements are intended to:
- Provide financial assistance;
- Advance the goals outlined in the Memorandum of Intent;
- Address other matters that were discussed only in principle (i.e., not finalized in detail).

This power allows for flexibility in structuring support, enabling negotiations and adjustments based on evolving circumstances.

### **4. Specific Financial Activities Permitted**
The Minister may undertake the following financial actions, either directly or through related arrangements, in order to carry out the terms of any agreement under Section 2:

#### **(a) Acquisition, Holding, or Disposal of Participation Certificates**
- The Minister may acquire, hold, or dispose of **participation certificates** in a portfolio of assets belonging to the Canadian Commercial Bank.
- These certificates typically represent ownership interests in a group of loans and related securities (e.g., mortgage loans, commercial loans, or debt instruments).
- This allows the government to invest in or exit positions in the CCB’s loan and securities portfolio as needed.

#### **(b) Acquisition, Holding, or Disposal of Transferable Rights or Warrants**
- The Minister may buy, hold, or sell **transferable rights or warrants** to purchase common shares of the Canadian Commercial Bank.
- These instruments give the holder the right (but not obligation) to buy common shares at a specified price within a set time.
- This provides a mechanism for the government to gain exposure to equity in the CCB without immediately purchasing shares, potentially as a way to stabilize share prices or support future growth.

#### **(c) Acquisition, Holding, or Disposal of Bank Debentures**
- The Minister may acquire, hold, or dispose of **bank debentures** issued by the Canadian Commercial Bank.
- Debentures are long-term debt instruments issued by banks to raise capital.
- This allows the government to lend money to the CCB or manage its debt structure, depending on financial needs.

#### **(d) Entry into Additional Agreements or Arrangements**
- The Minister may enter into **any agreement or arrangement** that is:
  - Necessary or incidental to the activities in (a), (b), or (c); or
  - Required to comply with conditions specified in the Memorandum of Intent.
- This provision ensures that the government can take steps that are practical, legal, and aligned with the broader objectives of the financial support.

### **5. Appropriation of Funds**
To support the financial activities authorized under this Act, the government has **appropriated $75 million**.

- This amount is drawn from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, which is the primary source of federal government funding.
- The funds are to be **paid out over time** as required by the specific needs of the financial assistance program.
- The appropriation is explicitly designated for the purposes of **Section 2** of the Act, meaning it is not available for other uses.

---

### **6. Key Implications and Context**
- **Historical Context**: The Canadian Commercial Bank was established in the early 20th century and played a role in commercial banking and lending. By the 1980s, it may have faced financial difficulties or structural challenges, prompting government intervention.
- **Nature of the Support**: This Act represents a form of **government financial intervention**, not a full takeover. The government is not assuming ownership but rather using financial instruments to stabilize or support the bank.
- **Flexibility and Prudence**: The broad powers given to the Minister allow for responsive and adaptive financial management, while the requirement to comply with the Memorandum of Intent ensures alignment with agreed-upon goals.
- **Accountability**: The use of public funds ($75 million) and the requirement for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund ensure that the support is transparent and subject to parliamentary oversight.

### **Conclusion**
The **Canadian Commercial Bank Financial Assistance Act** is a targeted piece of legislation designed to provide the Canadian government with the legal authority and financial tools to support the Canadian Commercial Bank during a period of financial vulnerability or restructuring. Through the Minister of State (Finance), the government can engage in a range of financial transactions—including investments in loans, warrants, and debentures—while being bound by the framework of the 1985 Memorandum of Intent. The $75 million appropriation ensures that the necessary financial resources are available to implement these measures, all within a structure that maintains accountability and alignment with legislative intent.

This Act exemplifies how governments can intervene in financial institutions to ensure stability, promote economic resilience, and support national financial objectives—particularly in times of crisis or transition.
