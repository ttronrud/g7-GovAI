## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the CN Commercialization Act**

### 🔹 **Overview and Purpose**
The *CN Commercialization Act* (c. C-36) is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada to **transition the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) from a Crown corporation to a commercially operated, publicly accountable corporation** under the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)*. 

This Act facilitates the **commercialization of CN**, enabling it to operate as a fully autonomous, market-driven enterprise while maintaining certain public interests, such as national transportation infrastructure and equitable governance. It also establishes specific regulatory and structural safeguards to prevent concentration of control and ensure accountability.

The Act came into force in **1995** (Section 18 in force November 28, 1995), as part of broader reforms to modernize Canada’s rail sector and improve efficiency, competition, and transparency.
