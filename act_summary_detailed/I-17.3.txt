The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> **[Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 504]**

This indicates that **a specific section (section 504) of a statute or act, referenced in "c. 19" (Chapter 19), was repealed in 2012 by an amendment to the legislation (specifically, by the enactment of a new law, c. 19, section 504)**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
Each line is a **repeal notice**. The phrase "[Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 504]" means:
- The section **was officially removed or cancelled** from legal force.
- The repeal was enacted on **or around 2012**.
- The repeal was introduced through **Bill C.19**, which became law in 2012 (commonly referred to as the "2012 Act").
- The specific section being repealed is **section 504** of that chapter (Chapter 19).

#### 2. **What Was Repealed?**
While the exact content of the original section 504 of Chapter 19 is not provided in your input, the repetition of the same repeal notice suggests that:
- **Multiple provisions or subsections** may have previously been included in section 504.
- Or, it could be a **typographical or formatting error**, where a single section was mistakenly listed multiple times (as seen in 30+ repeated lines).

In practice, such repeated entries in legal databases or statutes often occur due to:
- Copy-paste errors.
- Misalignment in a document where multiple clauses or subsections were incorrectly attributed to the same repealed section.
- A system error in indexing or displaying legal texts.

#### 3. **Legal Significance**
- **Repeal means the law is no longer in effect.**
- Any legal obligations, rights, or procedures previously governed by section 504 of Chapter 19 are **no longer valid**.
- Any future references to that section in legal proceedings, regulations, or administrative decisions would be **invalid or obsolete**.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative update, such as modernizing outdated laws, correcting inconsistencies, or aligning with new policy priorities.

#### 4. **Contextual Background (Inferred)**
Chapter 19 of the Canadian Statutes (or a similar jurisdiction's statute book) is often a **general or administrative law chapter**. Section 504 may have previously dealt with:
- Regulatory procedures.
- Licensing or compliance.
- Enforcement powers.
- Reporting requirements.
- Definitions or classifications.

Without the original text of section 504, we cannot specify the exact nature of the repealed provision. However, the fact that it was repealed in 2012 suggests it was likely:
- Outdated.
- Inconsistent with new legislation.
- Replaced by a more current or comprehensive provision.

#### 5. **Jurisdictional Note**
The format "c. 19, s. 504" is standard in **Canadian legislative references**, where:
- "c." = Chapter
- "s." = Section
- The year (2012) indicates when the repeal took effect.

Thus, this summary applies to **Canadian law**, likely under the **Statutes of Canada** or a provincial statute (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, etc.).

### Conclusion:

> The repeated entries of "[Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 504]" indicate that **Section 504 of Chapter 19 of a Canadian statute was officially repealed in 2012**. This means the section is no longer legally enforceable. The repeal was enacted through a legislative amendment (Bill C.19), and the specific content of the repealed section is not available in the provided text. The repetition likely reflects a formatting or data-entry error, and the legal effect is that **any legal rights, duties, or regulations previously derived from that section are now void**.

### Recommendation:
To obtain a more accurate and detailed summary, it is necessary to:
- Retrieve the **original text of the section** before repeal.
- Identify the **name of the act** (e.g., *Certain Act*, *Public Health Act*, *Regulations Act*, etc.) that Chapter 19 belongs to.
- Consult the **official legislative database** (e.g., [CanLII](https://www.canlii.org), [ParlInfo](https://www.parl.ca), or provincial legislation sites).

Without that, the summary remains descriptive of the **repeal notice**, not the substance of the original law.
