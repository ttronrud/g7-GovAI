## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Anishinabek Nation Governance Agreement Act**

### 🔍 **1. Purpose and Context**
The Act is enacted to give legal effect to the **Anishinabek Nation Governance Agreement (AGREEMENT)**, a self-government agreement between the Government of Canada and the Anishinabek Nation — a collective of First Nations with shared cultural, linguistic, and historical ties, primarily in Ontario.

The Act is grounded in several core principles:
- **Reconciliation**: The Government of Canada’s commitment to nation-to-nation relationships based on **recognition of rights, respect, cooperation, and partnership**.
- **Inherent Rights**: Recognition of the **inherent right of self-government** of Indigenous peoples, affirmed under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**: The Agreement is viewed as contributing to the implementation of UNDRIP, reinforcing Indigenous sovereignty and rights.

This Act is not a treaty under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 — it is a **self-government agreement** that establishes a framework for Indigenous self-determination.

### 🏛️ **4. Powers of Self-Governance**

A First Nation or the Anishinabek Nation may, in accordance with its constitution and the Agreement, make laws on the following matters:

1. **Selection of government representatives**  
   → Authority to choose leaders and elected officials.

2. **Citizenship determination**  
   → Define who is an “E’Dbendaagzijig” (citizen), including rights, privileges, and responsibilities.

3. **Management and operation of government**  
   → Oversee administration, budgets, services, and governance structures.

4. **Preservation, promotion, and development of culture and language**  
   → Protect and advance Anishinabek language, traditions, ceremonies, and cultural practices.

5. **Any other matters covered by additional self-government agreements**

### ⚖️ **5. Transition from the Indian Act**

This section outlines how the *Indian Act* is modified or phased out for participating First Nations and the Anishinabek Nation.

| Indian Act Section | When it Ceases to Apply |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sections 8 to 14** | On the day a law made under **paragraph 6(b)** (e.g., citizenship, governance) comes into force. |
| **Sections 74 to 79** | On the day a law made under **paragraph 6(a)** (e.g., land, reserves, administration) comes into force. |
| **Section 80** | On the day **Section 4** of this Act comes into force. |

> These provisions allow for a **phased transition** from federal control to Indigenous self-governance.

#### 📌 Important Clarification:
- The definitions of **band**, **council of the band**, and **member of a band** in the *Indian Act* are **redefined** to align with the Agreement:
  - “Band” → First Nation
  - “Council of the band” → First Nation Government
  - “Member of a band” → Citizen (E’Dbendaagzijig)

> This ensures continuity and legal coherence during the transition.

#### 🚫 Cessation of the *First Nations Elections Act*:
- The *First Nations Elections Act* stops applying when a law under **paragraph 6(a)** comes into force.
- This removes federal control over election processes and allows First Nations to establish their own electoral systems.

### 📜 **6. Legal Recognition and Evidence of Laws**

- **Anishinabek laws** and regulations made under them are **not statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.
  → They do not require prior approval or notice under that Act.
- **Judicial notice** must be taken of:
  - The Agreement itself
  - An Anishinabek law registered in the official registry of a First Nation or the Anishinabek Nation
- A **copy of a law registered in the official registry** is **evidence of its existence and content**, unless proven otherwise.

> This ensures that Indigenous laws are **recognized and enforceable in court** without needing to be submitted as formal legislation.
