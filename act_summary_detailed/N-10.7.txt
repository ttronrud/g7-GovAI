### **Background and Justification (Whereas Clauses)**

The Act begins with a series of *whereas* clauses that establish the historical, cultural, and practical importance of the Canadian horse:

1. **Historical Introduction (1665)**  
   The Canadian horse was introduced to Canada in 1665 when the King of France sent horses from his own stables to the French settlers in New France. These horses were not merely imported animals—they were foundational to the survival and development of early colonial life.

2. **Role in Settlement and Survival**  
   Over the following century, the Canadian horse grew in number and became an essential asset to the settlers. Its strength, endurance, and adaptability enabled pioneers to traverse rugged terrain, plow fields, transport goods, and defend their communities—making it a vital tool in the success of early Canadian life.

3. **Cultural and Emotional Value**  
   Canadians across generations have expressed deep admiration for the Canadian horse. Its defining qualities—great strength, endurance, resilience, intelligence, and good temper—are seen as emblematic of Canadian character. These traits have made the breed not only a practical asset but also a symbol of national pride and perseverance.

4. **Threats to Survival**  
   The breed faced significant threats over time, including:
   - **Interbreeding** with other horse breeds, which diluted its genetic purity.
   - **Loss due to war**, particularly during conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars and later military engagements, which led to the decline of pure Canadian stock.
   Despite these dangers, the breed has survived through careful stewardship and conservation efforts.

5. **Conservation Efforts Since 1885**  
   Beginning in 1885 and continuing throughout the 20th century, dedicated efforts—by breeders, conservationists, government agencies, and the public—have been made to preserve and re-establish the Canadian horse. These efforts have been successful in maintaining the breed’s integrity and ensuring its survival as a distinct and valued part of Canada’s heritage.

6. **Government Recognition**  
   Given the historical significance and enduring cultural value of the Canadian horse, the Government of Canada has formally decided to recognize its unique place in Canadian history and identity.
