**Detailed Summary of the Canada Evidence Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Evidence Act* is a foundational statute that establishes the rules governing the admissibility, administration, and presentation of evidence in both **criminal and civil proceedings** within Canada. It applies to all matters within Parliament’s jurisdiction—covering all criminal trials, civil lawsuits, and other legal proceedings. The Act ensures fairness, protects individual rights, and provides clear procedural guidelines for witnesses, evidence, and judicial conduct.

While the Act has been substantially revised over time (notably with the repeal of certain sections in 2015), its core principles remain central to Canadian legal practice, particularly in the areas of **witness competency, privilege, cross-examination, oaths, and the admissibility of public records**.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Scope and Applicability**
> *"This Part applies to all criminal proceedings and to all civil proceedings and other matters whatever respecting which Parliament has jurisdiction."*

- The Act applies universally across all types of legal proceedings where federal jurisdiction exists.
- Covers both **criminal** and **civil** cases, including administrative and quasi-judicial matters.
- Ensures consistency in evidentiary standards regardless of the nature of the proceeding.

---

### **2. Competency of Witnesses: No Incompetency Due to Interest or Crime**

> *"A person is not incompetent to give evidence by reason of interest or crime."*

- A person cannot be barred from testifying simply because they have a personal interest in the outcome or because they are involved in a crime.
- This protects individuals from being silenced due to self-interest or criminal history.

---

### **3. Spouses as Competent Witnesses for the Defence**

> *"Every person charged with an offence, and, except as otherwise provided in this section, the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, is a competent witness for the defence..."*

- The spouse of an accused is **automatically a competent witness** for the defence.
- This rule applies whether the accused is charged alone or jointly.
- **No limitation** is placed on the spouse’s ability to testify in support of the defence.

> *"No person is incompetent, or uncompellable, to testify for the prosecution by reason only that they are married to the accused."*

- A spouse may be called by the prosecution to testify **without being barred** by marital status.
- This ensures that spouses are not excluded from giving evidence based solely on their relationship to the accused.

---

### **4. Marital Communication Privilege (Repealed in 2015)**

> *"No husband is compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife is compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage."*  
> [**Repealed – 2015, c. 13, s. 52**]

- This section previously protected marital communications from being compelled in court.
- **It has been repealed**, meaning that **spouses can now be compelled to disclose private communications** made during marriage if relevant to a proceeding.
- The repeal reflects modern legal standards and the move toward greater transparency in evidence.

> **Implication**: The old marital privilege is no longer a legal barrier. Courts may now order spouses to produce private conversations if necessary for a fair trial.

---

### **5. Prohibition on Commenting on a Witness’s Failure to Testify**

> *"The failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband of that person, to testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution."*

- Judges and prosecutors **cannot criticize or comment** on why an accused or their spouse did not testify.
- Prevents unfair prejudice and protects the right of individuals to remain silent or avoid testimony.

---

### **6. Protection from Self-Incrimination and Civil Liability**

> *"No witness shall be excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer to the question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person."*

- A witness **cannot be excused** from answering questions that might incriminate them or expose them to civil liability.
- This protects the right to testify, even if the answer could lead to criminal or civil consequences.

> *"If a witness objects on such grounds, the answer given shall not be used against the witness in any criminal proceeding thereafter."*

- **Exception**: If a witness objects and the court finds the objection valid, the **answer cannot be used against them in a future criminal trial**—except in a prosecution for **perjury** or **giving contradictory evidence**.

- This balances the right to self-protection with the need for truthful testimony.

---

### **7. Accessibility for People with Disabilities**

> *"If a witness has difficulty communicating by reason of a physical or mental disability, the court may order that the witness be permitted to give evidence by any means that enables the evidence to be intelligible."*

- Courts may allow **alternative methods of testimony** (e.g., sign language, written statements, video, audio, assistive technology) for witnesses with disabilities.
- Ensures **accessibility and fairness** in legal proceedings.

> *"The court may conduct an inquiry to determine if the means used are necessary and reliable."*

- Before adopting alternative methods, the court must assess whether the method is **necessary and reliable** to ensure the integrity of the evidence.

---

### **8. Identification of Accused**

> *"For greater certainty, a witness may give evidence as to the identity of an accused whom the witness is able to identify visually or in any other sensory manner."*

- A witness may testify to the **visual or sensory identification** of an accused person.
- This supports accurate identification in criminal cases.

---

### **9. Limitation on Expert Witnesses**

> *"Where it is intended to examine professional or other experts, not more than five such witnesses may be called on either side without the leave of the court or judge."*

- Prevents **excessive use of expert testimony**.
- Limits each side to **five expert witnesses** without court permission.
- Encourages judicial oversight and prevents abuse of expert evidence.

> **Exception**: The court may grant leave to exceed this limit if necessary for justice.

---

### **10. Comparison of Disputed Writings**

> *"Comparison of a disputed writing with any writing proved to the satisfaction of the court to be genuine shall be permitted... and such writings may be submitted as proof of genuineness."*

- Allows **comparison of documents** to determine authenticity.
- A document can be challenged by comparing it to a known genuine copy.
- This is a key tool in fraud, forgery, and document authenticity cases.

---

### **11. Impeachment of Witnesses (Bad Character and Contradictory Statements)**

> *"A party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character..."*

- **No general bad character evidence** (e.g., “he’s a liar”) can be used to undermine a witness’s credibility.
- However, if the witness is deemed **adverse** (i.e., likely to be lying), the party may:
  - Offer **contradictory evidence** of prior statements, or
  - Prove that the witness made a **prior inconsistent statement**.

> **Requirements for Contradictory Evidence**:
- The circumstances of the prior statement (date, place, content) must be **disclosed to the witness**.
- The witness must be **asked directly** whether they made the statement.
- Before any contradictory evidence is introduced, the witness must be given a chance to respond.

> **Cross-Examination of Prior Statements**:
- A party may cross-examine a witness about prior statements **without showing the writing or recording**.
- However, if the prior statement is to be used to **contradict** the witness, the witness must be **specifically informed** of the parts used.
- The judge may **require production** of the writing or recording at any time during trial.
- The judge may then **use the recording or document** as part of the trial.

> **Proof of Prior Statement**:
- If the witness denies making a prior statement, the party may prove it **only after disclosing the circumstances** and asking the witness.
- The witness must be given the opportunity to deny or confirm the statement.

---

### **12. Conviction Evidence**

> *"A party may prove a conviction by producing a certificate containing the substance and effect only of the indictment or summary conviction, purporting to be signed by the clerk of the court or officer in charge of records."*

- A conviction may be proven by:
  - A **certificate** summarizing the indictment or conviction (without formal legal language),
  - Signed by the **court clerk or record-keeper**,
  - Plus **proof of identity** (e.g., name, date, case number).

> **Applies to**:
- Indictable offences (trial-level),
- Summary convictions (provincial court level).

---

### **13. Administration of Oaths and Affirmations**

> *"Every court and judge has power to administer an oath to every witness legally called."*

- Witnesses must take an oath or make a solemn affirmation before giving evidence.

> **Solemn Affirmation (Alternative to Oath)**:
- A person may make a solemn affirmation instead of taking an oath.
- The affirmation has the **same legal effect** as an oath.
- The affirmation is: *"I, [name], do solemnly affirm..."*

> **Affirmation in Affidavits or Depositions**:
- A person who does not wish to take an oath may use
