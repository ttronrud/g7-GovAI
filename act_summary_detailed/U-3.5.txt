### **Detailed Summary of the *Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act***  

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
The *Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act* (UFPRBA) is a legislative measure designed to **foster and protect the use of French in federally regulated private businesses operating in Quebec or regions with a strong francophone presence**. It operates under the principle that **the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not limit Parliament’s authority to promote the equality of status and use of English and French**, especially given that French is a minority language in Canada and North America.

The Act recognizes the **diversity of provincial and territorial language policies**, including Quebec’s unique linguistic framework, and aims to ensure that **francophone consumers and employees in Quebec are not disadvantaged in accessing services or working conditions in French**—even when the business is privately owned and federally regulated.
