**Detailed Summary of the *National Research Council Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Research Council Act* establishes the **National Research Council of Canada (NRC)** as a key federal institution responsible for advancing scientific and industrial research in Canada. The Act grants the NRC broad autonomy and operational powers, enabling it to conduct research, manage property, enter into contracts, and oversee technological development—particularly in areas related to digital and information technology, public health, and industrial innovation—while operating under a framework of accountability to the Government of Canada and Parliament.

This Act is foundational in shaping the governance, mandate, and operational independence of Canada’s premier research body.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Name and Establishment of the Council**

- The Act establishes the **National Research Council of Canada (NRC)**.
- The Council consists of:
  - A **President** (chief executive officer),
  - A **Chairperson** (presiding officer),
  - Up to **10 additional members** (excluding the President and Chairperson).

> *Note: The term "company" was repealed in 1999 and is no longer relevant.*

---

### **2. Legal Status and Corporate Powers**

The NRC is recognized as a **corporation** with extensive powers to operate independently, including:

- **Acquisition, ownership, sale, or disposal** of real and personal property (movable and immovable).
- **Entering into contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding**, or other arrangements with:
  - Government departments, agencies, or boards;
  - Other governments or their entities;
  - Private persons or organizations.

> These powers are granted despite restrictions imposed by other federal statutes, notably the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**.

---

### **3. Exemptions from Financial Administration Act (FAA) Restrictions**

Despite the FAA, the NRC is **exempt from** certain financial limitations:

- **No financial criteria limitations** on contract procurement (e.g., dollar thresholds or cost-benefit rules) for goods and services.
- **No restrictions on liability or indemnification** in contracts entered into by the Council.

> This ensures the NRC can engage in large-scale, innovative procurement without being constrained by traditional public spending rules.

---

### **4. Procurement Authority and Scope**

- The NRC may procure goods and services **outside the federal public administration**, including:
  - Construction projects;
  - Research-related digital and information technology (IT);
  - Services supporting scientific and industrial research.

> This allows the NRC to access private-sector expertise and innovation, enhancing research outcomes.

- **Legal services** may only be procured from outside the federal public administration **with the prior approval of the Attorney General of Canada**.

---

### **5. Approval Requirements for Certain Transactions**

Under **paragraph 90(1)(a) or (b)** of the FAA (which governs certain financial activities), the NRC (and any corporation where it holds shares meeting specific thresholds) may engage in such activities **only with the approval of the Governor in Council**, and subject to any conditions imposed.

> *Eligibility threshold*: A corporation is considered under this provision if:
> - A majority of its directors or members are nominated or appointed by Her Majesty in right of Canada, or by persons nominated on her behalf; **or**
> - Her Majesty otherwise controls the corporation.

This ensures that significant financial decisions involving NRC-linked entities remain subject to high-level government oversight.
