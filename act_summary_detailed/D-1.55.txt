### **Detailed Summary of the Dental Benefit Act**

---

#### **Overview and Purpose**

The **Dental Benefit Act** is a temporary, targeted legislative measure introduced by the Government of Canada to address the significant issue of **unaffordable dental care for children**, particularly those under 12 years of age who lack access to dental services due to financial constraints.

This Act establishes a **temporary interim dental benefit program** designed to provide financial assistance to eligible families for the cost of essential dental care services for children. It is not a long-term solution but rather a **step toward developing a comprehensive national dental care program**. The Act recognizes that without access to affordable dental care, children suffer health consequences, and the broader healthcare system bears increased costs—such as performing dental surgeries in pediatric hospitals.

- Has received or will receive dental care during the period **October 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023**;
