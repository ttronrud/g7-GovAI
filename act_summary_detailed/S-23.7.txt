**Detailed Summary of the *Supplementary Fiscal Equalization Payments 1982–87 Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Supplementary Fiscal Equalization Payments 1982–87 Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It establishes specific supplementary payments to certain provinces to support their fiscal capacity, particularly during a period of economic and financial strain. The Act supplements the existing fiscal equalization payments provided under the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act, 1977* (commonly referred to as the "Fiscal Arrangements Act").

This legislation is part of a broader federal effort to ensure that provincial governments—especially those with lower tax bases or higher per capita expenditures—receive adequate financial support to maintain essential public services such as healthcare, education, and social programs.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Citation of the Act**
The Act is formally cited as:  
**"The Supplementary Fiscal Equalization Payments 1982–87 Act"**

This title reflects the time frame during which the supplementary payments are intended to be distributed, specifically from April 1, 1982, to March 31, 1987.

---

#### **2. Purpose and Scope of Supplementary Payments**
In addition to the regular fiscal equalization payments that provinces receive under the 1977 Act, the Minister of Finance is authorized to make **supplementary payments** to certain provinces. These payments are designed to address disparities in provincial fiscal capacity and to provide targeted financial assistance during a period of economic volatility or fiscal stress.

The payments are not general transfers but are specifically designated as "supplementary" and are tied to particular fiscal years.

#### **3. Distribution of Payments by Fiscal Year**

##### **Fiscal Year Commencing April 1, 1985**
The following amounts are to be paid to specific provinces:

- **Quebec**: $110 million  
- **Manitoba**: $50 million  
- **Nova Scotia**: $20 million  
- **New Brunswick**: $20 million  
- **Newfoundland**: $15 million  
- **Prince Edward Island**: $5 million  

These payments are made to provinces that are considered to have relatively smaller fiscal bases or higher costs of providing public services, and they reflect the federal government’s recognition of their need for additional financial support during that period.

##### **Fiscal Year Commencing April 1, 1986**
An additional payment is made to:

- **Manitoba**: $65 million  

This payment is targeted at Manitoba, likely due to ongoing economic challenges or increased public service demands during that time.

> Note: The 1986 payment is separate from the 1985 payments and is specifically tied to the fiscal year beginning in April 1986.

---

#### **4. Funding Source**
All payments authorized under this Act are to be drawn from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada. This is the primary fund used to finance federal government expenditures and ensures that the payments are funded through regular federal revenues, not through special or temporary appropriations.

---

#### **5. Timing of Payments**

- **For the 1985 fiscal year payments**: The full amount must be paid **within 30 days after the coming into force of this Act**.  
  This means the payments were to be disbursed promptly upon the Act receiving royal assent and coming into effect.

- **For the 1986 fiscal year payment**: The $65 million to Manitoba must be paid **within 30 days after the commencement of the fiscal year** (i.e., April 1, 1986).

This time frame ensures timely delivery of financial support to provinces, allowing them to plan and implement necessary public service initiatives without delays.

---

### **Key Features and Implications**

- **Targeted Support**: The payments are not distributed equally across all provinces. Instead, they reflect a prioritization of provinces facing greater fiscal challenges, such as Quebec (due to its large population and high public service costs), and Manitoba (which may have experienced economic downturns or high expenditures).

- **Temporary in Nature**: The Act covers a specific five-year period (1982–1987), indicating that these payments were intended as a temporary measure to stabilize provincial finances during a transitional or difficult economic period.

- **Fiscal Responsibility**: By drawing funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the payments are consistent with standard federal fiscal practices and do not require special budgetary measures or new revenue sources.

- **Policy Context**: The 1980s were a period of significant economic adjustment in Canada, including inflation, recession, and shifts in public spending. This Act reflects the federal government’s commitment to maintaining fiscal equity among provinces, especially in the face of regional economic disparities.

### **Conclusion**

The *Supplementary Fiscal Equalization Payments 1982–87 Act* provides a structured and targeted mechanism for the federal government to offer additional financial support to provinces experiencing fiscal constraints. By authorizing specific, time-bound payments to key provinces—particularly Quebec, Manitoba, and the Atlantic provinces—the Act aims to maintain equitable access to public services and support provincial governments in managing their budgets during a challenging economic era.

These payments represent a critical component of Canada’s federal-provincial fiscal framework, emphasizing both fiscal responsibility and equity in the distribution of financial resources across the country.
