**Detailed Summary of the *Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement Act* (2005) is a federal statute enacted by the Parliament of Canada to **ratify and give legal force to the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement**, a landmark treaty between the Inuit of Labrador and the Governments of Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador. This Act serves as the legislative instrument through which Canada formally recognizes and enforces the rights of the Inuit of Labrador under the *Constitution Act, 1982*, particularly in relation to land, self-governance, and economic development.

It is not merely a land claims agreement—it is a **treaty** with constitutional significance, affirming Indigenous rights and establishing a framework for meaningful self-determination for the Inuit of Labrador.
