**Detailed Summary of the *Human Pathogens and Toxins Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Human Pathogens and Toxins Act* (HPA) is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation enacted to establish a robust, science-based safety and security regime aimed at protecting the public's health and safety from the risks posed by **human pathogens** and **toxins**. The Act recognizes that biological threats—such as infectious agents and harmful substances—are dynamic, evolving, and capable of emerging unpredictably, necessitating proactive and flexible regulatory oversight.

The Act applies to all activities involving the **possession, handling, production, storage, transfer, import/export, release, or disposal** of human pathogens and toxins, and it mandates strict licensing, reporting, and compliance requirements to ensure public safety.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

### **1. Purpose of the Act**
> *“To establish a safety and security regime to protect the health and safety of the public against the risks posed by human pathogens and toxins.”*

This foundational objective underscores the Act’s primary mission: preventing harm to individuals and communities through rigorous control over dangerous biological materials.

### **2. Definitions (Crucial for Understanding Scope)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Human Pathogen** | A micro-organism, nucleic acid, or protein listed in Schedules 2–4 or in Part 2 of Schedule 5; or any unlisted agent that falls into Risk Group 2, 3, or 4. |
| **Toxin** | A substance listed in Schedule 1 or Part 1 of Schedule 5. |
| **Controlled Activity** | Any activity listed in subsection 7(1) — including possession, production, storage, transfer, import/export, release, or disposal. |
| **Risk Groups** | A classification system indicating the level of risk to human health and public health: |
| - **Risk Group 2** | Moderate individual risk, low public health risk. Serious disease possible, treatment available. |
| - **Risk Group 3** | High individual risk, low public health risk. Serious disease likely, treatment usually available. |
| - **Risk Group 4** | High individual and public health risk. Serious disease likely, treatment not usually available. |
| **Release** | Any discharge — leaking, dumping, spraying, vaporizing, etc. |
| **Possession** | As defined in the Criminal Code. |
| **Production** | Creating or altering a pathogen/toxin via manufacturing, cultivation, synthesis, refining, or chemical modification. |
| **Conveyance** | Any vehicle or transport method (aircraft, ship, train, truck, cargo container). |
| **Person** | An individual or organization under the *Criminal Code*. |
| **Personal Information** | As defined in the *Privacy Act*. |
| **Security Clearance** | A clearance issued under section 34. |

> **Note**: The Act includes **synthetic forms** of pathogens or toxins and substances containing them within its scope.

### **3. Exemptions (When the Act Does Not Apply)**

The Act **does not apply** to:

- Human pathogens or toxins that naturally occur in environments (e.g., in soil, water, or on a human body) **unless** they have been cultivated or intentionally collected.
- Pathogens/toxins present in or on:
  - A person suffering from a disease caused by the agent.
  - A person who has expelled such an agent.
  - A cadaver, body part, or human remains.
- Drugs in approved dosage forms (regulated under the *Food and Drugs Act*) that contain pathogens or toxins.

> These exemptions acknowledge that natural exposure and medical use are not inherently dangerous and do not require the same level of control.

---

### **4. Licensing Requirements (Section 8)**

**No person may conduct any controlled activity involving a human pathogen or toxin unless authorized by a licence issued by the Minister of Health.**

#### Activities Requiring a Licence:
- Possessing, handling, or using
- Producing
- Storing
- Permitting access to
- Transferring
- Importing or exporting
- Releasing or abandoning
- Disposing of

#### Exceptions:
- Activities governed by the *Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992*.
- Authorized exports under the *Export and Import Permits Act*.

> This ensures that only authorized, vetted, and safe operations involving dangerous biological materials are permitted.

---

### **5. Regulatory Powers of the Minister and Governor in Council**

#### **(a) Adding Substances to Schedules**
- The **Minister** may, by regulation, add a substance to:
  - **Schedule 1 (Toxins)** if it is produced by or derived from a micro-organism and can cause disease.
  - **Schedules 2–4 (Pathogens)** based on Risk Group classification (2, 3, or 4).
- The **Governor in Council** (on Minister’s recommendation) may:
  - Add a substance to **Part 1 of Schedule 5** (prohibited substances) if:
    - It is derived from a micro-organism and can cause disease, **and**
    - All activities under section 7 should be **prohibited**.
  - Add a micro-organism/protein to **Part 2 of Schedule 5** if:
    - It can cause disease, **and**
    - All activities should be prohibited.
  - Delete a substance from Schedules 1–4 if it is no longer considered dangerous or if it is in the public interest to allow certain activities.

#### **(b) Removing Substances from Schedules**
- The Governor in Council may **delete** a substance from Schedule 5 if it is in the public interest to **authorize** certain activities.

> These powers allow the government to respond dynamically to scientific developments, emerging threats, or changes in risk assessment.

---

### **6. Consultation and Transparency**

- Before making any regulation or recommendation, the **Minister must consult** an **advisory committee** established under the *Public Health Agency of Canada Act*.
- The advisory committee must **make its advice publicly available**.

> This ensures scientific rigor, transparency, and public accountability in decisions about pathogen/toxin classification and regulation.

---

### **7. Transition and Disposal Obligations (Section 9 & 10)**

#### **After a Regulation is Published:**
- **Within 30 days**, any person who no longer has lawful possession of a pathogen/toxin must:
  - Dispose of it per regulations,
  - Transfer it to a facility where controlled activities are authorized, or
  - Obtain a new licence or variation of existing conditions.

- **Within 14 days**, for substances added to Part 1 of Schedule 5 (prohibited), the same disposal or transfer requirement applies.

> This ensures that no dangerous material remains uncontrolled after regulatory changes.

#### **No Contravention**:
- A person does **not violate the Act** simply for possessing a pathogen/toxin under these circumstances **if they comply** with the disposal or transfer requirement.
