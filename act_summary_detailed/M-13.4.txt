**Detailed Summary of the Museums Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Museums Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to establish, define, and empower key national museums in Canada. The Act provides a legal framework for the creation, governance, operations, and mission of six major national museums, each with distinct but complementary purposes related to preserving and promoting Canada’s cultural, historical, scientific, and human rights heritage.

The Act is structured to ensure that these institutions operate as independent, self-sustaining corporations with the capacity and rights of a natural person—allowing them to manage collections, conduct research, engage the public, and collaborate with other organizations—while remaining accountable to public interest and Canadian values.
