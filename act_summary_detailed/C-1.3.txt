### 🏠 4. **Residency Rules (Determining Tax Liability)**

Residency is central to determining where income is taxable. The Convention provides a **multi-tiered hierarchy** to determine residency:

#### For **Individuals**:
1. **Permanent Home**:
   - If the individual has a permanent home in **one State**, they are deemed a resident **only** of that State.
   - If they have a permanent home in **both**, residency is determined by **centre of vital interests** (where personal and economic ties are strongest).
2. **If centre of vital interests cannot be determined**:
   - Residency falls to the State where the individual has an **habitual abode**.
3. **If no habitual abode**:
   - Residency is assigned to the State of the individual’s **nationality**.
4. **If national of both or neither**:
   - The **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

#### For **Non-Individual Entities (e.g., companies, partnerships)**:
- If a person is a resident of both countries:
  - The competent authorities must resolve residency by **mutual agreement**, considering:
    - Place of effective management
    - Place of incorporation
    - Other relevant factors
- **In the absence of agreement**, such a person is **not considered a resident of either country** for Articles 6 to 22 (profit taxation).

> 💡 *This prevents double taxation by clearly defining residency based on economic and personal ties, not just legal residence.*

### 🏢 5. **Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise conducts business. It triggers tax liability in the host country.

#### Included in PE:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or any natural resource extraction site

#### Exceptions (Not a PE):
- Use of facilities **solely** for:
  - Storage, display, or delivery of goods
  - Maintenance of stock for storage/display/delivery
  - Stock for processing by another enterprise
  - Purchasing goods or collecting information
  - Preparatory or auxiliary activities
- A combination of such activities is only a PE if the **overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**.

> ⚠️ *Important: A PE is only created if the activity is central to the business operations, not incidental.*

#### Special Rule for Agents:
- If an individual acts **on behalf of an enterprise** and has **authority to conclude contracts** in a Contracting State, the enterprise is deemed to have a PE **unless** the activities are limited to those listed above (i.e., auxiliary functions).

#### Insurance Exception:
- An **insurance enterprise** of a Contracting State is deemed to have a PE in the other State **if it collects premiums or insures risks** in that State through:
  - A broker, general commission agent, or
  - An independent agent with authority to conclude contracts.

> 🚫 *Note: A company controlling or being controlled by another does NOT automatically create a PE.*

### 💰 6. **Taxation of Profits from Business Activities**

#### General Rule:
- Profits of an enterprise are **taxable only in the State where the enterprise is resident**.
- **Exception**: If the enterprise carries on business in the other State via a **permanent establishment**, then **profits attributable to that PE** may be taxed in the other State.

#### Determining Profits Attributable to a PE:
- The profits are calculated as if the PE were a **separate, independent enterprise** engaged in the same or similar activities under the same conditions.
- This method is known as the **"arm’s length" or "separate enterprise" principle**.
- **Deductible expenses** (including administrative and executive costs) are allowed for the PE.

#### If Data Is Inadequate:
- In the absence of proper accounting data, the tax may be assessed in the other State **in accordance with domestic laws**, based on **normal profits of similar enterprises**.

#### Exclusion:
- **No profits** are attributed to a PE **just because it purchases goods** for the enterprise.

#### Annual Determination:
- Profits are determined **year by year** using the same method, unless there is **good and sufficient reason** to vary it.

> ✅ *This ensures consistency and fairness in profit allocation.*

#### Exceptions for Separate Income:
- If income items are separately taxed under other Articles (e.g., dividends, royalties), those Articles **do not interfere** with the profit attribution rules.
