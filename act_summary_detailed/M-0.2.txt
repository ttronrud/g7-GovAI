## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act**

### 📌 **Overview and Purpose**
The *Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act* (MV-RMA) is a federal statute enacted to establish a system of **cooperative, Indigenous-led, and environmentally sound land and water management** in the Mackenzie Valley of the Northwest Territories. It is rooted in the **land claim agreements** of Indigenous peoples in the region — specifically the Gwich’in, Sahtu, and Tlicho First Nations — and aims to ensure that Indigenous communities have meaningful roles in managing their traditional territories.

The Act establishes **multiple governance bodies** (boards) responsible for regulating land and water use, including waste disposal, in both settlement areas and broader regions of the Mackenzie Valley. These boards operate as **institutions of public government** within an **integrated and coordinated system of resource management**, reflecting a commitment to **Indigenous self-determination**, environmental protection, and sustainable development.
