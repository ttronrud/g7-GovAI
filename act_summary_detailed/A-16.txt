## ✅ Summary in Plain Language

This document was the **former *Nuclear Energy Act***, which gave the federal government broad powers to:
- Conduct nuclear research;
- Acquire land, nuclear materials, and patents;

- Collect royalties from innovations.

However, it included **strong protections for Indigenous land rights**, especially in Yukon, requiring:
- Public hearings;

- Consultation with First Nations (Gwich’in and Yukon First Nations).

It also established:
- Crown ownership of the company;

But in **1997**, the Act was **fully repealed**
