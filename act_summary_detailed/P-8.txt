**Detailed Summary of the *Pension Fund Societies Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Pension Fund Societies Act* is a Canadian legislative framework that enables corporations—particularly those engaged in business under federal statutes—to establish **pension fund societies** for the purpose of providing retirement benefits, pensions, and survivor benefits to their officers, employees, and their dependents. The Act grants these societies corporate status, establishes governance structures, and sets out rules for administration, funding, and accountability.

It is designed to promote the long-term financial security of key personnel within corporate organizations by creating a structured, legally recognized mechanism for pension provision, while ensuring oversight and transparency.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Parent Corporation**  
   - Refers to a corporation whose officers (e.g., directors, executives) initiate or pursue the establishment of a pension fund society under this Act.  
   - This is the primary employer or corporate entity that forms the foundation of the pension society.

2. **Relative**  
   - Includes relatives of the surviving officer or employee.  
   - This definition extends benefits beyond just spouses to include family members, which may include children, parents, or siblings of the deceased.

3. **Survivor**  
   - Defined as either:
     - The spouse of the deceased officer or employee, or  
     - A person who was cohabiting with the officer or employee in a conjugal relationship for at least one year immediately before death.  
   - This ensures that individuals in common-law relationships are protected under the Act.
