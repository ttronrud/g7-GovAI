**Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Citation of the Act**  
   The Act is officially cited as the *Fruit and Vegetable Customs Orders Validation Act*. This title reflects its purpose: to validate specific customs orders concerning the importation of fresh fruits and vegetables.

2. **Validation of Prior Customs Orders (1972–1985)**  
   - **Scope:** The Act declares that all customs orders made under **paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Customs Tariff**—specifically those related to imported fresh fruits and vegetables—are **validly made**, despite any legal or procedural challenges that may have existed.  
   - **Timeframe:** These orders were issued between **January 1, 1972, and January 10, 1985**.  
   - **Legal Effect:** This provision overrules any potential invalidity claims under other statutes or legal principles. It affirms that these orders were lawful and properly authorized under the Customs Tariff.

3. **Validation of Customs Duties Collected**  
   - Any customs duties that were **collected** on imported fresh fruits and vegetables as a result of these valid orders are also declared to have been **validly collected**.  
   - This provides legal certainty to importers, customs officials, and financial institutions by confirming that the duty assessments and collections during this period were legally sound and enforceable.

4. **Remission of Uncollected Duties (June 28, 1984 – January 10, 1985)**  
   - A specific and targeted provision addresses a gap: duties that were **imposed** under the same paragraph (15(1)(a)) of the Customs Tariff between **June 28, 1984, and January 10, 1985**, but were **not collected** (i.e., not paid by importers), are hereby **remitted** (cancelled or forgiven).  
   - This provision effectively provides a financial relief or correction for importers who were legally required to pay duties but were unable or unwilling to do so during that short window.  
   - The remission is not a general reduction in duties but a specific, time-bound action to correct a failure in collection due to administrative or economic circumstances.

**Purpose and Significance:**

- **Legal Certainty:** The Act resolves potential legal disputes by affirming the validity of past customs orders, providing clarity for stakeholders (importers, exporters, customs authorities) regarding the legality of duty assessments and collections.
  
- **Administrative Correction:** By remitting uncollected duties during a narrow period (June 28, 1984 – January 10, 1985), the Act acknowledges administrative shortcomings or economic pressures that may have prevented payment, and offers a corrective measure without undermining the overall integrity of the tariff system.

- **Historical Context:** The period covered (1972–1985) reflects a time when Canada was actively managing the importation of fresh produce, possibly in response to supply chain developments, trade negotiations, or economic shifts. The Act may have been prompted by legal challenges or judicial scrutiny of the validity of those tariff provisions.

**Key Legal Principles Applied:**

- **Non-Contradiction Clause:** "Notwithstanding any other Act" indicates that this Act overrides conflicting provisions in other legislation, ensuring that the validation and remission are not subject to the constraints of other laws.

- **Statutory Interpretation:** The Act interprets the meaning and validity of paragraph 15(1)(a) of the *Customs Tariff* in a way that supports administrative consistency and fairness.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Fruit and Vegetable Customs Orders Validation Act* serves as a targeted legislative intervention to validate and correct customs practices related to imported fresh fruits and vegetables from 1972 to 1985. It affirms the legality of past duty orders and collections while providing a meaningful financial relief—remitting uncollected duties during a specific, transitional period. This Act enhances legal certainty in trade operations and demonstrates Canada’s commitment to fair and consistent customs administration, particularly in the agricultural sector.
