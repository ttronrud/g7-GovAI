### **Detailed Summary of the *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act* (UNDRIP Act)**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Context**

The *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act* (commonly referred to as the **UNDRIP Act**) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted in 2019. It formally affirms the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** as a binding framework for Canadian law and policy. The Act is rooted in a long-standing commitment by the Government of Canada to address historical injustices, advance reconciliation, and uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples — First Nations, Inuit, and Métis — in accordance with international human rights standards.

This Act is not merely symbolic; it represents a **legal and institutional commitment** to implement the principles of UNDRIP in Canada through concrete, measurable, and accountable actions.

#### **2. Key Background and Motivations**

The Act is grounded in several key international and national commitments:

- **UNDRIP (2007)**: Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on September 13, 2007, UNDRIP sets out a comprehensive framework of rights for Indigenous peoples worldwide. It affirms their **self-determination, cultural integrity, land rights, and freedom from discrimination**.
  
- **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action (2015)**: The TRC, in its final report, called on all levels of government to fully adopt and implement UNDRIP as the framework for reconciliation. This Act directly responds to that call.

- **National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG)**: The Inquiry’s *Calls for Justice* emphasize the need to implement UNDRIP to combat systemic racism, violence, and discrimination against Indigenous women, girls, youth, and elders.

- **Historical Injustices**: The Act acknowledges that Indigenous peoples have suffered centuries of colonization, dispossession of land and resources, forced assimilation, and systemic racism — all of which continue to impact their lives today.

- **Rejection of Colonial Doctrines**: The Act explicitly rejects racist and colonial ideologies such as *terra nullius* (the idea that lands were "empty" before European arrival) and doctrines of discovery, which falsely claim Indigenous peoples had no rights to their lands.

#### **3. Core Principles and Values**

The Act is built upon several foundational principles:

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Self-Determination** | Indigenous peoples have the right to freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. This includes the right to **autonomy or self-government** in internal affairs. |
| **Inherent Rights** | Indigenous rights derive from their cultures, histories, legal systems, and relationships with land — not from laws imposed by the state. These are **collective rights** essential to their survival and well-being. |
| **Non-Discrimination** | Indigenous peoples are entitled to equal treatment under the law and must not face discrimination based on Indigenous identity, origin, culture, language, gender, disability, or other characteristics. |
| **Justice and Good Faith** | All relations between the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples must be based on **mutual respect, justice, democracy, and good faith**. |
| **Cultural Integrity** | Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, revitalize, and transmit their languages, traditions, spiritual practices, oral histories, and knowledge systems. |
| **Land and Resource Rights** | Indigenous peoples have the right to their lands, territories, and resources, and no forced removal or displacement may occur without **free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)**. |

##### **A. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Declaration**: Refers to the full text of UNDRIP as adopted by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 61/295.

> *Note: A provision was repealed in 2024 (s. 35), but the core definitions remain in force.*

---

##### **B. Purpose of the Act**
The primary purposes are:
1. To **affirm UNDRIP as a universal human rights instrument with application in Canadian law**.
2. To **establish a clear, actionable framework** for the Government of Canada to implement the Declaration.

---

##### **C. Legal and Policy Obligations**

- **Consistency with Canadian Law**: The Government of Canada must take all necessary **legislative, policy, and administrative measures** to ensure that Canadian laws are consistent with UNDRIP — especially in areas involving Indigenous rights, land, education, health, and justice.

- **Action Plan Requirement**:
  - The Minister (designated under section 3) must prepare and implement a **comprehensive action plan** to achieve the objectives of UNDRIP.
  - The plan must include:
    - Measures to **combat racism, violence, and discrimination** (including systemic racism) against Indigenous peoples, youth, women, elders, persons with disabilities, and gender-diverse/two-spirit individuals.
    - Measures to **promote mutual respect, understanding, and good relations**, including through **human rights education**.
    - **Monitoring, oversight, recourse, remedy, and accountability mechanisms** for implementation.
    - A **review and amendment process** to ensure the plan evolves over time.

- **Timeline for Action Plan**:
  - Must be completed **within two years** of the Act coming into force (i.e., by 2021).
  - Must be **tabled in both Houses of Parliament** and made **public** as soon as possible after completion.

- **Annual Reporting**:
  - The Minister must prepare a **fiscal year report** within **90 days** after each fiscal year ends.
  - Reports must be:
    - Tabled in Parliament on one of the first 15 days of sitting in each House.
    - Made publicly available.
    - **Permanently referred** to the relevant parliamentary committee responsible for Indigenous issues.

> This creates a **transparent, accountable, and participatory process** where Indigenous voices and oversight are central.

---

##### **D. Recognition of Constitutional Foundations**

- The Act affirms that **section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982** recognizes and affirms Aboriginal and treaty rights — including the right to self-government.
- These rights are **not frozen**; they are **living and evolving**, capable of growth and adaptation in response to changing circumstances.
- The Act recognizes that **treaties, agreements, and constructive arrangements** between the Crown and Indigenous peoples are **integral to the implementation of UNDRIP** and should be respected and honored.

---

##### **E. Affirmation of UNDRIP as a Source of Interpretation**

- UNDRIP is affirmed as a **source for interpreting Canadian law**.
- This means that when courts interpret laws affecting Indigenous peoples — such as land use, education, or policing — they must consider the principles of UNDRIP, especially in cases involving Indigenous rights and self-determination.

> This is a significant legal shift: it elevates UNDRIP from a moral or policy document to a **legal interpretive tool**.

---

##### **F. Commitment to Diversity and Cultural Specificity**

- The Act acknowledges that Indigenous peoples are **diverse** in identity, language, culture, governance, and relationship to land.
- It emphasizes that implementation must respect this diversity and avoid **one-size-fits-all approaches**.
- It calls for **consultation and cooperation** with Indigenous governments and communities in all aspects of implementation.
