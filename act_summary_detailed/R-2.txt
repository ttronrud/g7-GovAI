### **Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Citation**
The **Radiocommunication Act** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation governing the regulation, licensing, and management of all forms of **radiocommunication** — that is, the transmission, reception, or emission of signals via electromagnetic waves (including radio, microwave, and other frequencies below 3,000 GHz) without artificial guidance.

This Act may be cited as the **Radiocommunication Act** and serves as the primary legal framework for regulating the use of the radio spectrum in Canada, ensuring efficient, safe, and equitable access to radio frequencies for public, commercial, and governmental purposes.

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The Act establishes precise definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |

| **Broadcasting Certificate** | A certificate issued by the Minister to entities operating broadcasting undertakings. |
| **Broadcasting Undertaking** | Includes distribution, programming, and network operations under the *Broadcasting Act*. |
| **Distribution Undertaking** | As defined in the *Broadcasting Act*; involved in distributing content to the public. |
| **Encrypted** | Signals treated electronically to prevent intelligible reception (e.g., subscription TV). |
| **Harmful Interference** | Any adverse effect that endangers safety-critical systems or significantly degrades or interrupts radio use. |
| **Interference-Causing Equipment** | Non-radio devices capable of causing interference to radiocommunication. |
| **Jammer** | Devices that emit electromagnetic energy to block or obstruct radiocommunication — *except* those with established standards or authorizations. |
| **Lawful Distributor** | A person authorized to transmit and decode encrypted programming signals. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Industry, who administers the Act. |
| **Network** | As defined in the *Broadcasting Act*; a system linking affiliates or retransmitters. |
| **Network Feed** | Transmission from a network to affiliates or programming undertakings. |
| **Radio Apparatus** | Any device intended or capable of being used for radiocommunication (e.g., radios, phones). |
| **Radio Authorization** | Broad term covering licenses, certificates, or authorizations issued by the Minister. |
| **Radio Licence** | Specific license for radio apparatus use. |
| **Radio Operator Certificate** | Certificate for individuals operating radio equipment. |
| **Radio-Sensitive Equipment** | Devices whose function can be impaired by radiocommunication emissions (e.g., medical devices). |
| **Radio Station/Station** | A physical location housing radio apparatus. |
| **Spectrum Licence** | License for use of specific radio frequencies in a defined area. |
| **Subscription Programming Signal** | Content intended for public reception via subscription (e.g., cable, satellite TV). |
| **Technical Acceptance Certificate** | Certificate confirming compliance of equipment with technical standards. |

> Note: Some older terms (e.g., *telecommunication*, *operator*) have been repealed.

#### **3. Scope of Application**
The Act applies:
- **Within Canada**, and
- On **any ship, vessel, or aircraft** registered or owned by the federal government or a province,
- On **any spacecraft** under Canadian control,
- On **any platform, rig, or structure** affixed to land in Canada’s **continental shelf**.

It also applies to **citizens, residents, and corporations** incorporated or resident in Canada.

> This ensures comprehensive regulatory coverage across all mobile and land-based platforms.

#### **4. Powers and Responsibilities of the Minister**
The **Minister of Industry** holds broad powers to administer the Act, including:

##### **(a) Issuance of Authorizations**
The Minister may issue various types of authorizations:
- **Radio Licences** – for radio apparatus use.
- **Spectrum Licences** – for use of specific frequencies in defined areas.
- **Broadcasting Certificates** – for broadcasting undertakings.
- **Radio Operator Certificates** – for individuals operating radio equipment.
- **Technical Acceptance Certificates** – for equipment compliance with technical standards.
- **Any other authorization** deemed appropriate.

Each authorization may include **specific terms and conditions**, such as:
- Services permitted (e.g., FM radio, satellite links),
- Geographic coverage,
- Operational requirements,
- Compliance obligations.

##### **(b) Technical Standards and Requirements**
The Minister may:
- Establish **technical standards** for:
  - Radio apparatus,
  - Interference-causing equipment,
  - Radio-sensitive equipment.
- Plan **spectrum allocation and use**.
- Approve **site locations** for radio apparatus and antenna structures.
- Test equipment for compliance with standards.
- Require disclosure of:
  - Current and proposed use of radio apparatus,
  - Installation and maintenance costs.

##### **(c) Enforcement Powers**
- **Determine harmful interference** and issue orders to stop or modify operations of offending equipment.
- **Appoint inspectors** to monitor compliance.
- **Take international action** to protect Canada’s radiocommunication interests and consult the **CRTC** (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission) when appropriate.
- **Undertake research** into radiocommunication technologies.

##### **(d) Competitive Bidding for Licenses**
- The Minister may use **competitive bidding** to select licensees for radio authorizations.
- In such cases, **bidding amounts are paid directly to Her Majesty** and replace standard fees.
- The Minister may set detailed **bidding procedures**, including:
  - Minimum bids,
  - Qualifications of bidders,
  - Application fees,
  - Deposit and withdrawal rules,
  - Payment schedules.

> This promotes transparency, fairness, and efficiency in spectrum allocation.

##### **(e) Suspension or Revocation of Licenses**
- A license may be **suspended or revoked**:
  - With **consent of the holder**,
  - After **written notice and opportunity to respond**, if the holder:
    - Contravenes the Act, regulations, or terms of license,
    - Obtained the license through **misrepresentation**,
  - Without notice or hearing, if the holder **fails to pay fees or interest** due.

> This provides both due process and enforcement mechanisms.

#### **5. Prohibitions and Restrictions**
Several key prohibitions are established:

##### **(a) No Unauthorized Use of Radio Apparatus**
No person may install, operate, or possess **radio apparatus** unless:
- It has a **radio authorization**, or
- It is **exempted by regulation**, or
- It is **only for reception** (not transmission) and not operated by a distribution undertaking.

##### **(b) No Sale or Distribution of Equipment Without Certification**
No person may **manufacture, import, distribute, lease, offer for sale, or sell**:
- Radio apparatus,
- Interference-causing equipment,
- Radio-sensitive equipment  
**unless** such equipment has a **technical acceptance certificate**.
