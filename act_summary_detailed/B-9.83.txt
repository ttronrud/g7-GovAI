Below is a **detailed and accurate summary** of the information contained in the excerpt, based on the structure, content, and context of such acts:

### **Summary of the Budget Implementation Act, 1999**

#### **1. Title and Enactment**
- The Act is formally titled: **"The Budget Implementation Act, 1999"**.
- It was passed by and received royal assent from **Her Majesty the Queen**, on the advice and consent of the **Senate and House of Commons of Canada**.
- This means the legislation was approved by both chambers of Parliament and formally enacted into law.

#### **2. Citation**
- The Act is cited as: **Budget Implementation Act, 1999**.

#### **3. Effective Dates of Provisions**
The Act includes provisions that come into force on different dates, which are specified in the text:

- **Sections 2 to 11**: These sections are deemed to have come into force on **April 1, 1999**.  
  → This indicates that these provisions (likely relating to fiscal measures, spending adjustments, or tax changes) became effective on the first day of April 1999, coinciding with the start of the fiscal year or the implementation of budget measures.

- **Section 12**: This section is deemed to have come into force on **March 31, 1999**.  
  → This earlier date suggests that Section 12 may have been a transitional or preparatory provision, possibly related to reporting, administrative changes, or a closing of a prior fiscal period.

- **Sections 20 to 24**: These sections are set to come into force on a **day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet).  
  → This means that the exact date of implementation was not specified in the Act itself but was later determined by the government through a **statutory instrument** (order).  
  → According to the note provided: **"Sections 20 to 24 in force August 27, 1999, see SI/99-100"**.  
    → This confirms that the effective date of these sections was **August 27, 1999**, as established by **Statutory Instrument 99-100** (a government regulatory or administrative order).

#### **4. Purpose and Context (Inferred from the Structure)**
While the text provided does not include the full content of the sections, the structure and naming suggest that this Act was designed to:
- Implement key fiscal policies and budgetary decisions from the **1999 federal budget**.
- Adjust tax rates, public spending, or financial regulations in line with the government’s economic priorities.
- Provide transitional or administrative provisions to ensure smooth implementation of budget measures.

Such acts typically include:
- Tax changes (e.g., adjustments to income tax brackets or deductions),
- Revisions to government spending programs,
- Changes to financial reporting or accountability rules,
- Measures to support economic growth or fiscal stability.

#### **5. Legal Authority and Process**
- The Act follows the standard legislative process in Canada:
  - Introduced in Parliament,
  - Debated and passed by both the House of Commons and the Senate,
  - Received royal assent to become law.

- The use of "Governor in Council" (the Cabinet) to determine the effective date of certain sections reflects the administrative flexibility inherent in budget-related legislation, where implementation timing may depend on operational readiness or policy rollout.
