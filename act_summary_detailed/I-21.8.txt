### **Detailed Summary of the Investment Canada Act**

#### **Overview**

The **Investment Canada Act (ICA)** is a federal law enacted to balance the benefits of foreign investment in Canada with the need to protect **national security** and **public interest**. It establishes a regulatory framework for reviewing significant investments by **non-Canadians** in Canadian businesses, ensuring that such investments contribute to **economic growth, employment, and innovation**, while also safeguarding Canada’s strategic and sensitive sectors.

The Act is designed to **encourage foreign investment** while providing a transparent, predictable, and fair process to assess whether a proposed investment could pose a threat to national security, public order, or economic stability.
