The amendments aim to:
- Ensure transparency and predictability in exemption claims,
- Prevent retroactive or unanticipated exemptions,
- Improve accountability by requiring advance notice,
- Allow for periodic review of outdated or unnecessary exemptions.

### **2. Key Provisions and Their Detailed Analysis**

#### **Subsection (1): Notice of Intent Requirement**
> *Notwithstanding anything in this Act but subject to subsection (3), no person who, on the day on which subsection 11(1) or (1)(2) of the Hazardous Materials Information Review Act comes into force, would but for this section be entitled to file a claim for exemption under that subsection in relation to a controlled product is entitled to file a claim for exemption in relation to that controlled product under that subsection unless, during the period beginning on the first day of the second month after the coming into force of this section and ending on the last day of the sixth month after the coming into force of this section, that person has, in accordance with this section, filed a notice of intent to file a claim for exemption in relation to that controlled product with the Minister.*

##### **Meaning and Implications:**
- This provision **creates a mandatory pre-claim notice requirement** for any individual or organization that would otherwise be eligible to claim an exemption under section 11(1) or (1)(2) of the Hazardous Materials Information Review Act.
- The **"would but for this section be entitled"** clause means that the rule applies only to those who *would have been eligible* to file an exemption *without* this amendment.
- The **notice period** is **four months**:
  - Begins on the **first day of the second month** after the section comes into force.
  - Ends on the **last day of the sixth month** after the section comes into force.
- During this period, the person must file a **notice of intent** with the Minister.
- **Failure to file** during this window **prevents the person from claiming an exemption** under section 11(1) or (1)(2), even if they would otherwise qualify.

##### **Purpose:**
- Prevents "last-minute" or unanticipated exemption claims.
- Ensures that the Minister and regulatory bodies have time to assess potential exemptions and manage compliance.
- Increases procedural fairness and transparency.

#### **Subsection (2): Form and Fee for Notice of Intent**
> *A notice of intent referred to in subsection (1) shall be in such form and contain such information as the Minister may, by order, determine and shall be accompanied by a fee of five hundred dollars.*

##### **Details:**
- The **form and content** of the notice of intent are **determined by the Minister through a regulatory order**.
- This allows flexibility to adapt the form to changing needs or technological developments.
- A **fee of CAD $500** must be paid with the notice of intent.

##### **Purpose:**
- Ensures standardization and consistency in how exemption claims are initiated.
- Generates administrative revenue and discourages frivolous or frivolous applications.
- Provides a mechanism for the Minister to set clear expectations and requirements.

---

#### **Subsection (3): Minister’s Power to Grant Exemption by Order**
> *The Minister may, by order, on the application of any person and on payment of a fee of five hundred dollars, exempt a controlled product specified in the order from the application of subsection (1) where the Minister is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist to allow the exemption.*

##### **Key Points:**
- The Minister can **grant exemptions** from the notice-of-intent requirement **only if**:
  - An application is submitted by a person,
  - A fee of **CAD $500** is paid,
  - The Minister is **satisfied that reasonable grounds exist** for the exemption.
- The exemption is **specific to a controlled product** and is granted via **Ministerial order**.
- This power is **not automatic** and requires justification based on legitimate public interest or safety concerns.

##### **Purpose:**
- Provides a **flexible exception** to the general notice requirement for exceptional cases.
- Balances regulatory oversight with practical needs (e.g., for essential or unique products).
- Ensures that exemptions are not granted arbitrarily.

---

#### **Subsection (4): Fee Payment Does Not Relieve Obligations**
> *The payment of a fee under subsection (2) or (3) does not relieve a person of the obligation to pay any fee required to be paid on the filing of a claim for exemption under section 11 of the Hazardous Materials Information Review Act, as enacted by this Act.*

##### **Clarification:**
- Filing a notice of intent or receiving an exemption **does not eliminate** the need to pay **additional fees** when formally submitting a claim for exemption under section 11.
- This ensures that **all exemption claims remain subject to financial accountability** and that the regulatory system maintains revenue streams.

##### **Purpose:**
- Prevents a loophole where individuals could avoid full compliance costs by simply filing a notice of intent.
- Maintains financial integrity of the exemption process.

---

#### **Definition Clauses**
> *In this section,*
> - *controlled product* has the same meaning as in the Hazardous Products Act, as amended by this Act;
> - *Minister* means the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.

##### **Significance:**
- "Controlled product" is defined in the *Hazardous Products Act* and includes substances or products regulated due to health, safety, or environmental risks.
- The Minister responsible for enforcement is the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs**, a key regulatory body in Canada.

---

#### **Section 54 Cessation of Effect**
> *Section 54 or any provision thereof shall cease to have effect on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation.*

##### **Interpretation:**
- This provision **discontinues the operation of Section 54** (presumably a previous exemption provision) on a date to be announced via **proclamation**.
- The exact date is not fixed here but will be determined later by the government.
- This indicates a **phase-out** of outdated or redundant exemption provisions.

##### **Purpose:**
- Streamlines the regulatory framework by removing obsolete rules.
- Aligns with broader efforts to modernize and simplify hazardous products regulation.

---

#### **Review of Exemptions under Section 12**
> *On the expiration of two years after the coming into force of section 12 of the Hazardous Products Act, as enacted by this Act, that section shall stand referred to such committee of the House of Commons, of the Senate or of both Houses of Parliament as may be designated or established for that purpose and the committee shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, undertake a comprehensive review of the exemptions provided by that section and shall, within one year after the review is undertaken or within such further time as the House of Commons may authorize, submit a report thereon to Parliament including any recommendations pertaining to the continuation of any of those exemptions.*

##### **Breakdown:**
- After **two years** from the coming into force of **section 12**, it will be **referred to a parliamentary committee**.
- The committee must:
  - Conduct a **comprehensive review** of all exemptions granted under section 12.
  - Submit a **report to Parliament** within **one year** of the review (or with further time authorized by the House of Commons).
- The report must include **recommendations** on whether any exemptions should be continued, modified, or abolished.

##### **Purpose:**
- Introduces **parliamentary oversight** of exemption practices.
- Ensures that exemptions are **periodically reviewed** for relevance, necessity, and public interest.
- Promotes **transparency, accountability, and democratic legitimacy** in regulatory decisions.

---

#### **Coming into Force**
> *This Act or any provision thereof, or any provision of the Hazardous Products Act or the Canada Labour Code as amended or enacted by this Act, shall come into force on October 31, 1988 or on such earlier day or days as may be fixed by proclamation.*

##### **Key Points:**
- The amendments come into force on **October 31, 1988**, unless earlier proclaimed.
- This provides a **clear implementation date** for the new rules.
- The government may choose to implement earlier if needed (e.g., due to emergencies or urgent public interest).

##### **Note:**
- Part III of the Act was already in force from **October 1, 1987** (as noted in the footnote), indicating phased implementation.
