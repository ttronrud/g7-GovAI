The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements:

> [Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 441]

This notation indicates that a specific provision or section of a statute (or act) was **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 2012**, specifically under **Section 441** of that act.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Nature of the Entry**: The repeated entries suggest that the referenced section (or sections) of a prior act were formally repealed in 2012.
  
- **Repeal Date and Legal Authority**:  
  The repeal occurred on **January 1, 2012**, or shortly thereafter, as part of the legislative changes introduced by **Bill C-19**, which became an Act in 2012. This bill is commonly known as the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2012*, or another related act depending on the jurisdiction (e.g., in Canada, this would be under the *Criminal Code*).

- **Section 441**:  
  While the exact content of the original section is not provided in your query, Section 441 of Chapter 19, 2012, likely dealt with a specific criminal offense, regulatory provision, or administrative rule that was deemed obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent with current law. Common examples include outdated penalties, procedural rules, or provisions related to fraud, theft, or public order.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  The repeal was likely due to:
  - Legislative modernization or streamlining of the law.
  - The provision being superseded by newer legislation.
  - A finding that the law was unjust, ineffective, or no longer applicable.
  - A need to align with international standards or public policy changes.

- **Jurisdictional Context**:  
  Given the format (e.g., "c. 19, s. 441"), this appears to be from **Canadian legislation**, specifically the *Criminal Code* or another federal statute. In Canada, such repeals are formally recorded in the *Statutes of Canada* and are accessible through official legal databases like the *Canada Gazette* or *ParlInfo*.

- **Impact**:  
  Any legal action, interpretation, or enforcement based on the repealed section is now invalid. Legal practitioners, courts, and law enforcement agencies must refer to current statutes instead.

### Conclusion:

The repeated entries "[Repealed, 2012, c. 19, s. 441]" indicate that **a specific section of a prior act was officially removed from the law in 2012** through **Chapter 19 of the Statutes of Canada (2012)**, under **Section 441**. The exact content of the repealed provision is not available in the provided text, but the repeal reflects a legislative effort to update or simplify the legal framework. This repeal has no legal effect today—any reference to the section is outdated and invalid.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the original text of the section that was repealed, a detailed summary of its content or purpose cannot be fully provided. For a complete understanding, one would need to consult the original statute or official legislative database (e.g., *CanLII*, *ParlInfo*, or the *Statutes of Canada*).

If you can provide the name of the original act or the full text of the repealed section, I can offer a more detailed and context-specific summary.
