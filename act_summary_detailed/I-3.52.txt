### **Detailed Summary of the *Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1997***

The **Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1997** is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation that implements several **bilateral income tax treaties** between Canada and various foreign countries—specifically **Sweden, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland, and Denmark**. The Act ensures that these tax treaties are legally binding in Canada, providing clarity, consistency, and enforceability in the application of international tax rules to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion.

---

## **I. Structure and Purpose of the Act**

The Act is structured into a single main provision (a "Part") for each of the five bilateral income tax conventions. Each Part:

- Is named after the Canada–Country income tax convention it implements.
- Defines key terms and establishes the legal framework for the treaty’s operation within Canadian law.
- Grants authority to the federal government to administer and enforce the treaty provisions.

### **Key Objectives:**
1. **Avoid Double Taxation:** Prevent individuals and enterprises from being taxed twice on the same income in both Canada and the foreign country.
2. **Prevent Fiscal Evasion:** Deter tax avoidance through artificial arrangements or misclassification of income.
3. **Ensure Legal Effectiveness:** Provide that the treaties have the force of law in Canada during their period of validity.
4. **Provide Regulatory Flexibility:** Allow for the creation of regulations to interpret or implement treaty provisions as needed.

---

## **II. Key Provisions of the Act**

### **1. Citation and Scope**
- The Act may be cited as the **Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1997**.
- Each bilateral treaty is implemented in a separate "Part" of the Act:
  - Canada–Sweden
  - Canada–Lithuania
  - Canada–Kazakhstan
  - Canada–Iceland
  - Canada–Denmark

Each Part refers to the relevant **Convention** (set out in an attached Schedule), which is approved and has full legal force in Canada during the time it is in force under its own terms.

---

### **2. Priority of Treaty Provisions**
- **Treaty Precedence:** In the event of conflict between:
  - The provisions of this Part or the Convention and any other Canadian law,
  → The **Convention and this Part prevail**.
- **Interpretation Act Precedence:** If there is a conflict between the Convention and the **Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act**, then the latter prevails to the extent of the inconsistency.

> This ensures that treaty terms take precedence over domestic tax laws when they are in conflict, while also providing a clear interpretive framework.

---

### **3. Regulatory and Notification Powers**
- **Minister of National Revenue (MNR):**
  - May make **regulations** necessary to carry out the treaty or give effect to its provisions.
  - This allows for practical implementation (e.g., defining what constitutes a "permanent establishment" or how to calculate profits).
- **Minister of Finance (MOF):**
  - Must publish in the **Canada Gazette** within **60 days** of:
    - The Convention entering into force.
    - The Convention ceasing to have effect.
  - This ensures transparency and public awareness of treaty timelines.

> **Note entries** in the Canada Gazette confirm the dates when each treaty came into force:
- Sweden: December 23, 1997
- Lithuania: December 12, 1997
- Kazakhstan: March 30, 1998
- Iceland: January 30, 1998
- Denmark: March 2, 1998

### **3. Residency Rules**

#### **Individuals:**
An individual is deemed a resident of **only one** of the two countries under the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent Home:**  
   - If the individual has a permanent home available to them in one country → resident of that country.

2. **Centre of Vital Interests:**  
   - If permanent home is in both countries → resident of the country with **closer personal and economic ties**.

3. **Habitual Abode:**  
   - If centre of vital interests cannot be determined → resident of the country where the individual has a **habitual abode**.

4. **Nationality:**  
   - If no permanent home or habitual abode → resident of the country of **nationality**.

5. **Nationality Tiebreaker:**  
   - If individual is a national of both or neither → the **competent authorities** must resolve the issue by mutual agreement.

#### **Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, trusts):**
- If a company is a resident of both countries:
  - Competent authorities must **resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.
  - If no agreement is reached → the person is **not considered a resident** of either country for Articles 6 to 21 and Article 23 (which cover taxation of income and profits).

> This prevents double taxation and ensures clarity in determining tax residency.

### **4. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a **fixed place of business** through which an enterprise conducts business.

#### **Includes:**
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other fixed place related to natural resource exploration/exploitation

> A **building site or construction project** qualifies only if it lasts **more than 12 months**.

#### **Exclusions (Does NOT constitute a PE):**
- Use of facilities solely for:
  - Storage, display, or delivery of goods
  - Maintenance of stock for storage/display/delivery
  - Stock for processing by another enterprise
  - Purchasing goods or collecting information
  - Preparatory or auxiliary activities (e.g., sales, marketing, administration)

> **Exception:** If a person acts on behalf of an enterprise and has **authority to conclude contracts** in a foreign country, then the enterprise is deemed to have a PE **unless** the activities are limited to those excluded above.

> **Note:** An agent acting in the ordinary course of business (e.g., broker, general agent) does **not** create a PE.

> **No PE arises** simply because a company controls or is controlled by another company in the other country — even if it operates through a PE.
