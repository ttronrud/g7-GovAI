**Detailed Summary of the Employment Equity Act (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The **Employment Equity Act (EEA)** is a cornerstone piece of Canadian legislation designed to promote **equality in the workplace** by addressing historical and systemic disadvantages faced by certain groups. Enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, the Act establishes a legal framework to ensure that **no person is denied employment opportunities or benefits based on characteristics unrelated to ability** — specifically, **gender, race, disability, or Indigenous status**.

The Act goes beyond simple equal treatment; it mandates **positive action and targeted measures** to correct imbalances in employment representation and to create a more inclusive and equitable workforce.

---

## **Key Objectives and Purpose**

1. **Achieve Equality in Employment**  
   The central goal is to eliminate employment barriers that disadvantage:
   - Women  
   - Aboriginal peoples (Indians, Inuit, Métis)  
   - Persons with disabilities  
   - Members of visible minorities (non-Caucasian or non-white individuals)

2. **Go Beyond Equal Treatment**  
   Employment equity is defined not just as treating everyone the same, but as requiring:
   - **Special measures** (positive actions)
   - **Reasonable accommodations** for differences in ability or background
   - Proactive efforts to correct underrepresentation

3. **Correct Systemic Disadvantage**  
   The Act recognizes that structural and cultural barriers in hiring, promotion, and workplace practices have historically disadvantaged these groups, and it mandates steps to dismantle such barriers.

## **Employer Responsibilities**

### **1. Identify and Eliminate Employment Barriers**
Employers must:
- Identify barriers in employment systems, policies, and practices that disproportionately disadvantage members of designated groups.
- These barriers must be **unauthorized by law**.

### **2. Implement Positive Policies and Practices**
Employers must institute **positive actions** such as:
- Hiring, training, promotion, and retention strategies that support underrepresented groups.
- Reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to employment opportunities.

### **3. Achieve Representation Proportional to the Canadian Workforce**
The goal is to achieve **representation in occupational groups** that reflects:
- The overall representation of designated groups in the **Canadian workforce**, or
- More specific segments (by qualification, eligibility, or geography) from which the employer may reasonably recruit.

> Example: If women represent 40% of the Canadian workforce, then women should make up approximately 40% of the workforce in any given occupational group — unless otherwise justified.

## **Exemptions and Limitations**

The Act **does not require** employers to:
1. **Take specific measures** that would cause **undue hardship** (e.g., significant cost, disruption, or impracticality).
2. **Hire or promote individuals who do not meet essential job qualifications**.
3. **Create new positions** in the workforce.
4. **Violate merit-based hiring** in the public sector — where the Public Service Employment Act requires merit-based selection.

> **Exception**: In the private sector, if an employer is primarily serving Aboriginal peoples, they may give preference to Aboriginal peoples or employ only Aboriginal peoples — **unless such preference constitutes a discriminatory practice under the Canadian Human Rights Act**.

---

## **Non-Barrier Status for Certain Practices**

The following are **not considered employment barriers** under the Act:
- Priorities for appointment under the Public Service Employment Act or Public Service Commission regulations
- Workforce adjustment measures established by the Treasury Board or Public Service Commission (including those in workforce adjustment agreements)

> These are recognized as legitimate, non-discriminatory administrative tools.
