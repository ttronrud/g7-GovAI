**Detailed Summary of the *Wage Earner Protection Program Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Wage Earner Protection Program Act* (WEPPA) establishes a federal program designed to protect workers who have been employed by a company that becomes insolvent — such as through bankruptcy, receivership, or foreign insolvency proceedings. The Act ensures that eligible employees receive payment for **wages owed** to them, up to a statutory maximum, in cases where the employer is unable to meet its financial obligations.

This legislation operates within the broader framework of Canada’s bankruptcy and insolvency laws, particularly the *Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA)* and the *Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA)*, and is administered by the **Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB)**, with oversight from the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**.
