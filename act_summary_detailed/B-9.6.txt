## **4. Canada’s Contribution to the Advance Market Commitment (AMC) for Pneumococcal Vaccine**

- **Objective**: To support global efforts to increase access to a vaccine for **pneumococcal disease**, a serious bacterial infection that causes pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis — especially dangerous in children and the elderly.
- **Funding Authority**: Payments up to **US$200 million** (in Canadian dollars) may be made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- **Exemption from prior payments**: The total amount available is reduced by **C$115 million** that was previously paid under **Order in Council P.C. 2007-368**, dated March 22, 2007, under the *Act to authorize the Minister of Finance to make certain payments* (Chapter 36 of the Statutes of Canada, 2005).
- **Requisition Requirement**: The **Minister for International Development** may request such payments.
- **Agreements**: The Minister may enter into agreements with **international organizations** (e.g., WHO, GAVI) to facilitate vaccine availability, subject to:
  - Terms and conditions established by the **Governor in Council**,
  - On the **recommendation** of both the **Minister for International Development** and the **Minister of Finance**.
- **Exchange Rate**: The rate used to convert US dollars to Canadian dollars is the rate set by the **entity providing foreign banking services to the Receiver General** on the **day the payment is made**.

> **Significance**: This demonstrates Canada’s commitment to global public health through targeted financial contributions to vaccine development and distribution, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

## **5. Recalculation of Fiscal Equalization Payments**

- **Issue**: If **Section 165** of this Act comes into force **after** a fiscal equalization payment has already been calculated under **Section 3.91 of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act** for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2008, then:
  - The **Minister of Finance** may **recalculate** the fiscal equalization payment for that province under **Section 3.6** of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.
- **Legal Basis**: This recalculation is permitted under the amended version of Section 3.91, as enacted by Section 165 of this Act.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that equalization payments are accurately adjusted if new rules or data (e.g., updated income or population figures) are introduced after the initial calculation, thereby maintaining fairness in interprovincial fiscal distribution.

> **Note**: This section was **repealed in 2015** (by *c. 4, s. 116*), indicating that the recalculation mechanism is no longer in force.

## **6. Section 172 – Effective Date for Newfoundland and Labrador’s Election**

- **Section 172** comes into force, or is **deemed to have come into force**, on **April 1 of the first fiscal year** in which **Newfoundland and Labrador makes the election** under **subsection 3.7(3)** of the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*.
- The **Minister of Finance** is required to **publish the effective date** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- **Effective Date**: April 1, 2010, as published in *Canada Gazette Part I, Volume 146, page 26*.

> **Purpose**: This provision allows Newfoundland and Labrador to opt into a specific fiscal arrangement (likely related to equalization or revenue sharing) and ensures that the changes take effect only when the province formally elects to participate, with clear public transparency.

## **7. Public-Private Partnership Funding for Fiscal Years 2007–2008 and 2008–2009**

- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** may pay out a sum **not exceeding C$5 million** on the **requisition of the Minister of Finance**.
- This funding is to be directed to an entity **designated by the Minister of Finance**.
- The funds are intended to **facilitate public-private partnership (PPP) projects**, specifically for:
  - **Operating expenditures**
  - **Capital expenditures**
- The support is available for **fiscal years 2007–2008 and 2008–2009**.

> **Purpose**: Encourages innovation and efficiency in public service delivery by enabling collaboration between government and private sector actors. This supports infrastructure, service improvement, and cost-effective delivery of public programs.

## **8. Interest Calculation under the Customs Act**

- For the purpose of applying provisions in the **Customs Act** that relate to **interest on unpaid amounts**, the following rule applies:
  - Interest shall be computed **as though Sections 204 to 208 of the Customs Act had come into force on January 1, 2008**.
- This means that any interest due on customs-related obligations (e.g., unpaid duties or penalties) will be calculated using the interest rates and rules that would have applied from January 1, 2008, forward.

> **Purpose**: Provides legal clarity and consistency in interest calculations for customs liabilities. It ensures that interest is computed based on a standardized, retroactive date, which helps avoid discrepancies in financial reporting and enforcement.
