**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Recovery Benefits Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Canada Recovery Benefits Act* (CRBA) was enacted in response to the economic and social impacts of the **COVID-19 pandemic**. It provides a suite of temporary financial assistance programs to support individuals who experienced job losses, reduced work hours, or were otherwise unable to work due to pandemic-related reasons. The Act was designed to be a **targeted, short-term relief measure** to stabilize household incomes during a period of significant economic disruption.

The key benefits under this Act include:
- **Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB)** – for individuals who lost income due to reduced work or job loss during the pandemic.
- **Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)** – for individuals unable to work due to illness related to COVID-19.
- **Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB)** – for individuals caring for a family member or child affected by illness or disability due to pandemic-related circumstances.

The Act applies to a specific time window: **from September 27, 2020, to October 23, 2021** (for CRB), and extends the sickness benefit to **May 7, 2022**.

## **II. Eligibility for the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB)**

A person is eligible for a Canada Recovery Benefit for any two-week period falling between **September 27, 2020, and October 23, 2021**, if they meet **all of the following conditions**:

### **1. Basic Requirements**
- Must have a **valid Social Insurance Number (SIN)**.
- Must be **at least 15 years old** on the first day of the two-week period.
- Must be **resident and present in Canada** during the entire two-week period.

---

### **2. Income Requirement**
The applicant must have had **at least $5,000 in total income** in a relevant year or 12-month period before applying, from the following sources:
- Employment income  
- Self-employment income  
- Employment Insurance (EI) benefits (under subsections 22(1), 23(1), 152.04(1), or 152.05(1))  
- Provincial benefits for pregnancy or childcare (including adoption)  
- Any other income prescribed by regulation  

> **Note**: For applications made in **2021**, the income requirement is adjusted based on 2019 or 2020 income.  
> For **special cases** (e.g., individuals with prior CRB claims), income requirements are slightly modified.

---

### **3. Job Loss or Reduced Work Requirement**
The person must have experienced a **reduction in income of at least 50%** (or a lower percentage fixed by regulation) in their **average weekly employment or self-employment income** during the two-week period compared to:
- For **2020 applications**: 2019 income or the 12 months prior to application  
- For **2021 applications**: 2019, 2020, or the 12 months prior to application  

> This is a **key eligibility criterion** that ensures only those with significant income drops qualify.

---

### **4. No Prior EI Benefit Periods (or Limited Exceptions)**
- **No EI benefit period** (as defined in the Employment Insurance Act) may have been established for any week within the two-week period.  
- **Exception**: If a person was already receiving EI benefits (regular or special), they may still qualify **only if** they were paid the maximum allowable weeks of regular or regular + special benefits **for that benefit period**, and the last week of those benefits was the **first week** of the two-week period being applied for.

> This means that individuals who had already exhausted their EI benefit entitlements may still qualify for CRB.

---

### **5. No Other Income During the Period**
The person must **not have received** any of the following during the two-week period:
- Provincial pregnancy or childcare benefits  
- Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)  
- Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB)  
- Regular or special EI benefits  
- Any other income prescribed by regulation  

> This ensures that CRB is not duplicated with other government benefits.

---

### **6. Work Search Requirement**
- The applicant must have **actively sought work** during the two-week period, whether as an employee or in self-employment.  
- **Exception**: If the person attended a course or training program **referred to by a provincial government or body**, this is considered a valid reason for not actively seeking work.

---

### **7. No Undue Restrictions on Work Availability**
- The applicant must not have placed **undue restrictions** on their availability for work.  
- This includes not refusing reasonable job offers or failing to return to work when requested.  
- **Exception**: Attendance at a **provincial-recommended training or education course** is permitted.

---

### **8. No Unreasonable Quitting or Non-Return to Work**
- **First-time applicants**: Must not have quit or voluntarily ceased work on or after September 27, 2020, unless it was reasonable to do so.  
- Must not have failed to return to work when requested by an employer, or declined a reasonable job offer during the two-week period or in the **four preceding two-week periods** beginning on September 27, 2020.

> This prevents abuse of the program by individuals who simply stopped working without cause.

---

### **9. Quarantine/Isolation Exemption**
- The person must **not have been required to quarantine or isolate** under the *Quarantine Act* due to entering Canada.  
- **Exception**: If required to isolate, the only acceptable reason for being outside Canada is:
  - To receive medically certified treatment (by a medical practitioner), or  
  - To accompany a person who is medically certified as unable to travel without assistance and requires medical treatment.

> This ensures that individuals who were isolated due to travel are not penalized unless their absence was for non-essential reasons.

---

### **10. Income Tax Return Requirement**
- The applicant must have filed a **tax return** for either **2019 or 2020** under Part I of the *Income Tax Act*, **excluding** returns filed under:
  - Subsection 70(2) or 104(23)  
  - Paragraph 128(2)(e)  
  - Subsection 150(4)

> This ensures that applicants have a verifiable income record.

---

## **III. Application Process**

- A person may apply **in the form and manner established by the Minister** (Minister of Employment and Social Development).
- **Deadline for Application**: No application may be submitted more than **60 days after the end** of the two-week period to which the benefit relates.
- Applicants must **attest** (confirm) that they meet each eligibility condition listed in section 3(1)(a) to (n).
- **Exemptions from attestation**:
  - Income under (d) and (e): Not required if the applicant has previously received a benefit under the Act.
  - Condition (k): Not required if applicant has previously received benefits.
  - Condition (l): Not required if applicant has never received benefits before.
  - Condition (m): Not required if application is made before **January 11, 2021**.

> These exemptions reduce administrative burden for individuals with prior claims.

## **IV. Benefit Amounts and Duration**

### **Benefit Structure**
| Group | Benefit Amount |
|------|----------------|
| **Applicants who applied for a two-week period before July 18, 2021** | $500 per week for up to 42 weeks; $300 per week thereafter |
| **First-time applicants (applied on or after July 18, 2021)** | $300 per week |

> This reflects a **phased rollout** of the benefit, with higher payments initially available to those who applied earlier.

---

### **Special Provision: Overlap with EI Benefits**
Despite the general rule, **if a person received EI benefits for the maximum number of weeks** in a benefit period, and the **last week of those benefits was the first week** of the two-week period being applied for, the Minister may pay **$300 for the entire two-week period**.

> This ensures that individuals who exhausted their EI entitlements still receive some support.

---

### **Maximum Duration of Benefits**
- The maximum number of two-week periods is **25**, **unless modified by regulation**.
- **Reduction Rule**: For every **two weeks** of regular EI benefits received during the period **September 27, 2020 – October 23, 2021**, the maximum number of CRB periods is reduced by **one**.
- **Exception**: For each
