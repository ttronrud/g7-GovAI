**Detailed Summary of the *Natural Resources Transfer (School Lands) Amendment Act, 1961***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Natural Resources Transfer (School Lands) Amendment Act, 1961* is a legislative instrument enacted by the Parliament of Canada to formally confirm and amend key provisions of Memoranda of Agreement between the Government of Canada and the provincial governments of **Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan**. These agreements pertain specifically to the **transfer and administration of school lands and the School Lands Fund**—a critical component of early Canadian provincial education financing.

The Act serves as a legal foundation for the full transfer of control over these lands and funds from federal to provincial jurisdiction, allowing provinces to manage them independently without federal oversight or restrictions.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Context**

#### **1. Confirmation of Memoranda of Agreement**
The Act confirms and declares the following three Memoranda of Agreement to have the **force of law in Canada**:
- **Manitoba (July 13, 1961)** – Between Canada and Manitoba
- **Alberta (July 13, 1961)** – Between Canada and Alberta  
- **Saskatchewan (July 14, 1961)** – Between Canada and Saskatchewan

These agreements were originally established in the 1920s and 1930s and were later amended in the 1950s to adjust provisions related to school land administration. This Act formalizes their legal status through Canadian statute.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that these intergovernmental agreements are recognized as binding legal instruments under Canadian law, thereby enabling their implementation and future modification through concurrent legislation.

---

#### **2. Historical Background of the Original Provisions**

All three provinces had previously entered into agreements under the **original 1929 Memorandum of Agreement** (with Manitoba and Alberta) or the **1930 agreement** (with Saskatchewan), which included a specific clause (Paragraph 7) governing the transfer of:
- The **School Lands Fund**
- Certain **school lands** under the *Dominion Lands Act*, specifically those referenced in **Section 37 of Chapter 113 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927**

##### **Original Provisions (as amended in the 1950s)**:
Under the prior version of Paragraph 7:
- The School Lands Fund and designated school lands were to be **set aside** and **administered by the province**.
- The province was required to **administer these lands in accordance with Sections 37–40 of the Dominion Lands Act**, "mutatis mutandis" (with necessary adjustments).
- The province could **invest funds** in securities (e.g., federal, provincial, municipal, or school district bonds), and apply the **interest earned** after management costs to support public schools in accordance with provincial law.

This arrangement imposed **federal-style administrative controls** and limitations on how provinces could use the funds or lands—particularly regarding investment and disposal.

---

#### **3. Key Change Introduced by the 1961 Amendment**

The central and most significant change introduced by the Act is the **deletion of the original Paragraph 7** and the **substitution of a new, broader clause**:

> **New Paragraph 7 (Substituted):**  
> *"The School Lands Fund transferred to the Province under the terms hereof, and such of the school lands specified in section 37 of the Dominion Lands Act, chapter 113 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as passed to the administration of the Province under the terms hereof, shall be administered or disposed of in such manner as the Province may determine."*

##### **Significance of This Change**:
- **Full Provincial Autonomy**: The province now has **complete discretion** over how to administer or dispose of the School Lands Fund and associated school lands.
- **Removal of Federal Constraints**: The prior requirement to administer the funds in accordance with specific sections of the Dominion Lands Act (Sections 37–40) is removed.
- **Freedom of Investment and Disposition**: Provinces are no longer restricted in how they invest the fund (e.g., in securities) or how they manage or sell school lands.
- **Flexibility in Educational Funding**: Provinces can now tailor their approach to education funding based on local needs, economic conditions, and policy priorities.

> This marks a major shift from **federal oversight and standardization** to **provincial self-governance** in education finance and land management.

---

#### **4. Legal Authority for Modification**

The original agreements included **Paragraph 24**, which provided that:
> "The foregoing provisions of the said Agreement may be varied by agreement confirmed by concurrent statutes of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the Province."

This clause gives the **legal basis** for future changes to the arrangements, including the one made in 1961. The 1961 Act demonstrates how such modifications can be enacted through **concurrent legislation**—i.e., laws passed by both federal and provincial parliaments.

---

#### **5. Implementation and Effective Date**

- The new agreements take effect **upon being duly approved** by:
  - The **Parliament of Canada** (federal level)
  - The **Legislature of the respective province** (provincial level)

> This ensures that the transfer of control is not unilateral but requires **shared legislative approval**, maintaining intergovernmental accountability and democratic legitimacy.

### **Provincial-Specific Contexts**

| Province | Original Agreement Date | Key Amendments | Change in 1961 |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Manitoba** | 1929 (Dec 14) | Amended June 11, 1951 | Removed administrative constraints; full provincial control over fund and land |
| **Alberta** | 1929 (Dec 14) | Amended March 31, 1951 | Same as Manitoba; removed restrictions on administration and investment |
| **Saskatchewan** | 1930 (Mar 20) | Amended May 25, 1948 & March 29, 1951 | Removed restrictions on investment and land disposal; added flexibility for land sales to veterans (previously allowed under Veterans Land Act) |

> Note: Saskatchewan’s original agreement included a provision allowing the sale of school lands to **veterans eligible under the Veterans Land Act, 1942**. However, this was **not retained** in the 1961 amendment, as the new clause grants the province full discretion—implying that such sales could be discontinued or modified at provincial will.

### **Broader Implications and Significance**

1. **Devolution of Education Authority**  
   The Act represents a significant step in the **devolution of power** from the federal government to provincial governments, particularly in the area of **education funding and land management**.

2. **Provincial Autonomy in Education Policy**  
   Provinces gained the ability to design their own school funding models, including investment strategies and land use policies, based on local economic and social conditions.

3. **Strengthening Provincial Fiscal Capacity**  
   By removing federal constraints, provinces could better manage their school funds, potentially leading to more efficient and responsive public education systems.

4. **Precedent for Future Intergovernmental Agreements**  
   The 1961 Act sets a precedent for how federal-provincial agreements involving natural resources, land, or public funds can be amended through **concurrent legislation**, ensuring legal clarity and democratic accountability.

5. **Historical Context**  
   The 1961 amendments occurred during a period of **increased provincial autonomy** in Canada, particularly in the post-World War II era when provinces sought greater control over social services and economic development.
