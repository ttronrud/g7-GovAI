### **Purpose of the Act**

To enhance **financial accountability and transparency** by requiring:
- The preparation and public release of **audited consolidated financial statements**
- The preparation and public release of a **Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses** for the chief and each councillor

This ensures that both internal stakeholders (members) and external audiences (public, government, oversight bodies) can assess how First Nation funds are managed, used, and distributed.

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

- Applies to **every First Nation’s financial year** beginning **after the Act comes into force**.
- Covers all First Nations that fall within the definition provided (i.e., bands not under comprehensive self-government agreements).

### **Mandatory Financial Reporting Requirements**

#### 1. **Consolidated Financial Statements**
- Must be prepared **annually** in accordance with **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)**.
- Primary sources: The **Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA)** handbooks, especially the *Public Sector Accounting Handbook*, as amended from time to time.
- These statements must reflect the financial position of the First Nation **combined with any affiliated entities** required to be consolidated under GAAP.

#### 2. **Auditing Requirement**
- The consolidated financial statements must be **audited** by an **independent auditor** who is:
  - A member in good standing of a **corporation, institute, or association of accountants** incorporated under a provincial statute.
  - Auditing must follow **generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS)** set by CICA or its successor.

> This ensures professional, objective, and standardized scrutiny of financial records.

#### 3. **Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses**
- A separate document titled **"Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses"** must be prepared annually.
- It must list, **separately**, the:
  - **Remuneration** (salaries, bonuses, honoraria, etc.) paid to:
    - The First Nation’s **chief**
    - Each **councillor**, acting in their official capacity and in any other personal capacity
  - **Expenses reimbursed** to the chief and each councillor (e.g., travel, meals, accommodation)
- The schedule **does not form part** of the consolidated financial statements.

> Importantly, remuneration includes **all monetary benefits** except expense reimbursements. Non-monetary benefits (e.g., vehicles, housing) are also included under "remuneration."

#### 4. **Auditor’s Report on the Schedule**
- The auditor must accompany the Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses with:
  - An **auditor’s report** (if a full audit) or
  - A **review engagement report** (if a review is conducted)

> This adds an independent layer of verification to the remuneration and expense data.

### **Access to Financial Information by Members**

#### 1. **Right to Request Copies**
- Any **member** of a First Nation may request copies of the following documents:
  - Audited consolidated financial statements  
  - Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses  
  - Auditor’s written report on consolidated statements  
  - Auditor’s report or review report on the Schedule  

#### 2. **Timeline for Provision**
- Must provide copies **without delay**.
- If the request is received **within 120 days** of the end of the financial year, the First Nation has **until 120 days after the end of that year** to provide the documents.

> This allows time for processing and ensures timely access without undue burden.

#### 3. **Fees for Copies**
- A First Nation **may charge a fee**, but:
  - The fee must **not exceed the actual cost of providing the copies**
  - Fees must be reasonable and cost-based

> This prevents financial barriers to access while ensuring sustainability of service delivery.

---

### **Public Publication Requirements**

#### 1. **Mandatory Online Publication**
- Within **120 days after the end of each financial year**, a First Nation must:
  - Publish the following documents on its **official website**, or
  - Cause them to be published on an **accessible Internet site**

The documents include:
- Audited consolidated financial statements  
- Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses  
- Auditor’s report on consolidated statements  
- Auditor’s report or review report on the Schedule  

#### 2. **Public Accessibility Duration**
- Once published, these documents must remain **accessible to the public on the Internet for at least 10 years**.

> This ensures long-term transparency and enables historical review.

#### 3. **Clarification: Publishing ≠ Access for Members**
- Simply publishing documents online is **not sufficient** to fulfill the duty to provide copies to members.
- Members must still be able to **request and receive physical or digital copies** directly.

---

### **Ministerial Role and Public Access**

- The **Minister of Indigenous Services** must:
  - Publish the same documents (as required by the First Nation) on the **Department of Indigenous Services’ official website**.
  - Do so **without delay** after receiving the documents or after they are published by the First Nation.

> This ensures broader public access and supports transparency beyond the First Nation’s own community.

---

### **Enforcement and Remedies for Non-Compliance**

If a First Nation fails to meet its obligations under Sections 5 to 8, the Minister may take one or more of the following actions:

#### 1. **Require Development of an Action Plan**
- The Minister may require the council to develop a **specific, actionable plan** to correct the breach and ensure compliance.

#### 2. **Withhold Grant or Contribution Funds**
- The Minister may **withhold payments** (grants or contributions) under existing agreements that were in force on the day the breach occurred.
- This applies **until compliance is achieved**.
- The withheld amount is treated as **due and owing** under **Section 37.1 of the Financial Administration Act**, which governs the enforcement of financial obligations.

#### 3. **Terminate Agreements**
- The Minister may **terminate any agreement** (e.g., funding or partnership agreements) entered into by the First Nation and the Crown, if the breach is serious or persistent.

> These measures serve as strong deterrents against non-compliance and reinforce the importance of financial integrity.

---

### **Legal Remedies for Non-Compliance**

#### 1. **Court Action by Members**
- If a First Nation fails to provide documents to a member under Section 7:
  - Any member may apply to a **superior court** for an order requiring the council to fulfill its duty.
  - The court may set a specific time frame for compliance.

#### 2. **Court Action by Any Person (including Minister)**
- If a First Nation fails to publish documents under Section 8:
  - Any person (including the Minister) may apply to a superior court for an order to enforce publication.

#### 3. **Time Limit for Applications**
- Applications for court orders regarding the **most recent financial year** may only be made **after 120 days** have passed from the end of that financial year.

> This prevents premature legal action and allows for a reasonable period of compliance.
