The provided text appears to be a **draft or excerpted version of a legislative act**, specifically the **Jobs and Economic Growth Act**, passed by the Parliament of Canada. However, the content presented is **not a complete or fully structured act**, and instead consists largely of repetitive placeholders (e.g., "[Amendment]", "[Amendments]", "[Note: ...]", "[Transitional Provision]", "[Repealed before coming into force]") and **fragmented transitional provisions** without clear section titles, substantive policy content, or detailed legislative text.

Below is a **detailed, accurate, and structured summary** of what can be reasonably inferred from the provided excerpt, based on its structure, terminology, and known Canadian legislative practices.

## 📚 Detailed Summary of the *Jobs and Economic Growth Act* (Excerpt)

### 1. **Title and Citation**
- The Act is formally titled: **Jobs and Economic Growth Act**.
- It may be cited as such and is enacted by Her Majesty (the monarch), with the advice and consent of the **Senate and House of Commons of Canada** — the standard constitutional process for passing federal legislation.

> 🔍 *Note: This title suggests the Act is designed to stimulate employment and economic activity, likely through tax incentives, business support, or investment measures.*

### 2. **Regulatory Provisions: Input Tax Credit Allocation Methods (GST/HST)**
- The Act references and **deems the Input Tax Credit Allocation Methods (GST/HST) Regulations** to have come into force on **April 1, 2007**.
- These regulations govern how businesses can claim input tax credits (a key component of Canada’s Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax – GST/HST) when purchasing goods and services used in their operations.
- The reference to April 1, 2007, aligns with when the federal government introduced updated rules for allocating GST/HST credits to ensure fair and transparent distribution among businesses.

> 📌 *Purpose:* Ensures businesses can properly claim tax credits for eligible expenses, promoting efficiency and reducing tax burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.

### 3. **Coming into Force Dates (Effective Dates)**
This section outlines **when various parts or sections of the Act come into force**, which is critical for legal implementation.

#### Key Effective Dates:
| Section/Part | Effective Date | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| **This Part (excluding Section 98)** | April 15, 2009 or later | Day to be fixed by Governor in Council (i.e., Cabinet). Cannot be earlier than April 15, 2009. |
| **Section 98** | July 1, 2010 | A specific provision, possibly related to transitional or administrative matters. |
| **Sections 99–102** | September 1, 2010 | As specified in Statutory Instrument SI/2010-55. |
| **Sections 1650–1652, 1654, 1656, 1658, 1660, 1662–1663, 1665–1666, 1668–1669, 1671–1682, 1684–1685, 1687–1691, 1693, 1695, 1697–1698, 1700–1710, 1712–1715, 1717–1721, 1723, 1725–1727, 1729, 1731, 1733–1736, 1738, 1740–1741, 1743–1744, 1746–1753, 1755, 1757, 1759, 1761, 1763, 1765, 1767, 1769–1772, 1774, 1776–1782, 1784** | **March 16, 2012** | All these sections are set to come into force on March 16, 2012, as confirmed in **Statutory Instrument SI/2012-14**. |
| **Section 1765** | **June 15, 2012** | Exceptionally, this section comes into force later — June 15, 2012 — also in SI/2012-14. |
| **Sections 1776–1782** | **August 27, 2010** | Earlier than 2012; effective date confirmed in **SI/2010-72**. |
| **Sections 1788, 1789, 1792, 1793, 1794, 1796, 1798, 1799, 1801, 1803, 1810, 1811, subsection 1813(2), section 1814, subsections 1816(1) and (3), section 1819, subsections 1820(2) to (5), (7), (8), (10), and sections 1821, 1824, 1825** | **July 12, 2010** (assent date), with some later (October 31, 2010) | These sections come into force on a day or days to be fixed by Governor in Council. However, specific dates are provided: <br> - July 12, 2010 (for most) <br> - October 31, 2010 (for section 1797 and subsection 1820(12)) |

> ✅ *This pattern reflects a typical Canadian legislative approach:*
> - Major provisions are introduced in phases.
> - Transitional provisions allow time for stakeholders (businesses, tax authorities) to adapt.
> - Effective dates are often delayed to allow for implementation planning and public consultation.

---

### 4. **Transitional Provisions**
- Several sections include **transitional provisions**, which ensure that existing rights, obligations, or tax treatments are preserved during the transition to new rules.
- For example:
  - Businesses that were already in compliance with old rules may not be required to change immediately.
  - Tax liabilities or credits may be adjusted retroactively or on a phased basis.

> 🔍 *Example:* A business that had claimed input tax credits under the old allocation method may continue to do so until the new rules take effect.

---

### 5. **Repeal and Repealed Provisions**
- **Section 1784** is noted as coming into force on August 27, 2010 (same as SI/2010-72), indicating it was not repealed but rather activated.
- A **repeal note** states:
  > *"Repealed before coming into force, 2010, c. 25, s. 198"*
- This means that **some provisions of the Act were formally repealed** prior to being enacted — likely due to being superseded by other legislation (e.g., the *Budget Act* or *Finance Act, 2010*).

> ⚠️ *This shows that the Act is not static — it evolves over time, with parts being added, modified, or removed based on economic conditions or policy shifts.*

---

### 6. **Absence of Substantive Policy Content**
Despite the detailed structure of effective dates and regulatory references, the **actual policy content, objectives, or provisions (such as tax credits, grants, investment incentives, or job creation programs)** are **missing** from the provided text.

- There are no clear descriptions of:
  - What economic goals the Act aims to achieve.
  - How businesses or workers will benefit.
  - Specific tax breaks, subsidies, or infrastructure investments.
  - Who is eligible for support.
- The only substantive content is procedural: **when rules come into force** and **how regulations are administered**.

> ❌ *Conclusion:* This is not a complete or fully developed version of the Jobs and Economic Growth Act. It appears to be a **technical or administrative excerpt**, possibly from a legislative draft, a government document, or a summary of implementation timelines.
