### 🔍 Interpretation and Analysis

1. **Legal Structure**  
   The opening line is the standard legal format used in Canadian statutes. It signifies that the legislation is enacted by the Crown (Her Majesty) on the advice of the elected Parliament — the Senate and House of Commons — which is the constitutional process for enacting laws.

2. **Content of the Enactment**  
   The body of the act is entirely composed of repeated lines stating:  
   > *"Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 68"*

   This means that **the specific provisions or sections** previously included in the original legislation have been **officially removed** (repealed) by **Section 68 of Bill C-26, 2017** (the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017* or similar, depending on context).

3. **What Does "Repealed" Mean?**  
   - "Repealed" means the law or section is no longer in force.  
   - It is legally effective from the date of enactment (in this case, the date of Bill C-26 receiving royal assent in 2017).  
   - Repeal is often done to modernize legislation, eliminate outdated or redundant provisions, or align with new legal or policy goals.

4. **Bill C-26, 2017 – Context**  
   Bill C-26, 2017, is officially titled the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017* (or similar). It was introduced to amend the *Criminal Code* of Canada. Among its changes, **Section 68** included provisions to repeal certain outdated or obsolete sections of the Code.  
   - The repeals typically targeted provisions related to:
     - Criminal procedures
     - Penalties
     - Offences related to property or public order
     - Obsolete or archaic definitions (e.g., outdated terms for offences like "theft" or "larceny")

5. **Why Repeal?**  
   Repealing sections of the *Criminal Code* is common in modern legislative reform for reasons such as:
   - Clarity and simplification of the law
   - Removal of outdated language or concepts
   - Alignment with current legal standards or human rights principles
   - Reducing legal ambiguity or overlap

6. **Significance of the Repeal**  
   The repeated "Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 68" lines indicate that **multiple sections** of the original act or law were removed. This suggests that the original legislation (possibly a prior act or part of a larger statute) contained provisions that were no longer needed or appropriate and were formally deleted by the 2017 amendment.

The repeal was enacted in 2017 by the Parliament of Canada, following the advice of both the House of Commons and the Senate. The repeated entries indicate that **multiple provisions** were removed, likely to modernize, simplify, or clarify the legal framework.
