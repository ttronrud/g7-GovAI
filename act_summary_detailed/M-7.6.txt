### **Detailed Summary of the Mi’kmaq Education Act**

---

#### **Overview**
The *Mi’kmaq Education Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted in 1999 to uphold and implement the **1997 Mi’kmaq Education Agreement** between the Government of Canada and the Mi’kmaq Bands in Nova Scotia. This Act grants Mi’kmaq communities significant autonomy over education on their reserves, recognizing their right to self-governance in educational matters, while ensuring that these programs meet national standards for equity and academic transferability.

The Act is rooted in the principles of **self-determination, cultural preservation, and educational equity**, and it establishes a legal framework allowing Mi’kmaq communities to govern their own primary, elementary, and secondary education systems, as well as to manage post-secondary education funding and administration.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

#### **1. Title and Citation**
- The Act is formally titled the **Mi’kmaq Education Act**.
- It is cited as such and serves as the legal instrument through which the 1997 Agreement is implemented in Canadian law.

---

#### **2. Definitions**
The Act defines key terms used throughout:
- **Agreement**: Refers to the **1997 Agreement between Her Majesty (the Queen in right of Canada) and the Mi’kmaq Bands in Nova Scotia** concerning education. This is the foundational treaty that gives the Act its authority.
- **Band**: A Mi’kmaq band as defined under the *Indian Act*.
- **Community**: A band listed in the Schedule to the Act. Only communities named in the Schedule are subject to the Act.
- **Constitution**: A constitution adopted by a community’s council that conforms to **Schedule D of the Agreement**. This constitution governs how the community will structure its educational laws and governance.
- **Council**: The governing body of a band or community as defined in the *Indian Act*.
- **Member**: A person whose name appears on the official band list under the *Indian Act*, or who is entitled to have their name included.
- **Reserve**: As defined in the *Indian Act*.

> These definitions establish a clear legal and administrative framework for identifying who is governed by the Act and what structures are involved.

---

#### **3. Jurisdiction and Purpose**
- **Purpose**: To enable Mi’kmaq communities to exercise jurisdiction over education as provided in the 1997 Agreement.
- **Scope**: Applies only to communities for which a constitution is in effect and listed in the Schedule.

> This ensures that only communities that have formally adopted a constitution in accordance with the Agreement can exercise educational self-governance.

---

#### **4. Powers of Communities in Education**
Communities have the authority to:
- **Make laws** regarding:
  - **Primary, elementary, and secondary education** on their reserve (subject to the Agreement).
  - **Post-secondary education** administration and expenditure for members of the community, wherever they reside (including off-reserve).

> This reflects a balance between local control and national standards. Communities can manage their own school systems and funding, but must do so within the boundaries set by the Agreement.

---

#### **5. Educational Standards and Transferability**
- The educational programs and services provided by a community must be **comparable to those of other Canadian education systems**.
- This ensures that students can **transfer between systems without academic penalty**, just as students can transfer between public schools across Canada.

> This provision is critical to ensure that Mi’kmaq students are not disadvantaged when moving between reserve-based and mainstream education systems.

---

#### **6. Community Education Boards**
- A community may establish an **education board** through its own laws.
- The board may exercise powers granted by:
  - The community’s laws, or
  - A resolution passed by the council under Section 7.

> This allows for operational flexibility in managing day-to-day education services while remaining accountable to the community council.

---

#### **7. Legislative Process and Public Access**
- Laws of a community must be enacted in accordance with the **community’s constitution**.
- The council must:
  - Publish a law within **30 days** of enactment in a manner that provides a reasonable opportunity for reserve residents to be informed.
  - Make copies of laws and the constitution available **for public inspection during normal business hours** at the community office.
- **Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey** (a central entity) must also make all community laws and constitutions available for public inspection.

> This ensures transparency, public participation, and accountability in the legislative process.

---

#### **8. Evidence of Community Laws**
- In legal proceedings, a **certified copy** of a community law is sufficient evidence of its existence.
- No proof of the person’s signature or official status is required.

> This facilitates legal use of community laws in court, promoting the legitimacy of community governance.

---

#### **9. Exemption from Statutory Instruments Act**
- The **Statutory Instruments Act does not apply** to laws passed by communities under this Act.

> This means community laws are not subject to ministerial review or approval through the Statutory Instruments process, reinforcing local autonomy.

---

#### **10. Establishment of Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey**
- A **corporation without share capital**, named **Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey**, is established to support the delivery of educational programs and services under this Act.
- **Chiefs of the communities** are the members of the corporation and form its **board of directors**.
- The board may govern the corporation’s affairs through by-laws or other mechanisms.

> Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey acts as a **centralized, shared entity** to support education across communities, ensuring coordination, resource sharing, and administrative efficiency.

> **Note**: Part 19 of the *Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act* applies to Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey. In particular, **section 160** is interpreted so that references to "members" are read as references to "directors."

---

#### **11. Exemption from Indian Act Provisions**
- **Sections 114 to 122 of the Indian Act** do **not apply** to a community or its members in relation to education under this Act.

> This removes federal restrictions on community education governance, allowing full autonomy in educational decision-making.

---

#### **12. Amendments to the Schedule**
The Governor in Council (federal government) may:
- **Add** a band to the Schedule if:
  - The band’s council has authorized the Agreement to be signed on its behalf.
  - The Agreement has been formally signed on behalf of the band.
- **Delete** a community from the Schedule if:
  - The community’s council has authorized withdrawal from the Agreement.

> This process allows for dynamic inclusion or exit from the education framework based on community decisions.

> **Timing**: Any such amendment takes effect on **April 1 of the following year** after a council authorizes the signing or withdrawal during the 12-month period ending on **June 30** of a given year.

> This provides a clear, predictable timeline for changes.

---

#### **13. Coming into Force**
- The Act comes into force on a day to be **fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.
- **Section 10** (establishment of Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey) comes into force **after** the chiefs of the named communities adopt a **resolution establishing Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey**.

> This ensures that Mi’kmaw-Kina’matnewey is only established with formal, collective community consent.
