**Detailed Summary of the *Expungement of Historically Unjust Convictions Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Expungement of Historically Unjust Convictions Act* is a legislative measure introduced to address historical injustices in Canada’s criminal justice system by enabling the **expungement of certain outdated or discriminatory criminal convictions** that are no longer consistent with modern human rights standards—particularly the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

The Act recognizes that certain criminal laws enacted in the past were **outdated, discriminatory, and fundamentally inconsistent with contemporary values of equality, privacy, and individual dignity**, especially regarding sexual conduct between consenting adults of the same sex. It provides a formal, structured process through which individuals can have these convictions legally erased, effectively treating them as if they never occurred.

This is not a general amnesty or blanket pardon. Instead, it is a **targeted, rights-based remedy** focused on specific offences that have been historically used to criminalize consensual same-sex activity, gender-neutral sexual conduct, and other forms of expression that are now protected under Canadian law.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

---

### **1. Purpose and Policy Rationale**

> *“Whereas it is now recognized that the criminalization of certain activities constitutes a historical injustice; and whereas the criminalization of an activity may constitute a historical injustice because, among other things, were it to occur today, it would be inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.”*

- The Act is grounded in the principle that **certain criminal laws from the past were unjust**, particularly those that criminalized consensual same-sex relationships or intimate acts between adults.
- These laws were **inconsistent with current Charter rights**, including:
  - Section 15 (equality rights)
  - Section 7 (life, liberty, and security of the person)
  - Section 13 (freedom of expression and privacy)
- The Act aims to **correct past wrongs** by allowing individuals to have their convictions expunged, thereby restoring dignity and reducing the long-term harm of stigma and discrimination.

---

### **2. Definitions**

- **Board**: Refers to the **Parole Board of Canada**, which is responsible for administering the expungement process.
- **Chairperson**: The Chairperson of the Parole Board, who has oversight authority over the Board’s decisions under this Act.

---

### **3. Scope of Expungement**

The Board may order the **expungement of a conviction** only for offences listed in a **Schedule** (attached to the Act).  
Once expunged, the person is **deemed never to have been convicted** of that offence.

> **Important Note**: Expungement does **not**:
> - Invalidate prior legal consequences (e.g., fines, imprisonment).
> - Remove the record from all institutions.
> - Affect the person's right to apply for a pardon or other forms of relief.
> - Restore rights that were previously denied due to the conviction.

---

### **4. Who Can Apply for Expungement?**

An individual or representative may apply if:
- They were convicted of an offence listed in the Schedule.
- They are deceased, and a representative applies on their behalf (e.g., spouse, child, parent, executor, guardian, etc.).

**Eligible representatives of a deceased person include**:
- Spouse or cohabiting partner (for at least one year)
- Child
- Parent
- Brother or sister
- Guardian, attorney, executor, administrator, or trustee
- Any other person deemed appropriate by the Board

> This ensures that family members and legal representatives can act in the interest of justice and dignity for deceased individuals.

---

### **5. Application Requirements**

An application must:
- Be submitted in the **form and manner** determined by the Board.
- Include **evidence** that specific **criteria** are satisfied (for offences listed in the Schedule).
- If documents cannot be obtained, the applicant must submit a **sworn statement or solemn declaration** explaining:
  - Reasonable efforts made to obtain the documents
  - Reasons they could not be obtained (e.g., lost, destroyed)
  - Affirmation that the evidence still supports the required criteria

> The Act emphasizes **due diligence** and **accountability**, requiring applicants to demonstrate they have made reasonable attempts to gather evidence.

---

### **6. Review Process by the Board**

After receiving an application, the Board:
- Conducts **inquiries** to verify eligibility and assess the application.
- Reviews whether:
  - The **criteria** for expungement are satisfied (e.g., consent, age, availability of a legal defence)
  - The activity in question is **prohibited under current law** (i.e., not a crime today)

> **Key Decision Rules**:
- **If no evidence** is found that the criteria are not met OR that the activity is currently prohibited → **Expungement ORDERED**
- **If evidence** is found that the criteria are not satisfied OR the activity is currently prohibited → **Refusal to expunge**

> This ensures that expungement is only granted when the conviction was based on outdated, unjust laws.

---

### **7. Notification and Record Management**

Upon decision:
- The Board **notifies the applicant in writing**.
- The Board **notifies the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** and any **provincial or municipal court** that holds judicial records of the conviction.
- The **RCMP must destroy or remove** any judicial record of the conviction within a reasonable time.
- Federal departments and agencies must also **destroy or remove** records upon receiving notification from the RCMP.

> This ensures that **records are purged from official systems**, reducing the long-term impact of the conviction on employment, housing, education, and social opportunities.

> **Exception**: Sections 17 to 20 of the *Library and Archives of Canada Act*, *Privacy Act*, and other laws **do not apply** to documents submitted in connection with an application under this Act—meaning records can be removed without violating privacy or archival obligations.

> **Exception to Privacy**: The Board may **disclose information** for investigation or prosecution of **perjury** under section 131 of the *Criminal Code*—a limited exception for accountability.

---

### **8. Amendments and Schedule Updates**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government) may:
  - **Add new offences** to the Schedule if:
    - The activity is **no longer a crime** under current legislation
    - The criminalization of the activity **constitutes a historical injustice**
  - **Establish criteria** for expungement for specific offences

> This allows the law to evolve and respond to changing societal norms and legal developments.

---

### **9. Specific Criteria for Expungement (Items 1–6 of the Schedule)**

For offences involving **same-sex sexual activity**, the following criteria must be satisfied:

| Criterion | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Activity between persons of the same sex** | The act must have been between two individuals of the same gender. |
| **Consent from all participants** | All individuals involved must have given **voluntary, informed agreement** (as defined under section 273.1 of the *Criminal Code*). |
| **Age requirement** | All participants were **16 years or older** at the time of the act, OR the convicted person would have been able to rely on a **defence under section 150.1** of the *Criminal Code* (which protects individuals under 18 from being convicted of sexual offences without consent). |

> **Note**: Section 150.1 was a defence that allowed minors to avoid conviction if they were under 18 and the activity was consensual. Its existence in the past shows that such conduct was not always criminalized—only when it involved minors or lacked consent.

> **Consent Definition**: As per section 273.1 of the *Criminal Code*, consent means **voluntary agreement** to engage in sexual activity.
