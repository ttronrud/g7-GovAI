**Detailed Summary of the *Judges Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Judges Act* is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that governs the appointment, tenure, compensation, retirement, and professional obligations of judges and associate judges across the federal and provincial judicial systems. It establishes standards for judicial eligibility, defines key terms, outlines salary structures, and includes provisions for judicial independence, compensation review, and ongoing professional development. The Act ensures consistency in judicial employment conditions while allowing for provincial variations in judicial structure and retirement policies.

### **5. Salary Adjustments (Annual Increases)**  
Salaries are adjusted annually based on changes in the **Industrial Aggregate** (average weekly wages and salaries in Canada), published by Statistics Canada.

#### **Adjustment Formula**:
- For each 12-month period starting April 1, 2021 and beyond:
  - New salary = (Previous salary) × (Ratio of Industrial Aggregate of First Adjustment Year to Second Adjustment Year)
- The ratio is **capped at 107%** (i.e., maximum increase is 7% per year).
- **First Adjustment Year**: The most recent 12-month period for which data is available on the first day of the new period.
- **Second Adjustment Year**: The 12-month period immediately before the first.

> *Example:* If the Industrial Aggregate increases from $1,000 to $1,070, the salary increases by 7%. If it increases by less than 7%, the salary increases proportionally.

> *Purpose:* Ensures judicial compensation keeps pace with inflation and economic trends while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
