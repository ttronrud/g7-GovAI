The provided text consists of **repeated entries** indicating that a particular provision or section of a legislative act has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Status**: All listed entries state that the provision in question was **repealed in 2002** under **Chapter 7, Section 280** of a legislative act (likely a provincial or federal statute, though the specific jurisdiction is not identified in the text).

- **Number of Entries**: There are **40 identical entries**, each stating the same repeal information. This repetition may be due to a formatting or data-entry error, possibly indicating that the original document or database entry was duplicated or misrendered.

- **Legal Implication**: The repeal means that:
  - The specific section or provision referenced (presumably Section 280 of Chapter 7) is **no longer in force**.
  - Any laws, regulations, or obligations previously derived from that section are **invalid or obsolete**.
  - Legal actions, administrative decisions, or judicial interpretations based on that section are no longer enforceable or binding.

- **Contextual Clues**:
  - The year **2002** and **Chapter 7, Section 280** suggest this is part of a larger legislative framework, possibly related to public administration, land use, or environmental regulation, depending on the jurisdiction.
  - The repeated nature of the entries implies that the repeal was applied broadly or that the original act contained multiple provisions that were similarly repealed.

- **Important Note**: Since the original content of the section (what it regulated, its purpose, or its scope) is **not provided**, the summary cannot describe the *substance* of the repealed provision. Only the *status* (repealed) and *date and legal reference* are known.

### Conclusion:

This list does **not contain a detailed summary of a law or act**—instead, it is a **repeal notice** indicating that a specific section (Section 280 of Chapter 7) of a legislative act was **officially removed and no longer applies** in 2002. Due to the repeated and identical nature of the entries, it appears to be a **technical or data formatting error**, and no substantive legal content or historical context of the repealed section is available in this excerpt.

To provide a meaningful detailed summary, the original text of the section or the full act would be required. As currently presented, the information is **only about the repeal**, not the content of the provision itself.
