**Detailed Summary of the *National Strategy for Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Strategy for Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias Act* is a federal legislative initiative introduced by the Government of Canada to establish a comprehensive, coordinated, and evidence-based national strategy for addressing Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia (collectively referred to as "dementia"). The Act recognizes the growing public health burden of dementia in an aging population and aims to improve outcomes for individuals living with dementia, their families, and caregivers through research, early diagnosis, care coordination, and systemic support.

---

### **Background and Rationale**

The Act begins with a series of "whereas" clauses that establish the urgency and significance of the issue:

- Dementia is a progressive, degenerative brain disease that impairs memory, thinking, behavior, and daily functioning.
- It leads to a loss of independence and ultimately results in death.
- Over **747,000 Canadians** currently live with dementia.
- With Canada’s population aging, the number of people diagnosed with dementia is projected to **double within a generation**.
- Early diagnosis, effective treatment, and robust support systems can improve health outcomes for individuals and reduce the strain on families and caregivers.
- Research, collaboration, and partnerships are essential to developing a cure and improving care.

Given these factors, the Government of Canada commits to developing a **national strategy** in consultation with provincial and territorial health authorities, researchers, caregivers, and advocacy groups.
