**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Yukon Oil and Gas Accord Implementation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–Yukon Oil and Gas Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act") is a federal statute enacted to implement the **Canada–Yukon Oil and Gas Accord**, signed on **May 28, 1993**, between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Yukon Territory. This Accord established a framework for the transfer of oil and gas regulatory authority from federal to territorial control in the Yukon, while preserving key rights and protections for existing federal interests.

The Act provides the legal mechanism for transitioning administrative and regulatory responsibilities over oil and gas operations in the Yukon Territory — ensuring continuity, legal certainty, and equitable treatment of stakeholders — particularly holders of existing federal oil and gas rights.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Citation**
- The Act is formally titled the *Canada–Yukon Oil and Gas Accord Implementation Act*.
- It serves as the legislative foundation for implementing the Canada–Yukon Oil and Gas Accord by enabling the transfer of control over oil and gas activities from federal to territorial jurisdiction.

---

#### **2. Definitions and Key Terms**

Several key definitions are established to ensure clarity and consistency in application:

- **Existing Federal Interest**:  
  Refers to:
  - An interest under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* (C.P.R.A.) in oil and gas within the Yukon Territory or its adjoining area, as it existed on the **transfer date**; or  
  - A production licence issued on or after the transfer date under the C.P.R.A. (i.e., new licences issued post-transfer that are treated as part of the existing framework).

- **Transfer Date**:  
  Defined as the effective date of the **first Governor in Council order** under **section 47.1 of the Yukon Act** (as amended by this Act), which transfers administration and control of oil and gas operations to the **Commissioner of the Yukon Territory**.  
  → This date is critical because it marks the point at which territorial jurisdiction takes over.

- **Adjoining Area**:  
  As defined in section 2 of the Yukon Act prior to this Act’s coming into force.

- **Gas, Oil, Oil and Gas Interest, Territorial Oil and Gas Minister, Yukon Oil and Gas Laws**:  
  These terms have the same meaning as in the original Yukon Act, prior to the coming into force of this section.

---

#### **3. Continuity of Existing Federal Interests**

- **Preservation of Rights**:  
  Every existing federal interest (e.g., exploration, discovery, production licences, leases) remains valid **on and after the transfer date** until:
  - It expires;
  - It is cancelled;
  - It is surrendered by the holder;
  - Or otherwise agreed to by the holder and the **Territorial Oil and Gas Minister**.

- **No Diminishment or Reduction of Rights**:  
  After the transfer date, Yukon oil and gas laws apply to existing federal interests, **except** that:
  - Rights under those interests **cannot be diminished**;
  - The **term of the interest cannot be reduced**.

> This provision protects holders of federal interests from having their rights eroded or shortened due to new territorial rules.

---

#### **4. Application of Yukon Oil and Gas Laws**

- **General Application**:  
  Yukon oil and gas laws apply to all existing federal interests **on and after the transfer date**, with the exception of the two prohibitions noted above (no diminishment or reduction of rights or terms).

- **Special Provisions for Different Types of Licences**:

| Type of Interest | Rights Protected |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Exploration Licence** | - Rights under paragraphs 22(a) and (b) of the C.P.R.A. (exploration rights);<br>- In lieu of paragraph 22(c), the exclusive right to obtain **production rights** in areas determined by Yukon laws to be commercially producible. |
| **Significant Discovery Licence** | - Rights under paragraphs 29(a) and (b) (excluding areas where no sustained production is possible);<br>- In lieu of paragraph 29(c), the exclusive right to obtain production rights in areas deemed commercially viable. |
| **Production Licence** | - Rights under subsection 37(1) of C.P.R.A. (production rights);<br>- Right to extend the licence term under subsection 41(3). |
| **Lease (under C.R.C. c. 1518)** | - Rights under section 58 of the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* (as of transfer date);<br>- Right to reissue the lease under section 63 (as of transfer date). |

> These provisions ensure that federal licence holders retain the same core rights as before, but now subject to Yukon’s regulatory framework for commercial production.

---

#### **5. Obligation to Mirror Provisions in Yukon Laws**

- Yukon oil and gas laws must **include corresponding provisions** to the ones in this Act **as long as any existing federal interest remains in effect**.  
→ Ensures legal consistency and prevents gaps in rights or obligations.

---

#### **6. Access to Surface Lands and Dispute Resolution**

- If Yukon oil and gas laws grant a **right of access** to surface lands for exploration or production, and if disputes arise between:
  - A person with a right of access and
  - A third party (non-governmental) with surface rights,

  → The dispute must be resolved by **access orders** issued by the **Yukon Surface Rights Board**, under the *Yukon Surface Rights Board Act*.

> This ensures a clear, transparent, and legally binding process for resolving surface access conflicts.

---

#### **7. Withdrawn Lands**

- Lands that were **withdrawn from disposition** under the *Territorial Lands Act* before the transfer date:
  - **Cannot** have new oil and gas interests granted under Yukon oil and gas laws;
  - For the **same purposes** and **under the same conditions**;
  - As long as those lands remain withdrawn.

> This preserves the original intent of land withdrawal and prevents new development on restricted lands.

---

#### **8. Pending Applications and Declarations**

- **Applications not disposed of before the transfer date**:
  - Must be **disposed of in accordance with the Canada Petroleum Resources Act** as if the Act continued to apply after the transfer date.

- **Commercial Discovery Declarations**:
  - If a declaration of commercial discovery was made **before the transfer date** and is still in effect, or is made **after** the transfer date (by virtue of the Act), in relation to lands previously subject to an existing federal interest:
    - The owner of that interest may apply for a **production licence** within **30 days after the transfer date or after the declaration**, whichever is later.
    - Such applications will be processed **as if the C.P.R.A. continued to apply** after the transfer date.

> This provides a clear and timely pathway for licence holders to transition from discovery to production.

- **Applications under Section 65 of the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act**:
  - If an application was made before the transfer date for a mineral right with a right of access under subsection 5.01(1) of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*, it shall be disposed of **as if section 65 continued to apply** after the transfer date.

> This preserves access rights and ensures continuity in surface rights processes.

---

#### **9. Indemnity Provisions**

These provisions protect both governments from financial liability arising from the transfer of authority and operation of laws:

- **Yukon Government Indemnifies Canada**:  
  Against any claim, action, or proceeding for damages arising from **acts or omissions of the Yukon Government** in the operation of Yukon oil and gas laws **on and after the transfer date**.

- **Canada Government Indemnifies Yukon**:  
  Against any claim arising from **the operation of**:
  - The *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*;
  - The *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*;
  - *Part II.1 of the National Energy Board Act*  
  **before the transfer date**.

> These indemnities are critical for managing risk during the transition and ensuring both governments can operate without fear of litigation over pre-existing regulatory actions.

- **Exclusion Clause**:  
  A government **cannot claim indemnity** if it has **settled a claim without the prior approval** of the other government.

> This prevents unilateral settlements that could undermine the balance of power or create inconsistencies.

---

#### **10. Public Notification**

- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** is responsible for publishing **notice of the transfer date** in the *Canada Gazette*.

> Ensures transparency and public awareness of the transfer of authority.

---

#### **11. Flexibility in Yukon Law Development**

- Yukon oil and gas laws **may be made at any time after this Act comes into force**, even though the C.P.R.A. and *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* were previously in force in the territory until the transfer date.
- However, these laws **have no effect before the transfer date**.

> This allows the Yukon Legislature to develop and adopt modern, locally appropriate oil and gas regulations, without retroactive application.

---

#### **12. Interpretation of "Yukon Oil and Gas Laws"**

- In sections 20, 21, 22, and 25, references to "Yukon oil and gas laws" are to be interpreted
