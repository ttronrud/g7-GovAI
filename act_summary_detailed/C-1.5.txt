**Detailed Summary of the *Canada-Brazil Income Tax Convention Act, 1984* (Part)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Canada-Brazil Income Tax Convention Act, 1984* establishes the legal framework in Canada for implementing the **Canada-Brazil Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income**, which was signed on December 23, 1985 (as amended by a Protocol). This Act ensures that income earned by individuals and enterprises in either country is taxed only once, and that tax rules are harmonized to prevent double taxation and avoid unjust tax burdens.

The Convention is a bilateral agreement designed to promote trade, investment, and economic cooperation between Canada and Brazil by clarifying the tax treatment of income derived from activities in either country.

### **7. Determination of Residency**
This is a critical rule for determining where income is taxed.

#### **For Individuals:**
An individual is deemed a resident of a Contracting State based on the following hierarchy:

1. **Permanent home** – If available, the individual is a resident of the country where they have a permanent home.
2. **Centre of vital interests** – If permanent homes are in both countries, the individual is a resident of the country with which their personal and economic ties are closest.
3. **Habitual abode** – If no permanent home exists, the individual is a resident of the country where they have an habitual abode.
4. **Nationality** – If no habitual abode, the individual is a resident of the country of which they are a national.
5. **Mutual agreement** – If both countries are involved in nationality or residency, the competent authorities must resolve the issue by mutual agreement.

#### **For Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, partnerships):**
- If a company is a resident of both countries, the competent authorities must **resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.

> This ensures that residency is determined fairly and avoids double taxation.

- An insurance company from one country is deemed to have a PE in the other country **if it receives premiums or insures risks** through a representative (not an independent agent).
