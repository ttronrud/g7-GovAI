**Detailed Summary of the *Yukon Surface Rights Board Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Yukon Surface Rights Board Act* establishes the **Yukon Surface Rights Board (the "Board")**, a statutory body tasked with resolving disputes over surface rights on land in the Yukon Territory—particularly in relation to land claims, traditional use, development, and expropriation for infrastructure such as hydroelectric or water storage facilities. The Act is designed to balance the rights of Indigenous peoples, particularly First Nations, with the needs of development projects and government interests, while ensuring fair, transparent, and culturally sensitive processes.

The Act operates within a broader framework of land claims agreements and Indigenous self-government arrangements, especially those involving the **Gwich’in people** and other Yukon First Nations.

### **2. Special Application to Tetlit Gwich’in Yukon Land**

This Act contains a **special provision** applying to land within the **primary use area** of the Transboundary Agreement (Annex A), specifically concerning **Tetlit Gwich’in Yukon land** (Annex B):

#### **Key Provisions:**
- **Section 3 (Special Application Clause):**
  - The Act applies **as if**:
    - References to settlement land, category B land, fee simple land, and undeveloped land refer to **Tetlit Gwich’in Yukon land**.
    - References to "Yukon First Nation" refer to the **Gwich’in Tribal Council**.
    - References to "Yukon Indian person" refer to **Tetlit Gwich’in**.
    - References to "traditional territory" refer to the **primary use area**.
- **Exclusions from Other Provisions:**
  - Subsection 31(1), sections 58 and 63, and paragraphs 1(g) and 2(1)(f) of Schedule II **do not apply** to Tetlit Gwich’in land.
- **Hearing Location:**
  - Applications involving Tetlit Gwich’in land shall be heard in **Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories**, unless the parties agree otherwise.

#### **Expropriation Restrictions (Section 55):**
When the Board issues an order for expropriation of Tetlit Gwich’in land for a **hydro-electric or water storage facility**, the following rules apply:
1. **Cultural value is not considered** in determining compensation or in the expropriation process.
2. **Compensation for improvements** to Tetlit Gwich’in land (including compensation for any land provided as compensation) **must not exceed 3% of the total cost of construction** of the facility.
3. **Transfer of land to Gwich’in Tribal Council**:
   - If land is transferred to the Gwich’in Tribal Council as compensation, it **automatically becomes Tetlit Gwich’in Yukon land** upon transfer.

> This provision reflects a **proportionality and equity-based approach**, ensuring that compensation is limited and that cultural values are not factored into financial calculations—though it does not negate the importance of cultural impacts in broader planning.

### **3. Conflict Resolution: Agreements Prevail Over the Act**

The Act recognizes that **final agreements and the Transboundary Agreement take precedence** over the Act in cases of inconsistency or conflict:

- **Final Agreement > This Act** (to the extent of conflict)
- **Transboundary Agreement > This Act** (to the extent of conflict)
- **Government regulatory requirements > Board access orders** (if a conflict arises between a Board order and a federal or territorial regulation or license)

This ensures that **Indigenous rights and self-governance arrangements are legally superior** to general statutory provisions, reinforcing Indigenous sovereignty.
