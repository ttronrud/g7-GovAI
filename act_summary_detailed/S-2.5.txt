**Detailed Summary of the St. Peter’s Reserve Act (1915)**

---

### **Background and Context**

The *St. Peter’s Reserve Act* was enacted in 1915 by the Government of Canada in response to a legal dispute concerning the validity of land transactions involving the **St. Peter’s Indian Reserve**, located in the **County of Selkirk, Province of Manitoba**.

- On **October 17, 1914**, an information was filed in the **Exchequer Court of Canada** on behalf of **His Majesty the King**, asserting that:
  - A release or surrender of the St. Peter’s Indian Reserve, dated **September 24, 1907**, was **invalid and void**.
  - All **patents** (government land grants) issued for lands within the reserve, as well as certain **sales of land** from the reserve, were also **void and of no legal effect**.

This legal challenge threatened to invalidate decades of land ownership and transactions tied to the reserve, which had significant implications for Indigenous rights and land tenure.

However, after review and negotiation, **His Majesty (the King)** ultimately **consented to confirm and make good** (i.e., validate and restore) certain patents and land sales, **subject to specific conditions**.

---

### **Enactment and Title**

- The Act was passed by and with the **advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada**.
- It is officially titled: **The St. Peter’s Reserve Act**.

---

### **Main Provisions**

#### **1. Confirmation and Validation of Patents and Sales**

The Act confirms and validates (i.e., legally recognizes) certain land patents and sales related to the St. Peter’s Reserve **under the following conditions**:

---

#### **Condition 1: Lands Unsold and Held by Patentees as of June 1, 1915**

- Any land that:
  - Was included in a patent issued by His Majesty,
  - Was **not sold** (i.e., remained unsold),
  - And was **held by the Indian patentee** on **June 1, 1915**,

→ **is confirmed and made good** (i.e., legally recognized and protected).

> This provision protects Indigenous landowners who had valid patents but whose land had not been sold, ensuring their rights are preserved.

---

#### **Condition 2: Payment of a One-Dollar Fee per Acre with Interest**

- For any land that **was sold** or involved in a transaction:
  - If the **additional sum of one dollar per acre** (for each acre of land in the patent or sale), **plus five percent annual interest** from **June 1, 1915**, until full payment, has been:
    - **Paid in full**, or
    - **Is being paid**, 

→ Then the patent or sale is **confirmed and made good**.

> This serves as a financial compensation mechanism to the Crown (His Majesty) for the revalidation of land rights.

> Example: For a 100-acre parcel, the total fee would be $100 plus interest at 5% per annum from June 1, 1915.

---

#### **Condition 3: Creation of a Lien (Security Interest) for Payment**

- If the owner **does not pay the one-dollar-per-acre fee** directly, they may instead:
  - Create a **first lien** (a legal charge) on the land,
  - Subject only to **taxes**,
  - For the amount of **one dollar per acre**, payable in **five equal annual instalments**,
  - With **interest at 5% per annum** from June 1, 1915.

##### Key Details of the Lien:
- **First instalment due on June 1, 1916** (one year after the Act's coming into force).
- The lien must be **recorded** in the land registry by:
  - An **endorsement** on the Certificate of Title, or
  - A **caveat** (a legal notice of claim) in the Land Titles Office.
- The lien remains enforceable for **five years**.
- The owner may **pay the entire lien in full at any time during the five-year period**, including interest up to the date of payment.
- A **Certificate from the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs** confirming that the lien has been paid and satisfied serves as a **valid discharge** of the lien.

> This provision provides a structured, legally enforceable alternative to direct cash payment, allowing landowners to fulfill their obligations over time.

### **Effective Date**

- The Act **came into force on June 1, 1915**.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

This Act represents a **compromise** between:
- The Crown’s interest in asserting control over land titles,
- The need to **validate existing land rights** of Indigenous communities,
- And the **financial obligations** of the Crown in relation to land sales and patents.

It effectively:
- **Restores legal validity** to certain land patents and sales that were challenged in court,
- Provides **flexible payment options** (cash or lien) to ensure compliance,
- Protects **Indigenous landowners** who had valid holdings,
- Maintains the **Crown’s financial interest** through a fee structure,
- Avoids outright invalidation of long-standing land transactions.

---

### **Key Legal and Historical Implications**

- **Land Rights and Indigenous Title**: While the Act confirms certain patents, it does so under conditions that reflect the colonial-era legal framework where Indigenous land rights were often subject to Crown approval and financial compensation.
- **Crown Sovereignty**: The Act reinforces the Crown’s authority to validate or invalidate land transactions, even in areas of Indigenous reserve.
- **Financial Mechanism**: The one-dollar-per-acre fee (with interest) is symbolic but serves as a financial tool to ensure Crown revenue from land revalidation.
- **Lien as a Tool**: The creation of a lien allows for a more accessible, long-term payment method, particularly for landowners who may not have immediate cash access.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *St. Peter’s Reserve Act, 1915* is a historically significant piece of legislation that resolves a major legal dispute over land validity in Manitoba. It balances the interests of the Crown with those of Indigenous landowners by:

- Confirming the validity of certain land patents and sales,
- Providing flexible payment options (cash or lien),
- Establishing clear timelines and legal procedures for enforcement,
- And ensuring that the Crown’s financial interests are protected.

While it reflects the legal and administrative practices of early 20th-century Canada, it also highlights the complex intersection of Indigenous land rights, colonial governance, and legal reform.

**Note**: This Act is a product of its time and should be read in the context of broader patterns of land dispossession, Indigenous land rights, and the evolution of federal Indian policy in Canada. Modern interpretations of Indigenous land rights would likely emphasize self-determination, treaty rights, and full recognition of title, rather than conditional validation based on financial compensation.
