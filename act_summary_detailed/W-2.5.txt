### **Detailed Summary of the War Service Grants Act**

The **War Service Grants Act** is a Canadian legislative framework established to provide financial support to members of the Canadian Armed Forces (naval, army, or air forces) who served during the Second World War (commencing in September 1939) and to their dependents upon discharge or death. The Act establishes two primary forms of compensation: **war service gratuity** and **re-establishment credit**, both designed to assist veterans in transitioning back to civilian life and supporting their families.

## **II. War Service Gratuity (Primary Benefit)**

### **1. General Entitlement**
Every member of the forces who served during the war (from September 1939) is entitled upon discharge to a **war service gratuity** calculated as follows:

- **Base Rate**: $7.50 for every completed **30-day period** of active service.
- **Additional Overseas Service Bonus**: +$0.25 for **each day of overseas service** within those 30-day periods.

> Example: A member with 120 days of service (4 periods of 30 days) and 60 days of overseas service would receive:
> - 4 × $7.50 = $30.00
> - 60 × $0.25 = $15.00  
> Total gratuity = **$45.00**

### **2. Overseas Service Payment (Pro Rata)**
In addition to the base gratuity, members with **overseas service** are entitled to a **separate payment** for each period of **183 days** of overseas service (or proportionally less):

- Amount: Based on **7 days of pay and allowances** that were payable to the member at the date of discharge.

> This ensures recognition of the greater hardship and cost of overseas service.

### **3. Special Rules for Service Before or After Key Dates**

#### **a) Members Joining Permanent Forces on or Before March 31, 1946**
- The gratuity under the overseas service clause is computed using **rates of pay and allowances at the start of their service**, excluding those reduced by section 4.

#### **b) Members Who Accept Lower Rates Due to Reversion or Appointment**
- If a member was required to accept lower pay or allowances due to reversion in rank or special assignment, **the rates prior to joining** the permanent forces or special service period are used for computation.

#### **c) Members Posted for Discharge**
- If a member is posted from an establishment for discharge and their pay is reduced, the **pre-posting pay and allowances** are used for calculation.

### **4. What Counts as Overseas Service**
- **Commences**: On the day the member is posted to an overseas unit, ship, or establishment.
- **Ends**: On the day they are taken off strength from overseas.
- **Temporary Duty Overseas**: Counts as overseas service, beginning on departure from parent unit and ending on return.

> For naval personnel, dates are determined by the **certificate of service** and **official appointment list**.

### **5. Exclusion of Service After March 31, 1946**
No gratuity or credit is payable for service **after** the following dates:

- If a member joins the **permanent naval, army, or regular air force after March 31, 1946**.
- If the member is already serving in a permanent force on March 31, 1946.
- If a volunteer joins a special period of service **after September 30, 1947**, **unless**:
  - They were on overseas service on **August 31, 1945**, and
  - Remained continuously on overseas service until discharge.

> This effectively limits eligibility to those who served primarily during the war years.

### **6. Full Eligibility for All Full-Time Service**
Members who **do not join** the permanent forces or special service periods after March 31, 1946, are entitled to gratuity for **all their full-time service**.

---

## **III. Payment of Gratuity to Deceased Members**

If a member dies **on active service or after discharge but before full gratuity is paid**, the gratuity (or unpaid balance) is paid to:

1. A person who was **already receiving or eligible** for dependants’ allowance immediately before death/discharge.
2. A person who **would have been eligible** for dependants’ allowance had they not been in the forces.
3. A person who was **dependent on the deceased** and had a pay assignment from them.

> The Minister may:
> - Direct payment to **one person** or **divide it among several**.
> - Authorize a third party (e.g., a legal representative) to receive and manage the payment for the benefit of the entitled person.

### **If No Qualifying Person Exists**
The unpaid gratuity becomes part of the **deceased member’s service estate**, as defined in subsection 39(2) of the National Defence Act.

### **If the Recipient Dies Before Full Payment**
The gratuity is **not paid to the estate** of the deceased recipient. Instead:
- It is paid to another entitled person under the Act.
- If no other person is entitled, it becomes part of the **deceased member’s service estate**.

---

## **IV. Deductions from Gratuity**

Certain overpayments may be deducted from the gratuity:

### **A. Overpayments of Pay and Allowances (excluding dependants’ allowance)**
- Pay or allowances issued at rates **exceeding authorized financial regulations**.
- Pay or allowances issued **without authorization** based on the member’s status.
- Unaccounted **advances of travel allowances**.

### **B. Overpayments of Dependants’ Allowances**
- Overpayments due to **wilful misrepresentation or fraud** by the member or dependant.
- Confirmed by a **finding of the Judge Advocate General**.

### **C. Other Authorizations**
- The Governor in Council may authorize deductions for other payments made to the member or dependants.

> Any amount **reimbursed by a third party** (e.g., a government or insurer) to the member or dependant is **returned to that third party**.

> **Note**: Section 157 of the Financial Administration Act does **not apply** to war service gratuity — meaning no administrative or accounting restrictions apply.

---

## **V. Payment Schedule and Method**

- Gratuity is paid in **monthly instalments in arrears**.
- The maximum instalment is equal to the **30-day average of pay and allowances** paid immediately before discharge.
- **Exception**: If a member is posted for discharge and pay is reduced, the instalment is capped at the **pre-posting pay and allowances**, including:
  - For naval members: lodging and provision allowance.
  - For army/air force members: subsistence allowance at standard Canadian rates (even if not received at discharge).

> The 30-day average is calculated as:
> (Daily rate on the last day of the period) × 30 days.
