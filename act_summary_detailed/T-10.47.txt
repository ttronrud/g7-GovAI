### **Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, 1929**

The **Manitoba Natural Resources Act, 1929** is a foundational piece of legislation in Canadian provincial–federal relations, particularly concerning the transfer of control over natural resources from the federal government to the Province of Manitoba. It was enacted on **December 14, 1929**, and formally establishes the Province of Manitoba as having **full administrative control** over its Crown lands, mines, minerals, water rights, and related revenues—subject to certain conditions and exceptions.

This Act is not merely a transfer of property; it is a **constitutional and financial realignment** designed to ensure that Manitoba, as one of the original provinces of Confederation, is treated on **equal footing** with the other provinces in terms of control over its natural resources. Below is a comprehensive, structured summary of its key provisions and their significance.

---

## **1. Purpose and Background**

### **Core Objective**
To place Manitoba on **equal footing with the original provinces** of Confederation (established in 1867) in terms of **administration and control of natural resources**, as mandated by **Section 109 of the British North America Act, 1867**.

### **Historical Context**
- **Section 30 of the Manitoba Act (1870)** originally vested all ungranted or "waste" lands in the Crown and placed them under **federal administration** due to the surrender of Rupert’s Land by the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC).
- Over time, Manitoba’s boundaries were expanded via legislation (44 Victoria, c.14; 2 George V, c.32), increasing the area under federal control.
- In **1928**, an **Order in Council** (approved August 1, 1928) directed that Manitoba should be placed on **equal footing** with other provinces in managing its natural resources.
- A **three-member Commission** (Turgeon, Crerar, Bowman) was appointed to assess financial adjustments needed to achieve this equity.
- The Commission’s report was accepted by both governments, paving the way for this Act.

> **Key Principle**: The federal government will transfer control of natural resources to Manitoba to ensure **provincial autonomy and economic parity** with other provinces.
