**Detailed Summary of the Translation Bureau Act**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The Act is formally titled the *Translation Bureau Act* and may be cited as such. This designation establishes the legal identity and reference point for the legislation.

---

**2. Definition of Key Term: "Minister"**  
The term *Minister* is defined as the member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada who is officially designated by the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) as the Minister responsible for the administration and oversight of the Translation Bureau. This ensures that a specific, accountable official is designated to lead the Bureau and to represent it in governmental operations.

---

**3. Establishment of the Translation Bureau**  
The Act establishes the *Translation Bureau* as a formal government entity operating under the authority and direction of the Minister. This creates a dedicated, centralized body tasked with managing all aspects of official translation and interpretation in Canada.

---

**4. Mandate and Scope of the Bureau**  
The Bureau has a broad mandate to:

- **Collaborate with and act on behalf of** all federal departments, boards, agencies, and commissions established by Acts of Parliament or appointed by order of the Governor in Council.  
- **Collaborate with both Houses of Parliament** (the House of Commons and the Senate) in all matters involving:
  - **Translation**: The preparation, revision, and production of translations from one official language (e.g., English to French or vice versa) into the other official language(s) of Canada.
  - **Translation of key documents**, including:
    - Correspondence
    - Reports
    - Proceedings (e.g., parliamentary sessions)
    - Debates
    - Bills
    - Acts of Parliament
  - **Interpretation services**, including:
    - Real-time spoken interpretation (e.g., during parliamentary debates or official meetings)
    - Sign-language interpretation (ensuring accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals)
  - **Terminology development and standardization** to ensure consistency and accuracy across official documents and communications.

This mandate emphasizes the Bureau’s role in promoting **bilingualism** and **equity** in government operations, ensuring that all official communications are accessible to citizens regardless of language.

**5. Obligation of Federal Entities**  
All departments, boards, agencies, and commissions referred to in Section 3 are required to **collaborate with the Translation Bureau** in implementing this Act and the regulations made under it. This ensures that translation and interpretation services are not siloed or duplicated across government bodies but are instead coordinated and standardized through the Bureau.

---

**6. Staffing and Employment**  
The Bureau may appoint officers, translators, clerks, or other employees who are necessary for its operations. These appointments are made under the *Public Service Employment Act*, which governs the hiring and management of federal public servants. Employees serve at the *discretion of the Minister* (i.e., during "pleasure"), meaning they can be removed at any time without cause, consistent with public service norms.

This provision ensures flexibility in staffing while maintaining accountability and adherence to public service employment standards.

---

**7. Regulatory Authority**  
The Minister is empowered, with the **approval of the Governor in Council**, to make regulations necessary or expedient for carrying out the purposes of this Act. These regulations may cover:
- Procedures for translation and interpretation
- Standards for quality and terminology
- Guidelines for staff conduct and performance
- Rules governing access to documents or services
- Administrative or financial arrangements

This regulatory power allows the Bureau to adapt to evolving needs, technological advances, and changing government priorities while remaining within the legal framework of the Act.

---

**8. Repeal Note (Historical Context)**  
Section 4, which originally contained a provision about the Bureau’s authority to issue translations for certain purposes, was **repealed in 1996** (under *c. 16, s. 58*). This reflects a revision in the legislative framework, likely to streamline or modernize the Bureau’s role. The repeal indicates that the current version of the Act is a more focused and updated version of earlier provisions.

**Key Objectives and Implications of the Act**

- **Promotes Bilingualism**: Ensures that all federal government communications are available in both official languages (English and French), in accordance with Canada’s constitutional commitment to bilingualism.
- **Enhances Access and Equity**: Provides accessible interpretation services, especially for individuals who are deaf or who speak a minority language.
- **Improves Efficiency and Consistency**: Centralizes translation and terminology work, reducing duplication and ensuring standardized language use across government.
- **Supports Democratic Participation**: Enables Parliament and public institutions to operate effectively in both official languages, supporting equal participation of all Canadians.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Translation Bureau Act* establishes a vital governmental institution designed to uphold Canada’s bilingual character and ensure equitable access to public information and services. By creating a centralized, authoritative body responsible for translation, interpretation, and terminology, the Act strengthens the integrity, accessibility, and inclusivity of federal governance. While relatively concise, the Act provides a robust legal foundation for the Bureau’s operations, with clear roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms for adaptation through regulation.
