#### **6. Principles Guiding Regulation and Supervision**

Despite the benefits of regulation, the Office must operate with the following **key principles**:

- **Board Responsibility**: Boards of directors are ultimately responsible for managing financial institutions. Supervision must respect this accountability.
- **Competitive Environment**: Financial institutions must be allowed to operate effectively and take reasonable risks in a competitive market.
- **Inherent Risk of Failure**: Financial institutions can face financial difficulties and fail—even with regulation. Supervision must balance oversight with operational flexibility.
- **Administrator Responsibility**: Pension plan administrators are responsible for managing plan assets and funding. Supervision must not override this responsibility.
- **Funding Difficulties**: Pension plans can face funding shortfalls, leading to reduced benefits. Supervision must be realistic and proportionate.

> These principles ensure that regulation does not stifle innovation or competitiveness while still protecting public interests.
