**Detailed Summary of the *Public Service Employment Act***  
*(Citation: Public Service Employment Act)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) is a foundational piece of federal legislation in Canada that establishes the framework for the appointment, management, accountability, and equity within the federal public service. Enacted to uphold core values such as **merit, non-partisanship, excellence, diversity, integrity, and linguistic duality**, the Act ensures that the public service remains a trusted, inclusive, and effective institution that serves all Canadians — regardless of background or language preference.

The Act reinforces the role of the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** as the central body responsible for overseeing appointments, managing equity, ensuring transparency, and maintaining accountability across the federal public service.

## **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Merit and Non-Partisanship**  
   The public service must operate on the principle of merit — individuals are selected based on qualifications, skills, and experience — and remain free from political influence. This ensures continuity and impartiality regardless of changes in government.

2. **Excellence and Diversity**  
   The public service must strive for excellence in service delivery and reflect the diversity of Canada’s population, including gender, race, Indigenous status, disability, sexual orientation, and language (both English and French).

3. **Integrity and Accountability**  
   Public servants are expected to serve with integrity and in accordance with their official language of choice. The Act emphasizes accountability at all levels — from individual managers to the Commission and ultimately to Parliament.

4. **Inclusive and Equitable Practices**  
   The Act promotes fair, transparent employment practices and includes specific protections for **equity-seeking groups** — individuals disadvantaged due to prohibited grounds of discrimination under the *Canadian Human Rights Act*.

5. **Flexibility and Responsiveness**  
   While maintaining accountability, the Act allows for flexibility in staffing and management, empowering public service leaders to make decisions that lead to results for Canadians.
