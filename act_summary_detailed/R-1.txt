**Detailed Summary of the *Radiation Emitting Devices Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Radiation Emitting Devices Act* (REDA) is a Canadian federal statute designed to regulate the **safety, labelling, packaging, advertising, and distribution** of devices that emit radiation. The Act ensures that such devices do not pose a risk to public health or safety by preventing false or misleading claims about their performance, design, or safety. It establishes a comprehensive framework for oversight, enforcement, and accountability involving manufacturers, distributors, importers, and regulators.

The Act applies to any device that emits radiation—whether electromagnetic or acoustic—and includes components or accessories of such devices. However, it explicitly excludes certain types of devices, such as those used for nuclear energy production and motor vehicles.

## **Exclusions from the Act**

The Act does **not apply** to:
1. Devices designed **primarily for nuclear energy production** (covered under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*).
2. **Motor vehicles** (covered under the *Motor Vehicle Safety Act*).

These exclusions ensure that specialized regulatory regimes for nuclear safety and vehicle safety remain distinct and separate.

## **Prohibited Actions (Prohibitions under Section 1)**

No person may **sell, lease, or import** a radiation-emitting device into Canada if:
- It **fails to comply** with standards prescribed by regulation (e.g., performance, safety, emissions), or  
- It **creates a risk** to individuals of:
  - Genetic injury,
  - Personal injury,
  - Impairment of health, or
  - Death from radiation due to:
    - Failure to perform as claimed,
    - Failure to accomplish its intended purpose, or
    - Emission of unnecessary radiation.

> This means that even if a device works well in theory, if it emits radiation beyond what is necessary to achieve its function, it is prohibited.

---

## **Prohibitions on Labelling, Packaging, and Advertising (Section 2)**

No person may:
- Label, package, or advertise a radiation-emitting device in a way that is:
  - False,
  - Misleading,
  - Deceptive, or
  - Likely to create an erroneous impression regarding:
    - Design,
    - Construction,
    - Performance,
    - Intended use,
    - Character,
    - Value,
    - Composition,
    - Merit,
    - Safety.

> This provision protects consumers from deceptive marketing and ensures transparency in product claims.

> **Note**: Section 2 applies **only to representations about radiation emissions**—not general product features unrelated to radiation.

---

## **Compliance and Notification Obligations (Section 3)**

All persons must comply with regulations governing:
- Labelling,
- Packaging,
- Advertising.

Failure to comply constitutes a violation.

---

## **Manufacturer/Importer Notification Duty (Section 4)**

If a manufacturer or importer becomes aware **after the device has left their premises** that:
- The device does **not comply** with prescribed standards, or  
- It **creates a risk** to individuals due to:
  - Poor performance,
  - Failure to meet claims,
  - Unnecessary radiation emissions,

They must **immediately notify the Minister of Health**.

---

## **Minister’s Enforcement Powers (Section 5)**

If the Minister determines—through notification or independent investigation—that a device violates the Act:
- The manufacturer or importer must **notify affected persons** (as directed by the Minister), including:
  - Method of notification,
  - Details of the defect or non-compliance,
  - Timeframe for delivery.

This enables timely public warnings and corrective actions.

---

## **Inspector Powers (Section 6–8)**

The Minister may designate individuals as **inspectors** with powers to:
- Enter premises of manufacturers, distributors, or importers where radiation-emitting devices are believed to be located.
- Examine devices, open packages, and take them away for further inspection.
- Access and copy relevant records (e.g., test data, shipping documents, reports).

### **Entry into Dwelling-Houses (Section 8(2))**
- Inspectors **cannot enter private dwellings without consent**.
- An exception exists if a **justice of the peace issues a warrant** based on sworn evidence that entry is justified.

### **Duty of Cooperation**
- Owners or persons in charge of premises must provide **reasonable assistance** and information to inspectors.

### **Detention of Devices**
- An inspector may detain a device if it is suspected of non-compliance.
- Detention ends **if the inspector determines compliance with the Act and regulations has been achieved**.

> The device is released only when it is confirmed to meet safety and performance standards.

---

## **Prohibition on Obstruction (Section 9)**

No person may:
- Obstruct or hinder an inspector,
- Make false or misleading statements orally or in writing to an inspector during an inspection.

Violations are criminal offenses.

---

## **Seizure of Devices (Section 10)**

An inspector may **seize** a radiation-emitting device if they have **reasonable grounds** to believe:
