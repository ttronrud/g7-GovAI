**Detailed Summary of the *Digital Services Tax Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Digital Services Tax Act* (DSTA) is a Canadian legislative framework designed to impose a **digital services tax** on certain foreign digital service providers that generate significant revenue from Canadian users. The Act targets companies that derive substantial income from digital platforms—such as online marketplaces, social media, targeted advertising, and user data—by assessing their **Canadian digital services revenue** and applying a **3% tax** when specific thresholds are met.

This Act is intended to ensure that digital companies that profit from Canadian users—particularly through data collection, advertising, and platform access—contribute fairly to the Canadian tax base, even if they are headquartered abroad.

## **II. Revenue Determination Rules**

### **General Rule**
Revenue is determined using acceptable accounting principles:
- If the taxpayer prepares consolidated financial statements → use those principles.
- If not → use **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)**.

### **Currency Conversion Rules**
- If revenue is in a currency other than the threshold currency (e.g., USD vs. CAD), convert using a rate acceptable to the Minister.
- For fiscal years shorter than 12 months, adjust the global revenue threshold using a daily rate:
  $$
  \text{Adjusted Threshold} = \left(\frac{\text{Global Revenue Threshold}}{365}\right) \times \text{Number of Days in Fiscal Year}
  $$

> This ensures the tax is applied fairly across different fiscal calendar lengths.

---

## **III. Tax Liability (Section 10)**

A taxpayer must pay a **3% tax** on its **taxable Canadian digital services revenue** in a calendar year **(except the first year of application)** if **any one** of the following conditions is met:

### **Conditions for Tax Liability:**
1. **Total Revenue Threshold**  
   The taxpayer had total revenue ≥ **global revenue threshold** during a fiscal year ending in the **immediately preceding calendar year**.

2. **Group Revenue Threshold**  
   The taxpayer was a **constituent entity** of a consolidated group that had total consolidated group revenue ≥ **global revenue threshold** during a fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year.

3. **Current Group Revenue Threshold**  
   The taxpayer is currently a constituent entity of a consolidated group that had total consolidated group revenue ≥ **global revenue threshold** during a fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year.

### **AND** at least one of the following must also be true:
- The taxpayer’s **Canadian digital services revenue** > **in-scope revenue threshold**; OR  
- The **sum of Canadian digital services revenue** from all constituent entities in the group during the calendar year > **in-scope revenue threshold**.

> The "in-scope revenue threshold" applies to specific revenue streams (e.g., advertising, user data), ensuring the tax targets actual Canadian digital services income.

---

## **IV. First Year of Application (Special Rules)**

For the first year the Act comes into force, the tax is applied differently:

- If the taxpayer meets the conditions in Section 10(1)(a) and (b):
  - Tax = **3% of taxable Canadian digital services revenue** for that year.
- Otherwise:
  - Tax = **nil**.

Additionally, the Act allows for a **transition election** for years *before* the first year of application:

> A taxpayer may elect (by filing on or before June 30 of the year following the first year of application) to:
> - Exclude the first-year rule from applying to a prior year.
> - Instead, calculate Canadian digital services revenue as:
>   $$
>   \text{Revenue} = (\text{Canadian digital services revenue in first year of application}) + (\text{Total revenue in the particular year})
>   $$

> **Restriction**: This election is **only allowed** if:
> - The taxpayer made a similar election in a **calendar year after 2021** that precedes the current year.
> - The conditions in Section 10(1)(a) and (b) were met in that prior year.

> This ensures that taxpayers cannot retroactively avoid the tax without a continuous history of eligibility.

Canadian digital services revenue is calculated as the sum of four revenue streams:

| Stream | Determination Method |
