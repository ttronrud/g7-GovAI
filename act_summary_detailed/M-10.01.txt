**Detailed Summary of the *Motor Vehicle Safety Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Motor Vehicle Safety Act* (MVSA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to ensure the safety of vehicles and equipment used on Canadian roads. The Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the design, manufacture, importation, sale, and post-market safety performance of motor vehicles and related equipment.

It aims to reduce the risk of death, injury, or property damage arising from vehicle use by setting and enforcing **mandatory safety standards**, requiring **transparency in safety data**, and establishing **accountability mechanisms** for manufacturers, importers, and dealers. The Act also provides for **exemptions under specific conditions**, **defect and non-compliance reporting**, and **government oversight** through inspections and investigations.
