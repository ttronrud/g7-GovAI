#### **8. Background and Context of the Agreement**  
The preamble outlines the historical and diplomatic foundations of the Agreement:  

- **1984**: The U.S. directed NASA to build a permanently manned space station and invited allies to participate.  
- **1985–1986**: Canada (via Prime Minister) and the U.S. confirmed interest in cooperation.  
- **ESA’s role**: The European Space Agency, through its Columbus program, committed to contributing to the ISS.  
- **Japan’s involvement**: Early interest in U.S. space programs led to participation.  
- **Canada’s prior contributions**: Canada contributed the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) and Spacelab.  
- **Russia’s inclusion**: Invited in 1993 due to its expertise in long-duration human spaceflight (e.g., Mir Station); accepted participation.  
- **International legal framework**: The Agreement respects and does not override core principles of:  
  - The **Outer Space Treaty (1967)** – Outer space is the common heritage of humankind; no national appropriation.  
  - The **Rescue Agreement (1968)** – Obligations to rescue astronauts.  
  - The **Liability Convention (1972)** – Responsibility for damage from space objects.  
  - The **Registration Convention (1976)** – Registration of space objects.  

> ✅ The Agreement emphasizes **peaceful use**, **mutual benefit**, and **non-assertion of territorial claims** in outer space.
