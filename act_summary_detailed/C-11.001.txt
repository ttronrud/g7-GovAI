### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Delegation Restrictions**: The Minister cannot delegate the power to make regulations or delegate authority to others. This may limit agility in responding to emerging issues.
- **Funding Reliance**: The success of the Agency depends on adequate and sustained federal funding.
- **Implementation Challenges**: Success will depend on effective collaboration with provinces, territories, and Indigenous governments—especially given differing priorities and jurisdictional boundaries.
- **Accountability**: As a new agency, the CWA will need clear performance metrics and oversight mechanisms to ensure accountability.

### **Conclusion**

The *Canada Water Agency Act* is a **comprehensive and forward-thinking legislative framework** designed to address the complex and evolving challenges facing Canada’s freshwater ecosystems. It establishes a new, unified federal agency with a clear mandate to coordinate policy, leverage scientific and Indigenous knowledge, and promote sustainable freshwater management across Canada.

More than a bureaucratic reorganization, the Act reflects a **fundamental shift in governance philosophy**—one that values collaboration, equity, environmental sustainability, and reconciliation. It sets a precedent for how Canada can manage natural resources in a way that is both scientifically sound and socially just.

This Act is a critical component of Canada’s broader environmental strategy and a significant step toward ensuring the long-term health of its freshwater resources for current and future generations.
