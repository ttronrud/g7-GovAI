### **2. Purpose of the Act**  
The primary objective of this Act is to **forgive specific official development assistance (ODA) debts** owed by certain African governments to the Government of Canada.

### **3. Key Provisions and Debt Forgiveness**

#### **Section 2: Forgiveness of Togo’s Debt**  
- The **official development assistance debt** owed by the **Government of Togo** to the **Government of Canada** is forgiven.  
- This debt arises from two loan agreements:  
  1. **Loan Agreement dated August 19, 1969**, as modified by an agreement dated **September 9, 1972**.  
  2. **Loan Agreement dated March 7, 1977**, as modified by an **amending agreement dated November 6, 1980**.  
- These agreements were part of Canada’s development financing to support infrastructure, economic development, and public services in Togo.

#### **Section 3: Forgiveness of Mauritania’s Debt**  
- The **official development assistance debt** owed by the **Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania** to Canada is forgiven.  
- This debt stems from a single loan agreement:  
  - **Loan Agreement dated December 10, 1975**, between the Government of Canada and the Government of Mauritania.  
- This reflects Canada’s commitment to supporting development in West Africa.

#### **Section 4: Forgiveness of East African Community (EAC) and Successor States’ Liabilities**  
- This provision is more complex and involves **liability apportionment** among three successor states:  
  - **United Republic of Tanzania**,  
  - **Republic of Uganda**, and  
  - **Republic of Kenya**.  
- The debt forgiveness applies to **liabilities assumed** by these countries under agreements entered into in **1984** (March 28, 1984), which were designed to **apportion liabilities** that originated from earlier loan agreements involving the **former East African Community (EAC)**.  
- The original EAC loan agreements were:  
  1. **October 28, 1970**, modified by agreement dated **March 15, 1971**.  
  2. **December 18, 1972**, modified by agreement dated **August 5, 1974**.  
- These agreements were part of a broader regional development initiative. When the EAC was dissolved, the individual countries (Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya) assumed the obligations of the community. The 1984 agreements formalized how these liabilities were shared among them.  
- As a result, **all such assumed debts** by the three countries are now forgiven under this Act.

### **4. Accounting and Financial Treatment**  
- The **amounts outstanding** in Canada’s financial records (specifically in its accounts of official development assistance) for the forgiven debts are:  
  - **Written off as a budgetary expenditure**, meaning they are no longer recorded as an outflow of funds.  
  - **Deleted from Canada’s official accounts** to reflect the debt forgiveness.  
- This ensures accurate financial reporting and compliance with public finance and budgetary accounting standards.

---

### **5. Commencement (Coming into Force)**  
- The Act does **not come into force immediately**.  
- It will take effect on a **day to be fixed by proclamation** (a formal government announcement).  
- This allows for administrative and financial adjustments before implementation.

---

### **6. Historical Context and Background**  
- The Act was passed in **1988** and came into force on **June 30, 1988** (as noted in the note).  
- It reflects a broader trend in the 1980s of **debt relief for developing countries**, especially in Africa, in response to economic hardship, political instability, and the need for development cooperation.  
- Canada’s development financing during this period was often tied to regional stability and economic growth, with loans structured to support infrastructure, health, education, and agricultural development.  
- The forgiveness of these debts was likely influenced by:  
  - The economic challenges faced by the recipient countries.  
  - Canada’s foreign policy goals of fostering equitable development and strengthening ties with African nations.  
  - International momentum toward debt relief, including the later **Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative** in the 1990s.
