## 📌 Key Provisions and Operational Principles

### 1. **Cessation of Membership**
A member ceases membership under the following conditions:
- In a **multi-employer plan**: After **24 months** without contributions from any participating employer and without receiving an immediate pension.
- In **other plans**: When employment ends and no immediate pension is being received.
- In **any other prescribed circumstance** (e.g., plan termination).

> ✅ **For greater certainty**: If the entire plan is terminated, membership ends.

---

### 2. **Retirement**
A member is deemed to **retire** when they begin receiving an *immediate pension benefit*, regardless of whether employment has ended.

> This ensures that retirement is tied to benefit commencement, not just job termination.

---

### 3. **Spouse or Common-Law Partner**
- In general, a reference to “spouse or common-law partner” means **common-law partner**, unless the member has a spouse from whom they are separated and is cohabiting with a common-law partner.
- This reflects a shift toward recognizing common-law relationships as legally equivalent in pension rights.

> 💡 This provision supports gender equity and modernizes family recognition in pension law.

---

### 4. **Negotiated Contribution Plan Status**
Even if a multi-employer plan no longer meets the criteria for being a "negotiated contribution plan" (e.g., only one employer remains or >95% of members are in affiliated companies), it is **deemed to remain a negotiated contribution plan for one year** — or longer if approved by the Superintendent.

> This provides **transition stability** and prevents sudden changes in contribution rules that could harm plan members.

---

### 5. **Flexibility and Advantage to Members**
- The Act **does not prevent** pension plans from offering benefits that are **more advantageous** than the minimum standards.
- This allows employers to offer enhanced benefits (e.g., better retirement payouts, survivor benefits) as long as they are not prohibited by law.

> This promotes **innovation and choice** in pension design while maintaining a floor of basic protections.

---

### 6. **Scope of Application**
The Act applies to **pension plans** that:
- Provide benefits to employees in **included employment** (federally regulated work).
- Require employer contributions.
- Are **not** excluded under specific categories:
  - Employees’ profit-sharing plans (under Income Tax Act).
  - Retiring allowances.
  - Pooled registered pension plans (under Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act).
  - Any other arrangements prescribed by regulation.

> 🔍 **Supplemental Pension Plans** are included if membership in the primary plan is a condition for joining the supplemental plan.

---

### 7. **Included Employment (Federal Jurisdiction)**
Defined broadly to include:
- Railways, canals, telegraphs, and transportation (inland or maritime).
- Ships and ferry services connecting provinces or with foreign countries.
- Air transportation (aerodromes, aircraft).
- Radio broadcasting stations.
- Banks and authorized foreign banks.
- Works or undertakings declared by Parliament to serve the **general advantage of Canada** or multiple provinces.
- Activities outside provincial jurisdiction, especially in **Yukon, Northwest Territories, or Nunavut**.

> This ensures that key national infrastructure and services are covered under federal pension oversight.

---

### 8. **Exempt Employment**
Employment by Her Majesty in right of Canada is excluded from included employment. Additionally, the Governor in Council may exempt other employment if:
- There is a pension plan covering such employees that primarily serves non-included employment, and is registered under a designated province’s law; **or**
- Other arrangements exist to protect employee benefits.

> This allows flexibility for government or niche employment sectors.

---

## 🛡️ Oversight and Supervision

### Role of the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions**
- The Superintendent (appointed under the *Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act*) has **primary responsibility** for administering the Act.
- Powers include:
  - Collecting data on inflation adjustments and benefit changes.
  - Conducting studies, surveys, and research on pension plans.
  - Compiling and disclosing statistical information to government agencies or regulatory bodies.
  - Receiving and sharing information with provincial pension supervisory authorities, especially in the context of **federal-provincial agreements**.

## 🤝 Federal-Provincial Agreements
