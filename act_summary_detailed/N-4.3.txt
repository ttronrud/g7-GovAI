### **Detailed Summary of the National Council for Reconciliation Act (2024)**

---

#### **Overview**

The **National Council for Reconciliation Act**, enacted on **July 2, 2024** (as per Statutory Instrument SI/2024-31), establishes a new, independent, Indigenous-led organization — the **National Council for Reconciliation (Council)** — with the explicit mission of advancing reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada. This legislation is a direct response to the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC)**’s Calls to Action, particularly **Call to Action 53**, which calls for the creation of a permanent, independent body to monitor and evaluate progress toward reconciliation.

The Act reflects a fundamental shift in Canada’s approach to Indigenous relations: moving from top-down, government-led initiatives to a **rights-based, collaborative, and Indigenous-led model** grounded in self-determination, accountability, and cultural revitalization.
