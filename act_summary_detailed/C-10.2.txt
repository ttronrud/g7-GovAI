**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Small Business Financing Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Canada Small Business Financing Act* (CSBFA) is a federal statute enacted to promote access to financing for small businesses in Canada by establishing a regulatory framework for loans provided by designated lenders. The Act sets out eligibility criteria, defines key terms, establishes the conditions under which loans may be made, and outlines the responsibilities of lenders, borrowers, and the federal government—specifically the Minister of Finance—regarding loan administration, loss liability, and financial oversight.

The Act came into force on **April 1, 1999**, and applies only to loans made on or after that date. It also includes transitional provisions for loans made under previous legislation, such as the *Small Business Loans Act*.
