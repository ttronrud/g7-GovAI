**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Disability Benefit Act* (2024)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Disability Benefit Act* (CDBA) is a landmark piece of federal legislation introduced by the Government of Canada to address the disproportionate rate of poverty among working-age persons with disabilities. The Act establishes a new, dedicated financial support program — the **Canada Disability Benefit (CDB)** — designed to reduce poverty, improve financial security, and promote economic and social inclusion for people with disabilities.

It builds upon existing commitments under the *Accessible Canada Act*, the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, and Canada’s international human rights obligations, particularly the *United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)*. The Act also aligns with Canada’s broader poverty reduction goals, including those set out in the *Poverty Reduction Act* and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## **Key Provisions and Objectives**

### **1. Legislative Purpose**
- **Primary Objective**: To reduce poverty and support the financial security of working-age persons with disabilities.
- The Act recognizes that persons with disabilities face systemic barriers to employment, income, and access to social services, which contribute to economic exclusion and poverty.

---

### **2. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Disability**: Defined in the same way as in *Section 2 of the Accessible Canada Act*, which includes a broad range of physical, sensory, cognitive, and mental health conditions that may affect a person’s ability to participate fully in society.
- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, responsible for administering the Act.

---

### **3. Eligibility and Benefit Structure**
- A person is eligible for the Canada Disability Benefit if they meet the eligibility criteria established in **regulations**.
- The **Minister must pay** the benefit to eligible applicants who:
  - Submit an application;
  - Have an application made on their behalf;
  - Meet all conditions specified in the regulations.
- The benefit is **not subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws**.
- It **cannot be assigned, charged, or used as security**.
- It **cannot be deducted or set off** under any other federal law except this Act.
- However, it **is garnishable** under the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act* (for example, in cases of child support or spousal support).

> This ensures that the benefit remains a stable, secure source of income for individuals with disabilities, protecting them from financial exploitation or loss due to debt or legal claims.

---

### **4. Application and Information Requirements**
- Applicants or their representatives (if the applicant is incapable of managing their affairs) must provide any information required by the Minister.
- The Minister may **collect and use the Social Insurance Number (SIN)** for administrative purposes, which is a standard practice in federal benefit programs.

---

### **5. Administration and Partnerships**
- The Minister may:
  - Enter into **agreements with other federal departments or agencies**;
  - With **provincial and territorial governments**, upon **Governor in Council approval**.
- All such agreements must be **made public**, ensuring transparency and accountability.

> This promotes collaboration between federal and provincial authorities to ensure coordinated, accessible, and effective delivery of support services.

---

### **6. Financial Management**
- All benefits are paid from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, ensuring they are funded at the federal level and not subject to fluctuating budgetary decisions.

---

### **7. Appeals and Review Mechanisms**
- A person may appeal decisions related to:
  - Ineligibility for the benefit;
  - The amount of the benefit received or to be received;
  - Any other matter prescribed by regulation.
- Appeals are directed to a body designated in regulations (e.g., a tribunal or independent review panel).
- The process is designed to be **barrier-free**, consistent with the *Accessible Canada Act*’s mandate for inclusive design.

---

### **8. Regulatory Authority (Governor in Council)**
The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has broad powers to make regulations covering:
- **Eligibility criteria** (e.g., age, disability status, income thresholds);
- **Conditions for receiving or continuing the benefit**;
- **Benefit amount and inflation indexing**;
- **Payment schedules**;
- **Application process** (including ensuring it is accessible and free of barriers);
- **Amendments or rescissions** of decisions;
- **Reviews and reconsiderations**;
- **Appeals process**;
- **Retroactive payments** (for those who applied late but were otherwise eligible);
- **Applications for persons who cannot manage their affairs**;
- **Deemed death** (if an applicant disappears under circumstances that raise a "beyond a reasonable doubt" presumption of death);
- **Application upon death**;
- **Correction of administrative errors**;
- **Identification and recovery of debts**;
- **Limitation periods for overpayments**;
- **Offences and penalties** (see below).

> These regulations are essential to operationalizing the Act and adapting it to evolving social and economic conditions.

---

### **9. Inclusion of Intersectional and Human Rights Considerations**
When setting the benefit amount, the Governor in Council **must consider**:
- The **Official Poverty Line** (as defined in the *Poverty Reduction Act*);
- The **additional costs of living with a disability** (e.g., medical expenses, transportation, assistive devices);
- The **challenges of earning income** due to employment barriers;
- **Intersectional needs** (e.g., gender, race, Indigenous status, age, or other marginalized identities);
- Canada’s **international human rights obligations**, including the UNCRPD.

> This ensures the benefit is not only sufficient to lift individuals above the poverty line but also responsive to the unique lived experiences of disabled persons from diverse backgrounds.

---

### **10. Timelines for Regulation Development**
- Within **12 months** of the Act coming into force, the Governor in Council must issue regulations for:
  - Eligibility;
  - Conditions;
  - Benefit amount and indexing;
  - Application process (with barrier-free design);
  - Appeals;
  - Retroactive payments;
  - Applications for persons unable to manage affairs;
  - Deemed death;
  - Recovery of overpayments.

> This ensures the program is operational and accessible within a realistic timeframe.

---

### **11. Engagement with the Disability Community**
A core principle of the Act is **inclusion and co-design**:
- The Minister **must provide meaningful, barrier-free opportunities** for persons with disabilities to participate in:
  - Developing eligibility criteria;
  - Designing the application process;
  - Setting benefit amounts;
  - Structuring the appeal process.
- This reflects the *“Nothing Without Us”* principle — recognizing that those most affected by disability policies must be central to their development.

> The Act mandates **specific reporting obligations** to ensure accountability:
  - **Within 6 months** of the Act coming into force: The Minister must **table a report** in the House of Commons on how engagement with the disability community has been implemented.
  - **Within one year**: A report on the **progress of the regulatory process** must be tabled in **both Houses of Parliament**.
  - The reports are to be **reviewed by designated parliamentary committees** and **published on the Department of Employment and Social Development’s website**.

> This ensures transparency, public accountability, and ongoing community involvement.

---

### **12. Periodic Review of the Act**
- A formal **review of the Act and its administration** must occur:
  - As soon as feasible after the **first anniversary**;
  - After the **third anniversary**;
  - And **every fifth anniversary** thereafter.
- The review will be conducted by a **parliamentary committee** (or a joint committee of both Houses).
- This ensures the policy remains relevant, effective, and responsive to changing needs and societal conditions.

---

### **13. Offences and Penalties**
The Act establishes legal consequences for fraud and abuse:
- **Offences punishable on summary conviction** (i.e., without a jury):
  - Knowingly using false identity information to obtain a benefit;
  - Counseling someone to apply with intent to steal a substantial portion of the benefit;
  - Making false or misleading representations in an application.
- **Administrative monetary penalties** (for enforcement):
  - For knowingly making false or misleading statements;
  - For applying for and receiving a benefit while ineligible.

> These provisions help deter fraud and ensure the integrity of the benefit system.

---

### **14. Adaptation of Existing Laws**
- The Act **adapts Section 44.2 of the Old Age Security Act** to allow for:
  - Verification of compliance with this Act;
  - Use of **copies of documents as evidence** (e.g., medical records, income statements).
- This strengthens the ability of the Minister to verify eligibility and prevent fraud without requiring invasive or burdensome personal interactions.

---

### **15. Verification and Compliance**
- The Minister may require applicants or beneficiaries (or their representatives) to:
  - Appear in person or via **audioconference, videoconference, or other suitable means**;
  - Provide information or documents at a **suitable time and place**.
- This provision supports verification while respecting the rights and dignity of applicants.

---

### **16. Implementation Timeline**
- The Act **comes into force no later than one year after royal assent**.
- It officially **came into force on June 22, 2024**.
