### **Detailed Summary of the *Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act***

#### **1. Official Citation**
The Act is formally titled:  
**"The Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act"**  
It may be cited as such in legal and official contexts.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Act**
The primary purpose of this Act is to **establish and codify the legal prohibitions in Canada against marriage between individuals who are closely related by blood, marriage, or adoption**. It clarifies which relationships are legally prohibited from marrying each other, and it ensures that such prohibitions are explicitly recognized and enforceable under Canadian law.

---

#### **3. Key Provisions**

##### **Section 1: General Principle – Exceptions to Prohibition**
> *"Subject to subsection (2), persons related by consanguinity, affinity or adoption are not prohibited from marrying each other by reason only of their relationship."*

- This provision establishes a **general principle**: Most relationships by blood (consanguinity), marriage (affinity), or adoption do **not automatically** prohibit marriage.
- The phrase *"by reason only of their relationship"* means that if the only basis for disallowing a marriage is the familial connection, then that marriage is not automatically invalid.
- However, this general principle is **subject to a specific exception** outlined in subsection (2), which limits the scope of this exception.

##### **Section 2: Prohibited Relationships**
> *"No person shall marry another person if they are related lineally, or as brother or sister or half-brother or half-sister, including by adoption."*

- This is the **core prohibition** of the Act.
- It explicitly bans marriage between individuals who are:
  - **Lineally related** (i.e., through direct descent, such as parent–child, grandparent–grandchild).
  - **Full siblings** (biological or adopted).
  - **Half-siblings** (sharing one parent).
- The inclusion of *"including by adoption"* means that **adoption creates the same legal relationship as blood ties** for the purposes of marriage prohibitions.
- This means that **a person cannot marry their biological or adopted sibling**, whether full or half.

##### **Section 3: Validity of Marriages – Exceptions**
> *"Subject to subsection (2), a marriage between persons related by consanguinity, affinity or adoption is not invalid by reason only of their relationship."*

- This provision states that **a marriage is not automatically invalid solely because the parties are related**, **except** in cases covered by subsection (2).
- In other words, if a relationship is not one of the prohibited types (e.g., parent–child, siblings), then the marriage is valid.
- This supports the idea that **not all familial relationships are automatically invalid**—only specific, close kinships are prohibited.

##### **Section 4: Void Marriages**
> *"A marriage between persons who are related in the manner described in subsection 2(2) is void."*

- This is a **critical legal consequence**.
- If two individuals are related as **full siblings, half-siblings, or lineally** (e.g., parent–child), then the marriage is **void**—meaning it is **legally null and unenforceable from the outset**.
- A void marriage is **not recognized as valid** by the law, and it has **no legal effect** (e.g., no rights to property, no recognition of children, no spousal benefits).
- This provision applies **only to the relationships specified in subsection 2(2)**.

##### **Section 5: Exhaustiveness of Prohibitions**
> *"This Act contains all of the prohibitions in law in Canada against marriage by reason of the parties being related."*

- This clause ensures that **this Act is the complete and final codification** of all marriage prohibitions based on familial relationships in Canada.
- It means that **no other legislation** can introduce new prohibitions or override this Act in relation to marriage by reason of kinship.
- It serves as a **comprehensive legal statement** that all such prohibitions are now consolidated and legally binding.

#### **6. Enactment and Coming Into Force**
> *"This Act shall come into force on the day that is one year after the day it is assented to, or on such earlier day in any province as may be fixed by order of the Governor in Council at the request of that province."*

- The Act does **not take effect immediately** upon passage.
- It comes into force **one year after it is assented to** by the Governor General of Canada (i.e., after receiving royal assent).
- However, **provincial governments** may choose to bring the Act into force **earlier** if they so request.
- This provision allows for **provincial flexibility** in implementation, particularly in regions where there may be different cultural or social norms regarding marriage and family relationships.

> **[Note: Act in force December 17, 1991.]**

- This note confirms that the Act **came into force on December 17, 1991**—one year after royal assent, which occurred on December 17, 1990.

---

### **Legal and Social Context**

- This Act was enacted to **modernize and clarify** the rules around prohibited degrees of marriage in Canada, which had previously been scattered across various statutes and judicial interpretations.
- It replaced older, less precise prohibitions and provided a **clear, consistent, and legally enforceable framework**.
- The Act reflects the principle that **certain close familial relationships are incompatible with marriage** due to social, ethical, and familial considerations.
- The distinction between **void marriages** and **invalid marriages** is important: a void marriage is not recognized at all, whereas an invalid marriage may be voidable under certain conditions (though in this case, it is explicitly void).

It ensures legal consistency, prevents invalid marriages, and reflects societal norms regarding family relationships. By codifying these rules and establishing that such marriages are void, the Act provides a strong legal framework to prevent unions that could lead to confusion, conflict, or harm within families and society.

It remains a key reference in Canadian legal practice, particularly in matters involving marriage validity, family law, and succession rights.

However, the core prohibitions remain in effect.*
