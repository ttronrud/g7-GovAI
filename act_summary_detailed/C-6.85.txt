**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Mexico Tax Convention Act, 2006***

---

### **Overview**
The *Canada–Mexico Tax Convention Act, 2006* is a legislative instrument that gives legal force and effect in Canada to the **Canada–Mexico Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income**, as set out in Schedule 1 and amended by the Protocol in Schedule 2. This Act establishes the framework under which Canada and Mexico cooperate to prevent double taxation and ensure fair treatment of individuals and enterprises operating across both countries.

The Convention was signed to promote economic cooperation, reduce tax disputes, and ensure that income earned by residents of either country is taxed only once, where appropriate, and in accordance with clear rules.

### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **"Convention"** refers to the bilateral tax treaty between Canada and Mexico (Schedule 1), as amended by the Protocol (Schedule 2).

### **2. Conflict of Laws – Precedence of Convention and Act**
- In case of **inconsistency** between:
  - This Act or the Convention and any other Canadian law,
  → **The Convention and this Act prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.

  - Implement the Convention;
  - Give effect to its provisions.

> This ensures transparency and public awareness of the treaty’s timeline.

---

### **4. Scope of Application**
#### **General Principles**
- The Convention applies to:

### **6. Determination of Residency**
Residency is a key factor in determining where income is taxed.

#### **Individuals**
An individual is deemed a resident of a Contracting State if:
1. They have a **permanent home available**.
   - If available in both countries → resident in the State where **personal and economic relations are closer** ("centre of vital interests").
   - If centre of vital interests cannot be determined → resident in the State with **habitual abode**.
   - If habitual abode is in both or neither → resident in the State of **nationality**.
   - If individual is a national of both or neither → the **competent authorities must resolve the issue by mutual agreement**.

#### **Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, trusts)**
- If a non-individual is a resident of both countries:
  - The **competent authorities must resolve** the residency status by mutual agreement.
  - In the **absence of agreement**, the person is **not entitled to any tax relief or exemption** under the Convention.

> This prevents double taxation and ensures clear residency status.

### **7. Permanent Establishment (PE)**
A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

#### **Types of Permanent Establishments**
- Places of management
- Branches, offices
- Factories, workshops
- Mines, oil/gas wells, quarries (related to natural resource exploration/exploitation)

#### **Additional Cases (where PE exists)**
- **Construction or building projects** lasting **more than 6 months**.
- **Furnishing of services** (e.g., consultancy) by employees or personnel for **more than 6 months in any 12-month period**.
- **Professional services** by an individual present in a country for **more than 183 days in any 12-month period**.

> These are treated as PE if the activities are continuous and part of the business.

#### **Exclusions (Not Considered PE)**
- Use of facilities for **storage, display, delivery** of goods.
- Maintenance of stock for **storage, display, delivery, or processing** by another party.
- Maintenance of a fixed place for **advertising, research, or loan preparation** (preparatory or auxiliary purposes).
- Any combination of the above if the **overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary**.

> These exclusions ensure that minor or ancillary operations do not trigger PE status.

#### **Special Rules for Agents and Representatives**
- A person acting on behalf of a foreign enterprise may be deemed to have a PE **if they have authority to conclude contracts** in the host country.
- **Exception**: If the activities are limited to those listed above (e.g., advertising, research), and are carried out through a fixed place, such a place is **not** a PE.

#### **Insurance Companies**
- An insurance company (resident of one country) is deemed to have a PE in the other country **if it collects premiums or insures risks located there**, **except for reinsurance**.
- This applies even if the company uses agents.

> This ensures that insurance companies are not taxed only on domestic activities.

#### **Brokers and Independent Agents**
- An enterprise **does not** have a PE merely because it uses a broker, general agent, or independent agent.
- **Exception**: If conditions imposed on the agent differ from those between independent parties (e.g., unfair pricing or terms), then such differences may trigger a PE.

> This protects legitimate commercial relationships between independent agents.

#### **Control and Ownership**
- **Control or ownership** of a company in the other country **does not** create a PE.
- For example, if one company controls another in the other country, this does not constitute a PE.

> This prevents abuse of control to create tax avoidance.

### **8. Taxation of Income from Immovable Property**
- Income from **immovable property** (land, buildings, agriculture, forestry) located in the other country may be taxed in that country.
- **Immovable property includes**:
  - Property accessory to land
  - Livestock and equipment used in agriculture/forestry
  - Rights to variable/fixed payments for working mineral deposits or natural resources
- **Excluded**: Ships and aircraft (not considered immovable property)

> Applies to:
- Income from **direct use, letting, or alienation** of immovable property.
- Income from **enterprise activities** related to such property.

> This allows the host country to tax income derived from property located within its borders.
