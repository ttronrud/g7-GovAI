**Detailed Summary of the *Fisheries Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Fisheries Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to provide a comprehensive legal framework for the **management, control, conservation, and protection of fish and fish habitats** across Canada. It serves as the primary federal law governing fisheries activities, including fishing, habitat protection, enforcement, and intergovernmental cooperation—particularly with Indigenous peoples.

The Act emphasizes **sustainability**, **ecosystem-based management**, **Indigenous rights**, and **scientific integrity**, while also ensuring that fish stocks remain viable for future generations. It applies to all waters within Canadian jurisdiction and extends to certain areas beyond traditional fishing zones, especially for sedentary species.

### **1. Definitions and Key Terms**

The Act establishes precise definitions of key terms used throughout:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Canadian fisheries waters** | Includes fishing zones, territorial sea, and internal waters of Canada. Also includes portions of the continental shelf beyond these waters for sedentary species. |
| **Fish** | Broadly defined to include parts of fish, shellfish, crustaceans, marine animals, and their reproductive stages (eggs, larvae, juveniles). |
| **Fishery** | Encompasses species, populations, stocks, locations, time periods, methods, and gear used in fishing. |
| **Fish habitat** | Areas where fish live and carry out life processes—spawning grounds, nurseries, migration routes, food sources. |
| **Fishing** | Any activity involving catching or attempting to catch fish by any method. |
| **Fishing vessel** | Any vessel designed or used for catching, processing, or transporting fish. |
| **Fishway** | Structures like ladders, elevators, or canals that allow fish to migrate freely. |
| **Obstruction** | Any dam, slide, or structure that impedes fish passage. |
| **Fishery officer / Fishery guardian** | Designated personnel with powers to enforce the Act; granted peace officer status under the *Criminal Code* when enforcing specific Indigenous laws. |
| **Indigenous governing body** | Entities recognized under Section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*, acting on behalf of Indigenous groups with rights affirmed by law. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (or a designated minister for Northern Pipeline matters). |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Several definitions (e.g., "Aboriginal," "commercial," "recreational") have been **repealed** as of 2019 or 2024 due to policy shifts, particularly in relation to Indigenous rights and modern fisheries governance.

### **2. Purpose of the Act**

The primary purposes are:

1. To **manage and control fisheries** in a sustainable and responsible manner.
2. To **conserve and protect fish and their habitats**, including through pollution prevention.

This reflects a shift from purely economic or commercial management to a **conservation-first, ecosystem-based approach**.

---

### **3. Scope and Application**

- Applies **nationwide** in Canadian fisheries waters.
- Extends to **sedentary species** (organisms that are immobile or remain in contact with the seabed) in areas beyond Canadian fisheries waters—specifically, parts of the **continental shelf**.

> This ensures that species like bottom-dwelling shellfish or deep-sea invertebrates are protected even in remote or deep-sea zones.

---

### **4. Indigenous Rights and Governance**

A significant and progressive feature of the Act is its recognition of **Indigenous rights under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.

#### Key Elements:
- The Minister must **consider adverse effects** on Indigenous rights when making decisions under the Act.
- The Act **promotes cooperation** with:
  - Provincial governments
  - Indigenous governing bodies
  - Co-management bodies established under land claims agreements

#### Agreements with Indigenous Partners (Section 4.1)

The Minister may enter into **formal agreements** with Indigenous governments or provincial authorities to:
- Facilitate joint action and reduce program overlap
- Enhance communication (especially scientific data exchange)
- Conduct public consultations
- Establish shared standards, objectives, and administrative structures

##### Key Requirements for Agreements:
- Must **respect Indigenous rights** affirmed under Section 35.
- May allow **provincial or Indigenous laws** to be treated as **equivalent to federal regulations**.
- The Governor in Council can issue an **order** declaring that certain provisions of the Act or regulations **do not apply** in a given jurisdiction if the local law is functionally equivalent.
- These orders are **revocable** if:
  - The local law is no longer equivalent
  - It is not being adequately enforced
- Revocation requires **notice to the relevant government or Indigenous body**.
- Orders cease upon termination of the agreement.

> This reflects a **principle of co-governance**, where Indigenous laws and knowledge are recognized as valid and effective tools in fisheries management.

---

### **5. Advisory Panels and Public Participation**

- The Minister may establish **advisory panels** to assist in decision-making.
- Panel members are **compensated** for attendance and reimbursed for travel, living, and other expenses.
- Panels provide a formal mechanism for **independent review**, scientific input, and community engagement.

---

### **6. Fisheries Management and Sustainability**

#### Section 6.1 – Maintaining Major Fish Stocks

The Minister is required to:
- Maintain **major fish stocks at or above levels necessary for sustainability**, considering fish biology and environmental conditions.

#### Limit Reference Points (for Cultural or Socioeconomic Reasons)

If it is **not feasible or appropriate** (due to cultural or economic reasons) to maintain stocks at full sustainability levels, the Minister may:
- Set a **limit reference point** (a threshold below which stocks are considered unsafe).
- Implement measures to keep stocks **above this point**.

> Example: If a fish stock is culturally vital to a First Nation but declining due to overfishing, the Minister may set a lower threshold to allow for cultural harvesting while still protecting the long-term viability of the stock.

#### Rebuilding Plans

- If a stock has declined **to or below** the limit reference point, a **rebuilding plan** must be developed and implemented.
- The plan must consider biology and environmental factors.
- If the plan would cause **adverse socio-economic or cultural impacts**, the Minister may **amend the plan or extend the timeline** to mitigate harm.

> These provisions balance ecological sustainability with social equity and cultural preservation.

#### Habitat Restoration

- If habitat degradation has contributed to stock decline, the Minister must **assess existing habitat restoration measures** and take them into account.

> This integrates **habitat conservation** directly into fish stock recovery strategies.

#### Major Fish Stocks

- The specific list of "major fish stocks" is **prescribed by regulations** (not defined in the Act itself), allowing flexibility based on scientific assessment.

---

### **7. Leases, Licences, and Access**

#### Issuance of Leases and Licences
- The Minister may issue or authorize leases and licences for fisheries **where no exclusive right to fish already exists**.
- Leases or licences may be issued **only under the Governor in Council’s authority** if they last **more than nine years**.

> This ensures long-term leases are subject to higher scrutiny and public accountability.

#### Refusal to Issue Licences
- The Minister may refuse a licence if:
  - The applicant is in **default of a fine** from a contravention of the Act
  - The proceeds of the fine belong to Her Majesty in Right of Canada or a province or another entity

> This serves as a deterrent against non-compliance.

#### Fees
- Fees for licences and quotas are **prescribed by regulation**, on the recommendation of the Minister and the Minister of Finance.
- Fees may be **periodically adjusted** to reflect inflation or market conditions.

---

### **8. Suspension and Cancellation of Leases/Licences**

The Minister may suspend or cancel a lease or licence if:
1. There is **non-compliance** with the lease terms
2. The holder has entered into an agreement that **contravenes the Act or regulations**
3. The holder is in **default of a fine** (proceeds go to government or third parties)

> **Important exception**: Suspension or cancellation **only occurs if no legal proceedings have been initiated** regarding the breach.

> This prevents arbitrary actions and ensures due process.

---

### **9. Fisheries Management Orders**

In cases of **urgent threats** to fish stocks or management, the Minister may issue a **fisheries management order** that:
- Prohibits fishing of specific species, populations, or stocks
- Bans certain types of fishing gear, vessels, or methods
- Limits fishing in specific areas or times (e.g., closed seasons)

> These orders are emergency tools used to protect stocks during critical periods (e.g., spawning seasons, environmental disasters).

---

### **10. Enforcement Powers**

#### Fishery Officers and Guardians
- The Minister may designate individuals as **fishery officers** or **fishery guardians**.
- These officers are **granted peace officer powers** under the *Criminal Code* when enforcing:
  - Nisga’a Laws (via the Nisga’a Final Agreement)
  - Tla’amin Laws (Tla’amin Final Agreement)
  - Tsawwassen Laws (Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement)
  - Maanulth Laws (Maanulth First Nations Final Agreement)

> This allows **Indigenous legal systems** to be enforced with the same authority as federal law, recognizing the validity
