**Detailed Summary of the *Commercial Arbitration Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Commercial Arbitration Act* (Act) is a comprehensive legislative framework that establishes the rules and procedures governing **commercial arbitration in Canada**, particularly when one of the parties is a **government entity**—specifically, Her Majesty in right of Canada, a **Crown corporation**, or a **departmental corporation**—or in **maritime or admiralty matters**. It is based on the **United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration**, adopted on June 21, 1985, with key modifications to suit Canadian legal and institutional contexts.

The Act came into force on **August 10, 1986**, through **Statutory Instrument SI/86-155**, and serves as the primary law governing commercial arbitration in Canada, especially in relation to state-owned entities and cross-border disputes.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretation Principles**

### 1. **"Code"**
- Refers to the *Commercial Arbitration Code*, which forms the core of the Act.
- Based on the UNCITRAL Model Law of 1985, with some adaptations.
- The Code applies to commercial arbitration, subject to any bilateral or multilateral agreements between Canada and other countries.

> **Note**: The term "international" has been removed from Article 1(1), and the detailed criteria for international arbitration have been deleted. This reflects a shift toward focusing on **domestic commercial arbitration** involving state entities.

---

### 2. **Scope of Application**
The Code applies **only in cases where at least one party is**:
- Her Majesty in right of Canada,
- A **Crown corporation**, or
- A **departmental corporation**  
*or* in **maritime or admiralty matters**.

This means that the Code does **not apply** to purely private disputes between individuals or private businesses unless one of the parties is a government body or the matter falls under admiralty law.

---

### 3. **Applicability of Arbitral Agreements and Awards**
- Applies to **arbitral agreements** (whether made before or after the Act's coming into force).
- Applies to **arbitral awards** and **arbitration agreements** regardless of timing.
- Includes specific claims under various **free trade agreements (FTAs)** such as:
  - **NAFTA** (Articles 1116/1117),
  - **USMCA** (Annex 14-C or Article 14.D.3),
  - **Canada–Chile FTA** (Articles G-17/G-18),
  - **Canada–Peru and Canada–Colombia FTAs** (Articles 819/820),
  - And other provisions listed in **Schedule 2**.

> This ensures that trade-related disputes involving Canada are governed by consistent, internationally recognized arbitration standards.

---

### 4. **Interpretation of the Code**
- The Act is interpreted in **good faith**, using ordinary meaning in context and in light of its **object and purpose**.
- Interpretation may refer to:
  - The **Report of the 18th Session of UNCITRAL (1985)**,
  - The **Analytical Commentary** by the Secretary-General.
- The Code has **full force of law** in Canada, subject to certain exceptions.

---

### 5. **"Court" or "Competent Court"**
- Refers to **superior, county, or district courts**.
- Exceptions exist where the context requires a different judicial body (e.g., Federal Court).

---

## **Core Provisions of the Code**

---

### **1. Arbitration Agreement**
- **Definition**: An agreement to submit disputes (arising or future) to arbitration, whether contractual or not.
- May take the form of:
  - An **arbitration clause in a contract**, or
  - A **separate agreement**.
- Must be in **writing**. A writing includes:
  - A signed document,
  - Exchange of letters, telex, telegrams, or other recorded communications,
  - Statements of claim and defense where one party alleges the existence of an arbitration agreement and the other does not deny it.
- A **reference to an arbitration clause** in a contract constitutes an arbitration agreement **if**:
  - The contract is in writing, and
  - The reference makes the clause part of the contract.

> **Key Point**: The agreement is not invalidated just because it is not explicitly stated in a separate document.

---

### **2. Court Referral to Arbitration**
- If a party brings a lawsuit in a matter governed by an arbitration agreement, **the court must refer the parties to arbitration** upon request, **unless**:
  - The agreement is **null, void, or unenforceable**.
- The referral **does not suspend** the litigation.
- Arbitral proceedings may **proceed or continue** while the court issue is pending.
- A party may request **interim protective measures** (e.g., injunctions) from the court **before or during** arbitration—this is **not incompatible** with the arbitration agreement.

---

### **3. Appointment of Arbitrators**
- **Parties are free** to agree on the number and method of appointing arbitrators.
- **Default rules**:
  - **Three arbitrators**: Each party appoints one; the two appointees choose the third.
    - If either fails to appoint within **30 days**, or if the two fail to agree within 30 days, the **court** (or other authority under Article 6) appoints the third.
  - **Sole arbitrator**: If parties cannot agree, the **court** appoints the arbitrator.
- If a party fails to act under the agreed procedure, or if a third party (e.g., an arbitration institution) fails to perform its role, any party may request the **court** to intervene.
- **No appeal** is allowed on decisions made by the court or authority in appointing arbitrators.
- Appointment must ensure **independence and impartiality**.
- Courts should consider:
  - Qualifications agreed upon by the parties,
  - Nationality diversity (especially for sole or third arbitrators),
  - Avoiding bias or conflict of interest.

---

### **4. Challenges to Arbitrators**
- A party may challenge an arbitrator **only if**:
  - There are **justifiable doubts** about impartiality or independence, or
  - The arbitrator lacks qualifications agreed upon by the parties.
- A party may challenge an arbitrator **only after** becoming aware of grounds **after appointment**.
- **Default procedure**:
  - Within **15 days** of becoming aware of the tribunal’s composition or any relevant circumstances, the party must send a **written statement** of reasons to the tribunal.
  - If the arbitrator does not withdraw or the other party does not agree, the **arbitral tribunal decides** on the challenge.
- If the challenge fails:
  - The challenging party may request the **court** to decide within **30 days**.
  - The decision is **final and appealable**.
  - During this period, the tribunal may **continue proceedings and issue an award**.
- **Termination of mandate**:
  - If an arbitrator becomes unable to act (de jure or de facto), or fails to act without undue delay:
    - The mandate terminates if the arbitrator withdraws or the parties agree.
    - Otherwise, any party may request the **court** to decide on termination.
    - The decision is **final and non-appealable**.
  - **Note**: Termination does **not imply acceptance** of any grounds for termination.

> **Substitute arbitrator**: If an arbitrator is removed, a substitute is appointed according to the original appointment rules.

---

### **5. Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal**
- The tribunal may **rule on its own jurisdiction**, including:
  - Validity of the arbitration agreement,
  - Whether the dispute falls within the scope of the agreement.
- An arbitration clause is treated as **independent** of the rest of the contract.
- A decision that the contract is null and void **does not automatically invalidate** the arbitration clause.
- A plea of **lack of jurisdiction** must be raised:
  - **No later than the submission of the defense** (for lack of jurisdiction),
  - **As soon as the issue arises** (for exceeding authority).
- The tribunal may **admit a later plea** if it considers the delay justified.
- If the tribunal rules on jurisdiction as a **preliminary question**, any party may request the **court** to decide within **30 days**.
  - The decision is **final and non-appealable**.
  - The tribunal may proceed with the case during this period.

---

### **6. Interim Measures of Protection**
- The tribunal may, at a party’s request, order **interim protective measures** (e.g., injunctions, preservation of assets).
- The tribunal may require the party to provide **security** (e.g., bond) to cover potential costs.
- These measures are **not incompatible** with the arbitration agreement.

---

### **7. Conduct of Proceedings**
- **Equality of parties**: All parties are treated equally and have a full opportunity to present their case.
- **Procedure**:
  - Parties may agree on procedures (e.g., hearings, evidence, language).
  - If no agreement, the tribunal may conduct proceedings as it deems appropriate.
  - The tribunal has broad power to:
    - Determine **admissibility, relevance, materiality, and
