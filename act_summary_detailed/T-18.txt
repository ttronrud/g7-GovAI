### **Detailed Summary of the *Department of Transport Act***

---

#### **1. Purpose and Citation**
The Act is titled the **Department of Transport Act** and establishes a centralized government department responsible for the management, operation, and oversight of Canada’s transportation infrastructure — specifically **railways and canals** — and related functions. It serves as foundational legislation for the federal government's control over key transportation systems before the modern *Canada Transportation Act* (1936) was enacted.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Canal**:  
  - Refers to any canal or lock belonging to Canada.  
  - Includes canals and locks acquired, constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired, or improved at public expense (i.e., through parliamentary appropriation).  
  - Excludes works funded solely as subsidies.  
  - Encompasses all works and property incidental to or under the management, direction, or control of the Minister of Transport by the Governor in Council.

- **Railway**:  
  - Refers to every railway and its rolling stock (e.g., locomotives, cars) that belong to Canada.  
  - Includes those acquired, built, or improved with public funds (appropriated by Parliament).  
  - Excludes works funded only as subsidies.  
  - Includes all related works, property, and assets placed under the Minister’s control.

> These definitions ensure that only federally funded or managed transportation infrastructure falls under the scope of this Act.
