### 💰 **5. Maximum Yearly Insurable Earnings (MIEE)**

#### a) **Base Threshold**
- The maximum yearly insurable earnings is **$39,000** **until** the calculated amount exceeds this threshold.

#### b) **Calculation Formula**
The MIEE is calculated as follows:

> MIEE = 52 × (Average Weekly Earnings over 12 months ending April 30 in the prior year) × (Ratio of current average to previous 12-month average)

Where:
- Average Weekly Earnings = Average of weekly earnings for each month in the 12-month period ending April 30.
- The ratio compares the current 12-month average to the 12-month average from 12 months earlier.

#### c) **Adjustment Rules**
- If the calculated amount exceeds $39,000, it becomes the new MIEE **before rounding down**.
- The MIEE is then **rounded down to the nearest multiple of $100** (e.g., $39,200 → $39,200; $39,250 → $39,200).
- For subsequent years, the MIEE is **multiplied by the same ratio** (to reflect inflation or wage trends), maintaining consistency.

> This ensures that benefit eligibility is tied to real wage growth and inflation, protecting both workers and the system.
