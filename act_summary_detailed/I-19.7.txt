**Key Provisions and Context:**

1. **Purpose and Rationale:**  
   The Act is grounded in several foundational principles:
   - **Official Languages of Canada:** English and French are recognized as Canada’s official languages, reflecting the nation’s bilingual character.

   - **Multilingualism in Canada:** Canadians speak a wide array of languages, contributing to the country’s rich cultural mosaic and social fabric.
   - **Global Recognition of Language Preservation:**  
     - In November 1999, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed **International Mother Language Day** on February 21st to promote awareness of the importance of language in cultural identity and human rights.  
     - In May 2007, the United Nations General Assembly urged member states to "promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by peoples of the world," reinforcing the global importance of linguistic diversity.

2. **Recognition of Existing Practices:**  
   The Act acknowledges that some Canadian provinces and cities already observe International Mother Language Day, indicating a growing national and local commitment to linguistic diversity and cultural preservation.

3. **Parliamentary Intent:**  
   The Parliament of Canada enacts this Act to formally recognize the value of linguistic and cultural diversity as a cornerstone of Canadian identity, democracy, and social cohesion.
