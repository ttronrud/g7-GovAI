**Detailed Summary of the *Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted to prevent abuse and ensure fairness in the administration of disability tax credits (DTCs) by regulating the fees that third-party "promoters" may charge individuals or families seeking eligibility for these credits. The Act was introduced to combat the practice of charging excessive fees for preparing disability tax credit requests, which could place a financial burden on vulnerable individuals—particularly those with disabilities or their dependents.

The legislation came into force on **November 15, 2021**, and is designed to promote transparency, accountability, and accessibility in the disability tax credit process.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

#### **1. Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is titled: **Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Act**.
- It establishes clear rules regarding who can charge fees for preparing disability tax credit requests and limits those fees to a reasonable, regulated maximum.

---

#### **2. Definitions (Key Terms)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Claimant** | An individual who is the subject of a disability tax credit request, or who has a dependent for whom such a request is made. |
| **Disability Tax Credit Request** | A formal request submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to determine eligibility for: <br> - A disability tax credit under subsection 152(1.01) of the Income Tax Act; <br> - A deduction under subsections 118.3(1) or (2); or <br> - Any tax deduction or overpayment that depends on eligibility for the above deductions. |
| **Fee** | The fair market value of any consideration (e.g., money, service) accepted or charged by a person to prepare a disability tax credit request. |
| **Maximum Fee** | The cap on fees set by regulations under Section 9 of this Act. |

#### **3. Prohibition on Excessive Fees (Section 3)**

- **Core Rule**: A promoter **cannot accept or charge a fee that exceeds the maximum fee**.
- This maximum fee is **set by regulation** under Section 9 and is reviewed periodically to reflect market conditions and ensure affordability.

> **Purpose**: To prevent exploitation of vulnerable individuals by charging unreasonably high fees for services that are essentially administrative or informational in nature.

---

#### **4. Penalties for Exceeding the Maximum Fee (Section 3 – Penalty Formula)**

Every promoter who violates Section 3 (i.e., charges more than the maximum fee) is liable to a penalty calculated as follows:

> **Penalty = $1,000 + [Fee – Maximum Fee] + [Amount Repaid to Claimant Within 120 Days]**

Where:
- **Fee** = The total amount charged by the promoter.
- **Maximum Fee** = The fee cap established by regulation.
- **Amount repaid to claimant within 120 days** = Any refund or repayment made by the promoter to the claimant after the CRA notifies the Minister (under Section 4) that the fee was excessive.

> **Important Notes**:
> - The penalty includes both a fixed $1,000 base and a variable component based on the excess fee.
> - If the promoter repays the claimant within 120 days (or a longer period acceptable to the Minister), that amount is subtracted from the penalty.
> - This incentivizes prompt correction and repayment, reducing harm to claimants.

---

#### **5. Mandatory Notification Requirement (Section 4)**

- Every promoter (except a **prescribed exempt promoter**) must **notify the Minister** in a form and manner authorized by the Minister **when a fee exceeds the maximum fee**.
- The notification must include:
  - The name of the claimant or dependent;
  - The amount of the fee charged;
  - The date of the fee;
  - The nature of the service provided.

> **Purpose**: To ensure transparency and allow the CRA to monitor compliance and detect potential fraud or abuse.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on False or Deceptive Entries (Section 5)**

- It is **prohibited** for a promoter to:
  - Make,
  - Participate in,
  - Assent to, or
  - Acquiesce in
  the making of **false or deceptive entries** in a notification required under Section 4.

> **Rationale**: Prevents promoters from misrepresenting fees, services, or claimant details to evade penalties or mislead the CRA.

---

#### **7. Offences and Penalties (Section 6)**

##### **Failure to Notify or False Notification (Section 6 – Offence)**  
- Violation of Section 4 or Section 5 constitutes an **offence**.
- Penalties:
  - **Summary conviction** (less formal court process);
  - Fine of **not less than $1,000 and not more than $25,000**.

##### **Excess Fee Violation (Section 3 – Offence)**  
- Violation of Section 3 (charging over the maximum fee) is also an offence.
- Penalty:
  - **Fine of not less than 100% and not more than 200%** of the total amount by which the fee exceeds the maximum fee.

> **Key Point**: The penalty is directly proportional to the overcharge, creating a strong disincentive for overcharging.

---

#### **8. Exemptions and Regulatory Flexibility (Section 9 and General Power)**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting through Cabinet) may make **regulations** to:
  - Set the **maximum fee**;
  - **Exempt certain promoters** (e.g., small businesses, non-profits, or specific professionals) from the notification requirement;
  - **Prescribe other matters** (e.g., forms, procedures, definitions) that are "to be prescribed" under this Act.

> This flexibility allows the government to adapt to changing economic conditions, service models, or industry practices.

---

#### **9. Application of Income Tax Act Provisions (Section 7)**

- Sections of the **Income Tax Act** that are relevant to disability tax credit requests are **applied with modifications** as needed. These include:
  - Sections 152, 158, 159
  - Subsections 161(1) and (11)
  - Sections 162 to 167
  - Section 257
  - Division J of Part I
  - Part XV

> These provisions govern:
> - Eligibility for disability tax credits;
> - Tax deductions for disability-related expenses;
> - Overpayment and refund processes;

> **Note**: The Act allows for **modifications** to these sections to ensure they align with the new regulatory framework for promoters.

#### **10. Information Access and Disclosure (Section 241 of the Income Tax Act)**

- **Section 241** (which normally restricts access to personal tax information) **does not apply** to information or documents that are:
  - Reasonably necessary for the **administration or enforcement** of this Act.
- Authorized officials (e.g., CRA officers) may:
  - Request or provide such information;
  - Make copies available to **any person** for purposes related to the enforcement of this Act.

> This provision ensures that investigators, auditors, or legal representatives can access necessary data to verify compliance with the Act.
