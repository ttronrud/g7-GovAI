**Detailed Summary of the *Port of Montreal Operations Act, 2021***

---

### **Overview**

The *Port of Montreal Operations Act, 2021* is a special legislative measure enacted by the Government of Canada to address a critical labor dispute at the Port of Montreal. It was introduced in response to a prolonged impasse between the **Maritime Employers Association (MEA)** — representing employers — and the **Syndicat des débardeurs – Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 375 (CUPU)** — representing port workers — following the expiration of their collective agreement on **December 31, 2018**.

The Act establishes an **exceptional, emergency framework** to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the Port of Montreal, prevent economic disruption, and facilitate a swift resolution of industrial disputes through binding arbitration. It is not a permanent labor law but a targeted intervention designed to stabilize operations during a high-stakes bargaining deadlock.

---

## **Key Background and Context**

- The previous collective agreement expired on **December 31, 2018**.
- Since **September 4, 2018**, the parties had been engaged in collective bargaining to reach a new agreement.
- The **Minister of Labour** recognized that:
  - Effective collective bargaining is essential for stable industrial relations.
  - A work stoppage (e.g., strike or lockout) at the Port of Montreal would have severe negative consequences for the economy, supply chains, and public services.
- Given these risks, the government concluded that an **exceptional solution** was required to avoid a prolonged shutdown.

Thus, the Act was passed to:
- **Mandate the resumption of operations** immediately.
- **Prohibit strikes and lockouts** during the interim period.
- **Establish a neutral mediator-arbitrator** to resolve disputes over the terms of a new collective agreement.
- Ensure that the parties negotiate in good faith under a legally binding and enforceable framework.
