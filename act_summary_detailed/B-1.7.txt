**Detailed Summary of the *Bank of British Columbia Business Continuation Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Bank of British Columbia Business Continuation Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the **sale of the assets of the Bank of British Columbia (the "Bank")** to a third party (a "purchasing bank") in a structured, legally sound manner, ensuring continuity of operations during the transition, while protecting stakeholders, including depositors, shareholders, and the public.

This Act **supersedes certain provisions of the Bank Act** in relation to asset sales, but does **not alter the fundamental application of the Bank Act** to the purchasing bank—except for a specific exemption regarding the deposit insurance provisions.

### **Core Provisions and Key Functions**

#### **1. Authority to Sell Assets**
- The Bank may sell **all or part of its assets** to a purchasing bank.
- The terms of the sale must be set out in a **sale agreement** signed between the Bank and the purchasing bank.

#### **2. Approval by Governor in Council**
- A sale agreement is **not effective until approved by the Governor in Council**.
- Approval is **only possible if the Minister recommends it**.
- Upon approval, the agreement becomes binding and effective **despite any winding-up proceedings or court orders**.

> This ensures that the sale process is not subject to arbitrary or premature termination and provides legal certainty to the purchasing bank.

#### **3. Vesting of Assets in the Purchasing Bank**
- Upon Governor in Council approval:
  - The purchasing bank **becomes liable** for all obligations of the Bank that have been assumed under the agreement.
  - The Bank ceases to be liable for those obligations.
  - The Bank must execute any necessary **conveyances, assignments, or assurances** to transfer full ownership of the assets to the purchasing bank.

> This effectively transfers both ownership and liability to the purchasing bank.

#### **4. Business Operations Post-Sale**
- After approval of the sale agreement, the Bank may **only continue operating to the extent necessary** to:
  - Carry out the sale agreement.
  - Wind up its business.

> This ensures that the Bank does not engage in unrelated or ongoing operations after the sale.

#### **5. Shareholder Approval of Consideration**
- The sale agreement must be **submitted to shareholders** at a special meeting.
- At least **two weeks before** the meeting, directors must send:
  - A copy of the sale agreement.
  - A notice of the meeting.
  - A management proxy circular (to allow shareholders to vote via proxy).
- A **resolution** is placed before shareholders to approve the **consideration (value)** received by the Bank from the sale.

> This provides shareholders with a formal opportunity to review and approve the financial return of the transaction.

#### **6. Release of Trust Amount**
- If the shareholders approve the consideration:
  - The **trust amount** (money paid into the trust account) is **immediately released to the Bank**.
- If the shareholders **do not approve** the consideration:
  - The Governor in Council appoints an **assessor** to determine the value of the Bank’s assets and obligations.

> The trust amount is held in trust until either shareholder approval or an independent valuation is completed.

---

### **Role of the Assessor**

When shareholder approval is not obtained:

1. **Appointment of Assessor**:
   - The Governor in Council appoints an assessor as soon as practicable.
   - The assessor has **all powers of a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act**, including the authority to examine facts, assess values, and issue reports.

2. **Determination of Net Values**:
   - The assessor determines two key values:
     - **Net value**: The net realizable value of the Bank’s assets **less its obligations**, as of the day before the Act came into force.
     - **Net retained value**: The net realizable value of assets and obligations **retained by the Bank** under the sale agreement.

3. **Factors Considered**:
   - Likelihood of profitability and viability of the Bank as an independent institution.
   - Potential for selling assets to someone other than the purchasing bank.
   - Risk of appointing a curator or winding up the Bank.

4. **Finality of Determination**:
   - The assessor’s determination and report are **final, conclusive, and binding**.
   - **No court review or appeal** is permitted.

5. **Distribution of Trust Amount Based on Determination**:
   - **If net value ≥ (trust amount + net retained value)**:
     - The **entire trust amount** is released to the Bank.
     - Any **excess** over the sum is paid **to the Bank by CDIC** (the Corporation).
   - **If net value < (trust amount + net retained value)**:
     - The Bank receives **only the net value minus net retained value**.
     - The **remainder** of the trust amount is paid to the **Corporation (CDIC)**.

> This mechanism ensures that the Bank is not unfairly compensated and that CDIC is protected in the event of a loss.

#### **7. Protection of Purchasing Bank Rights**
- Any release of funds to the Bank is **subject to the terms of the sale agreement**, including any rights, remedies, or protections granted to the purchasing bank.

> This protects the purchasing bank from arbitrary or unjust distributions.

### **Dissolution of the Bank**

- The directors may **resolve to liquidate and dissolve** the Bank.
- On behalf of the Bank, they may apply to the Minister for **letters patent dissolving the Bank**.
- This application is **deemed to have been made under Section 287 of the Bank Act**, but with modifications:
  - Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 287 **do not apply** to the Bank.
  - A reference to subsection (3) of Section 287 is treated as a reference to **subsection (1) of this Act**.

> This streamlines the dissolution process and removes procedural barriers that would otherwise apply in standard bank wind-ups.

---

### **Name Change Approval**

- The Minister may, **with Governor in Council approval**, approve a proposal to change the name of the Bank.
- This requires **no special resolution** from shareholders.
- It provides flexibility for branding or repositioning post-sale.

---

### **Liability and Immunity Provisions**

- **No liability** is imposed on:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada.
  - The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).
  - Any person acting on behalf of either.
- This immunity applies to **any act or omission done in good faith** under this Act.

> This protects government entities and officials from personal or institutional liability arising from administrative or procedural decisions under the Act.

---

### **Effective Date and Note**
- The Act came into force on **November 27, 1986**.
- This date is referenced in the note as the starting point for valuation and other financial calculations.

### **Significance and Context**

This Act was enacted during a period of financial restructuring in Canadian banking. It provides a **clear, legally robust framework** for the sale of a failing or underperforming bank without triggering full insolvency or public intervention. It balances:

- The need for **financial stability** (protecting depositors via CDIC),
- The need for **operational continuity** (allowing the Bank to wind down smoothly),
- The need for **transparency and accountability** (through shareholder approval and independent valuation).

It is a model of **pragmatic regulatory intervention**, allowing a bank to exit the market in an orderly fashion while minimizing risks to the broader financial system.
