**Detailed Summary of the *Shared Services Canada Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Shared Services Canada Act* establishes **Shared Services Canada (SSC)** as a centralized, single shared services entity within the Canadian federal government. The primary objective of the Act is to **standardize, consolidate, and streamline administrative services** across government departments and Crown corporations. By doing so, the Government of Canada aims to improve service delivery, increase operational efficiency, and ensure more effective and accountable use of public funds.

This Act creates a new department — **Shared Services Canada** — to provide standardized administrative services to other departments and Crown corporations, while also enabling flexibility in certain cases to meet exceptional needs.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Rationale**
- The Government recognizes that administrative services (e.g., human resources, finance, procurement, information technology) are often duplicated across departments.
- Consolidating these services into a single, centralized entity allows for:
  - Greater efficiency
  - Cost savings through economies of scale
  - Improved quality and consistency of service
  - Better use of public money

> This is not just a reorganization — it is a strategic shift toward shared service delivery to modernize federal operations.

---

### **2. Definitions**
Key terms are defined to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the Act:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Crown corporation** | As defined in subsection 83(1) of the *Financial Administration Act* — a corporation owned by the Crown. |
| **Department** | As defined in section 2 of the *Financial Administration Act* — a federal government ministry or agency. |
| **President** | The head of Shared Services Canada, appointed under section 10(1). |
| **Appropriate Minister** | As defined in section 2 of the *Financial Administration Act* — the minister responsible for a given department (e.g., Minister of Finance, Minister of Health). |
| **Chief Executive** | For departments listed in Part I of Schedule VI: Deputy Minister; for those in Parts II or III: person holding the designated position; otherwise: chief executive officer, deputy head, or equivalent. |

These definitions ensure that responsibilities and delegation flows are clearly understood and legally grounded.

### **3. Establishment of Shared Services Canada**
- A **new department** called *Shared Services Canada* is established under section 4.
- It is created to assist the **Minister** (the Minister responsible for public administration) in delivering specific administrative services.
- The **Minister presides over** Shared Services Canada and has overall management and direction of its operations.

> This structure ensures that the Minister maintains accountability and strategic oversight.

---

### **4. Powers and Authority of the Minister**
The Minister has broad powers to determine what services are delivered through Shared Services Canada:

#### **(a) Specifying Services**
The Governor in Council may specify:
- **Mandatory services** that must be provided through SSC (i.e., departments must obtain these services *only* from SSC).
- **Optional services** that may be provided through SSC (departments may choose to use them or provide them internally).
- **Departments required to obtain mandatory services exclusively** from SSC and not internally.
- **Departments and Crown corporations eligible** for services from SSC.
- **Departments and Crown corporations excluded** from receiving services from SSC.
- **Terms and conditions** governing the provision of services (e.g., pricing, performance standards, service levels).

> This gives the government flexibility to define service boundaries based on efficiency, cost, and operational needs.

#### **(b) Delegation of Powers**
To facilitate service delivery, the Minister may delegate powers under section 7 (which includes powers from the *Department of Public Works and Government Services Act*) to:
- The **appropriate Minister** of a department (for services provided to that department).
- The **chief executive** of a department, even if the Minister does not preside over it — provided the department’s chief executive is the appropriate Minister.

> This enables decentralized decision-making at the department level while maintaining oversight.

#### **(c) Sub-delegation**
- The **appropriate Minister** can subdelegate to the **chief executive**.
- The **chief executive** can further subdelegate to any person within their jurisdiction.

> This creates a tiered delegation structure, allowing for operational agility and responsiveness at the department level.

> All delegations must be made under conditions deemed suitable by the delegating authority and must be subject to the overall framework of the Act.

---

### **5. Service Provision to External Entities**
- The Minister may provide services through Shared Services Canada to:
  - Any **department**
  - Any **Crown corporation**
  - Any **foreign government** or other **person, organization, or government** (with Governor in Council approval)

> This opens the possibility of international cooperation or cross-border service delivery, enhancing Canada’s global engagement.

---

### **6. Charging for Services**
- The Minister may **charge fees** for services provided under this Act.
- However, such charges are subject to **regulations made by the Treasury Board** to ensure fairness, transparency, and consistency.

> This ensures financial accountability and allows the government to recover costs where appropriate, without compromising service access.

---

### **7. Exceptions for Exceptional Circumstances**
Despite mandatory exclusivity rules (e.g., a department must obtain a service only from SSC), the Minister may, in exceptional circumstances:
- **Authorize a department to obtain part of the service internally** (i.e., not through SSC), or
- **Authorize a department to obtain all of the service for a portion of its operations** (but not the entire department) internally.

> This provides flexibility to address unique operational needs, such as legacy systems, regional requirements, or urgent staffing needs.

> The department must comply with any instructions provided by the Minister in such cases.

> The Minister must **personally exercise** this power — no delegation is allowed.

---

### **8. Leadership and Governance**
- The **Governor in Council** appoints:
  - The **President of Shared Services Canada** (during pleasure)
  - An **Executive Vice-President** (during pleasure)

> "During pleasure" means the appointment can be terminated at any time by the Governor in Council.

- The **President** is the **deputy head** of Shared Services Canada.
- The **Executive Vice-President** acts as President if:
  - The President is absent
  - The President is incapacitated
  - The President's office is vacant

> This ensures continuity of leadership and operational stability.

- Remuneration for both positions is set by the Governor in Council.

---

### **9. Location and Employment**
- The **head office** of Shared Services Canada must be located in the **National Capital Region**, as defined in the *National Capital Act* schedule.
- Employees required for SSC’s operations are appointed in accordance with the **Public Service Employment Act** — ensuring compliance with public service standards, merit principles, and fair hiring practices.

---

### **10. Legal and Regulatory Clarifications (Access to Information and Privacy)**
To prevent confusion about data ownership and control:

#### **Access to Information Act (ATIA)**
- Records of other government institutions or organizations that are **stored in or on SSC’s IT systems** are **not under the control of Shared Services Canada**.
- These records remain the responsibility of their originating institution.

#### **Privacy Act**
- Personal information collected by other institutions or organizations and stored in SSC’s systems is **not under the control of SSC**.
- The original institution remains responsible for privacy obligations.

> This protects institutional autonomy and ensures compliance with privacy laws.
