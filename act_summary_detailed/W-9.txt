**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Wildlife Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Canada Wildlife Act* (CWA) is a foundational piece of Canadian federal legislation designed to protect and conserve wildlife and their habitats. Though the Act has undergone significant amendments and repeals over time, the current version reflects a modernized framework focused on scientific research, habitat protection, intergovernmental cooperation, and enforcement mechanisms. It establishes the legal authority for the federal government—specifically the Minister of the Environment—to manage, protect, and promote wildlife conservation across Canada, including in federal public lands and marine areas.

The Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada and the provinces, and it applies to all wild animals, plants, and organisms, as well as their natural habitats.

## **Key Definitions and Repealed Provisions**

### **1. Key Definitions**
- **Chief Review Officer**: Refers to the designated review officer under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA), including any officer appointed or designated to perform the functions of the Chief Review Officer. This role is central to administrative review and appeals.
- **Conveyance**: Includes vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, or any device used to transport persons or goods. This broad definition supports enforcement powers related to movement of wildlife-related items.
- **Minister**: Initially refers to the Minister of the Environment. In cases involving the *Northern Pipeline*, it may refer to a designated member of the Queen’s Privy Council.
- **Public Lands**: Defined broadly to include:
  - Lands owned by Her Majesty in right of Canada;
  - Lands that the federal government has power to dispose of, subject to provincial agreements;
  - Any waters on or flowing through these lands;
  - Internal waters, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Canada;
  - The natural resources of these lands.

> *Note: The original definition of "wildlife" was repealed in 1994 (s. 4, c. 23), and the definition of "possession" was repealed in 2024 (s. 5, c. 30). These changes reflect modernization and alignment with broader environmental legislation.*
