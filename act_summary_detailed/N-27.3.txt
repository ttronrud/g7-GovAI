The provided text appears to be a **summary or excerpt from a Canadian Act of Parliament**, specifically indicating that a particular provision or set of provisions has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Bill C-2, 2014**, under **Section 66**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Text**
The text begins with a standard legislative preamble:
> *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*

This is the formal opening of a statute enacted by the Parliament of Canada. It signifies that the law is being passed under the constitutional authority of the Crown, acting on the advice of the elected legislative bodies — the Senate and the House of Commons.

However, **the entire body of the enacted provisions that follows is marked with repeated references to repeal**:
> `[Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 66]` — repeated 66 times.

This indicates that **the section(s) or provisions previously listed or referenced in a prior act have been formally repealed** by **Section 66 of Bill C-2, 2014** (the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2014*, or another related bill, depending on context).

---

#### 2. **What Does "Repealed" Mean?**
- "Repealed" means that a law, rule, or section of a law is **officially canceled or abolished**.
- In this case, **multiple provisions** (possibly dozens or even hundreds) from a previous act or part of an act were **removed from the legal framework**.
- The repeal is effective from **2014**, specifically through **the enactment of the legislation known as Chapter 2 of the Statutes of Canada in 2014** (Bill C-2).

---

#### 3. **Legal Context and Significance**
- The repeated notation suggests that **a large number of provisions were removed**, possibly due to:
  - Legislative modernization
  - Redundancy
  - Inconsistencies with current laws
  - Policy changes
  - Overlapping or outdated regulations
- The fact that the repeal is attributed to **Section 66 of Bill C-2, 2014** implies that this section of the bill specifically **contains the list or mechanism for repealing prior laws**.

> Note: Bill C-2, 2014, is commonly known as the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2014*, or sometimes referred to in the context of reforms related to criminal law, including provisions on hate crimes, child protection, or sentencing.

---

#### 4. **Why This Matters**
- **Legal Clarity**: Removing outdated or obsolete provisions ensures that the law is current, coherent, and easier to interpret.
- **Efficiency**: It streamlines the legal code by eliminating redundant or conflicting rules.
- **Policy Alignment**: Repeals often reflect shifts in government priorities or societal values.

---

#### 5. **Important Caveat**
- The text **does not contain any new legislation** — it only lists repeals.
- There is **no substantive law being enacted** in this section.
- Therefore, **this is not an act that creates new rights, obligations, or penalties**, but rather one that **removes existing ones**.

### Conclusion:

> The provided text is a **formal legislative notice indicating that a number of provisions (or sections) from a prior Canadian Act have been formally repealed** by **Section 66 of Bill C-2, 2014**.  
>  
> The repeated `[Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 66]` entries confirm that the legislation enacted in 2014 removed these provisions from the legal code.  
>  
> This action reflects a common practice in law-making: **modernizing and streamlining statutes** by eliminating outdated, redundant, or obsolete rules.  
>  
> As such, **no new legal content is introduced in this excerpt** — only the **cancellation of prior legal provisions**.
