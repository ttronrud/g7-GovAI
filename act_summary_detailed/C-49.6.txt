**Detailed Summary of the *Crown Corporations Dissolution or Transfer Authorization Act***

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Crown Corporations Dissolution or Transfer Authorization Act* is a legislative instrument enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. The Act provides the legal authority for the Canadian federal government to dissolve, transfer, or dispose of assets from various Crown-owned corporations. It serves as a mechanism to streamline operations, reduce administrative costs, and reallocate responsibilities among government departments or entities.

The Act is structured to authorize specific actions related to the dissolution or transfer of ownership in several Crown corporations, including Canada Harbour Place Corporation, the Canadian Livestock Feed Board, Canadian Patents and Development Limited, Harbourfront Corporation, and Mingan Associates, Ltd. It also includes provisions governing the vesting of property, liabilities, and rights during such transitions.
