**Detailed Summary of the *Provincial Subsidies Act***

The *Provincial Subsidies Act* is a historical legislative instrument enacted in the context of post-Confederation Canada, primarily to address financial imbalances, compensate provinces for lost revenue, and settle long-standing claims between the federal government and provincial governments. It establishes a comprehensive framework for annual subsidies, capital adjustments, and indemnities based on historical debts, population changes, and specific provincial needs.

### **1. General Citation and Purpose**
- The Act is formally titled the *Provincial Subsidies Act*.
- Its primary purpose is to provide financial support to the provinces of Canada, particularly in compensation for lost revenues or disadvantages arising from Confederation, and to settle historical claims related to union terms, debt, and population-based entitlements.

### **2. Compensation for Loss of Export Duties – New Brunswick**
- **Key Provision**: The Province of New Brunswick is entitled to an **annual subsidy of $150,000**, in addition to any existing subsidy it receives.
- **Reason for Payment**: This indemnity compensates New Brunswick for the **repeal of export duties on lumber** that were previously imposed by the federal government. These duties were a significant source of revenue for the province, and their removal is seen as a financial loss.
- **Condition**: The subsidy continues as long as no new export duties are imposed by the provincial or federal legislature.

### **3. Annual Subsidies to Prince Edward Island (PEI)**
- **Two Separate Annual Allowances**:
  1. **$20,000 annually** – Paid **half-yearly in advance** on **July 1 and January 1**.
  2. **$30,000 annually** – Also paid **half-yearly on July 1 and January 1**.
- **Total Annual Payment to PEI**: $50,000.
- **Purpose of the $30,000 Allowance**:
  - This sum is specifically designated to **settle all claims** made by Prince Edward Island against the Government of Canada regarding the **non-fulfilment of union terms** related to the **maintenance of efficient steam communication** between the island and the mainland.
  - This reflects a historical grievance over inadequate transportation infrastructure, which hindered economic development and integration with the mainland.

### **4. Subsidy to Manitoba**
The subsidy to Manitoba is structured in several components:

#### a) **Support of Government and Legislature**
- **$50,000 annually** – For general government operations and legislative functions.

#### b) **Population-Based Per Capita Allowance**
- **Base Amount**: $120,000 annually, based on a population of **150,000** at **80 cents per capita**.
- **Adjustment Mechanism**:
  - A **census is conducted every five years**, starting from 1881.
  - Population estimates are made between censuses.
  - If the population **exceeds 150,000**, the per capita allowance increases proportionally.
  - The increase continues **up to a maximum population of 400,000**.
  - This ensures that Manitoba’s subsidy grows with population growth, reflecting its expanding needs.

#### c) **Indemnity for Lack of Public Lands**
- **$100,000 annually** – Compensation for the **absence of public lands** available for provincial development and settlement.
- This reflects a historical disadvantage: Manitoba entered Confederation without sufficient land grants, which limited its ability to develop agriculture and infrastructure.

#### d) **Total Annual Subsidy to Manitoba**
- Base: $50,000 (government support) + $120,000 (population-based) + $100,000 (land indemnity) = **$270,000 annually**.

#### e) **Additional Obligations**
- Manitoba is **charged with**:
  - Advances made by Canada prior to **July 20, 1885**, for local purposes.
  - Expenditures made by Canada for strictly local projects.
  - A **further advance of $150,000** to cover the cost of constructing a **lunatic asylum** and other exceptional services.
- These advances are **deemed part of Manitoba’s debt** and must be repaid under agreed conditions.

#### f) **Settlement of Historical Claims**
- The **grant of swamp lands** and **up to 150,000 acres** of land as an endowment to the **University of Manitoba**, authorized under the *Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act*, along with the payments described above, constitute a **full settlement** of all claims:
  - For costs incurred in governing the **disputed territory**.
  - For the **boundary dispute** with Canada.
  - For any other claims discussed between Canada and provincial governments **up to January 10, 1885**.

### **5. Adjustment of Provincial Debts Based on Confederation Debt**
This section adjusts the **debt-based subsidies** for several provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia) based on **historical debt** and **population proportions**.

#### a) **General Principle**
- The amount of subsidy payable to each province is adjusted so that the **debt with which it entered Confederation** is increased in proportion to the **population** of the province, as measured by the **1881 census**.
- The adjustment is applied **equally** to all provinces, with the increase based on the **same proportion** as the increase in debt for the larger provinces.

#### b) **Specific Adjustments**
- **Ontario and Quebec**:
  - Their original debt (under Section 112 of the *Constitution Act, 1867*) is increased from **$62.5 million** to **$73.688,84**.
- **Nova Scotia**:
  - Original debt under Section 114 is increased from **$8 million** to **$9.186,756**.
- **New Brunswick**:
  - Debt under Section 115 is increased in the **same proportion** as Nova Scotia and Ontario.
- **British Columbia**:
  - The interest-bearing debt on which it was admitted into Confederation is increased in the **same proportion**.

#### c) **Application of the Adjustment**
- The increased subsidy is **calculated as if** the higher amounts had been set in the original Constitution Act.
- The adjustment is applied **from the date of Confederation (July 1, 1867)**.

#### d) **Capitalization of Past Subsidies**
- The total amount of **half-yearly subsidies** that would have been paid from **July 1, 1867, to January 1, 1873**, under the adjusted terms, **plus interest at 5% per annum** from the payment date to **July 1, 1884**, is deemed **capital owing** to the provinces.
- This capital:
  - Bears **interest at 5% per annum**.
  - Is **paid as part of the annual subsidy** from Canada.

### **6. Adjustment for British Columbia and Prince Edward Island**
- The **debt amounts** for British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, as of **April 19, 1884**, are increased in proportion to their **populations** as per the **1881 census**.
- The increase is calculated **in the same ratio** as the total increase in capital owed to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, relative to their combined population in 1881.
- These increases are also **deemed capital** and bear **interest at 5% per annum**, payable as part of the annual subsidy.

### **7. Capital and Interest Calculations – Summary Table**
| Province | Capital Increase | Interest Rate | Payment Method |
|--------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Ontario & Quebec (jointly) | Based on increased debt (from $62.5M to $73.688,84M) | 5% per annum | As part of annual subsidy |
| Nova Scotia | From $8M to $9.186,756 | 5% per annum | As part of annual subsidy |
| New Brunswick | Increased in same proportion as others | 5% per annum | As part of annual subsidy |
| British Columbia | Increased in proportion to population | 5% per annum | As part of annual subsidy |
| Prince Edward Island | Increased in proportion to population | 5% per annum | As part of annual subsidy |

> The capital is treated as a **debt owed by Canada**, and interest is paid annually as part of the subsidy.

### **8. Additional Provisions on Provincial Advances**

    - The advance is **sanctioned by the provincial legislature**.
- **Nature of Advances**:
