## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1996**

### 🔹 **Overview and Purpose**
The *Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1996* (the "Act") is a Canadian federal law enacted to give legal effect to bilateral income tax treaties between Canada and five foreign countries:  
- Russia  
- South Africa  
- Tanzania  
- India  
- Ukraine  

The primary purpose of the Act is to **avoid double taxation** and **prevent fiscal evasion** related to income and capital taxes by establishing a legal framework under which these international tax agreements are enforceable within Canada. It ensures that tax rules from these treaties are recognized and applied consistently with Canadian tax law.

---

## 🔍 **Structure of the Act**

The Act is structured into **five distinct parts**, each corresponding to one bilateral tax agreement. Each part:

1. Defines the name and scope of the treaty.
2. Establishes the definition of key terms.
3. Confirms that the treaty has the force of law in Canada during its period of validity.
4. Provides rules for resolving conflicts with other laws.
5. Grants regulatory and notification powers to government ministers.

> **Note**: Despite being titled a single Act, it contains five separate "Parts," each governing a different country. This reflects Canada’s practice of implementing multiple bilateral tax treaties through a single legislative framework.

## 🔧 Key Provisions by Part

### ✅ General Principles (Common to All Five Parts)

| Provision | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **1. Legal Force of the Agreement** | The treaty (whether called an "Agreement" or "Convention") is approved and has the force of law in Canada during the period it is in force under its own terms. |
| **2. Precedence Over Other Laws** | If there is a conflict between the treaty and any other Canadian law, the treaty provisions prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. |
| **3. Precedence Over Interpretation Act** | If there is a conflict between the treaty and the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*, the latter prevails. This ensures consistency in how treaties are interpreted. |
| **4. Regulatory Authority** | The **Minister of National Revenue** may make regulations necessary to implement the treaty or give effect to its provisions. |
| **5. Notification Requirement** | The **Minister of Finance** must publish a notice in the *Canada Gazette* within 60 days of the treaty’s entry into force or termination, specifying the dates. |

These provisions ensure that the treaties are not only legally binding but also practically implementable and transparently governed.
