### **Summary of the Text**

> *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*  
> [Repealed, 2003, c. 15, s. 43]

> [Repealed, 2003, c. 15, s. 43]  
> ... (repeated nine times)

### **Key Interpretation**

1. **Nature of the Document**:
   - The text begins with a formal legal preamble indicating that the document is an **Act of Parliament** (a law passed by the Canadian Parliament).
   - The phrase *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada"* is the standard legal form used in Canadian statutes to denote that a law has been passed through the legislative process.

2. **Repeal Notice**:
   - Each line after the preamble contains the phrase: **"[Repealed, 2003, c. 15, s. 43]"**.
   - This means that **the entire section or the act being referenced was officially repealed** (cancelled or replaced) by **section 43 of Chapter 15 of the Statutes of Canada in 2003**.
   - The reference **"c. 15"** refers to the **Statutes of Canada 2003, Chapter 15**, which is the **Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2003**, or another act passed that year.
   - **Section 43** of that chapter specifically repealed the provisions in question.

3. **Implication**:
   - The content that was originally intended to be enacted — which would have been detailed in the "enacts as follows" section — **does not exist in current law**.
   - The repeated "repealed" entries suggest that either:
     - The original act had multiple provisions or subsections that were all repealed.
     - The document is a placeholder or incomplete version of a statute that was never fully drafted or published.
     - It may be a copy of a statute that was drafted but later revoked without substantive content being added.

4. **Legal Status**:
   - As of **2003**, this provision is **no longer in force**.
   - It is **not applicable** in current Canadian law.
   - Any legal reference to this provision would be considered **outdated or invalid**.

### **Conclusion**

The provided text is **a repealed statute** that was officially canceled in 2003 under **Section 43 of Chapter 15 of the Statutes of Canada**. The legislative preamble indicates the formal process of enactment, but the actual provisions (the "enacts as follows" section) are missing or omitted. Since the entire section is marked as repealed, **no substantive law was ever enacted** from this document.

Therefore, **this act has no current legal effect** and should not be referenced in modern legal or regulatory contexts.
