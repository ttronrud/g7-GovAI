**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act* (COCD Act) is a legislative framework designed to establish clear and consistent standards for determining **Canadian ownership and control status** of individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, and other entities. Its primary purpose is to assess whether a person is "Canadian controlled" — a key factor in determining eligibility for certain types of investments, approvals, or benefits under Canadian foreign investment and ownership regimes.

This Act operates in conjunction with the *Foreign Investment Review Act (FIRA)* and provides a structured methodology for evaluating ownership structures, including both **formal equity** and **informal equity**, to determine whether a person is Canadian controlled or not. It also governs the issuance, revocation, amendment, and redetermination of **certificates of Canadian ownership and control status**.

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Certificate** | A formal document issued by the Minister of Natural Resources that confirms a person’s Canadian ownership rate and/or control status. |
| **Control Status** | Determines whether a person is "Canadian controlled" based on ownership structure and equity holdings. |
| **Direct Equity Percentage** | The percentage of formal equity directly owned by a person in another entity. If the entity has multiple classes of equity, it is calculated as the aggregate fair market value of the person’s equity divided by the total fair market value of all equity. |
| **Formal Equity** | Legally recognized ownership interests such as shares in a corporation, capital or income interests in a partnership, or beneficial interests in a trust. Excludes equity excluded by regulation. |
| **Informal Equity** | Interests or rights (not formal) to participate in or benefit from the assets, revenues, or business activities of another person — e.g., management rights, voting influence, or residual profit-sharing — subject to regulation. |
| **Investor** | A person who holds more than zero total equity percentage in an applicant for a certificate. |
| **Owned** | Means beneficially owned; used interchangeably with "owner" and "ownership." |
| **Person** | Includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, government bodies, segregated funds, and any other entity prescribed by regulation. |
| **Prescribed** | Refers to rules or procedures set out in regulations or by order of the Minister. |

## **Core Principles and Framework**

### **1. Determination of "Canadian Controlled" Status**
- A person is **Canadian controlled** if:
  - They are **not a non-eligible person**, and
  - They meet the ownership thresholds under this Act and regulations.
- A person is **not Canadian controlled** if they are a **non-eligible person**.

> **Non-eligible person**: Defined under the *Foreign Investment Review Act (FIRA)*, but with specific modifications in this Act:
> - As of **September 1, 1987**, subparagraph (a)(ii) of FIRA’s definition of non-eligible person is **deleted**.
> - The clause about permanent residents who have lived in Canada for over one year after becoming eligible for citizenship is **removed**.
> - This ensures that certain foreign nationals (especially long-term residents) may be treated differently than under the original FIRA.

> **For partnerships and trusts**, the Act treats them as **corporations** for the purposes of determining control:
> - The interests in capital or income are treated as **shares**.
> - Beneficial owners are treated as **shareholders**.
> - In a limited partnership, the **general partner** is treated as a **board member**.
> - In a trust, **beneficial interests** are treated as shares; **trustees** are treated as **board members**.

> **Minister’s FIRA Opinions Are Binding**:
> - If the Minister designated under FIRA determines a person is **not a non-eligible person**, they are deemed **Canadian controlled** for as long as that opinion remains binding.
> - If the Minister determines a person **is a non-eligible person** or demands notice, they are deemed **not Canadian controlled** until the opinion or demand ends.

### **2. Calculation of Total Equity Percentage**

To determine ownership, the Act uses a **layered equity calculation**:

#### **Direct Equity Percentage**
- The proportion of formal equity directly held by a person in another entity.

#### **Indirect Equity Percentage**
- Calculated by multiplying:
  - A person’s **direct equity** in another entity (say, A),
  - By the **total equity percentage** (direct + indirect) of that other entity in the applicant (say, B).

> Formula:  
> Indirect equity in applicant = (Person’s direct equity in A) × (A’s total equity in applicant)

> **Total Equity Percentage** =  
> (Direct equity in applicant) +  
> (Sum of [Equity in other person × that person’s direct equity in applicant])

This method allows for **multi-tiered ownership chains** to be accounted for — e.g., A owns 50% of B, and B owns 30% of C; the total equity of A in C is calculated through the chain.

### **3. Role of Informal Equity**
- The Minister may **adjust the Canadian ownership rate** based on **informal equity** if it is deemed appropriate in the circumstances.
- Informal equity includes non-legal ownership interests such as:
  - Management control
  - Decision-making power
  - Voting rights
  - Profit-sharing arrangements
- This gives flexibility to account for real-world influence beyond formal shareholding.

> **Note**: The Act allows the Minister to **exercise discretion** in adjusting ownership rates where informal influence is significant, even if not reflected in formal equity.
