**Detailed Summary of the *Industrial Design Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Industrial Design Act* establishes the legal framework for the registration, protection, and enforcement of **industrial designs** in Canada. It provides a system for protecting the **visual appearance** of finished products—such as shape, configuration, pattern, or ornament—that appeal to the eye and are not dictated solely by utilitarian function. The Act aligns with international standards, particularly the **Paris Convention**, and provides both domestic protection and mechanisms for international priority claims.

This summary provides a comprehensive, structured breakdown of the key provisions, objectives, and operational mechanisms of the Act.

## **2. The Register of Industrial Designs**

- The **Minister** maintains the **Register of Industrial Designs**, which records all registered designs.
- The register is **evidence of its contents**.
- A **certified copy** of an entry is admissible in court as proof of the particulars.
- The Minister may **correct obvious errors** in entries within six months of registration, provided the error is evident from documents in the Minister’s possession at the time of filing.

> **Purpose**: Ensures transparency, provides legal evidence of ownership, and supports enforcement.

---

## **3. Application for Registration**

To register a design, an applicant must:
- Pay **prescribed fees**.
- File an application containing:
  - The **name of the finished article**.
  - A **representation of the design** (complying with prescribed requirements).
  - Any **prescribed information or statements**.

### **Filing Date**
- The filing date is the date the Minister receives the application.
- If documents are received on different dates, the **latest date** is used.

### **Ownership and Filing Date**
- If, before registration, it is established that **another person was the actual proprietor** at the time of filing, the application is deemed filed by that person.
- This allows for transfer of rights during the application process.

## **4. Criteria for Registrability**

A design is registrable **only if** all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Compliance with the Act**: The application is filed in accordance with the Act.
2. **Novelty**: The design must be **new**—i.e., not previously disclosed publicly in Canada or elsewhere more than 12 months before the **priority date**.
3. **Authorship**: The design must have been created by the applicant or their predecessor in title.
4. **Non-Utilitarian Features**: The design must not consist only of features dictated by a utilitarian function (e.g., a chair’s ergonomic shape is utilitarian; its aesthetic form may be protected).
5. **No Public Morality or Order Violation**: The design must not be contrary to public morality or order.

> **Note**: The Act protects **visual appearance**, not function or technical innovation.

## **5. Priority Rights (Paris Convention Principles)**

Under the Paris Convention, applicants from member countries may claim **priority** to establish an earlier filing date.

### **Eligibility for Priority**
An applicant may claim priority if:
- On the filing date, they are a **citizen or national**, **domiciled in**, or have a **real and effective industrial or commercial establishment** in a **country of the Union**.
- They or their predecessor previously filed a **regular application** in or for a country of the Union disclosing the same design.
- The pending application is filed **within six months** of the earlier filing.
- A **request for priority** is submitted in accordance with regulations.

### **Priority Date**
- The priority date is the **filing date of the earlier application**, not the Canadian filing date.

### **Multiple Prior Applications**
- If multiple prior applications exist, the **earliest filing date** is used for both novelty assessment and priority determination.

### **When Priority Fails**
A previously filed application is deemed **never filed** if:
- More than **six months** have passed since its filing date.
- A **new application** for the same design was filed by the same person (or their successor/predecessor) in the same country **before** the pending application.
- The earlier application was **withdrawn, abandoned, or refused** without public disclosure and **did not serve as a basis for a priority claim** in any country.

> **Purpose**: Prevents applicants from gaining priority through multiple filings or delays.

---

## **6. Novelty Requirement (Section 8)**

A design is novel if:
- It has **not been disclosed** publicly in Canada or elsewhere **more than 12 months before the priority date** by:
  - The applicant or their predecessor in title.
  - A person who obtained knowledge **directly or indirectly** from the applicant or their predecessor.
- It has **not been disclosed** by any third party before the priority date.
- It has **not been disclosed** in a Canadian application filed before the priority date (unless withdrawn before public disclosure or registration).

> **Key Exception**: An application is deemed never filed if it is withdrawn before it becomes public or is registered.

---

## **7. Public Disclosure of Applications**

- The Minister must make the **application and all related documents** publicly available on a **prescribed date**.
- This date is the **later of**:
  - The date of registration.
  - **30 months after the filing date** of the application.
- **If a priority request is made**, the date is the **earliest filing date** of the previously filed application on which priority is claimed.
- **If the priority request is withdrawn before the prescribed date**, it is deemed never filed.
- **If the application is withdrawn before the prescribed date**, disclosure is **refused**.

> **Purpose**: Balances the need for transparency with the protection of confidential information during the examination phase.

---

## **8. Term of Protection**

- The **exclusive right** granted by registration lasts:
  - **10 years from the date of registration**, or
  - **15 years from the filing date** of the application—whichever is **longer**.
- The term begins on the **later of**:
  - The date of registration.
  - The date the application is made public (prescribed date in section 8.3).
- The term is **maintained** by the **payment of prescribed fees**.
- Failure to pay fees results in the **automatic expiration** of the exclusive right.

> **Note**: The 15-year term from filing is a significant advantage for early innovators, especially in fast-moving industries.

## **9. Infringement and Enforcement**

### **Prohibited Acts During the Term of Protection**
Without the **license of the proprietor**, no person may:
- Make, import, sell, rent, or offer for sale or rent:
  - Any article to which the registered design is applied.
  - Any design that **does not differ substantially** from the registered design.
- Do anything in relation to a **kit** that would constitute infringement if done with a fully assembled article.

> **Substantial Difference Test**: Courts consider how much the design differs from previously published designs when assessing infringement.

### **No Protection for Utilitarian Features**
- Features of a useful article that are **dictated solely by function** (e.g., a screwdriver’s shape for gripping) are **not protected**.
- Protection does **not extend** to:
  - Methods of manufacture or construction.
  - Functional features.

> **Purpose**: Ensures protection is limited to aesthetic elements, not technical or functional aspects.

---

## **10. Ownership and Transfer**

### **Authorship and First Proprietorship**
- The **author** of the design is the first proprietor unless:
  - The author created the design **for another person** in exchange for a **good and valuable consideration** (e.g., payment).
  - In that case, the **other person** becomes the first proprietor.

> **Note**: Co-ownership is limited to rights actually acquired.

### **Transferability**
- Designs (both registered and unregistered) are **transferable in whole or in part**.
- The Minister may record or register transfers:
  - On request of the applicant (for applications).
  - On request of a transferee, with satisfactory evidence.
- A transfer of an **unregistered design** is **void against a subsequent transferee** if the transfer to that transferee is **not registered**.
- The Minister may **remove** a transfer record if it is shown that
