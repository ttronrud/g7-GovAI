**Detailed Summary of the Statutes Repeal Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Statutes Repeal Act* is a legislative measure introduced by the Government of Canada to systematically review and repeal outdated or obsolete Acts of Parliament. It establishes a structured, annual process by which the Government identifies and repeals provisions of laws that have remained unenacted for a significant period—specifically, nine years or more—since their assent, and that were never brought into force by proclamation or order.

The primary objective of the Act is to **modernize the statute book**, eliminate obsolete or redundant legislation, reduce legal complexity, and improve legislative clarity and efficiency in Canadian law.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. Citation of the Act**
- The Act is officially titled: **"The Statutes Repeal Act"**.
- This title reflects its purpose: to repeal statutes that are no longer in force or have become obsolete.

---

#### **2. Annual Report Requirement**
- **Who**: The Minister of Justice is responsible for preparing and delivering the annual report.
- **When**: The report must be laid before both the **Senate and the House of Commons** on **any of the first five days** on which either House sits in a given calendar year.
- **Content of the Report**:
  - The report must list every **Act of Parliament** or **provision within an Act** that:
    1. Was **assented to nine years or more before the December 31 of the year immediately preceding the laying of the report**; and  
    2. Has **not come into force by December 31 of that preceding year**.
    - In other words, the law was passed and approved (assented to) at least nine years ago, but it was never activated (i.e., never came into force) by proclamation or order from the Governor in Council.

> 🔍 *Example*: If the report is laid in January 2025, it will include provisions assented to on or before December 31, 2015 (nine years prior), that did not come into force by December 31, 2015.

---

#### **3. Automatic Repeal of Listed Acts/Provisions**
- Every Act or provision listed in the annual report is **repealed on December 31 of the year in which the report is laid**, **unless**:
  - It comes into force **on or before December 31** of that year; or  
  - During that year (i.e., within the calendar year the report is laid), **either House of Parliament adopts a resolution** stating that the Act or provision **should not be repealed**.

> ✅ This means that if a provision is still needed for legal or practical purposes, Parliament can intervene and prevent its repeal through a formal resolution.

> ⚠️ Repeal is automatic unless overridden by parliamentary action.

---

#### **4. Publication in the Canada Gazette**
- The Minister of Justice must publish **each year** in the *Canada Gazette* a list of all Acts or provisions that were **repealed on the preceding December 31** under this Act.
- This ensures **public transparency** and provides a clear, official record of legislative changes.

> 📚 The *Canada Gazette* is the official journal of the Government of Canada and serves as a public record of laws and regulatory changes.

---

#### **5. Exemption from Repeal (Section 2 Exclusion)**
- **Section 2 does not apply** to:
  1. Any provision that was **amended by an Act that was assented to during the nine calendar years before the year this Act comes into force**; or  
  2. Any provision that is **necessary for the amended provision to have effect**, until the calendar year following the **ninth anniversary of the assent** of the amending Act.

> 💡 This provision protects **amended or updated legislation** from being automatically repealed, even if the original provision was long dormant. It ensures that changes made to laws in the recent past are not lost due to the automatic repeal mechanism.

> 🔍 *Example*: If an Act was amended in 2018, and the amendment was assented to in 2018, then the original provision (which may have been inactive for years) is protected from repeal until after 2027 (nine years after 2018), even if it had not come into force.

> 🛡️ This safeguard prevents unintended legal gaps or disruptions when laws are updated.

---

#### **6. Coming Into Force**
- The Act **comes into force two years after the day on which it receives royal assent**.
- This delay ensures that the repeal process begins only after sufficient time has passed to allow for proper planning, administrative review, and public awareness.

> 📅 Example: If the Act receives royal assent on June 18, 2010, it comes into force on June 18, 2012.

> ✅ The note at the end of the text confirms: *"Act in force on June 18, 2010"* — this is a likely typo or misstatement. It should read: *"The Act comes into force on June 18, 2012"*, as per the two-year delay rule.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The *Statutes Repeal Act* serves several important functions:

1. **Legal Modernization**: Removes laws that are no longer relevant, outdated, or redundant, thereby streamlining the legislative framework.
2. **Transparency and Accountability**: The annual report and public publication in the *Canada Gazette* ensure that the public and Parliament are informed about which laws are being removed.
3. **Parliamentary Oversight**: The ability of either House to block a repeal through a resolution gives Parliament a mechanism to preserve laws deemed important or necessary.
4. **Protection of Legislative Integrity**: The exemption for recently amended laws prevents the loss of critical legal changes due to automatic repeal.
5. **Efficiency in Law Reform**: By focusing on laws that have been dormant for over nine years, the Act targets obsolete statutes without disrupting current legal systems.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No automatic repeal of active laws**: Only laws that have not come into force and were passed more than nine years ago are affected.
- **Parliamentary discretion**: The power to block repeal through a resolution ensures that important or practical laws can survive even if they are long dormant.
- **Exclusion of amendments**: The protection for provisions amended within the last nine years ensures that legal reforms are not undone by the repeal mechanism.

### **Conclusion**

The *Statutes Repeal Act* is a well-designed, proactive tool for legislative streamlining. It enables Canada to maintain a clean, up-to-date statute book by identifying and repealing long-dormant laws. Through a structured, transparent, and accountable process involving the Minister of Justice, Parliament, and the public, the Act balances the need for legal modernization with the need to preserve essential or recently updated provisions.

It reflects a broader commitment to **legal efficiency**, **good governance**, and **public accountability** in the Canadian legal system.

**Final Note**: The Act is in force as of **June 18, 2012** (not 2010), due to the two-year delay from royal assent. The note stating "Act in force on June 18, 2010" appears to be an error.
