**Detailed Summary of the Canada Fund for Africa Act**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The Act is officially titled the *Canada Fund for Africa Act* and may be cited accordingly. This designation establishes the legal identity and reference point for the legislation.

---

**2. Definition of "Minister"**  
The term *Minister* refers specifically to the member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada who has been formally designated by the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) as the Minister responsible for administering the Canada Fund for Africa. This individual holds the authority to make decisions regarding eligibility, program implementation, and the approval of contributions under the Act.

---

**3. Establishment of the Canada Fund for Africa Program**  
The Act establishes a formal funding program known as the *Canada Fund for Africa*. The primary objective of this program is to provide financial contributions—funding—to eligible recipients in order to support the implementation of *eligible activities*. These contributions are intended to promote development and cooperation in Africa, in alignment with broader international development goals.

---

**4. Definition of "Eligible Activity"**  
An *eligible activity* is defined as any activity that:

- Is currently being conducted or is planned to be conducted by an eligible recipient, and  
- In the judgment of the Minister, significantly advances the objectives of the **New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)**.

Specifically, the eligible activities must align with the objectives of NEPAD as adopted at the **Lusaka Summit in July 2001**, by the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Additionally, the activities must support the specific goals identified in the **Africa Action Plan**, which was proposed by the **Group of Eight (G8) industrialized countries** during their meeting in **Genoa in July 2001**. These goals were further endorsed and formalized at the **G8 Summit in Kananaskis in June 2002**.

This means the Fund supports activities that promote sustainable development, economic growth, poverty reduction, institutional capacity-building, governance reform, and regional integration in Africa—particularly those aligned with the G8’s commitments to Africa.

**5. Definition of "Eligible Recipient"**  
An *eligible recipient* is defined broadly to include:

- A foreign government  
- An agency of a foreign government  
- An international organization  
- A corporation  
- A partnership  
- A trust  

A recipient is considered eligible if it either:

- Is currently carrying out an eligible activity, or  
- In the opinion of the Minister, is capable of carrying out such an activity in the future.

This broad definition allows the Fund to support a wide range of actors—ranging from national governments and multilateral institutions (like the World Bank or UN agencies) to private-sector entities and non-governmental organizations—provided they meet the criteria of contributing to eligible activities.

---

**6. Funding Mechanism – Agreements with Recipients**  
The Minister has the authority to enter into *agreements* with eligible recipients. These agreements serve as the legal framework through which the Canada Fund for Africa provides financial contributions. The terms of these agreements will specify:

- The nature and scope of the eligible activity  
- The amount of the contribution  
- The conditions under which the funds are to be used  
- Reporting and accountability requirements  

This mechanism enables flexibility in how funds are allocated while ensuring that contributions are tied directly to development outcomes.

---

**7. Regulatory Authority**  
The Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet) has the power to make *regulations* to implement and govern the Act. These regulations may:

- Set general rules for the operation of the Fund  
- Establish specific terms and conditions for funding (e.g., eligibility criteria, reporting requirements, compliance standards)  
- Define procedures for applications, reviews, and disbursements  
- Address administrative, financial, or procedural matters necessary for effective implementation  

This regulatory power ensures that the Fund can adapt to evolving policy priorities, international developments, and operational needs without requiring changes to the core Act.

**Key Objectives and Principles of the Act**

- **Developmental Focus**: The Fund supports development in Africa by financing activities that promote sustainable growth, poverty reduction, and institutional strengthening.
- **Alignment with International Commitments**: It is grounded in internationally recognized frameworks—NEPAD, the Africa Action Plan, and G8 commitments—ensuring coherence with global development agendas.
- **Flexibility and Inclusivity**: The broad definition of eligible recipients and activities allows for diverse forms of engagement, including public, private, and multilateral participation.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: The Minister and the Governor in Council provide oversight, ensuring that funds are used effectively and in accordance with established goals.

By funding eligible activities through agreements with foreign governments, international organizations, and private entities, the Fund supports key development priorities identified in major international forums. The Act provides both flexibility in implementation and robust oversight through defined roles for the Minister and the Governor in Council, ensuring that Canadian development assistance is both effective and strategically aligned with Africa’s developmental needs and global partnerships.
