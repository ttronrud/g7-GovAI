**Detailed Summary of the *Access to Information Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Access to Information Act* (ATIA) is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to **enhance accountability, transparency, and public trust in federal institutions**. Its primary objective is to ensure that government information is accessible to the public, thereby promoting an **open and democratic society** and enabling **public debate** on the actions and decisions of government bodies.

The Act establishes a **right of access to information** held by government institutions, while also recognizing the need for **limited exceptions** to protect sensitive or confidential matters. It does not replace existing access procedures but rather **complements and strengthens** them.

---

## **Key Components of the Act**

---

### **Part 1: Right of Access to Government Records**

#### **1. Who Has the Right to Access Information?**
- Every **Canadian citizen** and **permanent resident** (as defined under the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*) has a **right to access any record** under the control of a government institution upon request.
- The Governor in Council may, by order, **extend this right** to include other categories of individuals (e.g., foreign nationals or temporary residents), subject to reasonable conditions.

> This ensures broad public access while allowing flexibility in specific cases.

---

#### **2. Obligations of the Head of a Government Institution**
The **head** of a government institution (defined below) must:
- Make **every reasonable effort** to assist a requester.
- Respond to requests **accurately and completely**.
- Provide **timely access** to the requested record in the requested format, **subject to regulations**.

> This emphasizes the institution's duty to facilitate access, not to obstruct it.

---

#### **3. Definition of "Record"**
A **record** includes **any documentary material**, regardless of form or medium (e.g., paper, digital files, audio, video).  
Even if a record does not currently exist, if it can be **produced from a machine-readable format** using standard government technology, it is still considered a record under the Act.

> This ensures that digital records and data are treated as accessible, even if they are not physically stored in traditional forms.

---

#### **4. Request Process**
- A request must be made in **writing** to the institution that controls the record.
- It must include **sufficient detail** so that an experienced employee can identify the record with a reasonable effort.

> This prevents vague or overly broad requests and ensures that institutions can process them efficiently.

---

#### **5. Time Limits for Response**
- The head of a government institution must provide a written response within **30 days** of receiving a request, stating whether access will be granted or denied.
- If access is granted, the record or part thereof must be provided.

> This establishes a clear, enforceable timeline to prevent indefinite delays.

---

#### **6. Extension of Time Limits**
A time extension may be granted under the following circumstances:
- The request involves a **large number of records** or requires extensive searching.
- **Consultations** are needed and cannot be completed within 30 days.
- The request was made **under subsection 27(1)** (e.g., in response to a prior notice).

> Extensions must be communicated to the requester within **30 days**, and the requester has the right to **complain to the Information Commissioner** about the extension.

> If the extension exceeds 30 days, the institution must **notify the Information Commissioner** simultaneously.

---

#### **7. Refusal to Grant Access**
If access is denied, the head of the institution must:
- Clearly state **why** access is denied, citing a specific provision of the Act.
- Indicate that the requester has the right to **make a complaint to the Information Commissioner**.

> Refusals must be based on **specific, narrowly defined exceptions** (see below), not on vague or subjective grounds.

> If the institution fails to respond within the time limit, it is **deemed to have refused access**.

---

#### **8. Transfer of Requests**
If the head of an institution believes **another government body has a greater interest** in a record, the request may be **transferred** to that institution.

> A record has a "greater interest" if:
> - It was originally produced for or in that institution; or  
> - It was the **first government body** to receive it or a copy thereof.

> The transfer is effective as of the day the original institution received the request.

> The transfer is treated as a new request for the receiving institution.

---

#### **9. Fees and Costs**
- A requestor may be required to pay a **non-refundable application fee of up to $25**, as prescribed by regulation.
- The institution may **waive** or **refund** the fee under certain circumstances.
- The requester has the right to **examine or receive a copy** of the record.

> This balances access with administrative costs, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent public access.

---

#### **10. Language and Alternative Format Access**
- If the requester requests access in a **specific official language**, the record must be provided in that language:
  - **Immediately** if it already exists in that language.
  - **Within a reasonable time** if translation is needed and in the public interest.
- If the requester has a **sensory disability** (vision or hearing), access must be provided in an **alternative format**:
  - **Immediately** if the record already exists in an acceptable alternative format.
  - **Within a reasonable time** if the institution determines that the format is necessary and reasonable to provide.

> These provisions promote **inclusivity and accessibility**, ensuring that people with disabilities can fully participate in public access.

---

### **Part 2: Proactive Publication of Information**

#### **1. Mandatory Proactive Disclosure**
The **designated Minister** (a senior official appointed by the Governor in Council) is responsible for:
- Publishing **annually** a comprehensive publication that includes:
  - A description of each government institution’s **organization, responsibilities, programs, and functions**.
  - A detailed list of **all classes of records** held by each institution.
  - A description of all **manuals used by employees** in carrying out institutional functions.
  - The **name and address** of the appropriate officer to whom access requests should be sent.

- Publishing **at least twice a year** a **bulletin** to update the information and provide additional useful information about the Act.

> This ensures the public can understand what information is available and how to access it.

#### **2. Avoiding Disclosure of Sensitive Information**
Any description in the publication or bulletin must be **crafted so that it does not itself constitute grounds** for refusing to disclose a part of a record under Part 1.

> This protects the integrity of the Act by preventing the publication of information that could later be used as a basis for refusal.

#### **3. Availability of Publications**
The publications and bulletins must be **available throughout Canada**, ensuring reasonable access for all citizens.

> This supports the principle of **equal access to information**, regardless of location.

### **Exceptions to Disclosure (Where Access May Be Refused)**

#### **1. Confidential Information from Foreign Entities**
Access may be denied if the information was obtained in confidence from:
- The government of a **foreign state** or its institutions;
- An **international organization of states** or its institutions;
- A **provincial government** or its institutions;
- A **municipal or regional government** (as defined by provincial legislation);
- An **aboriginal government** (as specifically defined in the Act).

> These exceptions are designed to protect **national security, diplomatic relations, and intergovernmental confidentiality**.

> **Note**: The Act provides **exceptions for aboriginal governments** — clearly defined in subsection (1)(e), including:
> - Nisga’a, Westbank First Nation, Tlicho, Nunatsiavut, Tla’amin, Tsawwassen, Cree Nation, Maanulth, Sioux Valley Dakota, Whitecap Dakota, Anishinabek Nation, and others.
> These reflect the recognition of **self-governance and treaty rights**.

#### **2. Protection of Federal-Provincial Relations**
Access may be denied if disclosure could reasonably be expected to:
- Harm the **conduct of federal-provincial consultations or deliberations**.
- Undermine **federal strategy or tactics** in managing federal-provincial affairs.

> This protects the **integrity of intergovernmental negotiations** and prevents public exposure of sensitive planning processes.

#### **3. Protection of International Affairs, Defence, and Security**
Access may be denied if disclosure could:
- Harm **international affairs**, **defence of Canada**, or the interests of allied states.
- Affect **military tactics, strategy, exercises, or operations**.
- Reveal **weapon capabilities, deployment, or defense establishment functions**.
- Involve **intelligence-related information** (e.g., sources, methods, or equipment used in intelligence gathering).

> These protections are critical for **national security and strategic defence planning**.

> The Act explicitly includes intelligence collected for the purpose of:
> - Defence of Canada or allied states;
> - Detection, prevention, or suppression of subversive or hostile activities;
> - Intelligence on foreign states or citizens used in international affairs.
