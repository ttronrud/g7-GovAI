- It emphasized **proactive environmental assessment**, **intergovernmental collaboration**, and **public accountability**.
- While the Department of the Environment was later restructured (notably in 1990 with the creation of the **Environment and Climate Change Canada** department), this Act remains historically significant as the first comprehensive legislative framework for environmental protection in Canada.

### **Key Principles Embedded in the Act**
1. **Environmental Protection as a Core Government Duty**
2. **Proactive Environmental Assessment**
3. **Interdepartmental and Intergovernmental Coordination**
4. **Public Access to Environmental Information**

### **Conclusion**
The *Department of the Environment Act* established a robust and comprehensive framework for federal environmental governance in Canada. By creating a dedicated department with clear powers, responsibilities, and accountability mechanisms, it enabled the Government of Canada to systematically address environmental challenges such as pollution, resource depletion, climate change (in its early forms), and cross-border environmental issues. Though superseded in part by modern legislation and departmental reorganizations, its principles continue to influence Canada’s environmental policy architecture today.

> **Note**: This Act is largely historical. The current equivalent is the *Environment and Climate Change Canada* (ECCC) department, formed through the amalgamation of several agencies and the evolution of environmental policy over the 1990s and 2000s. However, the core mandates and structures outlined in this Act remain foundational to Canada’s environmental governance.
