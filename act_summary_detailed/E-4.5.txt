## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Emergencies Act**

### **1. Purpose and Fundamental Principles**

The **Emergencies Act** was enacted to address national emergencies that threaten the **safety, security, and sovereignty** of Canada. It provides a legal framework allowing the **federal government** to take **special temporary measures** during emergencies that exceed provincial capacity or threaten national integrity.

#### Key Foundational Principles:
- **Safety and Security of Individuals**: Protecting citizens’ lives, health, and safety is a core government obligation.
- **Preservation of Sovereignty, Security, and Territorial Integrity**: The federal government must safeguard Canada’s independence and territorial boundaries.
- **Emergency Exception**: Normal legal rules may be temporarily suspended during emergencies to ensure effective response.
- **Parliamentary Oversight**: All emergency powers are exercised under the **supervision of Parliament**, ensuring democratic accountability.

> ⚖️ The Act affirms that **no emergency powers can override fundamental rights** protected by:
> - The **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**
> - The **Canadian Bill of Rights**
> - The **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)** — particularly in relation to rights that **cannot be limited even in emergencies** (e.g., freedom of expression, fair trial, protection from arbitrary detention).

### **2. Scope and Definitions**

#### 🔍 What Constitutes a "National Emergency"?

A **national emergency** is defined as an **urgent, critical, temporary situation** that:
- **Seriously endangers the lives, health, or safety of Canadians**, OR
- **Threatens the ability of the Government of Canada to preserve its sovereignty, security, or territorial integrity**, AND
- **Exceeds the capacity or authority of any province to handle it**, OR
- **Cannot be effectively managed under existing laws.**

> This definition ensures that only truly severe, nationwide threats trigger federal intervention.

#### 🚨 Two Types of Emergencies Covered:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Public Welfare Emergency** | Caused by natural disasters (floods, fires, earthquakes), disease (in humans, animals, plants), accidents, or pollution that result in danger to life, property, or essential services. |
| **Public Order Emergency** | Arises from threats to Canada’s security (as defined under the *Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act*), such as terrorism, civil unrest, or violent threats to public order. |

> These emergencies are distinct in nature and require different types of responses.

### **3. Declaration Process**

#### ✅ Declaration of a Public Welfare Emergency
- Issued by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) upon **reasonable grounds**.
- Must be accompanied by:
  - A concise description of the emergency.
  - Anticipated special temporary measures.
  - The geographic area affected (if limited).
- **Effective immediately upon issuance**.
- Must be **submitted to both Houses of Parliament** for confirmation (see Section 58).
- **Expires after 90 days** unless continued or revoked.

> 🔍 **Consultation Requirement**: Before issuing a declaration, the Governor in Council must consult with the **lieutenant governors in council of each affected province** (unless the emergency is confined to one province and that province has indicated it cannot manage it).

#### ✅ Declaration of a Public Order Emergency
- Also issued by the Governor in Council based on **reasonable grounds**.
- Must specify:
  - The nature of the emergency.
  - Anticipated measures.
  - Geographic scope (if limited).
- **Effective immediately upon issuance**.

### **4. Powers of the Governor in Council During Emergencies**

While a declaration is in effect, the Governor in Council may issue **orders or regulations** to manage the emergency. These powers are **targeted and limited** to ensure proportionality and avoid overreach.

#### 📌 Public Welfare Emergency Powers:
The following measures may be authorized:
1. **Travel restrictions** (to/from or within areas) to protect health/safety.
2. **Evacuations** and relocation of people and property with care arrangements.
3. **Requisition or use of property** (e.g., buildings, vehicles).
4. **Mandate essential service providers** (e.g., medical staff, utility workers) with compensation.
5. **Regulate distribution** of essential goods, services, and resources.
6. **Make emergency payments**.
7. **Establish emergency shelters and hospitals**.

9. **Imposition of fines**:
   - On summary conviction: up to **$500 fine or 6 months imprisonment**.
   - On indictment: up to **$5,000 fine or 5 years imprisonment**.

> ⚖️ These powers are **not unlimited** — they must not:
> - Unduly impair provincial authority to act.
> - Be used to end strikes or lockouts or impose settlements in labor disputes.
> - Interfere with provincial control over police forces.

#### 📌 Public Order Emergency Powers:
The following measures may be authorized:

### **5. Duration and Renewal of Declarations**

#### ⏳ Expiry:
- **Public Welfare Emergency**: 90 days (can be renewed).
- **Public Order Emergency**: 30 days (can be renewed).

#### 🔁 Renewal Process:
- Can be renewed **multiple times**.
- Before renewal, the Governor in Council must:
  - Review all existing orders/regs.
  - **Revise or revoke** those that are no longer necessary.
- A **motion for confirmation** of the renewal must be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

> 🔍 This ensures that emergency measures are **proportional, time-limited, and subject to democratic review**.

#### 🔄 Amendment of Declarations:
- If the emergency spreads beyond the original area, the Governor in Council may **amend the declaration** to include new areas.
- Must again go through **Parliamentary confirmation**.

> This prevents arbitrary expansion of emergency powers.

---

### **6. Consultation Requirements**

- **Mandatory Consultation**:
  - Before issuing, continuing, or amending a declaration, the Governor in Council must consult with the **lieutenant governors in council** of all provinces affected.
- **Exception**:
  - If an emergency is **confined to one province**, the federal government may proceed **only if that province's lieutenant governor in council confirms** the emergency exceeds provincial capacity.

> This ensures **inter-provincial cooperation** and prevents unilateral federal overreach.

> 🚨 Special Rule for Multi-Provincial Emergencies:
> If consultation with a province would **jeopardize the effectiveness** of the response, the province may be consulted **after** the declaration is issued — but before Parliament considers it.

---

### **7. Revocation of Declarations**

- Declarations can be **revoked** by:
  - **Parliament** (via a motion under Section 58 or 59).
  - **Governor in Council** by proclamation (effective immediately).
- Upon revocation:
  - All **orders and regulations** made under the declaration **expire or are revoked** on the same day.

> This ensures that emergency powers are **not permanent** and are removed when no longer needed.
