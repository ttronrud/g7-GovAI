### **Detailed Summary of the Great Lakes Fisheries Convention Act**

---

#### **1. Overview of the Act**

The *Great Lakes Fisheries Convention Act* is a Canadian statute enacted to **ratify, confirm, and provide legal effect** to the **Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between Canada and the United States of America**, originally signed in 1954. This Act serves as the domestic legal instrument that enables Canada to implement and enforce the provisions of the international convention, ensuring cooperation with the United States in managing and conserving fishery resources in the Great Lakes region.

The Act establishes a framework for **joint fishery management**, emphasizes **scientific research**, and specifically addresses the **threat posed by sea lampreys**—a parasitic species that has severely damaged fish populations in the Great Lakes.

#### **2. Key Definitions in the Act**

- **Commission**:  
  Refers to the *Great Lakes Fishery Commission*, a joint body established under the Convention. It is composed of two national sections: a Canadian Section and a U.S. Section. Each section has up to four members (originally three, later increased to four via amendment), with one vote each.

- **Convention**:  
  The international agreement between Canada and the United States on Great Lakes fisheries, signed on September 10, 1954, and amended in 1967.

#### **3. Core Provisions of the Act**

##### **A. Ratification and Approval of the Convention**
- The Act formally **approves and confirms** the Convention, making it legally binding within Canada.
- This ratification ensures that the international agreement becomes enforceable under Canadian law.

##### **B. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**
- Despite any conflicting domestic legislation, the **Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet)** may make **regulations** to implement and give effect to the provisions of the Convention.

  - A **fine of up to $1,000**, or
  - **Imprisonment for up to one year**, or
  - **Both**.
- **Jurisdiction**:  
  Canadian courts—including justices of the peace, provincial court judges, and provincial courts—have **the same jurisdiction** over offences under these regulations as they do under **sections 257 and 258 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001**. This means enforcement is treated with the same legal weight and procedural standards.

##### **D. Duration of the Act**
- The Act **remains in force until a day is proclaimed by the Governor in Council** following the **termination of the Convention**.
