**Detailed Summary of the *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted to facilitate the restructuring, reorganization, and divestiture of **Eldorado Nuclear Limited (Eldorado)** — a corporation operating in the nuclear energy sector — through a formal corporate reorganization. The Act provides a legal framework enabling Eldorado and its subsidiaries to transfer their assets, operations, and liabilities to a newly formed or existing corporation ("the new corporation") under strict regulatory and financial conditions. It also addresses tax treatment, ownership restrictions, voting rights, and government obligations, with a particular focus on ensuring transparency, preventing concentration of control, and aligning with broader public interest objectives such as national energy policy, competition law, and fiscal accountability.

This Act was likely passed in response to strategic decisions involving the sale or restructuring of nuclear assets, possibly in the context of a broader government review of nuclear energy operations, including safety, cost, and public interest considerations.

### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Title**: The Act is titled *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act*.
- **Key Definitions**:
  - **Agent Corporation**: A corporation defined under Part XII of the *Financial Administration Act* (e.g., entities acting on behalf of Her Majesty).
  - **Eldorado**: Refers to *Eldorado Nuclear Limited*, a corporation continued under the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)*.

---

### **2. Exemption from Competition Act**

- **No effect on Competition Act**: Nothing in this Act affects the operation of the *Competition Act* in relation to any acquisition of interest in the new corporation. This ensures that market competition concerns remain intact during the reorganization.

---

### **3. Submission and Approval of Articles**

- The **Minister** may submit proposed **articles of incorporation** for the new corporation to the **Governor in Council (GiC)** for approval.
- Upon approval, the Minister must send the approved articles and required supporting documents to the **Director of the Canada Business Corporations** within **ten days**.

> This ensures a clear, transparent, and government-approved path for establishing the new corporation.

---

### **4. Authority to Enter into Transactions**

Eldorado or a subsidiary of Eldorado may enter into transactions involving the **sale, assignment, or transfer** of:
- Assets, businesses, works, undertakings
- Shares of subsidiaries of Eldorado

To the **new corporation** or a **wholly-owned subsidiary** of the new corporation.

These transactions may include:
- Incorporation of a new corporation with shares held on behalf of Eldorado or its subsidiary
- Acquisition of shares in a corporation to be held on behalf of Eldorado
- Transfer of all or part of Eldorado’s assets
- Disposal of shares or assets
- Dissolution or amalgamation of Eldorado or its subsidiaries
- Reorganization of capital structure
- Any agreement incidental to the above

> These powers are granted **on terms and conditions approved by the Governor in Council**, including consideration (e.g., securities or assumption of liabilities).

---

### **5. Application of Financial Administration Act Provisions**

- **Subsections 101(1)–(3) and 108(2) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)** do **not apply** to any transaction under this Act.
- This exclusion is critical because it removes certain restrictions on government-owned corporations and agent corporations (e.g., restrictions on ownership, transfer, or control) that normally apply under the FAA.

---

### **6. Vesting of Property and Liabilities from Her Majesty**

A significant and transformative provision:

> All property, rights, and interests of **Her Majesty** held by Eldorado or a subsidiary that is an **agent corporation** on the coming into force of this Act, **and all obligations and liabilities incurred by Eldorado or such a subsidiary**, are **vested in Eldorado or the subsidiary**, respectively.

This means:
- The government’s ownership or liabilities previously held by the corporation are legally transferred to the corporation.
- This transfer is **deemed to have occurred as of the date of the transfer**, with full legal and fiscal consequences.

---

### **7. Income Tax Treatment (Deemed Acquisition and Ownership)**

To ensure consistency in tax treatment, the Act provides specific **income tax rules** under the *Income Tax Act* (ITA):

#### a) **Deemed Acquisition**
- The property is deemed to have been **acquired by Eldorado or the subsidiary at the same time and under the same circumstances** as when it was acquired by Her Majesty.
- The **cost basis** of the property is deemed to be:
  - For **non-depreciable property**: The cost amount to Her Majesty **immediately before** vesting.
  - For **depreciable property**: The capital cost to Her Majesty.

#### b) **Capital Cost Adjustment**
- The **difference** between the capital cost to Her Majesty and the cost amount to the corporation (for non-depreciable) is **deemed to have been allowed** as a capital cost **in computing income for taxation years ending before vesting**.

> This ensures that tax losses or capital cost deductions are not lost due to the transfer of ownership.

#### c) **Deemed Income/Loss**
- Income or loss from:
  - A business carried on by Eldorado or a subsidiary (agent corporation)
  - Property administered by Eldorado or such a subsidiary
  → Is **deemed to be income or loss of the corporation** (not of Her Majesty).

#### d) **Deemed Obligations**
- All obligations, expenditures, costs, and liabilities incurred by Eldorado or a subsidiary on behalf of Her Majesty **before the vesting date** are **deemed to have been incurred by the corporation itself**.

> This ensures that the new corporation bears full financial responsibility for historical obligations.

---

### **8. Tax Precedence and Application**

- The tax provisions in section 7 **prevail over** any inconsistency with the ITA or Income Tax Regulations.
- **Section 108(1) of the FAA** (which restricts certain transfers of government property) and **section 134 of the FAA** (which restricts issuance of securities) **do not apply** to the property or securities involved in the transaction.

> This removes key administrative and financial barriers to the reorganization.

---

### **9. Exemptions from Vesting**

- The **Governor in Council may issue an order** to **exempt any property, rights, obligations, or liabilities** of Her Majesty from the application of section 7 (the vesting provision).
> This provides flexibility in exceptional cases (e.g., certain sensitive or strategic assets).

---

### **10. Articles of the New Corporation – Mandatory Provisions**

The articles of the new corporation must include the following provisions:

#### a) **Prohibition of Restricted Shares**
- The new corporation must **prohibit the creation of restricted shares** — shares that give holders residual rights to earnings or assets on winding-up, or voting rights subject to limits.

> This prevents excessive control by any single shareholder.

#### b) **Voting Rights Restrictions**
To prevent concentration of control:
- **Residents** (individuals or entities based in Canada):
  - May not hold, beneficially own, or control **more than 25% of the voting power** (votes) of the new corporation (directly or indirectly).
- **Non-residents**:
  - May not hold, beneficially own, or control **more than 15% of the voting power**.

> This ensures no single entity (domestic or foreign) gains excessive influence.

#### c) **Voting Rights Proration for Non-Residents**
- At shareholder meetings, **votes held by non-residents are limited to 25% of the total votes cast**.
- This is a **prorating mechanism** to prevent foreign influence from dominating governance.

#### d) **Head Office and Registered Office Location**
- The **registered office and head office operations** of the new corporation **must be located in Saskatchewan**.
> This serves as a geographic anchor, likely to support local economic development or public interest.

#### e) **Enforcement Mechanisms**
- The articles must include provisions to **enforce** the above constraints, including:
  - Filing of declarations
  - Suspension of voting rights
  - Forfeiture of dividends
  - Refusal to issue or register voting securities

> These tools allow the board to enforce compliance with ownership limits.

---

### **11. Exceptions to Voting Restrictions**

Certain voting securities are **exempt** from the voting restrictions:

- **Securities issued as part of consideration** in a transaction authorized under section 4 (i.e., asset transfers).
- **Securities issued in connection with transactions involving sale of assets to the new corporation** (not involving Eldorado or its subsidiaries).
- **Securities held by underwriters** solely for distribution to the public.
- **Securities held by intermediaries** (e.g., clearing houses) acting only as intermediaries in trade settlement.
