The provided text appears to be a partial or incomplete excerpt of a Canadian Act of Parliament, specifically showing a series of repeated lines indicating that certain provisions of a law have been **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or abolished).

Here is a **detailed summary** of the content as presented:

### **Summary of the Text**

**Text:**  
> *Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:*  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 64]  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 64]  
> ... (repeated 14 times)

### **Key Interpretation**

1. **Legal Context and Purpose**  
   The opening line is the standard formal preamble used in Canadian statutes. It indicates that the law is being enacted by the Crown (Her Majesty) on the advice and consent of the elected Parliament — the Senate and House of Commons — which is the constitutional process for passing legislation in Canada.

2. **Repeal Notices**  
   The repeated entries "[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 64]" indicate that **specific sections or provisions of a previous law have been formally removed or canceled**.  
   - **"Repealed"** means the provision is no longer in force.  
   - **"2017, c. 26, s. 64"** refers to:
     - **2017, c. 26**: The *Statutes of Canada* (a collection of laws passed in 2017), specifically **Bill C-26** (the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2017* or another related act).
     - **s. 64**: Section 64 of that act.
   - This means that **Section 64 of Bill C-26 (2017)** was used to repeal certain earlier provisions of a previous statute.

3. **Repeated Entries**  
   The fact that the same repeal notice is listed 14 times suggests that:
   - The original statute (or a prior version of it) contained **14 sections** that were repealed by **Section 64 of Bill C-26, 2017**.
   - These sections were likely part of a prior law (possibly a previous version of the *Criminal Code*, *Family Law Act*, or another statute) that was amended or replaced.
   - The repetition may be due to a formatting or editorial error in the document, or it may reflect a list of multiple repealed sections in a legislative table.

4. **Legal Significance**  
   - Repealing a section of a law removes its legal effect.  
   - It may have been done to modernize legislation, eliminate outdated or obsolete provisions, or align with new legal standards or public policy.
   - In this case, the repeal likely occurred as part of a broader legislative reform in 2017, such as changes to the *Criminal Code* or *Family Law*.

### **Possible Original Law Repealed**

While the specific law is not named, the most likely context is the **Criminal Code of Canada**, as Bill C-26, 2017, is known to have addressed criminal law amendments. Section 64 of that bill likely repealed outdated or redundant provisions related to:
- Offences related to sexual offences
- Child protection
- Sentencing
- Domestic violence
- Or other areas of criminal law that had become obsolete or inconsistent with current standards.

### **Conclusion**

The provided text does **not** contain a new enactment — instead, it reflects a **repeal** of multiple provisions from a prior law. Specifically:

- **14 sections** of a previous statute were **repealed**.
- The repeal was enacted via **Section 64 of Bill C-26, 2017**.
- The purpose was likely to **modernize, simplify, or update** outdated or redundant legal provisions.
- The text's repetition of the repeal notice is likely a formatting artifact or a list of the repealed sections in a legislative table.

✅ **Final Summary in One Sentence:**  
The text shows that 14 provisions of a prior Canadian law were formally repealed by Section 64 of Bill C-26, 2017, as part of a legislative update to modernize or remove outdated legal provisions, though the specific law and sections are not fully detailed in the excerpt.
