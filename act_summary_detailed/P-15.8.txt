The provided text appears to be a **partial or erroneous excerpt** of a Canadian Act of Parliament, specifically showing a series of repeated lines indicating that certain provisions have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).

Here is a **detailed summary** of what the text represents and what it implies:

---

### 🔍 Summary of the Text:

> **"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"**  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 70]  
> [Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 70]  
> ... (repeated 20 times)

---

### 📌 Key Interpretation:

1. **Structure of the Act**:
   - The opening line is the standard formal header used in Canadian statutes, indicating that the legislation was passed by the Canadian Parliament (via the Crown, acting on the advice of the elected Senate and House of Commons).
   - This is the beginning of a legislative act, typically followed by sections that outline laws, rules, or amendments.

2. **Repeated Repeal Notices**:
   - The repeated line **"[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 70]"** indicates that **a specific section (or provision)** of a prior law was **officially removed or canceled** by **Bill C-26, 2017**, which became an Act of Parliament (commonly known as the *Criminal Code (Amendments) Act, 2017* or related legislation).
   - Specifically, **Section 70 of the Criminal Code** (as amended or replaced by C-26) led to the repeal of the provisions listed in the text.
   - The number **"c. 26"** refers to the **chapter number** of the bill (Bill C-26), and **"s. 70"** refers to **Section 70** of that bill.

3. **Repeal Context**:
   - The fact that the same repeal notice is repeated 20 times suggests that **the original document may have been a list of provisions that were all repealed** by Section 70 of Bill C-26.
   - In legal drafting, such repetitions are sometimes used to list multiple provisions being repealed, especially in older or compiled versions of statutes.
   - However, in this case, the repetition is likely **a formatting or copy-paste error**, as it is not standard practice to list 20 identical repeal notices unless there were 20 distinct provisions being repealed.

4. **Status of the Original Provisions**:
   - The original provisions (which are not visible in the excerpt) were **previously part of a law** (likely the *Criminal Code* or another statute) and were **removed in 2017**.
   - The repeal was part of a broader legislative reform, possibly related to:
     - Criminal justice reforms
     - Changes to sentencing
     - Amendments to definitions or penalties
     - Modernization of outdated laws

5. **Legal Significance**:
   - Repealing a section means that the law **no longer applies**.
   - It may have been done to:
     - Eliminate outdated or obsolete language
     - Improve clarity and coherence in the law
     - Reflect changes in policy or societal norms
     - Remove provisions that were found to be unjust, ineffective, or inconsistent with current standards

### ⚠️ Important Note on the Excerpt:

- The text provided **does not contain any actual enacted provisions** (i.e., no new laws, definitions, or rules).
- Instead, it only shows a **repeal notice**, repeated multiple times.
- This suggests that the original act (or its section) was **entirely repealed** and **no longer in force**.
- Therefore, **this document is not a law that creates new rights or obligations**, but rather a **record of a legal change** — the removal of old provisions.

### ✅ Final Summary:

> The provided text is a **repeal notice** indicating that multiple provisions of a prior Canadian law were **officially canceled** by **Section 70 of Bill C-26, 2017**. The repeated entries suggest that several (or many) provisions were repealed in that section.
