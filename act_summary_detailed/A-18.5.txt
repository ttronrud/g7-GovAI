**Detailed Summary of the *Aviation Industry Indemnity Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Aviation Industry Indemnity Act* (AIIA) is a Canadian statute designed to provide financial protection to key stakeholders in the aviation sector—specifically, aviation industry participants—against losses, damages, or liabilities arising from certain serious and unpredictable events. The Act establishes a framework under which the **Minister of Transport** can issue binding, written indemnity undertakings to cover such losses, **only when they are not already covered by insurance or otherwise compensated**, and **excluding losses solely related to lost income**.

This Act is intended to enhance the resilience of Canada’s aviation industry by reducing the financial burden of catastrophic or unlawful incidents—such as terrorism, armed conflict, or operational disruptions involving air navigation services—especially when private insurance markets may be insufficient or unaffordable.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definitions**

The Act begins with clear definitions that shape its scope and application:

#### **Airport**
- Defined consistently with *subsection 3(1) of the Aeronautics Act*.
- Refers to designated facilities where aircraft take off, land, or are maintained.

#### **Aviation Industry Participant**
A broad category of entities involved in the operation or support of aviation, including:
- **Air carriers** that are Canadian-owned (as defined under *section 55(1) of the Canada Transportation Act*).
- **NAV CANADA**, a federally incorporated corporation providing air navigation services.
- **Airport owners or operators**.
- **Suppliers of goods or services directly supporting aircraft operations**, such as:
  - Aircraft maintenance, cleaning, loading/unloading of passengers, baggage, and cargo.
  - Freight forwarding.
  - Air navigation support.
  - Airport security services.
- Any **entity prescribed by regulation** or belonging to a **class of entities prescribed by regulation**.

> This definition ensures that a wide range of stakeholders—both direct operators and supporting service providers—are included in the protection scheme.

#### **Event**
An event is defined as one of the following:
- An **act of unlawful interference** with an aircraft, airport, or air navigation facility (e.g., terrorism).
- An **act or omission in the course of armed conflict**, including war, civil war, rebellion, insurrection, martial law, usurpation of power, civil commotion, or riot.
- An **act or omission by NAV CANADA or its officers/agents**, carried out in accordance with an agreement with the Department of National Defence or the Canadian Forces, related to air navigation services (as defined in the *Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act*).

> This definition explicitly includes both terrorist attacks and acts of civil unrest or conflict, and extends to official actions by NAV CANADA during military operations.

#### **Minister**
- Refers to the **Minister of Transport**, who is the central authority responsible for administering the Act.

### **2. Indemnification Powers of the Minister**

The Minister may, **in writing**, enter into an **undertaking to indemnify**:

- Any **aviation industry participant** or **class of participants** against:
  - Loss, damage, or liability caused by an *event*.
- Any **beneficiary** of an insurance policy held by an aviation industry participant, against their own loss or damage caused by an event.

#### **Limitations on Indemnification**
Indemnification is **not available** for:
- Losses that are **already covered by insurance** or otherwise indemnified.
- Losses that are **solely due to loss of income** (i.e., revenue loss without physical damage or liability).

> This ensures that the government does not cover routine or financially predictable losses, and prevents duplication of coverage.

#### **Terms That May Be Attached to an Undertaking**
The Minister has broad discretion to impose conditions on the indemnity, including:
- Specifying which **events or classes of events** are covered or excluded.
- Limiting coverage to specific **activities** (e.g., only for maintenance or security services).
- Defining which **types of loss, damage, or liability** are covered (e.g., property damage, personal injury, but not lost profits).
- Setting a **maximum amount** of indemnification or establishing a method to calculate it (e.g., based on exposure or cost).
- Requiring aviation industry participants to maintain a **minimum level of private insurance** (e.g., a specified coverage threshold).
- Requiring participants or beneficiaries to enter into **agreements with the Minister** regarding the **conduct or settlement of legal proceedings** related to covered claims.

> These terms allow for tailored, risk-managed indemnity programs that balance public responsibility with private sector accountability.

#### **Distinguishing Among Participants**
The Minister may differentiate among:
- Different types of participants (e.g., commercial airlines vs. regional operators).
- Beneficiaries within the same class.
- Classes of entities based on size, location, or risk profile.

> This enables targeted protection for more vulnerable or high-risk actors.

#### **Incorporation of Materials by Reference**
Any material (e.g., reports, regulations, legal judgments) can be referenced in an undertaking, as of a specific date, even if it is not formally part of the Act.

> This allows for flexibility in incorporating current data, legal precedents, or regulatory updates.

#### **Personal Exercise of Powers**
The Minister must **personally exercise** all powers under this section—no delegation is allowed.

> Ensures accountability and direct oversight of decisions affecting aviation safety and financial stability.

#### **Exemption from Statutory Instruments Act**
The *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to undertakings under this Act.

> This means undertakings are not subject to formal legislative review or public consultation processes required under other statutes, allowing for faster, more responsive action.

#### **Publication Requirement**
All undertakings, amendments, or revocations must be **published in Part I of the Canada Gazette within 23 days** of issuance, amendment, or revocation.

> Ensures transparency and public access to the government’s indemnity commitments.

#### **Exemption for NAV CANADA Undertakings**
Subsection (2) (the general indemnification rule) **does not apply** to undertakings that:
- Cover **only events specified in paragraph (c)** of the definition of "event" (i.e., NAV CANADA actions in relation to military operations).

> This reflects a separate risk profile for NAV CANADA, which operates under a distinct mandate and contractual relationship with the Department of National Defence.

---

### **3. Information and Reporting Requirements**

#### **Information Requests**
At any time after issuing an undertaking, the Minister may **request information** from covered participants or beneficiaries, including:
- Whether they qualify as participants.
- Their current insurance coverage levels for events covered under the undertaking.

> This allows the Minister to monitor risk exposure and ensure compliance with coverage requirements.

---

### **4. Claim Submission and Eligibility**

To submit a claim for indemnification:
- An aviation industry participant or beneficiary must provide the Minister with a **written notice of a potential claim within two years** of the event occurring.
- The notice must include **any additional information** the Minister deems necessary.

> This establishes a clear and time-bound process to initiate claims, promoting prompt action and accountability.

#### **Review and Indemnification Process**
After a claim is submitted:
- The Minister must **review the claim**.
- If:
  - A notice was provided within the two-year window, and
  - The Minister determines the claim is **eligible** under the undertaking as it existed on the day the event occurred,
- Then the Minister must **indemnify** the participant or beneficiary accordingly.

> The Minister may rely on **final, non-appealable court or tribunal decisions** in assessing eligibility.

#### **Joint Events**
If the Minister believes **two or more events are directly connected** (by timing, cause, or parties involved), they may be **deemed a single event** for indemnification purposes.

> This prevents fragmentation of claims and allows for broader, more practical compensation in complex scenarios.

#### **Exclusion Based on Fault**
Despite all other provisions, the Minister is **not required to indemnify** if they believe the loss, damage, or liability is **principally the fault** of the participant or beneficiary.

> This introduces a **fault-based exclusion**, ensuring that parties not acting in good faith or with due diligence are not protected.

#### **Amount of Indemnification**
The Minister’s determination of eligibility **includes a determination of the amount**, if any, of indemnification.

> The decision is not just about eligibility—it includes a quantified financial assessment.

### **5. Funding and Subrogation**

- All indemnity payments are made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** (i.e., general government funds).
- **Her Majesty in Right of Canada** is **subrogated** to the rights of the participant or beneficiary in respect of the loss or damage paid for.
  - This means the government **takes over the legal rights** to pursue recovery from third parties (e.g., terrorists, insurgents, or negligent actors).
- The government may **maintain legal action** in the name of the participant or in its own name to recover funds from liable parties.

> This ensures that public funds are not wasted and that the government can recover costs through legal avenues.

---

### **6. Periodic Review and Reporting**

#### **Feasibility Assessment**
The Minister must **at least every two years** assess whether aviation industry participants can obtain **private insurance** or similar coverage for events under paragraphs (a) or (b) of the "event" definition (i.e., unlawful interference or armed conflict).

> This evaluates whether government indemnity is still necessary or if the private market can adequately serve
