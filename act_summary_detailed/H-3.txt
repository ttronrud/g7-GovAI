**Detailed Summary of the *Hazardous Products Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Hazardous Products Act* (HPA) is a Canadian federal statute designed to ensure the safe handling, sale, importation, and use of hazardous products in the workplace. Its primary objective is to protect human health and safety by requiring clear, accurate, and accessible information about hazardous products through standardized **labels** and **safety data sheets (SDS)**. The Act applies to any product classified as a *hazardous product*—defined as a chemical substance or mixture that poses a risk to health or the environment based on its physical, chemical, or biological properties.

The Act was originally enacted to replace outdated regulations and modernize the system of hazardous product management in Canada. It is administered by the **Minister of Health**, with enforcement powers delegated to **inspectors** and oversight through regulatory provisions made under the Governor in Council.

## **Key Definitions (Important for Understanding the Act)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Hazardous Product** | Any product, mixture, material, or substance classified under Schedule 2 (based on hazard classes) as posing a risk (e.g., flammable, toxic, corrosive, etc.). |
| **Container** | Includes bags, bottles, drums, cylinders, boxes, etc., but excludes storage tanks. |
| **Label** | A group of written, printed, or graphic elements affixed to or printed on a hazardous product or container, indicating hazard information. |
| **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** | A document containing standardized information about a hazardous product, including hazards, safe handling, storage, emergency measures, and exposure controls. Required for all workplace-use products. |
| **Supplier** | A person (individual or organization) who sells or imports a hazardous product in the course of business. |
| **Workplace** | Defined by regulations under subsection 15(1); generally refers to any location where employees or workers are present and exposed to hazardous products. |
| **Manufactured Article** | A product shaped for a specific design, where its form is essential to its intended use and it does not release hazardous substances during normal use. Excluded from the Act. |
| **Analyst / Inspector / Review Officer** | Designated individuals with specific roles in classification, compliance, or review processes. |
| **Prescribed** | Means defined by regulations under specific sections (e.g., regulations under subsection 15(1) or section 27). |

> ⚠️ **Note on Repealed Provisions**: Several terms such as "controlled product," "prohibited product," and "restricted product" have been repealed (e.g., 2010 and 2014 amendments). These were replaced by the current concept of "hazardous product." The Act now focuses exclusively on hazard classification and safety information.

## **Core Provisions and Requirements**

### **1. Mandatory Labeling and Safety Data Sheet Requirements**

**Section 13 – Sale of Hazardous Products (Domestic)**  
A supplier **must not sell** a hazardous product intended for use, handling, or storage in a workplace in Canada unless:

- They possess a **true and accurate safety data sheet (SDS)** that meets the requirements set out in regulations under subsection 15(1);
- Upon sale to a person or government, they **provide or cause to be provided** the SDS if the buyer acquires ownership or possession of the product;
- The **label** on the product or container is **correctly affixed, printed, or attached**, meeting all regulatory requirements.

> ✅ Applies to **all sales** of hazardous products intended for workplace use — including offers for sale, distribution, exposure, or transfer of possession (e.g., leasing, loans).

**Section 14 – Importation of Hazardous Products**  
A supplier **must not import** a hazardous product intended for workplace use unless:

- They **obtain or prepare** a safety data sheet before importation that meets regulatory standards;
- The product or container has a **correctly compliant label** affixed, printed, or attached.

> ⚠️ Importation is subject to the same labeling and SDS requirements as domestic sales.

### **2. Special Provisions for Asbestos-Containing Products**

Despite general provisions, **asbestos-containing hazardous products** are subject to additional, stricter requirements under **section 13(1)** and **section 14**:

- Suppliers must comply with **specific labeling and SDS requirements** (paragraphs 13(1)(a)–(b) and 14(a)–(b)) **even if otherwise exempt**.
- The hazardous product must meet **specific regulatory standards** under subsection 15(2).

> 📌 This ensures that even products containing known carcinogens (like asbestos) are properly disclosed and managed in the workplace.

---

### **3. Prohibition of False, Misleading, or Erroneous Information**

The Act strictly prohibits suppliers from providing **false, misleading, or deceptive information** in any form related to hazardous products. This includes:

- **Labels** or **SDSs** that misrepresent hazards or safety data;
- **Communications** during sales (e.g., marketing, brochures, websites) that mislead about product risks;
- Any information that creates an **erroneous impression** regarding hazard classification or handling.

> 🔍 This provision reinforces transparency and accountability in product information.

---

### **4. Recordkeeping Requirements**

Every supplier who sells or imports a hazardous product for workplace use must:

1. **Maintain a document** containing a true copy of:
   - The **label** used on the product or container;
   - The **safety data sheet** in their possession or provided to a buyer.

2. **Maintain records of supply chain details**:
   - Name and address of the supplier from whom the product was obtained;
   - Quantity obtained;
   - Month and year of acquisition.

3. **Maintain sales records**:
   - Locations of sales;
   - Duration of sales period;
   - Monthly quantities sold.

4. **Maintain any "prescribed documents"** as defined by regulations.

> 📚 **Retention Period**: Records must be kept for **six years after the end of the year** to which they relate. In some cases, longer retention may be prescribed.

> 📂 **Access**: Suppliers must provide these records **on written request** to the **Minister of Health** or an **inspector**, within the time and manner specified.

> 🚫 **Exemption**: The Minister may **exempt** a supplier from keeping records in Canada if it is deemed **unnecessary or impractical** (e.g., for international suppliers with minimal operations).

### **5. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government) may make **regulations** under this Act to:

- Define terms in Schedule 2 (e.g., hazard classifications);
- Establish **categories and subcategories** of hazard classes (e.g., flammable liquids, oxidizers, carcinogens);
- Specify **classification criteria** for products, mixtures, materials, and substances;
- Define **label and SDS requirements**;
- Specify **recordkeeping requirements** (what to keep, where, for how long);
- **Exempt certain products or suppliers** under specific conditions (e.g., small quantities, specific industries, certain containers);
- Define what constitutes a **workplace**;
- Require suppliers to provide **SDS information to prescribed professionals** (e.g., safety officers, health professionals) upon request;

### **6. Interim Orders and Emergency Powers**

The **Minister of Health** may issue an **interim order** (without waiting for full regulation) if there is an **immediate risk** to public health or safety.

- This allows **urgent action** (e.g., banning a dangerous chemical, requiring new labeling) in response to a significant threat.
- The order must be **proportional and temporary**, with a plan for formal regulation.

> 🚨 Example: An emergency order could be issued during a chemical spill or outbreak of a toxic substance.
