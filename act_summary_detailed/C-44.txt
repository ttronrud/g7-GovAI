## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)**

---

### 🔍 **Overview and Purpose**

The *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA) is the primary federal statute governing the formation, operation, governance, and regulation of business corporations in Canada. It replaces a patchwork of prior provincial and federal corporate laws with a **uniform, national framework** for business corporations.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Modernize and reform** the law applicable to business corporations operating across Canada.
2. **Promote uniformity** in corporate law to ensure consistency in how corporations are governed and regulated.
3. **Facilitate a smooth transition** of federal companies incorporated under older Acts (e.g., the *Bank Act*, *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*) into a single, modern legal regime.
4. Provide **clarity and predictability** in corporate governance, shareholder rights, and regulatory compliance.

> The CBCA applies to all corporations incorporated or continued under it and not discontinued.

### 🏛️ **Key Definitions and Legal Concepts**

The Act establishes precise definitions for core legal terms used throughout the legislation. These definitions form the foundation of corporate law in Canada.

| Term | Definition and Significance |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **Body Corporate** | Any company or other legal entity incorporated anywhere in Canada. Broadly includes corporations, partnerships, trusts, joint ventures, and unincorporated associations. |
| **Affairs** | Refers to internal relationships among a corporation, its affiliates, shareholders, directors, and officers — *excluding* the business operations themselves. This concept is critical for fiduciary duties and corporate governance. |
| **Affiliate** | Two bodies are affiliates if one is a subsidiary of the other, or both are subsidiaries of the same parent, or both are controlled by the same person. Affiliates are treated as having interconnected interests under the Act. |
| **Control** | A person or group controls a body corporate if they hold **more than 50% of the voting rights** (excluding security interests) and those votes would be sufficient to elect a majority of directors. |
| **Holding Body Corporate** | A parent company that owns a subsidiary. |
| **Subsidiary** | A company controlled by another body corporate directly or indirectly. Can include nested chains of control (e.g., A controls B, B controls C → A controls C). |
| **Associate** | A broad definition that includes: <br> - Shareholders who beneficially own >10% of voting shares or convertible securities; <br> - Partners acting on behalf of a partnership; <br> - Trustees or estates with substantial beneficial interest; <br> - Spouse or cohabiting partner (≥1 year); <br> - Child or relative living at the same residence. |
| **Beneficial Ownership** | Includes ownership through intermediaries (e.g., trustees, agents). This ensures that actual control is captured even if shares are held in nominee names. |
| **Security** | Includes shares (of any class/series) and debt obligations (bonds, debentures, notes). Also includes certificates evidencing such securities. |
| **Security Interest** | A legal interest or charge on property to secure payment of debt or performance of obligations. |
| **Redeemable Share** | A share that a corporation may redeem at its own discretion or at a specified time, or one required by its articles to be redeemed. |
| **Put** | An option to sell securities at a fixed price within a specified time. |
| **Call** | An option to buy securities at a fixed price within a specified time. |
| **Series of Shares** | A division of a class of shares with distinct rights, privileges, and conditions. Directors can create new series. |
| **Ordinary Resolution** | Passed by a majority of votes cast by shareholders. |
| **Special Resolution** | Passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of votes cast, or signed by all shareholders entitled to vote. |
| **Going-Private Transaction** | A transaction where a distributing corporation (one that has offered shares to the public) sells or otherwise disposes of its shares to private parties, typically involving a change in control. Defined in regulations. |
| **Squeeze-Out Transaction** | A transaction that terminates a shareholder’s interest in a class of shares without consent and without replacing it with equivalent shares having equal or greater rights. Prohibited unless the corporation is not a distributing corporation and the Director approves. |
| **Unanimous Shareholder Agreement** | An agreement among shareholders (or a declaration) that governs the rights and obligations of shareholders, particularly in relation to voting, control, or share transfers. |
| **Resident Canadian** | Includes Canadian citizens and permanent residents who are ordinarily resident in Canada (with some exceptions for those who have lived in Canada for over a year post-citizenship eligibility). |
| **Individual with Significant Control** | Defined as someone who holds 25% or more of voting rights or shares by fair market value, or who has direct/indirect influence over the corporation’s control. Joint holdings or agreements between individuals also trigger this status. |
| **Incapable** | An individual found legally unable to manage their property (not due to minority) or declared incapable by a court outside Canada. |
| **Auditor** | Includes partnerships or incorporated entities. |
| **Officer** | Includes directors, chairperson, president, secretary, treasurer, general counsel, general manager, etc. Any person performing similar functions. |
| **Person** | Encompasses individuals, partnerships, associations, bodies corporate, and personal representatives. |
| **Personal Representative** | Includes executors, administrators, trustees, guardians, liquidators, curators, receivers, and attorneys. |
| **Prescribed** | As defined in regulations. Used to allow flexibility in implementation (e.g., thresholds, reporting requirements). |

### 🌐 **Affiliation and Control Rules**

These rules define how corporate relationships are structured and governed under the CBCA.

#### Affiliation:
- Two or more bodies are **affiliated** if:
  - One is a subsidiary of the other, or
  - Both are subsidiaries of the same parent, or
  - Each is controlled by the same person.

> If two bodies are affiliated with the same third body at the same time, they are **deemed affiliated with each other**.

#### Control:
- A body corporate is **controlled** by a person or group if:
  - They hold **more than 50% of the voting rights** (not just as security) in the corporation.
  - Those voting rights are sufficient to elect a majority of directors.

> This is a **strict threshold** (over 50%) and applies only to voting rights, not fair market value.

#### Subsidiary:
A company is a **subsidiary** if:
- It is controlled by another body corporate, or
- It is controlled by that body corporate and one or more bodies that are also controlled by it, or
- It is a subsidiary of a body that is itself a subsidiary of the other.

> This creates a **nested control structure** — e.g., A controls B, B controls C → A controls C.

### 📜 **Incorporation Process**

#### Who Can Incorporate?
- One or more individuals or bodies corporate may incorporate a corporation.
- An individual must:
  - Be at least **18 years old**,
  - Not be **incapable**, and
  - Not be a **bankrupt**.

> No restrictions on nationality — anyone meeting these criteria can incorporate.

#### Articles of Incorporation
Must be signed by incorporators and follow a form prescribed by the Director.

**Mandatory Contents:**
1. **Name** of the corporation.
2. **Registered office** location (province).
3. **Classes of shares** and any maximum number authorized.
4. If multiple classes exist:
   - Rights, privileges, restrictions, and conditions for each class.
   - Authority to issue shares in **series** (with rights, conditions, and designations).
5. **Restrictions** on share transfer or ownership (if any).
6. **Number of directors**:
   - A fixed number, or
   - A minimum and maximum number (subject to section 107(a)).
7. **Business restrictions** (e.g., prohibited activities).

> Articles may include any provisions permitted by the Act or by by-laws.

#### Precedence of Articles or Agreements
- If articles or a **unanimous shareholder agreement** require a **greater number of votes** than required by the Act to take an action (e.g., approve a merger), those provisions **prevail**.
- However, **articles cannot require more votes than required by section 109** to remove a director.

> This ensures that shareholders have a floor of protection against excessive director removal requirements.

#### Submission and Approval
- Incorporators must **send articles and required documents** to the Director.
- The Director **must issue a certificate of incorporation** upon receipt, **unless**:
  - A required notice (under sections 19 or 106) indicates the corporation would violate this Act.

> The corporation **comes into existence on the date shown in the certificate**.
