**Detailed Summary of the *Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act***

---

### **1. Title and Purpose**
The *Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act* (EVAMPA) establishes a **fair, efficient, and accessible administrative monetary penalty (AMP) system** as an **alternative and supplement** to traditional criminal or civil penalties under environmental laws in Canada.

#### **Key Objectives:**
- To provide a **faster, less costly, and more proportionate enforcement mechanism** for environmental violations.
- To reduce the burden on the criminal justice system by addressing minor or repeat violations without resorting to prosecution.
- To promote compliance with environmental laws through **deterrence, accountability, and transparency**.
- To ensure that penalties are **proportionate, consistent, and enforceable**, while preserving the integrity of environmental protection.

### **3. Scope of Application**

This Act applies only to **offences under the Environmental Acts**. It does **not apply** to violations that are not criminal offences under these statutes.

#### **Specific Restrictions on Designated Violations:**
- **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999**: Only violations arising from:
  - **Part 7** (e.g., reporting, compliance with standards)
  - **Part 9** (e.g., environmental protection and risk assessment)
  - Any regulation made under these parts
- **Impact Assessment Act (IAA)**: Only the following contraventions or failures may be designated:
  - Violations under sections 7, 122(5), 125(3), 129(1), 135(2), 141(4)/(5), 142, or 143
  - Failure to comply with conditions established under subsection 64(2) or amended under section 68
  - Failure to provide required information under subsection 72(1)
- **Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GHGPPA)**: Only violations arising from **Part 2** (emissions reporting, compliance, and limits) or regulations made under that part.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Violations not falling within these specific provisions are **not eligible** for enforcement under this Act.

---

### **4. Penalty Limits**

Regulations may set the penalty amount, but **maximum limits are strictly capped**:
- **Individuals**: Maximum penalty = **$5,000**
- **Corporations, ships, or vessels**: Maximum penalty = **$25,000**

These caps ensure that penalties remain **proportional** and **non-punitive**, especially for first-time or minor infractions.

---

### **5. What Constitutes a Violation**

A violation occurs when:
- A person, ship, or vessel **contravenes** or **fails to comply** with:
  - A provision, regulation, order, or direction of an Environmental Act
  - A condition of a permit, licence, or authorization issued under such an Act

> **Key Principle**: The violation must be an **offence under the Environmental Act** to be eligible for enforcement under this Act.

---

### **6. Liability and Party to a Violation**

#### **Corporate Liability (Section 10)**
- If a **corporation** commits a violation, any **director, officer, agent, or mandatary** who:
  - Directed, authorized, assented to, acquiesced in, or participated in the violation
- Is **personally liable** for the penalty, even if the corporation is not prosecuted.

#### **Ship/Vessel Liability**
- If a **ship or vessel** commits a violation, any **director or officer of the owner/operator** who influenced the company’s policies or activities related to the violation is liable.
- If the **owner, operator, master, or chief engineer** directly directed, authorized, or participated in the violation, they are personally liable.

> This creates a **chain of liability**, extending responsibility beyond the entity to individuals with decision-making authority.

#### **Agent/Employee Liability**
- In proceedings against a person, it is sufficient to prove that the violation was committed by an **employee, agent, or mandatary**, even if that individual is not personally prosecuted.
- Similarly, for ships/vessels, proof that a **crew member or other person on board** committed the violation is sufficient.

> This simplifies enforcement and ensures accountability at the operational level.

### **7. Issuance of Notices of Violation**

#### **Who Can Issue a Notice?**
- A person **designated under paragraph 6(b)** (e.g., a compliance officer or enforcement official) may issue a notice if they have **reasonable grounds** to believe a violation has occurred.

#### **Contents of the Notice Must Include:**
1. Name of the person, ship, or vessel involved
2. Relevant facts surrounding the violation
3. The penalty amount
4. Right to request a **review** of the penalty or facts, and the **time limit** (30 days, or longer if allowed by the Chief Review Officer)
5. Instructions on how to pay the penalty
6. Notification that **failure to pay or request a review** constitutes a legal admission of violation

> This notice serves as both a **warning** and a **formal charge**, with clear procedural rights.

---

### **8. Defences and Legal Principles**

#### **No Defences Based on:**
- Due diligence
- Honest and reasonable belief in facts that would exonerate the party

> This removes common legal defences (like "I didn’t know" or "I took reasonable steps") from administrative penalties, emphasizing **accountability**.

#### **Common Law Defences (with Limitations)**
- Any common law principle that justifies or excuses an offence **applies to violations**, **unless it contradicts this Act**.
- Example: A defence of necessity or mistake may still apply, but only if it does not conflict with the purpose of AMPs.

> This balances fairness with the goal of consistent enforcement.

---

### **9. Multiple-Day Violations**

- A violation that occurs over **more than one day** constitutes **a separate violation for each day**.
- Similarly, under the GHGPPA, **each tonne of CO₂e emitted over the limit** (without compensation) constitutes a **separate violation**.

> This ensures **proportionality and accountability** over time.

---

### **10. Exclusivity of Enforcement Pathways**

- **Proceeding under this Act precludes prosecution** under the Environmental Act.
- Conversely, **prosecution under an Environmental Act precludes enforcement under this Act**.

> This prevents **double jeopardy** and ensures that **only one enforcement route** is used per incident.

> Also, **section 126 of the Criminal Code (which deals with criminal liability)** does **not apply** to violations under this Act — penalties are purely administrative.

---

### **11. Time Limits for Enforcement**

- A notice of violation **cannot be issued more than two years** after the violation arises.
- A person or vessel that **fails to pay the penalty or request a review within the prescribed time** (30 days or longer) is **deemed to have committed the violation** and is liable.

> This establishes a **clear and predictable timeline** for enforcement.

---

### **12. Review Process**

#### **Right to Request a Review**
- Within 30 days (or extended by the CRO), a party may request a **review** of:
  - The penalty amount
  - The facts of the alleged violation
  - Both

#### **Conduct of the Review**
- Conducted by:
  - A **review officer**, or
  - A **panel of three review officers** (assigned by the CRO)
- The **Chief Review Officer may be a member** of the panel.

#### **Parties to the Review**
- The person/ship/vessel requesting the review
- The **Minister** may appear in person or be represented by counsel

#### **Review Officer Powers**
- Can **summon witnesses**
