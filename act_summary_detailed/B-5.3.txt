The provided text consists of **repeated entries** indicating that a particular provision (or set of provisions) of a legislative act was **repealed before coming into force**.

Here is a **detailed summary** of what this means and its legal significance:

### 📝 Summary of the Text:

> **[Repealed before coming into force, 2008, c. 20, s. 3]**

This notation appears **repeated 20 times**, suggesting that multiple sections or provisions were designated for repeal under the same legislative instrument.

#### Key Elements of the Notation:
- **"Repealed before coming into force"**:  
  This means that the provision (or section) was formally **cancelled or removed** from the law **prior to the date when the act was scheduled to become effective**. In other words, the law did not actually take effect, and the section was never in force.

- **"2008, c. 20, s. 3"**:  
  - **2008** refers to the year the legislative action occurred.  
  - **c. 20** refers to **Bill 20 of 2008** (a specific act or bill introduced in that year).  
  - **s. 3** refers to **Section 3** of that bill.  

  Therefore, this notation indicates that **Section 3 of Bill 20 (2008)** was **intended to repeal certain provisions**, but the repeal was enacted **before the bill itself came into force** — so the repeal never had the opportunity to take effect in practice.

- **Multiple repetitions** (20 times):  
  This likely reflects a technical or editorial error in the original document — possibly a duplication of the same legal notice. It does **not** mean that 20 different sections were repealed, but rather that the same repeal notice was applied repeatedly, perhaps due to formatting or transcription issues.

### 🔍 Legal Implications:

1. **No Legal Effect**:  
   Since the provisions were repealed *before* the act came into force, they **never became part of the law** and therefore **do not have any legal standing**.

2. **Legislative Intent**:  
   The repeal may have been a result of:
   - Political or administrative decision to withdraw a provision.
   - Discovery of errors or inconsistencies.
   - Public or expert review leading to its removal.
   - A desire to avoid unintended consequences.

3. **Public Record**:  
   The notation is included in legal databases or statutes to maintain transparency — showing that a provision was **intended to be removed**, even if it never took effect.

4. **Historical Significance**:  
   This entry helps researchers or legal professionals understand the **evolution of legislation** and identify provisions that were abandoned or withdrawn early.

### ✅ Conclusion:

The repeated entries of **"[Repealed before coming into force, 2008, c. 20, s. 3]"** indicate that **Section 3 of Bill 20 (2008)** was **intended to repeal certain provisions**, but the repeal was enacted **prior to the bill’s effective date**, meaning those provisions **never became law**.

This is a **common administrative or legislative practice** to correct errors, avoid unintended legal consequences, or respond to public or expert feedback — and the repetition is likely a formatting or transcription error, not a reflection of multiple distinct repeals.
