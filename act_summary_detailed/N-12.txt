The provided text consists entirely of **repeal notices** indicating that various provisions of a prior act have been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by amendments to legislation.

Here is a **detailed summary** of the information:

### 🔍 Summary of the Document

The text lists multiple entries stating that specific sections (or provisions) of a former act have been **repealed** — that is, legally removed and no longer in force — through amendments passed in the year **2004** (specifically, *Chapter 11, Section 56* and various other sections) and in **1995** (*Chapter 29, Section 61 and 62*).

#### Key Points:

1. **Nature of the Content**:
   - This is **not a summary of an active act**, but rather a **list of repealed provisions**.
   - The entries indicate that the original legal provisions were **no longer valid** after being formally repealed.

2. **Repeal Dates and Legislation**:
   - **2004, c. 11, s. 56**: This section of the *Statutes of Canada* (or a provincial statute, depending on jurisdiction) repealed certain provisions of a prior act.
     - *c. 11* refers to a specific bill or act passed in 2004 (Chapter 11).
     - *s. 56* refers to Section 56 of that act.
     - This repeal likely targeted a number of sections (indicated by the repeated "s." entries), suggesting a broad or comprehensive revision.
   - **1995, c. 29, s. 61 and s. 62**: These refer to earlier repeals under a different legislative act from 1995 (Chapter 29), specifically sections 61 and 62.

3. **Number of Repeals**:
   - There are **14 entries** in total.
   - Most of them are repeated (e.g., “Repealed, 2004, c. 11, s.”) — suggesting that multiple sections of a former act were repealed under the same amendment.
   - The entries are **not labeled with specific section numbers**, only with the year, chapter, and section (e.g., s. 56, s. 61, s. 62), which implies that the original act had several provisions that were either:
     - Removed due to redundancy,
     - Found to be outdated or inconsistent with new laws,
     - Or replaced by new legislation.

4. **Jurisdictional Context**:
   - While the exact name of the original act is not provided, such repeals are common in legal systems like Canada’s (federal or provincial), where laws are periodically updated or restructured.
   - The use of "c." (chapter) and "s." (section) follows standard legislative citation formats.

5. **Legal Significance**:
   - Repeal means the provision **no longer applies**.
   - It is a formal process that ensures the law is current and reflects modern policy or administrative needs.
   - Repealed sections are typically **not enforceable**, and any legal action based on them would be invalid.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> The provided text is a list of legal provisions that have been repealed (canceled) through amendments to legislation in **1995** and **2004**. These repeals were enacted under specific sections of acts (e.g., *c. 11, s. 56* and *c. 29, s. 61/62*), indicating that multiple sections of a prior law were formally removed due to obsolescence, redundancy, or legislative reform.
