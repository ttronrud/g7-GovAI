### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Recognition of Aboriginal Rights and Title**
- The Act begins with a foundational recognition that:
  - The **Crees of Eeyou Istchee** are an **aboriginal people of Canada**.
  - They assert **aboriginal rights in and title to the Eeyou Marine Region**, as defined in the Agreement.
  - The Eeyou Marine Region is a **fundamental and integral component** of Eeyou Istchee, as defined in the Agreement.
- These assertions are grounded in **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, which recognizes and affirms the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada.

> ✅ This establishes the legal and constitutional legitimacy of the agreement based on constitutional principles.

---

#### **2. Nature of the Agreement**
- The Agreement is formally defined as:
  - A **treaty under Section 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- It was:
  - Negotiated between the **Crees of Eeyou Istchee**, represented by the **Grand Council of the Crees (GCC)**, and the **Government of Canada**.
  - Approved by the Crees through a **vote from March 15 to 26, 2010**.
  - Signed on **July 7, 2010**, on behalf of the Crees and Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- The Act confirms that **no legislative action can be taken without ratification** by Parliament — which is achieved through this Act.

- These bodies are granted:
  - The **capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person** (i.e., they can act independently, make decisions, and enter into obligations).
- However, they are **not agents of Her Majesty in right of Canada** — meaning they operate independently and are not acting on behalf of the federal government.

> ✅ This empowers Indigenous-led governance structures to manage environmental, planning, and development issues in the region.

#### **5. Financial Obligations**
- Monetary obligations under **Chapters 13, 22, 23, and 25** of the Agreement (which cover compensation, funding, and other financial commitments) are to be paid out of the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada.

> ✅ Ensures that financial obligations are funded through federal public revenue, providing transparency and accountability.

#### **6. Judicial Notice and Evidence**

- A **copy published by the Queen’s Printer** is:
  - **Evidentiary proof** of the Agreement and its contents.
  - **Presumed authentic** unless proven otherwise.
- This ensures legal certainty and access to the Agreement in court or administrative proceedings.
