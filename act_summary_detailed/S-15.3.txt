## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**

### **1. Introduction and Purpose**

The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) is a foundational piece of Canadian environmental legislation designed to **protect and recover wildlife species at risk of extinction**. It recognizes that Canada’s natural heritage is central to national identity, culture, history, and well-being — both for Canadians and for the global community.

#### Key Principles Underlying the Act:
- Wildlife has intrinsic value — it is valued for **aesthetic, cultural, spiritual, recreational, educational, historical, economic, medical, ecological, and scientific reasons**.
- Canada has ratified the **United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)**, and SARA fulfills Canada’s international commitments to conserve biological diversity.
- The Act emphasizes **proactive action** even in the face of scientific uncertainty: *cost-effective measures to prevent serious or irreversible damage to species should not be delayed due to lack of full scientific certainty*.
- Conservation is a **shared responsibility** among federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as Indigenous peoples and communities.
- The Act promotes **cooperation, coordination, and integration** of knowledge — including traditional Indigenous knowledge — in decision-making.

### **2. Key Definitions (Critical to Understanding the Act)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|----------|
| **Wildlife Species** | A species, subspecies, variety, or geographically/genetically distinct population of animal, plant, or organism (excluding bacteria or viruses) that is wild by nature and either: (a) native to Canada; or (b) has extended its range into Canada without human intervention and has been present for at least 50 years. |
| **Species at Risk** | Includes: <br> - Extirpated (no longer exists in Canada, but exists elsewhere) <br> - Endangered (facing imminent extirpation or extinction) <br> - Threatened (likely to become endangered if no action is taken) <br> - Species of Special Concern (may become threatened or endangered due to biological traits and threats) |
| **Habitat** | The area where a species naturally occurs or depends on for survival (e.g., breeding, feeding, migration). For aquatic species, includes spawning grounds, nurseries, migration routes. |
| **Critical Habitat** | The specific habitat necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed species, identified in a recovery strategy or action plan. |
| **Residence** | A dwelling place such as a den, nest, or shelter used by individuals during life cycles (breeding, feeding, hibernation, etc.). |
| **Individual** | Includes all developmental stages: larvae, embryos, eggs, sperm, seeds, pollen, spores, asexual propagules. |
| **Competent Minister** | The federal minister responsible for a given species: <br> - Minister of Environment (all non-aquatic species) <br> - Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (aquatic species) <br> - Minister responsible for Parks Canada (federal lands) |
| **Public Registry** | A publicly accessible database where key documents (e.g., recovery strategies, action plans) are stored and updated. |
| **COSEWIC** | Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada — assesses species status and classifies them. |

> Note: A key provision states that a species is presumed to have been in Canada for at least 50 years unless proven otherwise — this supports the inclusion of species that have naturally migrated.

- **Functions**:
  - Provides **general direction** to COSEWIC on assessments and classifications.
  - Oversees the **preparation and implementation** of recovery strategies and action plans.
  - Coordinates activities among federal, provincial, and territorial governments to ensure consistent and effective conservation efforts.

#### B. **National Aboriginal Council on Species at Risk**
- Established by the Minister to include **six representatives from Aboriginal peoples of Canada**, selected based on recommendations from Aboriginal organizations.
- **Roles**:
  - Advises the Minister on administration of SARA.
  - Provides advice and recommendations to the CESCC.
- Emphasizes **Indigenous knowledge and participation** in species conservation.

#### C. **Advisory Committees**
- The Minister may establish one or more **advisory committees** to assist with:
  - Administration of the Act
  - Specific technical or policy issues related to the CESCC

---

### **4. Key Provisions and Mechanisms**

#### A. **Assessment and Classification of Species (COSEWIC Role)**
- COSEWIC evaluates each wildlife species to determine its status using the best available scientific, community, and **Aboriginal traditional knowledge**.
- Classifications include:
  - Extinct
  - Extirpated
  - Endangered
  - Threatened
  - Species of Special Concern
- COSEWIC must:
  - Determine when species should be assessed (with priority on those most at risk)
  - Reassess and reclassify species as needed
  - Identify whether species migrate across Canada’s borders
  - Develop and review classification criteria
  - Provide advice to the Minister and CESCC

> **Note**: COSEWIC must consider **treaties and land claims agreements** when assessing species status.

#### B. **Recovery Strategies and Action Plans**
- **Recovery Strategy**: A comprehensive plan outlining how a species can be recovered. Must be developed and registered in the public registry.
- **Action Plan**: A detailed, site-specific plan that includes specific actions, timelines, and responsibilities. Also registered in the public registry.
- These plans are **living documents** and can be amended with public input.

#### C. **Delegation of Powers**
- The Minister (or relevant competent minister) may delegate enforcement and administrative powers to:
  - Other federal ministers
  - Provincial governments
  - Government employees or agencies
- Delegation requires:
  - A formal agreement between delegating and delegate
  - Annual reporting to the delegating minister
  - Copy of the agreement and annual report must be filed in the **public registry within 45 days**

#### D. **Stewardship Action Plan**
- A mechanism to **encourage and support voluntary conservation efforts** by individuals, communities, and organizations.
- Must include:
  - Examinations of incentives and programs supporting stewardship
  - Public awareness campaigns about species at risk
  - Methods for sharing **community and Indigenous traditional knowledge** (with respect and approval of knowledge holders)
  - Recognition programs (awards, honors)
  - Information on stewardship agreements, land conservation easements
  - Access to technical and scientific support

> This promotes **community involvement** and recognizes that all Canadians have a role in species conservation.

#### E. **Conservation Agreements**
- Competent ministers may enter into **conservation agreements** with governments, organizations, or individuals to:
  - Benefit species at risk
  - Enhance survival in the wild
- Agreements may include:
  - Monitoring species status
  - Developing education and public awareness programs

  - Conducting research
  - Implementing recovery strategies and action plans

> These are **flexible, collaborative tools** that allow for shared responsibility and funding.

#### F. **Agreements for Non-At-Risk Species**
- Competent ministers may also enter into agreements to:
  - Protect wildlife species that are **not currently at risk**
  - Prevent them from becoming at risk
- Includes measures like:
  - Habitat protection
  - Public education
  - Monitoring
  - Preventing threats

> This shows a **proactive, preventive approach** to biodiversity conservation.

#### G. **Cost-Sharing Agreements**
- The government may enter into agreements to **share the financial costs** of conservation programs and measures.
