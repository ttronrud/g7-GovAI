**Detailed Summary of the Railway Belt Act**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The Act is formally titled the **Railway Belt Act** and may be cited as such. This legislation was enacted in the province of **British Columbia, Canada**, during the late 19th century, primarily to facilitate the development and expansion of the **Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)** across the mainland of the province.

### **2. Definition of "Railway Belt"**
The term **"Railway Belt"** is defined in the Act as:
> *The tract of land in the province of British Columbia within which lie the lands granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of the said province.*

This definition is rooted in earlier provincial legislation:
- It originates from **Section 1 of the Act of the Legislature of British Columbia, Chapter Eleven of 1880**.
- It was amended by **Chapters Fourteen of 1883 and 1884**, which adjusted the boundaries and land allocations to better accommodate railway construction.

Thus, the "Railway Belt" refers specifically to a designated geographic area in British Columbia where land was set aside by the provincial government for the purpose of supporting the construction of the CPR.

### **3. Boundary Description of the Railway Belt**
The western boundary of the Railway Belt is precisely defined by a detailed, step-by-step description that follows natural features and surveyed lines. The boundary begins at the **international boundary** and proceeds through several key geographic points:

1. **Commencement Point**:  
   Intersection of the **international boundary** with the waters of **Semiahmoo Bay** (a branch of Boundary Bay, which itself is an arm of the Pacific Ocean).

2. **Westerly and Northerly Along Bays**:  
   - Follows the **shore of Semiahmoo Bay** and then **Mud Bay** (another branch of Boundary Bay) to a point where the **west boundary line of Township Two, New Westminster District** meets the waters of Mud Bay.

3. **North Along Township Boundary**:  
   - Proceeds **north along the west boundary line of Township Two** to its **northwest corner**.

4. **Along Roads to the Fraser River**:  
   - Travels **northerly** along the **eastern side lines** of:
     - The **Mud Bay (or Scott) Road**
     - The **Yale Road**
   - Reaches the **south bank of the Fraser River** at **Brownsville**.

5. **Crossing the Fraser River**:  
   - Proceeds **northerly**, crossing the Fraser River to a point on the **north bank** where the **eastern side line of the North Road**, if extended south, would intersect the north bank of the Fraser River.

6. **Along the North Road**:  
   - Travels **north** along the **eastern side line of the North Road** until it reaches its intersection with the **south shore of Burrard Inlet**.

7. **Along the North Shore of Burrard Inlet**:  
   - Proceeds **north** to the **north shore line of Burrard Inlet**.

8. **Westerly and Northerly Along Burrard Inlet**:  
   - Follows the **shoreline of Burrard Inlet** westerly and northerly to the **most northerly point of the peninsula between Bedwell Bay and the North Arm of Burrard Inlet**.

9. **Northeasterly Straight Line**:  
   - Proceeds **northeasterly on a straight line** to the point where the **northern boundary of Township Thirty-Nine West of the Coast Meridian** intersects the **eastern shore of the North Arm of Burrard Inlet**.

10. **Along the Eastern Shore of the North Arm**:  
    - Proceeds **northerly** along the **eastern shore** of the North Arm to the **mouth of the Mesliloet River**, a stream flowing from the north into the head of the North Arm.

11. **Along the Mesliloet River**:  
    - Travels **northerly** along the **middle of the main channel** of the Mesliloet River to the point where it intersects the **northern boundary of Township Seven in Range Seven, West of the Seventh Meridian**, as per the **Dominion Lands System** used in the railway belt surveys.

This precise, topographically grounded boundary ensures that the land designated for railway construction is clearly demarcated and legally defined, minimizing disputes over land ownership and use.

### **4. Land Disposition and Settlement Rights**
The Act establishes a framework for how the lands within the Railway Belt are made available to settlers:

- **Open for Entry**:  
  All lands within the Railway Belt that have **not already been disposed of** shall be **open for entry** by **bona fide settlers**.

- **Lot Size and Pricing**:  
  Settlers may enter the land in **lots**, and the **size of lots and the price** at which they may be purchased are determined by the **Governor in Council** (the federal executive authority).

This provision reflects the colonial-era policy of encouraging settlement and development through accessible land grants, particularly in areas critical to infrastructure like railway construction.

---

### **5. Prior Rights of Squatters with Improvements**
A significant and protective provision is included for individuals who **squatted on the land prior to December 19, 1883**:

- Any person who **squatted on the lands** before that date and who has made **substantial improvements** (such as building homes, fences, or other structures) shall have a **prior right of purchase**.

- This right allows them to **buy the land** at the **same rates** charged to general settlers.

This clause recognizes the rights of early settlers and prevents displacement of long-term occupants who had established themselves and invested in the land, even in the absence of formal legal title.

---

### **6. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**
The **Governor in Council** (a federal body representing the Crown) is granted broad powers to regulate the management of the Railway Belt lands:

- May **determine the manner** in which the land is:
  - Surveyed
  - Laid out
  - Administered
  - Dealt with
  - Disposed of

This power allows for flexibility in response to changing needs, such as expansion of the railway, changes in settlement patterns, or economic conditions.

> **Note**: This provision was **repealed in 1950** by **Section 10 of Chapter 50**, indicating that the Act was eventually superseded by later legislation or administrative reforms.

---

### **7. Validity of Letters Patent to Deceased Individuals**
The Act includes a critical legal safeguard:

- If **letters patent** (official land grants) are issued **in the name of a deceased person**, they are **not void**.
- The **title to the land** shall **vest in the legal heirs, assigns, devisees, or other representatives** of the deceased person **according to provincial succession laws**.
- This ensures that the land grant is not invalidated due to the death of the grantee and provides continuity in land ownership.

This provision is essential for maintaining legal certainty in land transactions involving deceased individuals, especially in a colonial context where land grants were often made to individuals or companies.

---

### **8. Role of the Dominion Lands Board**
The **Dominion Lands Board** (a federal body responsible for managing Crown land in Canada) is granted the **same powers and duties** as those conferred upon it in the **Dominion Lands Act**.

- This includes:
  - Administering the land
  - Conducting surveys
  - Managing entries and disposals
  - Ensuring compliance with land policies

This ensures a consistent and centralized administrative system for managing the railway belt lands, aligning them with broader federal land policies.

---

### **Key Historical and Legal Context**
- The Railway Belt Act was enacted during a period of intense railway development in British Columbia (late 1800s), when the Canadian Pacific Railway was being constructed to connect the Pacific coast with the interior and the rest of Canada.
- The Act reflects a **colonial-era approach** to land management: balancing infrastructure needs (railway construction) with settler access and protection of early occupants.
- It is a product of **provincial legislation** (initially) that was later **integrated into federal land administration** through the Dominion Lands Board.

---

### **Repeal and Legacy**
- The provision allowing the Governor in Council to regulate land administration was **repealed in 1950** (Section 10 of Chapter 50), indicating that the Act was no longer relevant or necessary in the modern era.
- The Act itself is now **historically significant**, as it:
  - Defined the geographic scope of railway-related land grants.
  - Established settlement rights and protections for early squatters.
  - Provided a legal framework for land administration during a pivotal period in Canadian westward expansion.

While the Act is no longer in force, its provisions laid the foundation for future land policies in British Columbia and influenced how railway-related land was managed in Canada.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Railway Belt Act** is a foundational piece of legislation that:
- Precisely defined a large tract of land in British Columbia for railway development.
- Established rules for land entry and settlement.
- Protected the rights of early squatters with improvements.
- Provided legal continuity for land grants after a person's death.
- Empowered federal authorities to manage land administration.
