**Detailed Summary of the Livestock Feed Assistance Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Livestock Feed Assistance Act* is a federal statute enacted to ensure the stability, availability, and equitable pricing of feed grain for livestock producers across key regions of Canada. The Act was originally designed to support livestock feeders—particularly in Eastern Canada and British Columbia—by providing financial assistance, facilitating storage, and stabilizing market conditions. However, it is important to note that **this Act has been repealed**, as explicitly stated in the text:  
> "[Repealed, 1991, c. 38, s. 12]" and "[Repealed, 1991, c. 38, s. 13]"  

This means the Act no longer has legal force in Canada. It was replaced or superseded by other legislation, likely through the restructuring of agricultural support programs in the 1990s. Nevertheless, this summary provides a detailed analysis of the **former provisions** of the Act as they existed prior to repeal.

## **Powers and Authorities of the Minister**

The Minister has broad powers to implement the Act's objectives, including:

### **1. Financial Assistance Payments**
- Can make **payments related to:**
  - The **cost of storing feed grain** in Eastern Canada.
  - The **cost of transporting feed grain** (e.g., to or from storage or farms).

These payments are governed by **regulations** that specify:
- Who is eligible (e.g., livestock feeders)
- The conditions under which payments are made
- The rates and geographic areas covered

### **2. Negotiation Powers**
- May negotiate with agencies or individuals involved in:
  - Feed grain storage
  - Handling
  - Transportation  
  To reduce or stabilize costs and secure adequate storage capacity.

### **3. Allocation of Storage Space**
- Can allocate space reserved for the Minister’s use in storage facilities among livestock feeders who need storage.

### **4. Importation of Feed Grain**
- May negotiate for **import licenses** to bring feed grain into Canada for use **outside the designated area**.
- Can contract with feed grain dealers to import grain under those licenses.

### **5. Regulatory Enforcement and Information Gathering**
- By **order** (served personally or by registered mail), can require any person involved in storing, handling, shipping, or pricing feed grain to:
  - Provide written information about:
    - Feed grain consumption
    - Storage levels
    - Handling practices
    - Pricing trends  
  Within a reasonable time frame.

> This power enables the Minister to monitor market dynamics and ensure transparency.

### **6. General Authority**

## **Minister’s Power to Buy or Import Feed Grain (Emergency Powers)**

### **Under Section 17 (Repealed 1991):**
- The Minister may:
  - Buy or enter into contracts to purchase feed grain.
  - Import feed grain from outside Canada (if authorized by a license obtained in the Minister’s name).
  - Take delivery, store, handle, and **sell or dispose of** feed grain.

### **Emergency Authorization**
- If the Minister advises the Governor in Council that an **emergency exists**, the Governor may authorize the Minister to act under these provisions.

### **Disposal of Grain Purchased**
- The Minister must sell or dispose of grain acquired under emergency powers:

  - At a price the Minister considers **reasonable**
  - With the goal of **recovering all costs** incurred, including:
    - Purchase price
    - Handling
    - Storage
    - Transportation
    - Administration costs  
  - *Minus* any payments made to the Minister’s own account (e.g., storage or transport payments)

> This ensures that the government does not incur a net loss on emergency purchases.

### **Ongoing Studies**
- The Minister is required to conduct a **continuing study** of:
  - Feed grain requirements in Eastern Canada and BC
  - Availability of feed grain
  - Need for additional storage facilities

This ensures proactive planning and long-term policy development.
