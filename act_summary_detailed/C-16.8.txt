**Detailed Summary of the *Veterans Well-being Act***

### **Overview**

The *Veterans Well-being Act* is a comprehensive piece of legislation enacted by Her Majesty in Council, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. It establishes a framework to recognize and fulfill Canada’s obligation to show **just and due appreciation** to members and veterans of the Canadian Forces for their service. The Act ensures that those who have served, or have been injured or died as a result of military service, and their families (including spouses, common-law partners, survivors, and orphans), receive appropriate **compensation, support, and services**.

The Act is designed to be **liberally interpreted** to ensure that the government fulfills its duty of care and respect toward veterans and their dependents. It includes provisions on **health-related benefits, education and training support, career transition services, rehabilitation, and eligibility criteria**, while also excluding certain cases—such as those involving self-inflicted harm or improper conduct.
