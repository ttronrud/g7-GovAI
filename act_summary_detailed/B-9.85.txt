**Detailed Summary of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2001***

The *Budget Implementation Act, 2001* is a legislative instrument passed by the Parliament of Canada, enacted by Her Majesty (the monarch) on the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. This Act serves as a vehicle to implement key provisions of the federal government’s 2001 budget, particularly those related to security, international development, and infrastructure funding.

### 1. **Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act (Amendment)**

- **Key Provision**: Sections 2 and 3 (or any provisions enacted under Section 2) of the *Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act* are amended to specify that these provisions will come into force on a day or days to be determined by order of the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet).
- **Effective Date**: The amendments are noted to have come into force on **April 1, 2002**, as per **Statutory Instrument SI/2002-63**.
- **Purpose**: This amendment likely strengthens or restructures the legal framework governing the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA), which is responsible for aviation security in Canada. The delayed implementation (via Governor in Council order) allows for administrative preparation and policy alignment before enforcement.

- **General Implementation**: Subject to subsection (2), the provisions of this Part or any new Acts enacted by this Part will come into force on a day or days to be fixed by the Governor in Council.

The amendments clarify implementation timelines and include transitional arrangements to ensure a smooth rollout, particularly in relation to employment and administrative obligations.

### Key Themes and Overall Purpose

1. **Security Enhancement**:
   - The amendments to the *Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act* and the *Air Travellers Security Charge Act* reflect Canada’s post-9/11 commitment to enhancing aviation security. The security charge provides a dedicated revenue stream to fund these efforts.

2. **Phased Implementation**:
   - The Act uses a **phased and flexible enforcement schedule** through Governor in Council orders. This allows the government to manage implementation based on administrative readiness, public consultation, and fiscal planning.

3. **International Development**:
   - The *Canada Fund for Africa Act* underscores Canada’s role in global development, particularly in Africa, with clear milestones for fund deployment.

4. **Legislative Flexibility**:
   - The use of "Governor in Council orders" to determine effective dates ensures that implementation can be adjusted based on evolving circumstances, such as economic conditions or policy developments.

5. **Compliance with Existing Laws**:
   - The note that Section 16 of the Air Travellers Security Charge Act overrides Section 153 of the Employment Insurance Act shows a deliberate effort to ensure that security-related measures can proceed without being blocked by employment insurance rules (e.g., regarding employee benefits or layoffs).
