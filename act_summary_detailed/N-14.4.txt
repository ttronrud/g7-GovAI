**Detailed Summary of the *National Public Service Week: Serving Canadians Better Act***

---

**1. Purpose and Context (Whereas Clauses):**

The Act begins with two foundational "Whereas" clauses that establish its intent and background:

- **Recognition of Public Service Contributions:** The people of Canada recognize the valuable services rendered by federal public service employees. This acknowledges the critical role that civil servants play in delivering government services, maintaining public trust, and supporting the effective functioning of federal institutions.

- **Government Acknowledgment of Service:** The Government of Canada wishes to formally acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of federal public service employees to the federal administration. This includes their professionalism, dedication, innovation, and service to Canadians across a wide range of policy areas and public programs.

These clauses emphasize the importance of public service not only as a career path but as a vital component of democratic governance and public trust.

**2. Enactment and Citation:**

- The Act is formally enacted by Her Majesty, acting on the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada.

**3. Establishment of National Public Service Week:**

- **Definition of the Week:** Throughout Canada, the **third week of June** each year shall be officially recognized and known as **"National Public Service Week"**.
  
- **Definition of "Third Week":** For the purposes of this Act, the "third week" is defined as:
  - Beginning on the **Sunday immediately preceding the third Saturday of June**.
  - Ending on the **third Saturday of June**.
  
  This means the week spans **seven days**, starting on a Sunday and concluding on a Saturday, aligning with standard weekly patterns and allowing for inclusive public engagement across communities.

  *Example:*  
  If June 25 is a Saturday, then:
  - Third Saturday = June 25
  - Second Saturday = June 18
  - First Saturday = June 11  
  → Third week begins on **June 12 (Sunday)** and ends on **June 25 (Saturday)**.
