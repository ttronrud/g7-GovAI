The provided text appears to be a **draft or partial enactment of a Canadian Act**, likely intended to establish a legal framework for determining access to land and water in the Northwest Territories — particularly in relation to Indigenous agreements — and to create a formal body to resolve disputes over such access.

However, there is a **critical issue**: the text contains **multiple repeated lines** stating:

> [Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 67]

This indicates that **the entire provision or act has been repealed** by the *Statutes of Canada, 2014, Chapter 2, Section 67*. As such, **the act as presented is no longer in force** and does not currently apply law in Canada.

### Detailed Summary (as if the act were active and valid)

Despite the repealing note, here is a **detailed, hypothetical summary** of what the *intended* act would have accomplished — based on the preamble and structure of the text:

---

## **Summary of the Intended Act:**

### **1. Purpose and Background**
The act was designed to:

- Establish a **legislative regime** for determining **terms and conditions of access** to specific Indigenous lands and waters in the Northwest Territories:
  - **Gwich’in lands**
  - **Sahtu lands**
  - **Tlicho lands**
  - **Inuvialuit lands**
  - And the **waters overlying** these lands

- Provide a **compensation framework** for individuals or companies seeking access to these lands and waters, particularly for commercial purposes (e.g., oil and gas, mining, transportation, or infrastructure development).

- Extend this regime to **other lands in the Northwest Territories**, not just those under existing Indigenous agreements, thereby creating a broader, consistent access and compensation system.

### **2. Establishment of a Surface Rights Board**
A key innovation proposed in the act was the creation of a **Surface Rights Board** — an independent, public institution of government — with the following functions:

- To **resolve disputes** over access to land and water (primarily for commercial use).
- To **determine fair and equitable terms and conditions** of access.
- To **set compensation amounts** for landowners or Indigenous communities when access is granted.
- To provide **transparent, consistent, and impartial decision-making** in access cases, reducing legal uncertainty and conflict.

This board would operate under a framework aligned with the **Gwich’in, Sahtu, Inuvialuit, and Tlicho Agreements**, which are land-use and resource-sharing agreements between the Canadian government and Indigenous peoples in the North.

### **3. Legal and Policy Rationale**
The rationale behind the act includes:

- **Indigenous rights and self-determination**: Ensuring that Indigenous communities have a formal, legal mechanism to govern access to their traditional territories.
- **Economic development**: Enabling responsible and transparent commercial access to natural resources while protecting environmental and cultural values.
- **Legal clarity**: Replacing fragmented or inconsistent access rules with a single, centralized legal framework.
- **Conflict prevention**: By establishing a neutral, expert body to adjudicate disputes, the act aims to reduce litigation and promote peaceful, cooperative development.

### **4. Scope and Application**
- Applies to:
  - Land and waters in the **Northwest Territories**.
  - Lands and waters covered under the **Gwich’in, Sahtu, Inuvialuit, and Tlicho Agreements**.
  - Other lands in the NWT where access is sought for commercial purposes.
- Focuses on **commercial access**, though it may include other forms of use (e.g., research, tourism) as secondary.

### **5. Repeal and Current Status**
Despite being drafted to address these objectives, the **entire provision has been repealed** by:

> **Section 67 of Chapter 2 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014**  
> (Repealed: 2014, c. 2, s. 67)

This means:
- The act **does not currently exist in force**.
- The provisions it would have created — including the Surface Rights Board and access rules — **are no longer part of Canadian law**.
- Any access decisions or disputes related to these lands are now governed by:
  - Existing Indigenous agreements (e.g., Gwich’in Agreement, Sahtu Agreement),
  - Federal laws (e.g., *Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, *National Energy Board* policies),
  - Provincial or territorial regulations,
  - Or by dispute resolution mechanisms outside of a central board.

---

### Conclusion

While the **preamble and structure** of the act reflect a well-intentioned effort to modernize land access governance in Canada’s North — promoting fairness, Indigenous partnership, and transparency — **the act itself has been formally repealed in 2014**.

Therefore, **this legislation is not currently active**. Its principles may have influenced later policy developments, such as the **Inuvialuit Final Agreement**, **Sahtu Final Agreement**, or the **creation of regional resource governance bodies**, but it does not currently operate as law.

### Recommendation for Users
If you are researching land access or Indigenous rights in the Northwest Territories:
- Consult the **Gwich’in Agreement (1992)**, **Sahtu Agreement (1992)**, **Inuvialuit Final Agreement (1984)**, and **Tlicho Agreement (2005)**.
- Review the **Canadian government’s Indigenous and Northern Affairs portfolio** for current policies.
- Look into the **Northwest Territories’ Land Use Planning and Resource Management framework**.

The 2014 repeal suggests that the government chose to **restructure or replace** the proposed regime with other mechanisms, possibly due to legal, political, or Indigenous community feedback.
