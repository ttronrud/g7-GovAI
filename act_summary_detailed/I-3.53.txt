### ✅ 4. **Residence Rules**

#### **Individuals**
An individual who is a resident of both countries is deemed to be a resident of:
1. The State where they have a **permanent home** (if available in both)
2. If permanent home is shared or not available → the State with **closer personal and economic ties** ("centre of vital interests")
3. If centre of vital interests cannot be determined → the State where they have **habitual abode**
4. If habitual abode is shared or absent → the State of their **nationality**
5. If nationality is shared or absent → **mutual agreement** between authorities

> This rule prevents double taxation by determining which country has jurisdiction over a person's income.

#### **Companies**
- A company is deemed a resident of:
  - The State of its **nationality**
  - If no nationality → the State where its **place of effective management** is located

#### **Other Persons**
- For non-individual, non-company persons (e.g., trusts, associations), the competent authorities must **mutually agree** on residency status.

> Ensures fair treatment and avoids ambiguity in tax jurisdiction.

### ✅ 5. **Permanent Establishment (PE)**

#### **Definition**
A **permanent establishment** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

#### **Examples of PE include**:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry
- Building site, construction, assembly, installation project (if lasting >6 months)
- Services (consultancy) provided by employees or personnel (if ongoing for >6 months in any 12-month period)

#### **Exclusions (Not a PE)**:
- Use of facilities for **storage or display** of goods
- Maintenance of stock solely for storage/display
- Stock maintained solely for processing by another enterprise
- Fixed place for **purchasing goods** or **collecting information**
- Fixed place for **preparatory or auxiliary activities**
- Any combination of the above if overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary

> These exclusions prevent the creation of PE for minor or ancillary functions.

#### **Special Rule for Agents of Independent Status**
- If a person (not an independent agent) acts on behalf of a foreign enterprise:
  - Has **authority to conclude contracts** in a foreign country → enterprise has a PE
  - Has **no such authority** but maintains stock from which goods are regularly delivered → enterprise has a PE

> This ensures that even without a formal office, business activities can trigger tax obligations.

#### **Insurance Exception**
- An insurance enterprise (except reinsurance) has a PE in the other country **if it collects premiums** or insures risks located there — **even if through an agent** — **unless** the agent is an independent agent acting in the ordinary course.

> Protects insurance companies from being taxed in a foreign country for standard operations.

#### **Agents of Independent Status**
- A company is **not** deemed to have a PE just because it uses a broker, commission agent, or agent of independent status.
- However, if the agent's activities are **wholly or almost wholly** on behalf of the enterprise → **not considered an independent agent**.

> Balances flexibility with tax fairness.

#### **Control and Ownership**
- Merely **controlling or being controlled** by a foreign company, or carrying on business there, **does not** create a PE.

> Prevents misuse of control to shift profits.

### ✅ 6. **Taxation of Income**

#### **Income from Immovable Property**
- Income from immovable property (including agriculture, forestry) located in the other country may be taxed in that country.
- **Definition of immovable property**:
  - Includes property accessory to land, livestock, equipment used in agriculture/forestry
  - Rights to mineral deposits, usufruct, variable/fixed payments for working resources
  - **Excludes** ships and aircraft

> Applies to:
- Direct use, letting, or alienation of property
- Income from enterprises using immovable property
- Income from personal services performed using such property

#### **Profits of Enterprises**
- Profits of a resident enterprise are **taxable only in their home country**, unless they operate through a permanent establishment in the other country.
- If a PE exists, only the **profit attributable to that PE** is taxable in the foreign country.
