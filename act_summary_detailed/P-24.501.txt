**Detailed Summary of the *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act* (PCMLTFA)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act* (PCMLTFA) is a cornerstone of Canada’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) framework. Enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons, this legislation establishes a comprehensive system to detect, deter, and combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities. It aligns Canada with international standards—particularly those of the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)**—and strengthens the country’s financial integrity by imposing robust obligations on financial institutions, businesses, and service providers.

The Act is binding on the federal government and provinces and applies to a wide range of persons and entities engaged in financial transactions that could be exploited for illicit purposes.
