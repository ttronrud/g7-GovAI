**Detailed Summary of the Fertilizers Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Fertilizers Act* is a comprehensive piece of Canadian legislation designed to regulate the **manufacture, sale, importation, exportation, packaging, labelling, and distribution** of fertilizers and soil supplements. Its primary objectives are to ensure that these products are **safe for human, animal, and plant health**, do **not pose a risk to the environment**, and are **properly registered, labelled, and controlled** throughout their lifecycle. The Act establishes a regulatory framework under the authority of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, with enforcement powers delegated to inspectors and analysts.
