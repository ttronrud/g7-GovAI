**Detailed Summary of the *Labour Adjustment Benefits Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Labour Adjustment Benefits Act* (LABA) is a federal Canadian law designed to provide financial support to employees who lose their jobs due to **significant economic changes** in specific industries or regions. It ensures that workers affected by **non-cyclical economic restructuring** — such as technological change or import competition — are not left without income support during periods of unemployment. The Act establishes a structured process involving two key bodies: the **Labour Adjustment Review Board (Board)** and the **Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission)**, to determine eligibility and administer benefits.

## **Key Definitions and Key Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Employee** | Any individual employed at a Canadian establishment (i.e., a business producing goods or providing services). |
| **Lay-off** | A separation from employment for an indefinite period due solely to a reduction in the number of employees at a workplace. |
| **Industrial Restructuring** | Includes technological change, automation, or shifts in production methods that lead to job losses. |
| **Designated Industry** | An industry formally designated by the Governor in Council as undergoing significant non-cyclical economic adjustment resulting in substantial job losses. |
| **Labour Adjustment Benefits (LABs)** | Weekly financial benefits paid to eligible employees who were laid off in a designated industry. |
| **Effective Date of Lay-off** | The date the employee was laid off, determined by the Board. |
| **Average Weekly Insurable Earnings (AWIE)** | The weekly average of an employee’s insurable earnings, calculated under the *Employment Insurance Act*. |
| **Qualified Employee** | An employee who meets all eligibility criteria set out by the Commission and is certified by the Board to receive LABs. |

> **Age Rule**: For age-related purposes, a person is deemed to have reached age 65 at the beginning of the month following the month they actually turn 65.

## **Designation of Industries (Section 3)**

The Governor in Council may designate an industry as a **designated industry** under two scenarios:

### 1. **General Designation (Canada-wide)**
- **Trigger**: The industry is undergoing significant non-cyclical economic adjustment due to:
  - Import competition, or  
  - Government-led industrial restructuring.
- **Requirement**: Must result in a **significant loss of employment** across Canada generally.
- **Duration**: Initially valid for up to **3 years**. Can be extended once (maximum 3 years), with no more than one extension per original order.

### 2. **Regional Designation (Specific Region)**
- **Trigger**: The industry in a specific region is experiencing significant non-cyclical adjustment causing:
  - Severe economic disruption and  
  - A significant loss of employment in that region.
- **Duration**: Initially valid for **1 year**. Can be extended once (up to 6 months), and a second extension is allowed (also up to 6 months).

> **Retroactivity**: The Governor in Council may declare that a designation is **retroactive**, applying to lay-offs occurring **on or after May 1, 1978**, but not earlier.

> **Important Note**: Revocation or expiration of a designation **does not affect** the rights of employees laid off during the period. Those employees can still apply for benefits under the designation.

## **Application Process (Sections 11 & 13)**

### **Step 1: Application to the Board (Section 11)**
- Any laid-off employee may apply directly or through an employer, union, or third party.
- Application must include:
  - Employee’s name
  - Effective date of lay-off
  - Other information required by the Board
- The Board investigates eligibility and determines the **effective date of lay-off**.

### **Eligibility Criteria for Certification (Section 11(4))**
An employee is eligible for certification if:
1. They were laid off.
2. The Canadian establishment where they worked was part of a **designated industry** at the time of lay-off.
3. The establishment experienced a **reduction of at least 10% or 50 employees** (whichever is less) in any 12-month period including the lay-off date.
4. The lay-off resulted from **economic adjustment** as defined in Section 3 (e.g., industrial restructuring or import competition).

> **Note**: The Board certifies that the employee is eligible to apply to the **Commission** for benefits.

## **Application to the Commission (Section 13)**

Once certified, the employee applies to the **Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission)** for actual benefits.

### **Eligibility Criteria (Section 14)**

An employee qualifies for benefits if they meet **all of the following**:

| Requirement | Details |
|-----------|--------|
| **1. Citizenship/Residency** | Must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. |
| **2. Employment History** | At least **10 years** of employment in the **relevant designated industry** in the **15 years before** the lay-off. |
| **3. Age** | Must be **between 54 and 65 years of age** on the lay-off date. |
| **4. Employment Insurance (EI) Exhaustion** | Must have claimed and exhausted all EI benefits after lay-off. |
| **5. No Prospects of Employment** | No present prospect of employment (with or without training/relocation), or has accepted employment with earnings **less than AWIE**. |

> **Exception – Severe Financial Hardship (Section 14(2))**  
If the employee would otherwise qualify except for age or years of service, and the Commission determines they would suffer **severe financial hardship**, they may qualify **if**:
- Age + years of service ≥ **80**
- Age < 65 on lay-off

> **Exception – Substantial Compliance (Section 14(3))**  
If the employee **does not meet the years of service requirement** due to illness, disability, lay-off, or other "good cause," the Commission may waive this requirement if they show **substantial compliance**.

> **Special Rule – Employment in Other Designated Industries**  
If the employee worked in another designated industry prior to the lay-off, those periods may count toward the required 10 years of employment in the relevant industry.

---

## **Review of Eligibility (Section 16)**

The Commission must **review the employee’s situation at least every six months** to determine if they still meet the **"no prospect of employment"** requirement (paragraph 14(1)(f)).

### **Review Process**
- Commission may require the employee to attend in person to provide information.
- Failure to comply **without waiver** means the employee remains **unqualified**.
- Commission may **waive attendance** if circumstances warrant it.
- If the employee **meets the requirement after a review**, the Commission **revokes the prior decision** and notifies them in writing.

## **Payment of Benefits (Section 18)**

### **Start Date of Benefits**
Benefits begin on the **later of**:
1. The week immediately following the week when the employee exhausted their **EI benefits** after lay-off, or  
2. The week during which the employee **applied to the Commission** for benefits.

> **Special Case**: If the employee was certified by the Board **after** exhausting EI benefits, benefits start on the **later of**:
- That week (when EI was exhausted), and  
- The week they applied to the Board for certification  
...**to the week they were certified**.

### **Payment Schedule**
- Benefits are paid **every two weeks in arrears**.
- The **initial weekly benefit** is **60% of the employee’s Average Weekly Insurable Earnings (AWIE)**.
- Rounded to the nearest cent (if equidistant, rounded up).

### **Annual Adjustment**
- The weekly benefit is **adjusted annually** using the **Pension Index**.
- Formula:
  > **New Weekly Benefit** = (Initial Benefit) × (Pension Index of following year / Pension Index of lay-off year)  
  → Rounded to the nearest **one-thousandth** (e.g., 0.001), with equidistant values rounded up.

> Example: If the pension index increased from 1.000 to 1
