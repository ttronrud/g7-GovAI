**Detailed Summary of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act* is a Canadian federal statute that provides a comprehensive legal framework governing the transfer (sale, lease, or other disposition) of airports from the federal government to designated private or corporate entities. It addresses key issues including:

- The designation of **designated airport authorities** and **designated employees**;
- The application of **official languages rights** and **public service pension laws** to the new entity;
- **Tax treatment** for income derived from airport operations;
- **Enforcement mechanisms** for unpaid fees, including the seizure of aircraft;
- The **treatment of assets** and investments in relation to financial regulations.

This Act ensures a smooth transition of airport operations while protecting the rights of employees, maintaining linguistic equality, and enabling financial sustainability for the receiving authority.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definitions**

The Act establishes key terms:

- **Designated Airport Authority**:  
  A corporation or other body officially designated by the Governor in Council to receive an airport through sale, lease, or transfer. This designation is made under subsection (2).

- **Designated Employee**:  
  A person employed in the federal public administration at or in connection with an airport under the Minister of Transport’s management who is formally designated as a "designated employee" for that airport (under subsection (3)).

- **Minister**:  
  Refers to the **Minister of Transport**, responsible for overseeing airport operations and making transfer decisions.

- **Transfer Date**:  
  The specific date on which the Minister transfers ownership (by sale, lease, or otherwise) of an airport to a designated airport authority. This date is set by order of the Governor in Council.

### **2. Designation Powers**

#### **(a) Designation of Designated Airport Authority**
- The **Governor in Council** (on advice of the Minister) may, by **order**, designate any corporation or body to which the Minister intends to transfer an airport as a **designated airport authority**.
- This allows flexibility in choosing private-sector partners or public bodies to manage airports.

#### **(b) Designation of Transfer Date**
- The **Governor in Council** may also designate the **transfer date** for each airport — the date on which the transfer occurs.
- This ensures clarity in timing and legal effect of the transfer.

#### **(c) Designation of Designated Employees**
- The **Minister** may, by order, designate any employee working at or in connection with an airport under federal management as a **designated employee** for that airport.
- This ensures continuity of employment rights and benefits for staff during the transition.

### **3. Application of the Official Languages Act (Post-Transfer)**

Once a transfer occurs, **Parts IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, and X of the Official Languages Act** apply to the designated airport authority **as if it were a federal institution**, with modifications as required by circumstances.

#### **Key Points:**
- The airport is treated as an **office or facility** of a federal institution (except its head or central office).
- This ensures that **official language rights** (e.g., use of English and French in services, signage, communications) are maintained at the airport level.
- **Exception**:  
  Subsection 23(2) of the Official Languages Act — which imposes duties on institutions — **does not apply** to any institution other than the designated airport authority.  
  → This protects the receiving entity from being subject to broader official language obligations beyond those relevant to its operations.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that language rights are preserved during the transfer without imposing undue obligations on the new entity or conflicting with its operational autonomy.

### **4. Public Service Pension and Retirement Benefits**

This section provides a **transition mechanism** for employees transferring from federal government to a private airport authority.

#### **Eligibility Criteria for Pension Continuity:**
A person qualifies for continued application of the **Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)** and the **Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act (SRBA)** if they meet **all** of the following:

1. They are a **designated employee** for the airport.
2. Immediately before the transfer date, they were a **contributor** under the PSSA.
3. On the transfer date, they **become an employee** of the designated airport authority.
4. The **President of the Treasury Board** has **not made a payment** under Section 40 of the PSSA (i.e., no pension payment has been made) for their pensionable service.
5. The person has **not received or opted to receive** any annuity or benefit under Sections 12 or 13 of the PSSA related to their service prior to the transfer.
6. The person **elects**, within **one year after the transfer date**, in a form and manner prescribed by the President of the Treasury Board, to have the PSSA and SRBA apply to them **in the manner and extent** provided by regulations.

#### **Irrevocability of Election**
- The election under paragraph (1)(e) is **irrevocable** — once made, it cannot be withdrawn.

#### **Regulatory Flexibility**
- The **Governor in Council** may make **regulations** to:
  - Define how and to what extent the PSSA and SRBA apply to those who make the election.
  - Adapt provisions of the Acts and regulations to suit the specific context.
  - Provide general guidance for implementation.

> **Note**: Regulations may be **retroactive** — meaning they can apply to periods before they were enacted — allowing for consistency in benefit treatment across time.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that employees are not left without pension coverage during the transition and to provide a fair and predictable path to retirement benefits.

### **5. Tax Exemption for Airport Business Income**

A **corporation** that is a **designated airport authority** during a taxation year may be **exempt from income tax** on income derived from its **airport business**, under the following conditions:

#### **Conditions for Tax Exemption:**
1. Throughout the year, the corporation was a **designated airport authority**.
2. **No part of the income or capital** of the corporation was or became available for the **personal benefit** of any member or shareholder.
3. **All or substantially all** of the gross revenue (excluding dividends from taxable Canadian corporations) was derived from **airport business activities**.

#### **Tax Year Definition**:
- If the corporation becomes a designated airport authority during the year → only the **portion of the year after designation** is eligible.
- If the corporation ceases to be a designated airport authority → only the **portion before cessation** is eligible.

> **Purpose**: To encourage investment in airport infrastructure by reducing tax burdens on legitimate airport operations, while preventing misuse (e.g., personal gain or unrelated business activity).

### **7. Enforcement of Airport Fees – Aircraft Seizure Powers**

This section grants **strong enforcement powers** to a designated airport authority over unpaid fees.

#### **(a) General Seizure Power (On Application to Court)**
- If any **landing fees, terminal fees, or other charges** (and interest) are unpaid, the authority may apply to the **superior court** of the province where the aircraft is located.
- The court may issue an order authorizing the **seizure and detention of the aircraft**.
- The order may be issued on terms considered necessary by the court.

#### **(b) Ex Parte Seizure Power (Preventive Measure)**

> **Note**: These powers are available **regardless of whether a judgment has been obtained**.

#### **(c) Release of Aircraft**
- Aircraft seized under either subsection **are not automatically released** unless:
  - The amount owed is paid, **or**
  - A **bond, surety, or other security** in a form acceptable to the authority is deposited with the authority.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that airport operators pay their fees and to prevent evasion of obligations through relocation or departure from Canada.

### **8. Exemptions from Seizure**

#### **(a) Exemption for Certain Aircraft**
- Any aircraft that would be **exempt from seizure under a writ of execution** issued by the superior court is **also exempt** under this Act.
- This preserves the legal protections of existing civil procedure rules.

#### **(b
