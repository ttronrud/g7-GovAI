**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–United States Enhanced Tax Information Exchange Agreement Implementation Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–United States Enhanced Tax Information Exchange Agreement Implementation Act* (the "Act") provides the legal framework in Canada for implementing the **Canada–United States Enhanced Tax Information Exchange Agreement** (the "Agreement"). This agreement is rooted in the broader goal of improving international tax compliance through the automatic exchange of financial account information between Canada and the United States, particularly in response to the **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)** of the United States.

The Act ensures that Canada recognizes and gives effect to the obligations and provisions of the Agreement, which enables automatic reporting of certain financial accounts held by Canadian and U.S. residents, while respecting legal, privacy, and compliance safeguards.

### **2. Precedence of Provisions**

## **Background and Policy Rationale (Whereas Clauses)**

The Agreement was developed based on several key motivations:

1. **Mutual Tax Compliance**: Canada and the U.S. share a long-standing relationship on tax cooperation and seek to enhance compliance through improved information exchange.

2. **FATCA Implementation**: The U.S. enacted **FATCA** to require foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report information about financial accounts held by U.S. persons (including Canadians). This led to concerns that Canadian financial institutions might be unable to comply due to **domestic legal barriers**.

3. **Reciprocity**: Both governments support applying FATCA’s underlying policy—improving tax compliance—on a **reciprocal basis**, meaning Canada will implement similar reporting obligations for U.S. financial institutions.

4. **Avoiding Duplication**: The U.S. recognizes the need to **coordinate reporting obligations** under FATCA with other U.S. tax reporting requirements to prevent **duplicative reporting** by Canadian institutions.

5. **Practical Compliance**: An **intergovernmental approach** (rather than requiring individual institutions to comply with complex U.S. rules) facilitates compliance and protects Canadians’ rights to access financial services without undue burden.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: The Parties commit to working together to establish **common reporting and due diligence standards** for financial institutions globally.
