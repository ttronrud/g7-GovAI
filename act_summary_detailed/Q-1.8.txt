**Detailed Summary of the *Queen Elizabeth II Canadian Research Fund Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Queen Elizabeth II Canadian Research Fund Act* is a Canadian legislative act passed by the Parliament of Canada to establish a dedicated fund in honor of Queen Elizabeth II’s visit to Canada and her personal interest in the health and well-being of children. The Act creates a research fund specifically aimed at advancing scientific understanding, prevention, and treatment of diseases affecting children.

This legislation reflects both a symbolic gesture of royal patronage and a practical commitment to improving pediatric healthcare through scientific research.

---

### **Background and Purpose**
The Act was introduced in response to a suggestion made by the Queen, who expressed her interest in supporting efforts to understand and combat childhood diseases. The primary motivation behind the Act is to:
- Recognize the Queen’s personal concern for children’s health.
- Promote research into the **causes, prevention, and treatment of diseases affecting children**.
- Encourage public contributions (gifts, bequests, donations) to support this cause.

The fund is not intended to provide direct medical care or treatment but rather to **advance medical research** with the long-term goal of preventing and curing childhood illnesses.

### **Key Provisions and Structure**

#### 1. **Name and Legal Status**
- The fund is officially named:  
  **The Queen Elizabeth II Canadian Fund to Aid in Research on the Diseases of Children** (commonly referred to as "the Fund").
- It is established as a **distinct legal entity** under the authority of the Medical Research Council (MRC).

#### 2. **Definition of the Fund**
- The Fund consists of:
  - All money, securities, and other property received by the **Medical Research Council (Council)** for the purposes of the Fund.
  - All income generated from the Fund (e.g., interest, dividends).
  - All gifts, bequests, appropriations, and contributions made to the Fund.

#### 3. **Purpose of the Fund**
The Fund is explicitly authorized to:
- Support individuals or organizations in conducting or continuing **research into diseases of children**.
- Support research focused on:
  - The **causes** of childhood diseases.
  - Their **prevention**.
  - Their **treatment** and **cure**.

This broad scope allows flexibility in funding diverse areas of pediatric health research.

#### 4. **Initial Financial Appropriation**
- A one-million-dollar sum is **appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada.
- This initial funding serves as seed capital to launch and sustain early research initiatives.
- [Note: This provision was later repealed in 1995 (c. 29, s. 71), indicating that the original funding may have been temporary or replaced by other mechanisms.]

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The appropriation of $1 million was **repealed in 1995**, meaning the original statutory funding was no longer legally active. The Fund now relies on **voluntary contributions**, donations, and ongoing fundraising rather than a fixed government appropriation.

#### 5. **Management and Administration**
- The **Medical Research Council (MRC)** is responsible for managing and administering the Fund.
- The Council must act in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Act.
- It has broad discretion to:
  - Make payments from the Fund for research purposes.
  - Invest fund assets in **Government of Canada bonds or other securities**.
  - Sell any such securities as needed.
  - Appoint advisory or administrative committees (from among its members or otherwise) to assist in governance.

#### 6. **Property Rights**
- The Council may:
  - Acquire real or personal property (through purchase, lease, gift, bequest, etc.).
  - Own, hold, sell, manage, or otherwise deal with such property.
- This provision allows the Council to use property to support research activities, such as maintaining research facilities or laboratories.

#### 7. **Bylaws and Governance**
- The Council may adopt **bylaws** to regulate its internal operations and procedures.
- These bylaws must be consistent with the objectives and provisions of the Act and are essential for ensuring accountability and effective management.

#### 8. **Gifts and Bequests**
- Any gift or bequest made to the Fund or to the Council **for the purposes of the Fund** is deemed to be a gift to **Her Majesty the Queen**.
- This provision serves a constitutional and ceremonial function, reinforcing the royal connection to the fund and aligning with the tradition of royal patronage in Canadian public institutions.

> ⚠️ This provision was also **repealed in 1995 (c. 29, s. 72)**, removing the formal link between donations and direct gifts to the Queen.

---

### **Historical and Political Context**
- The Act was passed in the **late 1980s or early 1990s**, during Queen Elizabeth II’s visits to Canada.
- It reflects a common practice in Commonwealth realms where monarchs are honored through public service initiatives, especially in areas of public health and social welfare.
- The inclusion of a **specific focus on children’s diseases** highlights the Queen’s personal interest in pediatric health, which was widely reported in the media at the time.

---

### **Repeal and Current Status**
- The Act was **repealed in 1995** under **Section 71 of the Statutes of Canada (c. 29)**, which removed the original appropriation of $1 million and the provision that deemed donations as gifts to the Queen.
- This suggests that:
  - The original funding mechanism was not sustainable or was superseded by other funding sources.
  - The symbolic and ceremonial aspects of the Act were preserved, but the legal framework was streamlined or replaced.
- While the **name and intent** of the fund may still be used in public or charitable contexts, the **legal standing and financial provisions** of the Act are no longer active.

### **Legacy and Impact**
Although the Act is no longer in force, its legacy includes:
- A lasting symbolic gesture of royal support for pediatric research in Canada.
- A model for how national institutions can align with royal patronage to promote public health initiatives.
- Inspiration for future legislation or funding mechanisms focused on children’s health.

Today, pediatric research in Canada is supported through various government agencies (e.g., Canadian Institutes of Health Research – CIHR), private foundations, and international collaborations—many of which may have inherited or built upon the original vision of the Queen Elizabeth II Canadian Research Fund.

### **Conclusion**
The *Queen Elizabeth II Canadian Research Fund Act* was a significant piece of legislation that:
- Established a formal, legally recognized fund to support pediatric disease research.
- Demonstrated the role of the monarchy in advancing public health policy.
- Created a framework for managing research funding through the Medical Research Council.

However, due to the **repeal in 1995**, the Act no longer provides active financial or administrative support. Its **historical and symbolic value** remains, and it stands as a notable example of how national policy can reflect both public concern and royal patronage in the realm of medical science.

📌 **In short**:  
This Act created a fund to support childhood disease research, named in honor of Queen Elizabeth II. While it was initially intended to provide financial and administrative support, it was repealed in 1995 and is no longer in force. The fund’s legacy lives on in the ongoing commitment to pediatric health research in Canada.
