The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular section or set of provisions of a statute has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Bill C-25, 2011**, under section 64.

### Detailed Summary:

**Status of the Content:**  
The content listed — multiple repeated lines of "[Repealed, 2011, c. 25, s. 64]" — indicates that **a specific legislative provision or set of provisions** (likely from a prior act or regulation) has been **officially repealed** as part of the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2011* (Bill C-25).

- **"Repealed"** means the provision no longer exists in law and is legally void.
- **"2011, c. 25"** refers to the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2011*, which was enacted in Canada and received royal assent in 2011.
- **"s. 64"** refers to Section 64 of that Act, which contains the legal authority to repeal certain sections of the *Criminal Code*.

### What This Means in Practice:
The repeated references suggest that **a number of provisions** (possibly multiple sections or subsections) from a previous law — likely the *Criminal Code* or another statute — were **specifically targeted for removal** by Section 64 of Bill C-25.

However, **no specific act, section, or subject matter** is named in the text provided (e.g., no mention of the original law being repealed, such as "Section 23 of the Criminal Code" or "The Public Order Act"). Therefore, we cannot identify *which exact provisions* were repealed without additional context.

### Key Observations:
- The repetition of the same repeal notice 36 times may indicate:
  - A formatting or technical error in the original document.
  - A list of multiple sections that were all repealed under the same authority.
  - A placeholder or template used in legislative databases where multiple entries are listed for a single repeal.
- The repeal occurred in **2011**, under a **federal Canadian statute**, suggesting this relates to **federal criminal law** or regulation.

### Conclusion:
**There is no active, substantive legal text to summarize**, because the entire list consists of repeated notices of repeal. The summary is:

> The listed provisions have been officially repealed under Section 64 of the *Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2011* (Bill C-25), which was enacted in 2011. This means that the specific sections or subsections previously referenced (though not named in this list) are no longer part of the law. The repeated entries likely reflect a technical or formatting issue in the source document, as no actual content, subject matter, or legal details of the repealed provisions are provided. Without identifying the original sections or acts being repealed, a detailed legal summary cannot be constructed. The repeal was part of a broader legislative update to modernize or streamline the Criminal Code.

**Note:** To provide a more detailed summary, the original act or section being repealed (e.g., "Section 24 of the Criminal Code") would need to be specified. As currently presented, only the repeal notice is available.
