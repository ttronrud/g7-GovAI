**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act* (the "Act") establishes the **Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board (CTAISB)**, an independent, non-punitive body tasked with enhancing transportation safety across Canada. The Act provides the legal framework for the Board’s mandate, structure, powers, duties, and operational procedures in relation to aviation, marine, railway, and pipeline transportation occurrences.

The Board operates independently of government departments and is empowered to conduct investigations into transportation accidents and incidents, identify safety deficiencies, and make public recommendations to prevent future harm. It does **not assign fault or liability**, but instead focuses on root causes and contributing factors to promote systemic safety improvements.
