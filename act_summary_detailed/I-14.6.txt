**Detailed Summary of the *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* is a Canadian law designed to protect the intellectual property rights of creators of **integrated circuit topographies**—specifically, the design of the layout of elements and interconnections in semiconductor chips. This Act establishes a legal framework for the **registration, protection, use, and enforcement** of such designs, providing exclusive rights to creators or owners, while balancing public interest, innovation, and international obligations.

It is modeled on international standards, particularly those under the **Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)**, and aligns with global practices in protecting technological designs in the electronics industry.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

1. **Integrated Circuit Product**  
   A product (final or intermediate form) intended to perform electronic functions, where at least one active element and some or all interconnections are integrally formed in or on a material (e.g., silicon wafer). This includes chips used in devices like smartphones, computers, and automotive systems.

2. **Topography**  
   The design of:
   - The interconnections and elements used to make an integrated circuit product; or  
   - The elements and interconnections for a customization layer added to an existing circuit in an intermediate form.  
   It does *not* include ideas, processes, systems, or concepts—only the physical layout.

3. **Commercially Exploit**  
   Includes selling, leasing, offering for sale or lease, distributing, or otherwise using the topography or a product incorporating it for commercial purposes.

4. **Filing Date**  
   The date the application is formally received by the Registrar, as determined under section 17. If all required information and fees are not submitted initially, the Registrar may assign a filing date under prescribed conditions.

5. **Registered Topography**  
   A topography that has been officially registered under this Act.

6. **Minister & Registrar**  
   - **Minister of Industry** is responsible for policy and certification of countries offering topography protection.  
   - **Registrar of Topographies** (designated under section 25) maintains the official register of registered topographies.

7. **National**  
   Includes citizens or residents of a country, or individuals domiciled there.

8. **Prescribed**  
   Means as defined in regulations made under this Act.

## **Core Principles and Provisions**

### **1. Ownership and Creation of Topographies**

- **Creator Ownership**:  
  The person who creates a topography (in the course of employment or under a contract) is deemed the creator unless otherwise agreed.  
  - If created during employment, the **employer** is considered the creator.  
  - If created under a contract, the **contracting party** is considered the creator.

- **First Commercial Exploitation**  
  A topography is considered "first commercially exploited" when, for the first time anywhere in the world, the topography or a substantial part of it, or an integrated circuit product incorporating it, is commercially exploited by or with the consent of the owner.

> *Note: This establishes a global threshold for protection, not just domestic use.*

---

### **2. Registrability of a Topography**

A topography may be registered **only if** all of the following conditions are met:

#### **(a) Originality**
- The topography must not be a mere reproduction of another topography or substantial part thereof.
- It must result from an intellectual effort and not be commonplace among designers or manufacturers.

> *Exception*: Even if elements are common, the **overall combination** may still be original if it demonstrates a non-obvious, inventive arrangement.

#### **(b) Applicant Eligibility**
The creator must be:
- A **Canadian national**, or  
- An individual or legal entity with a **real and effective establishment in Canada** for creating topographies or manufacturing ICs, or  
- A national of a country that:
  - Offers topography protection under a treaty or convention to which **Canada and that country are parties**, or  
  - Is certified by the Minister (via Canada Gazette notice) as offering protection **substantially equivalent** to Canada’s protection, or  
  - Is a **WTO Member**.

> *Note*: This ensures that protection is available to foreign creators whose home countries provide comparable rights.

#### **(c) Timely Filing**
- An application must be filed **before** the topography is first commercially exploited, or **within two years** after such exploitation.

> *Exception*: If the topography is **first commercially exploited in Canada**, it is registrable regardless of the above eligibility conditions.

---

### **3. Exclusive Rights in a Registered Topography**

Upon registration, the creator (or successor in title) gains an **exclusive right** to:
- Reproduce the topography or any substantial part thereof;  
- Manufacture an integrated circuit product incorporating the topography or a substantial part thereof;  
- Import or commercially exploit the topography or such products.

> **Important Limitation**:  
> These rights **do not extend to ideas, concepts, processes, systems, or information** embodied in the topography. Protection is limited to the *design layout*.

---

### **4. Duration of Protection**

- The exclusive right begins on the **filing date** of the application.
- It lasts for **ten calendar years** from the **earlier of**:
  - The calendar year in which the topography is first commercially exploited;  
  - The calendar year of the filing date.

> *Example*: If filed in 2023 and first exploited in 2025, protection ends at the end of 2033 (10 years from 2023).

> *Note*: This is a **limited-term** protection, unlike patents, and does not extend beyond 10 years.

### **5. Infringement and Exceptions**

Infringement occurs when someone performs any act under section 3(2) without the owner’s consent.

**Exceptions (non-infringement)**:
- **Analysis/evaluation/research or teaching**: For the sole purpose of studying topographies.
- **Derivative works**: Creating a new topography based on analysis of a registered one, provided it is original.
- **Post-sale use**: Using a particular IC product after it is sold (with consent at time of sale).
- **Private, non-commercial use**.
- **Temporary importation**: Of an IC product forming part of a vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or spacecraft temporarily entering Canada (e.g., for transit).
- **Independently created topographies**: No infringement if the topography is independently created.

> *This promotes innovation and research while protecting legitimate rights.*

---

### **6. Transferability and Licensing**

- A topography (registered or unregistered) is **transferable**—either fully or in part.
- It may serve as the subject of a **license**, allowing others to use the topography under agreed terms.

> *Note*: This supports commercial licensing and collaboration in the semiconductor industry.

---

### **7. Public Non-Commercial Use (Section 7.1 & 7.2)**

The **Commissioner of Patents** (Commissioner) may authorize **non-commercial use** of a registered topography by:
- The Government of Canada or a provincial government.

**Conditions**:
- Use must be **non-exclusive**.
- Scope and duration must be limited to the authorized purpose.
- Use should **primarily serve the domestic market**.
- The authorized user must pay **adequate remuneration** (determined by the Commissioner).
- The use can be **terminated** if the original justification no longer exists, with conditions to protect the user’s interests.

> *Non-transferable*: The authorization cannot be passed on to third parties.

> *Prescribed Conditions*: Any use must comply with regulations (e.g., security, reporting).

> *Appeal Rights*: Decisions under sections 7.1 and 7.2 are appealable to the **Federal Court** under the *Patent Act*.

---

### **8. Infringement Actions and Remedies**

- Any **court of competent jurisdiction** may hear an action for infringement by:
  - The owner of the registered topography, or  
  - A licensee (subject to any agreement between owner and licensee).

- **Each owner** must be a party to such actions.

**Remedies available**:
- Injunctions (to stop infringement)
- Royalties
- Recovery of damages or profits
- Punitive damages
- Disposal of infringing products or articles containing them

---

### **9. Limitations on Liability and Damages**

#### **(a) Good Faith Purchaser Defense**
- If a defendant **did not know** and had **no reasonable grounds to suspect** that an IC product was made or sold without consent, they are **not liable** for:
  - Royalties
  - Damages
  - Profits
  - Punitive damages  
  *For any dealings prior to gaining actual knowledge.*

- The defendant may **dispose of inventory** (sold before knowledge) but must pay a **reasonable royalty** as determined by the court.

#### **(b) No Damages for Infringement More Than 3 Years Ago**
- No royalties, damages, or punitive damages can be awarded for acts of infringement committed **more than three years before the lawsuit begins**.

> **Exception**:  
> If the infringement was **not reasonably discoverable** by a diligent owner, and the action is brought **within three years** of when it should have been discovered, the limitation period **does not apply**.

#### **(c) Reliance on Register Entries**
- If a person relied on
