**Detailed Summary of the *Avoiding Complicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Avoiding Complicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act* is a Canadian legislative measure designed to **prevent the Canadian government from becoming complicit in the torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (CIDT) of individuals by foreign entities**. The Act establishes a formal, transparent framework for federal departments, agencies, and officials to **avoid actions—such as disclosing, requesting, or using information—that could lead to or result in mistreatment of individuals abroad**.

It operates within the broader context of Canada’s commitment to **national security, the rule of law, human rights, and international obligations**, particularly those related to the prohibition of torture.

---

### **Key Background and Policy Rationale**

1. **National Security and Public Safety**  
   The Government of Canada has a fundamental duty to protect national security and the safety of Canadians. This responsibility requires the government to gather, share, and use intelligence and information—sometimes involving foreign entities.

2. **Need for Information Disclosure and Use**  
   While such information is necessary for national security, it must be handled responsibly to avoid contributing to human rights abuses.

3. **Rule of Law and Charter of Rights**  
   All government actions must comply with the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, ensuring that individual rights and freedoms are protected—even in sensitive security contexts.

4. **International Obligations**  
   Canada is a party to key international treaties that explicitly prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, including:
   - The **Geneva Conventions**
   - The **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**
   - The **Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)**

5. **Domestic Legal Prohibitions**  
   The *Criminal Code* criminalizes:
   - Torture
   - Aiding, abetting, counselling, conspiring to, attempting, or being an accessory after the fact to torture

6. **Moral and Value-Based Stance**  
   The Government of Canada explicitly opposes torture and CIDT, viewing such acts as contrary to Canadian values and principles of justice and human dignity.

### **Main Provisions and Key Features**

#### **1. Definitions**

The Act establishes clear definitions of key terms:

- **Appropriate Minister**:  
  The minister responsible for a specific department, division, or corporation. For example:
  - For departments (e.g., Department of Foreign Affairs), the Minister presiding over that department.
  - For Crown corporations, the minister designated by the Governor in Council.
  - For the Canadian Forces, the Minister of National Defence.

- **Deputy Head**:  
  The senior official responsible for day-to-day operations in a federal agency. Examples include:
  - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
  - Chief of the Defence Staff
  - Director of CSIS
  - Commissioner of RCMP
  - President of CBSA
  - Chief of CSE  
  *Note: For other entities, the Governor in Council may designate a deputy head.*

- **Mistreatment**:  
  Defined strictly as **torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment**, as defined under the **CAT (Convention Against Torture)**.

> ⚠️ *This definition is legally binding and aligns with international human rights standards.*

#### **2. The Core Mechanism: Directions from the Governor in Council**

The central mechanism of the Act is the power of the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) to issue **written directions** to deputy heads of key federal agencies.

These directions are issued **on the recommendation of the appropriate Minister** and apply to the following activities:

- **Disclosure of information** to any foreign entity that would result in a **substantial risk of mistreatment** of an individual.
- **Making requests** to any foreign entity for information that would result in a **substantial risk of mistreatment**.
- **Use of information** that was obtained through the **mistreatment of an individual** by a foreign entity.

> 🔍 *The key trigger is a "substantial risk" of mistreatment — not mere possibility — which ensures that actions are only taken when there is a clear and serious threat.*

---

#### **3. Mandatory Application to Specific Deputy Heads**

The Governor in Council **must** issue directions to the following deputy heads:

| Agency | Deputy Head |
|--------|-------------|
| Canadian Forces | Chief of the Defence Staff |
| Department of National Defence | Deputy Minister of National Defence |
| Department of Foreign Affairs | Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs |
| Royal Canadian Mounted Police | Commissioner |
| Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) | Director |
| Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) | President |
| Communications Security Establishment (CSE) | Chief |

> ✅ These are the only deputy heads to whom directions are automatically required under the Act.

---

#### **4. Status of Directions**

- Directions are **not statutory instruments** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.  
  → This means they do **not require parliamentary approval** or public notice under the normal SI process.  
  → They are treated as **direct executive orders** with immediate effect, reflecting their urgency and sensitivity.

---

#### **5. Transparency and Public Access**

Every deputy head receiving directions must:

- **Make the directions available to the public as soon as feasible**  
  → Ensures accountability and transparency in how the government avoids complicity in mistreatment.

- **Provide a copy to the following bodies**:
  1. **National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICP)**
  2. **National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA)**
  3. **Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP (if applicable)**

> This ensures **parliamentary oversight** and **independent review** of sensitive security decisions.

---

#### **6. Annual Reporting Requirement**

Every deputy head must submit an **annual report** to the **appropriate Minister** by **March 1** of each year, detailing:
- How the directions were implemented
- Any challenges or decisions made
- Actions taken to avoid complicity

---

#### **7. Public Disclosure of Reports (with Exceptions)**

After submitting the report, the deputy head must make a **public version** available — **but with important exclusions**:

> ❌ Information may **not** be disclosed if it would:
- Be injurious to **national security**, **national defence**, or **international relations**
- Compromise an **ongoing operation or investigation**
- Be protected by **solicitor-client privilege**, **professional secrecy** (advocates, notaries), or **litigation privilege**

> ✅ This balance ensures transparency while protecting legitimate security and legal interests.

---

#### **8. Reporting to Oversight Bodies**

After receiving the report, the **appropriate Minister** must provide a copy to:

- NSICP
- NSIRA
- **Public Complaints and Review Commission (PCRC)** *(replaced the previous reference to the RCMP Commission)*

> 🔁 **Note: A significant amendment in 2019 replaced the reference to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP with the Public Complaints and Review Commission (PCRC)**  
> → This reflects a broader shift toward **civilian oversight** of federal agencies and improves consistency in oversight mechanisms.

---

### **Key Amendments (as of 2019)**

- **Repeal of the "Review Body" provision** (Section 4)  
  → The original review body was removed in 2019 via *Bill C-13, s. 49.2*  
  → The Act now focuses on **direct oversight by the Minister and parliamentary bodies**, not a standalone review body.

- **Update of reporting recipients**  
  → The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP is replaced with the **Public Complaints and Review Commission (PCRC)**  
  → This strengthens the principle of **civilian accountability** and aligns with broader reforms in Canadian oversight.

---

### **Purpose and Impact**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prevent Complicity** | Ensures that Canadian government actors do not inadvertently assist or enable mistreatment abroad. |
| **Promote Accountability** | Mandates transparency through public access to directions and annual reports. |
| **Ensure Legal and Ethical Compliance** | Aligns with both domestic law (Criminal Code, Charter) and international obligations (CAT, Geneva Conventions). |
| **Strengthen Oversight** | Empowers parliamentary committees and independent review agencies to monitor compliance. |
| **Protect Canadian Values** | Reinforces Canada’s commitment to human rights and the rule of law in all international engagements. |

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No automatic prohibition of all foreign information sharing**  
  → The Act only applies when there is a **substantial risk** of mistreatment. Routine intelligence sharing is not restricted.

- **Does not prevent all intelligence operations**  
  → It only applies to actions that could lead to mistreatment. It does not ban intelligence gathering or foreign collaboration.

- **Relies on risk assessment**  
  → The determination of "substantial risk" depends on judgment and assessment by the appropriate Minister and Governor in Council.

- **Security and privacy concerns**  
  → Exemptions for national security and litigation privilege ensure that sensitive operations are not exposed.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Avoiding Complicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act* is a **principled, legally grounded, and operationally focused piece of legislation** that:

- Embeds **human rights protections** into national security decision-making  
- Balances the need for
