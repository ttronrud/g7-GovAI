**Detailed Summary of the *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act* (FAFOA) is a Canadian legislative measure designed to protect the integrity of international relations by enabling the temporary freezing of assets held by individuals who are *politically exposed foreign persons* (PEFPs) — particularly those suspected of misappropriating state property or engaging in corrupt conduct — in circumstances of political instability or internal turmoil in their home countries. The Act empowers the Government of Canada to restrict financial activities related to such individuals’ property, both within and outside Canada, as a tool to deter corruption and safeguard diplomatic interests.

It operates under a strict framework of due process, transparency, and accountability, ensuring that measures are not applied arbitrarily and that affected individuals have meaningful avenues to challenge or appeal the restrictions.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Definitions and Scope**

The Act establishes key definitions that shape its application:

- **Canadian**: A citizen under the Citizenship Act or a corporation incorporated in Canada or a province.
- **Entity**: Includes corporations, trusts, partnerships, funds, unincorporated associations, or foreign states.
- **Foreign State**: Any country other than Canada, including its political subdivisions, government bodies, departments, agencies, and their equivalents.
- **Minister**: Refers specifically to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
- **Person**: An individual or an entity.
- **Politically Exposed Foreign Person (PEFP)**: A person who holds or has held one of the following positions in or on behalf of a foreign state:
  - Head of state or head of government
  - Member of the executive council or legislature
  - Deputy minister or equivalent rank
  - Ambassador, attaché, or counsellor
  - Military officer at general rank or above
  - President of a state-owned company or bank
  - Head of a government agency
  - Judge
  - Leader or president of a political party represented in a legislature
  - Any office prescribed by regulation

> *Note:* The term also includes **any person closely associated** with such a person, including family members.

- **Prescribed**: Means as defined by regulation (only applies in English).
- **Property**: Includes real, personal, movable, or immovable property, whether owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the person.

> **Important**: The Act treats property as being "controlled" even if not formally owned — this broadens the scope of what can be frozen.

---

### **2. Trigger for Freezing Assets**

An order to freeze property can be initiated **only if**:

1. A **foreign state in writing** asserts to Canada that:
   - A person has **misappropriated property** of the foreign state, or
   - Acquired property **inappropriately** due to their office or personal/business relationship.

2. The Government of Canada receives this assertion.

3. The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal cabinet) determines that:
   - The person is a **PEFP**;
   - There is **internal turmoil or uncertain political situation** in the foreign state;
   - The freezing of assets is in the **interest of international relations**.

> This ensures that the measure is not used as a tool of political retaliation or without justification.

---

### **3. Types of Restrictions Imposed**

If the Governor in Council approves the order, they may:

#### (a) Restrict or Prohibit the Following Activities:
- **Dealing** (buying, selling, transferring) in any property — directly or indirectly — by any person in Canada or abroad, whether the property is located in Canada or elsewhere.
- **Entering into or facilitating** financial transactions related to the above dealings.
- **Providing financial services or related services** (e.g., banking, investment advice) for the PEFP’s property.

> These restrictions apply globally — even if the transaction occurs outside Canada.

#### (b) Seize, Freeze, or Sequestrate Property
- The Governor in Council may **order the seizure or freezing** of the person’s property located in Canada.
- The order specifies how and when the property is to be frozen.

> This is a powerful enforcement mechanism that can halt financial flows and access to assets.

#### (c) Exclusion Clauses
- Orders or regulations may **exclude specific persons, properties, or transactions** from the scope of the restriction — allowing flexibility for legitimate or essential activities.

---

### **4. Permits for Compliance**

To ensure that legitimate financial needs are not unduly disrupted:

- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs** may issue a **permit** to individuals or entities allowing them to carry out restricted activities.
- Permits may be subject to **conditions** deemed appropriate by the Minister (e.g., reporting requirements, limits on transactions).
- The Minister may **amend, suspend, revoke, or reinstate** permits at their discretion.

> This provides a balance between enforcement and practicality.

---

### **5. Duration and Review of Orders**

- All orders or regulations under Section 4 **automatically expire after five years** from their coming into force.
- The Governor in Council may **extend** the order for a specified period (multiple times possible).
- Extensions require formal justification and must be based on continuing grounds (e.g., ongoing political instability).

> This prevents indefinite or permanent asset freezes and promotes accountability.

---

### **6. Transparency and Parliamentary Oversight**

- A **copy of every order or regulation** must be **tabled in both Houses of Parliament** within **15 days** of issuance.
- If a House is not sitting, the copy may be sent to the **Clerk of the House**.

> This ensures legislative transparency and public accountability.

---

### **7. Obligations of Specific Financial Institutions**

Certain financial institutions and entities must **continuously monitor** their operations for property that may belong to a PEFP under an active order or regulation. These include:

- **Authorized foreign banks** (as defined in the *Bank Act*)
- **Cooperative credit societies, savings and credit unions, caisses populaires**
- **Foreign companies** (under the *Insurance Companies Act*) in relation to their insurance business
- **Insurance companies, provincial companies, and societies**
- **Fraternal benefit societies** (regulated provincially) in relation to insurance activities
- **Trust and loan companies**
- **Loan companies**
- **Entities involved in opening client accounts** under the *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act*
- **Securities dealers, portfolio managers, investment advisers** authorized under provincial law
- **Other entities of a prescribed class**

> These institutions are legally required to **identify and report** any property they believe may belong to a PEFP subject to a freeze.

---

### **8. Disclosure Obligations**

Every person in Canada and every Canadian resident abroad must:

- **Disclose without delay** to the **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**:
  - The existence of property they believe may belong to a PEFP under an order or regulation
  - Any transaction or proposed transaction involving such property

> This creates a broad reporting obligation to help detect and prevent illicit financial flows.

> **No criminal or civil liability** arises for disclosures made in **good faith**.

---

### **9. Penalties for Violations**

Violations of the Act are treated as **offences** with both **indictable** and **summary conviction** penalties:

#### (a) Violation of Section 4 (Restrictions on Activities)
- **Indictable offence**: Up to **5 years imprisonment**
- **Summary conviction offence**: Fine up to **$25,000**, or **1 year imprisonment**, or both

#### (b) Violation of Sections 8 or 9 (Disclosure or Reporting Obligations)
- Same penalties as above

> These penalties apply to both **Canadian citizens** and **non-residents**.

---

### **10. Jurisdiction and Legal Proceedings**

- Proceedings for offences under this Act may be:
  - Tried in the **court with jurisdiction** at the place where the offence was committed
  - Or at the place where the accused **resides, works, or has an office** at the time of proceedings

> **Key provision**: If a Canadian commits an offence **outside Canada**, proceedings may be **commenced in any territorial division of Canada**, and the accused may be **tried and punished** as if the offence occurred within Canada.

> This enhances Canada’s ability to enforce its laws internationally.

> **Additional**: The *Criminal Code* requirements for an accused to appear and be present during proceedings **apply** to such cases.

> **Proceedings may only begin with the consent of the Attorney General of Canada** — ensuring that the government retains control over initiating legal action.

### **11. Review and Appeal Mechanisms**

#### (a) Application to Cease Being a PEFP
- A person subject to an order may apply in writing to the **Minister** to have the order **repealed or amended** on the grounds that they are **not a PEFP**.
- If the Minister has **reasonable grounds** to believe the person is not a PEFP, they must **recommend to the Governor in Council** that the order be changed or lifted.
- The applicant must be **notified promptly** of any rejection.

#### (b) Application for Certificate of Non-PEFP Status
- A person may apply for a **certificate** stating they are **not a PEFP**.
- If the Minister determines this is true, they issue the certificate **as soon as feasible**.

> These mechanisms ensure due process and prevent arbitrary application of the law.

#### (c) Application for Property Exemption
- A person may apply
