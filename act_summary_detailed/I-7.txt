**Detailed Summary of the Indian Oil and Gas Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Indian Oil and Gas Act* is a federal law in Canada that establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas on **First Nation lands**. It balances the economic interests of the Canadian government with the rights, interests, and self-determination of Indigenous peoples, particularly First Nations. The Act governs how oil and gas rights are granted, managed, and shared, ensuring that First Nations receive a **royalty in trust** for their lands and that environmental, cultural, and community concerns are respected.

It applies to all oil and gas activities (exploration and exploitation) on designated **First Nation lands**, including reserves and specific land transfers under agreements, and supersedes or modifies existing provincial and federal laws where necessary.
