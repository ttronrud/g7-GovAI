**Detailed Summary of the *Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act* (the "Act") is a Canadian legislative instrument designed to **protect homeowners and stabilize the housing finance system** by ensuring that mortgage or hypothecary insurance policies — particularly those issued by approved insurers — remain viable even in the event of financial distress or insolvency of the insurer. The Act establishes a framework for **government-backed protection** of policyholders and lenders in cases where an insurer fails, thereby supporting market confidence and financial system stability.

The core objective is to **mitigate systemic risks** arising from the failure of mortgage insurers, especially during economic downturns or financial crises, while maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the housing market.

>     `(Total amounts payable to beneficiary before winding-up)`  
>     − `(Amounts already received by beneficiary)`  
>     + `(10% of original principal amount of first eligible mortgage loan)`  

> If the insured event **did not occur** before the winding-up:
> - The Minister may choose to:
>   1. **Pay an approved mortgage insurer or the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** to allow it to enter into a new policy (replacing the original one), **with the policyholder’s consent**; or  
>   2. **Satisfy future claims** that may arise from the occurrence of the insured event.

> Note:  
> - If the Minister makes a payment under (1), **no further payment** is required under this section.
