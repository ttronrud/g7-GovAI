This authority includes all matters within the jurisdiction of Parliament that are **not assigned to another department, board, or agency** of the Government of Canada.

### **8. Implementation of International Agreements (Repealed)**
- The Act originally included provisions allowing the Governor in Council to make regulations to implement **Article 708 of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA)**.
- These regulations could **exempt certain goods, animals, or persons** imported from the United States from specific provisions of Canadian laws or regulations, subject to conditions deemed appropriate by the Governor in Council.
- **Status:** This section was **repealed in 1994 (c. 38, s. 7)**, reflecting the evolution of trade policy and the integration of such provisions into other legislation.

---

### **9. Transfer of Powers from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Forestry**
- A key transitional provision ensures that **any power, duty, or function previously vested in the Minister of Agriculture, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, or officers of the Department of Agriculture** related to **forestry or forest resources** is automatically transferred to the **Minister of Forestry**, the **Deputy Minister of Forestry**, or the **appropriate officer of the Department of Forestry**.
- This transfer occurs **unless** the Governor in Council, by order, designates a different Minister, Deputy Minister, or public service officer to exercise that function.
- This provision ensures **clear jurisdictional boundaries** between agriculture and forestry, preventing overlap or confusion in policy implementation.

---

### **10. Continuity of Employee Status**
- The Act provides **protection for existing employees** of the former Department of Agriculture.
- Employees who held positions in the Department of Agriculture **immediately before the Act came into force** will continue in those roles, but now under the **Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food**.
- Their position is to be held under the authority of the **Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**.
- The term *"employee"* is defined consistently with **subsection 2(1) of the Public Service Employment Act**, ensuring alignment with federal public service employment standards.

---

### **11. Continuity of Appropriations**
- Any **funds appropriated** in the fiscal year when the Act comes into force for the Department of Agriculture — that are **unexpended on the day the Act takes effect** — are **automatically deemed to be appropriated** for the **Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food**.
- This ensures **financial continuity** and avoids disruption in operations due to the reorganization.

---

  - any **officer of the Department of Agriculture**,  
  — it is **automatically transferred** to:
  - the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**,  
  - the **Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, or  
  - the **appropriate officer of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food**,  
  **unless** the Governor in Council, by order, designates a different Minister, Deputy Minister, or public service officer to exercise that function.

> This provision ensures **a seamless transition** of responsibilities and avoids legal gaps during the reorganization.

### **Historical Context and Repeals**
- The Act was originally enacted to modernize and expand the scope of Canada’s agricultural governance.
- The **1989 repeal** of the international trade provision (Article 708) reflects the shift toward more integrated trade policy under the **Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)** and the move away from specific regulatory exemptions.
- The **1994 repeal** of the CUSFTA implementation clause indicates that such regulatory powers were transferred to more specific trade and customs legislation.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Act* serves as a foundational piece of legislation that:
- Establishes a unified department for agricultural and agri-food governance,
- Transfers existing powers and responsibilities with legal certainty,
- Ensures operational and financial continuity during reorganization,
- And provides a clear framework for ministerial leadership and enforcement.

Although several provisions have since been repealed due to changes in trade policy and government structure, the core structure of the Act — particularly the creation of the Department, the appointment of key officials, and the transfer of functions — remains significant in shaping Canada’s agricultural policy framework.

> **Note:** This Act is largely historical in nature. The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food was later restructured and merged into the **Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food (now part of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada)**, which operates under the broader **Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food** as of today. The current framework is governed by the **Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Act** and related regulations.
