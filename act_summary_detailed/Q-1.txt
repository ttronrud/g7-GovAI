The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> **[Repealed, 2005, c. 20, s. 82]**

This indicates that **the specific legislation or section referenced has been formally repealed** (i.e., canceled or abolished) by **an act passed in 2005**, specifically **Chapter 20 of that year (c. 20)**, under **section 82 (s. 82)** of that act.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
Each line is a legal annotation indicating that a particular provision — likely a section of a statute — has been **repealed** (removed or invalidated). The repetition of the same annotation 24 times suggests that multiple provisions or subsections were affected, or that the reference appears in a list or index where multiple entries point to the same repeal.

#### 2. **Repeal Details**
- **Year**: 2005  
- **Act**: Chapter 20 of the Statutes of the jurisdiction (likely Canada, given the format and context of such citations)  
- **Section**: Section 82 of that act  
- **Action**: Repeal — the provision(s) previously in force are no longer valid or in effect  

> Note: In Canadian legislative terminology, "c. 20" refers to a statute (e.g., *An Act to amend the [specific area of law]*), and "s. 82" refers to a specific section within that act.

#### 3. **Legal Implication**
- Any law, rule, or regulation previously governed by the section(s) in question is now **invalid** and **no longer enforceable**.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Modernize or streamline legislation
  - Remove outdated or redundant provisions
  - Correct errors or inconsistencies
  - Align with new legal frameworks or policy directions

#### 4. **Contextual Considerations**
- The fact that this repeal is cited **24 times** suggests that the original legislation (or a related document) contained **24 different provisions or subsections** that were all repealed by section 82 of the 2005 act.
- Without knowing the full name of the original act being repealed, it is difficult to determine the exact subject matter (e.g., whether it related to land use, taxation, health, or another area).
- The absence of the original section's content or title limits the depth of a substantive summary — only the **status** (repealed) and **legal citation** are provided.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
This summary does **not** describe a live or active law, but rather a **record of legal change**. The original provisions referenced in this list have been **officially removed from the statute book** and are no longer in force.

### Final Summary (Concise):

> The repeated annotations "[Repealed, 2005, c. 20, s. 82]" indicate that multiple provisions of a prior statute were formally repealed by **Section 82 of the Act No. 20 of 2005**. These provisions are no longer legally valid. The repeal was likely part of a legislative update to remove outdated, redundant, or obsolete laws. Without the original act or section titles, the specific subject matter remains unknown, but the legal status of the referenced provisions is now **inactive and void**.
