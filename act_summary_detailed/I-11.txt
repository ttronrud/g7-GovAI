**Detailed Summary of the Inquiries Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Inquiries Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that empowers the federal government to conduct formal inquiries into matters related to the **good governance of Canada** and the **conduct of public officials**. The Act provides a flexible, comprehensive framework for investigations into public administration, accountability, and administrative misconduct, with broad powers granted to commissioners and their deputies. It ensures that such inquiries are thorough, legally enforceable, and conducted with due process and transparency.

---

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**
- The Act may be cited as the *Inquiries Act*.
- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) may, at its discretion, initiate an inquiry into:
  - Matters connected with the **good government of Canada**, or
  - The **conduct of any part of public business** in Canada.

> This broad scope allows the government to investigate issues ranging from policy failures and corruption to administrative inefficiencies and systemic misconduct.

---

### **2. Appointment of Commissioners (Section 2)**
- If no special law governs a particular inquiry, the Governor in Council may appoint a **commission of persons** (called "commissioners") to conduct the inquiry.
- These commissioners are given **full investigative authority**, including:
  - Summoning witnesses,
  - Requiring them to give evidence (orally or in writing),
  - Requiring witnesses to take oaths or solemn affirmations (as permitted under civil law),
  - Requiring the production of documents and physical evidence.

> This provision ensures that inquiries can be carried out independently and with the necessary authority when no specific legislation exists.

---

### **3. Powers of Commissioners (Section 3–4)**
Commissioners have **powers equivalent to those of a court of record in civil matters**, including:
- The ability to **enforce attendance** of witnesses,
- To **compel testimony**,
- To **require production of records or documents**.

These powers are designed to ensure that investigations are not hindered by resistance from individuals or institutions.

---

### **4. Departmental Inquiries (Section 6)**
- Any **federal minister** may, under the authority of the Governor in Council, appoint a commissioner to investigate:
  - The **state and management** of a department’s operations (both internal and external services),
  - The **conduct of public officials** in their official duties.

> This allows for **department-specific oversight**, enabling targeted reviews of performance, accountability, and compliance within individual government departments.

#### **Powers of Departmental Commissioners (Section 6):**
- May enter and remain in any **public office or institution**,
- Examine all **records, documents, books, vouchers, and papers**,
- Summon witnesses and require them to testify under oath or affirmation,
- Administer oaths or affirmations.

> These powers ensure that internal operations are transparent and accessible to investigators.

---

### **5. Subpoenas and Enforcement Mechanisms (Section 7)**
Commissioners may issue **subpoenas or requests** to:
- Require individuals to **appear at a specified time and place**,
- Testify about matters within their knowledge,
- Produce any documents or records in their possession or control.

#### **Key Features:**
- A subpoena may summon a person **from any part of Canada**.
- **Reasonable travel expenses** are to be paid to those summoned.
- In lieu of requiring personal attendance, commissioners may issue a **commission to an officer or person**, authorizing them to:
  - Take evidence,
  - Report findings directly to the commissioners.

> This flexibility allows for efficient gathering of evidence without requiring witnesses to travel or appear in person.

---

### **6. Penalties for Non-Compliance (Section 8)**
Any person who:
- Fails to attend when summoned (without valid excuse),
- Fails to produce documents required,
- Refuses to take an oath or affirmation,
- Refuses to answer proper questions,

> Is liable to a **summary conviction** before:
- A **provincial court judge**, or
- A **superior or county court judge** (who also qualifies as a justice of the peace) in the jurisdiction where the person resides or where the inquiry takes place.

**Penalty:** A fine of up to **$400**.

> This provision ensures compliance with the investigative process and deters obstruction.

---

### **7. Engagement of Experts and Counsel (Section 9)**
Commissioners may:
- Engage **accountants, engineers, technical advisers, clerks, reporters, and assistants**,
- Hire **legal counsel** to assist in conducting the inquiry.

Additionally:
- Deputed experts (those hired under the commissioner’s direction) may:
  - Be authorized to conduct their own investigations,
  - Exercise **the same powers as commissioners** (e.g., issue subpoenas, take evidence),
  - Report findings directly to the commissioners.

> This enables complex or technical inquiries (e.g., financial audits, infrastructure failures) to be properly addressed by qualified professionals.

---

### **8. Right to Legal Representation (Section 10)**
- Any person whose conduct is under investigation, or against whom a charge of misconduct is made, has the **right to be represented by counsel**.
- This ensures due process and protects individuals from unfair or unbalanced proceedings.

> This is a critical safeguard against arbitrary or punitive investigations.

---

### **9. Notice and Opportunity to Respond (Section 11)**
- **No report can be made against any person** until:
  - The person has been **given reasonable notice** of the alleged misconduct,
  - The person has had **a full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel**.

> This requirement ensures fairness and prevents the use of investigations as tools of retaliation or arbitrary punishment.

---

### **10. International Commissions and Tribunals (Section 12)**
- The Governor in Council may confer on an **international commission or tribunal** all or any of the powers granted to domestic commissioners under Part I.
- Such international bodies may operate **within Canada**, but only subject to **limitations and restrictions** imposed by the Governor in Council.

> This provision supports international cooperation and allows for cross-border investigations (e.g., in cases involving foreign entities or international organizations).

---

### **11. Continuity of the Correctional Investigator (Section 13)**
- The **Correctional Investigator** (a key public oversight role) who held office **immediately before the coming into force of this Act** continues in office.
- The individual is **deemed to have been appointed under Part III** of the Act for a **one-year term**, beginning on the date the Act comes into force.

> This ensures continuity and stability in the oversight of the correctional system.

---

### **12. Transition of Staff from Correctional Investigator to Public Service Employment (Section 14)**
- Any person who was **engaged on a full-time basis** by the Correctional Investigator during a period **immediately before the Act came into force** is deemed to have been **appointed under the Public Service Employment Act** on the date of the Act’s coming into force.

> This ensures that staff members are properly integrated into the public service system with appropriate employment rights and protections.

#### **Probation Rules (Section 15):**
- **If the person served for at least one year**:  
  → **Not subject to probation** under the Public Service Employment Act.

- **If the person served for less than one year**:  
  → Subject to **probation for a period equal to one year minus the time served**.

> This rule balances the need for accountability with recognition of long-term service and institutional continuity.

## **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No automatic right to investigate** — The Governor in Council must determine that an inquiry is "expedient."
- **No right to appeal** — Findings and reports are final unless challenged through other legal avenues.
- **Limited scope of international commissions** — Powers are subject to restrictions imposed by the Governor in Council.
- **Penalty cap** — The maximum fine is relatively low ($400), which may limit deterrence in serious cases.

## **Conclusion**

The *Inquiries Act* serves as a **robust and adaptable tool** for ensuring accountability, transparency, and good governance in the Canadian federal public sector. It enables the government to investigate complex issues involving public administration, official conduct, and institutional performance, while safeguarding individual rights through due process and the right to legal representation.

Its provisions support both **internal oversight** (through departmental investigations) and **independent inquiries** (through commissions), and it ensures **smooth transitions** in key public roles like the Correctional Investigator.

By balancing **investigative power** with **legal protections**, the Act promotes a culture of accountability without compromising fairness or the rule of law.
