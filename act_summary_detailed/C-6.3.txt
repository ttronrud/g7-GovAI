### **5. Residency Rules – Determining Who Is a Resident**

Residency is critical in determining where income is taxed. The Convention provides a **multi-tiered hierarchy** to determine residency:

#### **For Individuals**
1. **Permanent Home**:  
   - Individual is a resident only of the country where a permanent home is available.
   - If available in both countries, the individual is deemed a resident of the country with **closer personal and economic ties** ("centre of vital interests").

2. **If Centre of Vital Interests Cannot Be Determined**:  
   - Resident is deemed to be a resident of the country where the individual has an **habitual abode**.

3. **If Habitual Abode Exists in Both or Neither Countries**:  
   - Resident is deemed to be a resident of the country of which the individual is a **national**.

4. **If Individual is a National of Both or Neither**:  
   - The **competent authorities** of Canada and Ireland must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

#### **For Non-Individual Entities (e.g., Companies)**
- If a company is a resident of both countries:
  - The competent authorities must **mutually agree** on which country it shall be considered a resident of.
  - Factors considered: place of effective management, place of incorporation, and other relevant factors.
- **In the absence of agreement**, the entity is **not entitled** to any tax relief or exemption under the Convention, except as may be agreed upon.

> This ensures that entities are not treated as residents of both countries without clear, agreed-upon status.

### **6. Permanent Establishment (PE)**

A **permanent establishment (PE)** is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on business.

#### **Examples of PE Include**:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office

- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other natural resource extraction site

#### **Exclusions (Not a PE)**:

- Stock maintained solely for **processing by another enterprise**.
- Fixed place used only for **purchasing goods or collecting information**.

> **Exception**: A fixed place is **not** a PE if its overall activity is preparatory or auxiliary.

#### **Special Rule for Agents**
- A person (not an independent agent) acting on behalf of an enterprise and having **authority to conclude contracts** in a Contracting State is deemed to have a PE in that State **for activities undertaken**.
- **Exception**: If the activities are limited to those excluded above (e.g., purchasing, information collection), no PE is created.
- **No PE** is created simply because a company uses a **broker, general commission agent, or independent agent** in the other country, **provided** such agents are acting in the ordinary course of business.

#### **No PE from Control or Ownership**
- Merely **controlling or being controlled** by a company in the other country, or carrying on business there, **does not** constitute a PE.

#### **General Rule**
- Profits of an enterprise are **taxable only in the State of residence** of the enterprise.
