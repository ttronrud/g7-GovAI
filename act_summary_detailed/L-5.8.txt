**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Lands Surveyors Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Lands Surveyors Act* is a legislative framework that establishes the regulatory structure, standards, and governance mechanisms for **Canada Lands Surveyors**—professionals responsible for surveying land, boundaries, and spatial data in Canada. The Act provides for the regulation of these surveyors through a professional association, sets out standards of conduct and qualifications, and creates a formal process for handling complaints and disciplinary actions. It also defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, including the Association of Canada Lands Surveyors, the Minister of Natural Resources, and the Registrar.

This Act is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province**, meaning it applies throughout Canada with legal force.
