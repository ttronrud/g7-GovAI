**Detailed Summary of the *Fort Nelson Indian Reserve Minerals Revenue Sharing Act***  

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Fort Nelson Indian Reserve Minerals Revenue Sharing Act* (1980) is a federal law enacted by the Parliament of Canada to resolve a long-standing dispute over mineral rights and revenue sharing involving the **Fort Nelson Indian Band**, the **Province of British Columbia**, and the **federal government of Canada**. The Act establishes a formal, legally binding agreement between Canada and British Columbia that defines ownership, administration, and revenue-sharing arrangements for certain minerals beneath the Fort Nelson Indian Reserve.

This legislation was passed on **September 18, 1980** (as noted in the statutory instrument SI/80-172) and came into force on a date fixed by proclamation. It is specifically applicable only to the **Fort Nelson Indian Band** and does not extend to any other First Nations.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context of the Act**

The primary purpose of the Act is to settle a historical conflict over mineral rights beneath the Fort Nelson Indian Reserve, which originated from:

- **Treaty No. 8 (1899):** In which the Fort Nelson Band ceded certain rights to lands in British Columbia in exchange for specific benefits, including reserved lands for the Band.
- **British Columbia Order-in-Council No. 2995 (November 28, 1961):** Conveyed certain lands to Canada in *trust for the use and benefit of the Band*, but reserved all rights to minerals (including coal, petroleum, and natural gas) beneath those lands for the Province.

This reservation was challenged by the Band and Canada, who argued it violated earlier agreements (specifically the **McKenna-McBride Agreement of 1912**) and Treaty No. 8, which implied that Indigenous peoples retained rights to minerals beneath their traditional territories.

The Act resolves this conflict through a **mutually agreed-upon framework** that recognizes:

- Provincial ownership and control of **coal, petroleum, and natural gas** beneath the Reserve.
- **Equal revenue sharing** between Canada (on behalf of the Fort Nelson Band) and the Province.
- A **one-time payment** to Canada to settle all prior claims related to mineral development.

### **4. Application Scope**

### **5. Ownership, Administration, and Control of Minerals**

#### **Coal, Petroleum, and Natural Gas**
- **Ownership, administration, and control** of coal, petroleum, and natural gas beneath the Reserve are **vested in the Province of British Columbia**.
- All claims and rights to these minerals are subject to **BC law**, except as specified in the Agreement.
- The Province **collects all revenue** from the sale, lease, or licensing of these minerals (e.g., royalties, permits, drilling fees, rentals), **excluding surface revenue**.

#### **Revenue Sharing**
- **Equal sharing** of both **net profit** and **gross revenue** from the disposition of coal, petroleum, and natural gas is mandated.
- **Net profit and gross revenue** are defined as:
  - For **coal and petroleum**: Determined by mutual agreement between Canada and the Province. If no agreement is reached, **arbitration** under Clause 12 applies.
  - For **natural gas**: A specific calculation method is outlined (see below).

> **Note:** The revenue-sharing applies only to minerals **under the Reserve** — not to surface rights or surface development.

### **6. One-Time Payment to Canada (for the Band)**

To settle all historical claims and demands, the Province agrees to pay Canada a **one-time sum of $4,329,377.00** for the use and benefit of the Fort Nelson Band.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This payment is not interest on a loan; it is a **settlement of claims** arising from prior mineral development activities.

### **7. Revenue Calculation for Natural Gas**

The gross revenue from natural gas is calculated as follows:

- The Province calculates **gross revenue** from:
  - Dispositions of petroleum and natural gas interests (e.g., leases, drilling reservations, permits).
  - Fees for renewal or recording of such interests.
- This includes **all revenue from the sale or licensing of interests** in the Reserve, regardless of surface ownership.

> The **net profit** from natural gas is derived after subtracting costs of production and processing.

### **8. Timber, Lime, and Building Materials**

- Ownership and control of **timber, lime, peat, clay, limestone, marble, gypsum, gravel, sand, and agricultural surface materials** in or under the Reserve is **in Canada for the use and benefit of the Band**.
- The Province may still take timber and lime under existing laws:
  - **British Columbia Order-in-Council No. 1036 (1938)** and
  - **Dominion P.C. Order No. 208 (1930)**

> This ensures the Band retains benefits from natural resources while allowing provincial development under legal frameworks.

---

### **9. Arbitration Clause**

In the event of disagreement between Canada and the Province regarding the **net profit or gross revenue** from coal or petroleum, the matter shall be resolved by **arbitration** as outlined in **Clause 12** of the Agreement.

This provides a neutral, binding mechanism to ensure fair and consistent revenue sharing.
