**Detailed Summary of the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act* (Canada)**

---

### **1. Overview and Purpose**

The *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act* (the "Act") is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It establishes a robust regulatory framework to address the significant public health risks associated with tobacco and vaping product use—particularly among youth and non-users.

#### **Primary Objectives:**
- **Protect public health**, especially that of **young persons** (under 18 years of age), from the harms of tobacco and vaping.
- **Prevent inducements** to use these products through misleading advertising, branding, or lifestyle associations.
- **Restrict access** to tobacco and vaping products, particularly for minors.
- **Enhance public awareness** of the health risks associated with these products.
- **Ensure transparency** through mandatory disclosure of product information and emissions data.
- **Establish clear standards** for product safety, composition, and labeling.

This Act is grounded in **conclusive scientific evidence** linking tobacco and nicotine use to numerous debilitating and fatal diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, and addiction.
