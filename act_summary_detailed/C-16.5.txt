### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act**

The **Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act** (CFIA Act) is a foundational piece of federal legislation that establishes the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** as a centralized, independent body responsible for ensuring food, animal, and plant health safety and quality across Canada. The Act was enacted to improve regulatory efficiency, consumer protection, trade facilitation, and intergovernmental collaboration.

Below is a comprehensive, structured summary of the key components and provisions of the Act:

---

## **1. Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The Act is grounded in several core policy objectives:

- **Consolidation of Services**: To consolidate federal inspection and regulatory services related to food, animal, and plant health into a single, unified agency.
- **Consumer Protection**: To enhance food safety and quality standards through consistent, risk-based inspection systems.
- **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**: To deliver services in a cost-effective manner.
- **Promotion of Trade**: To support Canada’s international trade by ensuring compliance with international standards and facilitating smooth cross-border movement of food and agricultural products.
- **Inter-Governmental Collaboration**: To foster greater cooperation between federal departments and provincial/municipal governments.

These objectives are rooted in the "Whereas" clauses, which set out the rationale for establishing the CFIA.
