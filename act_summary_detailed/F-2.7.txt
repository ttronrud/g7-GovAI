**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Agricultural Loans Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**

The *Canadian Agricultural Loans Act* (the "Act") is a federal statute designed to **support agricultural development in Canada** by providing **financial protection and incentives for lenders** who extend loans to farmers and farm products marketing cooperatives for specific agricultural purposes. The core objective of the Act is to encourage investment in farming infrastructure and operations by ensuring that lenders are **compensated for losses** incurred when they extend eligible agricultural loans — thereby reducing the risk of lending to farmers, especially in capital-intensive areas like equipment purchase, land acquisition, and farm construction.

The Act establishes a **loss-sharing mechanism** where the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** (the "Minister") is liable to pay **up to 95%** of a lender’s losses resulting from qualifying agricultural loans, subject to strict conditions and limitations.

## **Conditions for Loss Compensation (Section 4(3))**

For a lender to be eligible for compensation, **all of the following conditions must be met**:

1. **Application Requirement**  
   - The loan must be made based on an application signed by the farmer or co-op in a form **established or approved by the Minister**.  
   - The application must clearly state the **purpose of the loan**.  
   - If the loan involves property, the application must specify any **interest or right** the farmer or co-op intends to hold in that property.

2. **Loan Amount Limits**  
   - **Aggregate limit**: The total amount of all loans under this Act to the same farmer (or co-op) **cannot exceed $500,000** (or a higher amount set by regulation).  
   - **Specific purpose limits**: For loans related to land, buildings, machinery, or livestock (paragraphs a–e and g.1–i), the limit is **$350,000** (or a regulated amount).  

3. **Repayment Terms**  
   - **For land or livestock purchases (paragraph g)**: Must be repaid in **no more than 15 years**.  
   - **For all other purposes**: Must be repaid in **no more than 10 years**.

4. **Fee and Interest Restrictions**  
   - **No fees or service charges** are allowed during the term of the loan **unless**:
     - A **prescribed fee** is charged.
     - A charge does not exceed the fee paid by lenders under paragraph 12(1)(b).
     - Interest does not exceed the **prescribed rate** or a rate determined by a prescribed formula.

5. **Security Requirements**  
   - The loan must be **secured in a prescribed manner** (e.g., lien on property).

6. **Standard of Care**  
   - The lender must exercise **the same care and prudence** as it would in granting loans outside the scope of this Act.

## **Joint Loans and Proportional Allocation**

For loans made **jointly to two or more farmers**:

- The **principal amount** is divided equally among the farmers.
- The **amount owed** is also divided equally among them.

> This ensures fairness in loss distribution when multiple farmers share a loan.

---

## **Monetary Limits and Ministerial Authority**

### 1. **Increase in Loan Limits**
- The Minister may, upon application by a lender, **approve an increase** in the aggregate loan limits (from $500,000 to up to **$3 million**) or a higher amount set by regulation.

> This allows flexibility during periods of high demand or economic stress.

### 2. **Caps on Total Loss Payments**

To prevent excessive exposure to the government, the Minister is **not liable** to pay more than the following:

| Loan Principal Amount | Maximum Compensation |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Up to $1 million | 90% of the principal |
| Between $1M and $2M | 50% of the amount above $1M |
| Above $2M | 10% of the amount above $2M |

> This ensures that losses are capped and does not create unlimited liability.

### 3. **Caps on Losses Based on Farmer Experience**

- For a farmer who has **less than 6 years of farming experience** at the time of loan application:  
  - The Minister is liable for **only up to 90%** of the **appraised value** of the property involved.

- For all other farmers:  
  - The Minister is liable for **only up to 80%** of the appraised value.

> This protects lenders from overexposure in cases where the farmer is new or inexperienced.

---

## **Prohibited Arrangements and Risk Increases**

The Minister is **not liable** for any loss if:

- After the loan is made, the **farmer or co-op and the lender enter into an agreement** (even if it modifies terms) that **increases the risk of non-repayment**, **unless** the Minister **approves** the arrangement beforehand.

> This prevents lenders from engaging in risky restructuring without oversight.

---

## **Fee Requirements**

- Lenders must **pay a fee of 0.5%** of the loan amount to the Minister **at the time of loan disbursement**.
- This fee is **refundable** if the lender advances **less than 75%** of the loan amount within one year of the first installment.
- The refund is limited to the portion of the fee attributable to the **unadvanced portion** of the loan.

> This ensures that lenders do not benefit from partial disbursements without contributing to the program.

---

## **Exclusion of Legal Costs**

- The Minister is **not liable** for **legal fees, costs, or disbursements** incurred by the lender, **unless** those costs are assessed using **rates established by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Justice**.

> This prevents the government from covering unapproved or excessive legal expenses.
