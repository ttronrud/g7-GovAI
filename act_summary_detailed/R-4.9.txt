**Detailed Summary of the *Regional Development Incentives Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Regional Development Incentives Act* is a federal statute designed to promote economic expansion and social adjustment in designated regions of Canada by providing financial incentives and loan guarantees to businesses establishing, expanding, or modernizing manufacturing or commercial facilities. The Act targets underdeveloped or economically disadvantaged regions and aims to stimulate job creation, industrial growth, and regional development through targeted financial support.

The Act establishes a framework for three types of development incentives — **primary**, **secondary**, and **special** — as well as **loan guarantees** for qualifying projects. These incentives are subject to strict eligibility criteria, conditions, and performance requirements to ensure they contribute meaningfully to regional economic development.

## **Designation of Designated Regions**

### **Section 3 – Criteria for Designation**
- The Governor in Council may designate a region (whole province or part thereof, ≥12,500 km²) as a **designated region** via order.
- Designation is only allowed if the Minister reports that:
  1. **Productive employment opportunities are exceptionally inadequate** in the region.
  2. The development incentive will make a **significant contribution to economic expansion and social adjustment**.

> This ensures that incentives are only given where there is a genuine need and potential for impact.

---

## **Types of Development Incentives and Their Limits**

### **1. Primary Development Incentive**
- Provides financial assistance for establishing, expanding, or modernizing a facility.
- **Maximum amount**:  
  - **20% of approved capital costs**, or  
  - **$6,000,000**, whichever is **lower**.
- Applies to all facilities in designated regions.

### **2. Secondary Development Incentive**
- For projects introducing **new products or processing** not previously done in the operation.
- **Maximum amount**:  
  - **5% of approved capital costs**, plus  
  - **$5,000 per job directly created**.
- This incentive emphasizes **innovation and job creation**.

### **3. Special Development Incentive**
- For new facilities or expansions enabling new product manufacturing.
- **Maximum amount**:
  - If based on capital costs: **10% of approved capital costs**.
  - If based on capital costs + jobs: **10% of capital costs + $2,000 per job directly created**.
- Designed to encourage major investments with high social or economic returns.

> **Overall Cap on Incentives**:  
> No development incentive (or combination) may exceed:
> - **$30,000 per job created**, and  
> - **One-half of the total capital to be employed in the operation**.

> This prevents excessive subsidy and ensures incentives are proportional to scale and employment impact.

## **Decision-Making Criteria for Authorizing Incentives**

The Minister must consider the following factors when deciding whether to approve an incentive:

1. **Contribution to economic expansion and social adjustment** in the region.
2. **Costs to public authorities** (e.g., utilities, services) required for the facility.
3. **Existing federal, provincial, or municipal assistance** (excluding this Act).
4. **Environmental impact** (cost of preventing pollution).
5. For processing operations: Whether resources are **sustainably available** (on a sustained-yield basis).
6. Any other relevant economic or social benefits/costs.

> These factors ensure a balanced, evidence-based decision that considers both benefits and burdens.

## **Exclusion and Eligibility Provisions**

### **1. No Incentive if Facility Would Be Established Without It**
- Incentives cannot be authorized if the Minister believes the facility would be built **without the incentive**.

### **2. Minimum Capital Cost Requirement**
- No incentive can be authorized if the **capital costs fall below a minimum amount** set by regulations.

### **3. Exclusion of Pre-1969 Contractual Commitments**
- No incentive may be authorized for a facility where a **contractual commitment** was made before:
  - July 1, 1969, or  
  - The date the application is received (whichever is later).
- **Exception**: If an application is received **before January 1, 1970**, and the commitment was made **on or after July 1, 1969**, the incentive may be authorized as if the commitment never existed.

> This prevents retroactive incentives for pre-existing commitments and promotes new investment.

---

## **Time-Based Restrictions on Commercial Production**

- **Primary and Secondary Incentives**:
  - Facility must be brought into **commercial production by December 31, 1984**.
- **Special Incentives**:
  - Facility must be brought into commercial production by **December 31, 1973**.
  - Exception: If the delay was due to **reasons beyond the applicant’s control**.

> These deadlines reflect historical policy goals to stimulate investment during specific economic periods.

---

## **Insurance and Compliance Requirements**

- Applicants must provide **proof of insurance** (to the Minister’s satisfaction) at request or as required by regulations.
- Failure to provide insurance may result in denial or revocation of incentive.

---

## **No Reuse of Incentives for Modernization**

- **No development incentive** may be authorized for **modernization** of a facility **where a prior incentive has already been granted** under this Act.

> Prevents double-dipping and ensures incentives are used for new or transformative investments.

---

## **Payment of Incentives After Commercial Production**

- Upon commercial production, the Minister pays:
  - **Up to 80% of the estimated incentive amount** immediately.
  - The **remaining 20%** is paid in installments within:
    - **30 months** (if based on capital costs only),
    - **42 months** (if based on capital costs + jobs).
- Payments are subject to regulations.

> This phased payment structure encourages sustained performance and long-term investment.

## **Payment if Region Ceases to Be Designated**

If a facility is located in a region that **ceases to be designated** before commercial production:

- No payment is made **unless**:
  1. The facility goes into production within **18 months** of the region’s loss of designation, **or**
  2. The Minister is satisfied that:
     - **Substantial progress** was made before the region lost designation, and  
     - The project was completed with **all reasonable speed** after that point.

> Ensures that incentives are not wasted due to regional reclassification.

---

## **Tax Exemption**

- All amounts paid under the Act are **exempt from income tax**.

> Enhances the financial benefit to applicants.

## **Employment and Training Conditions (Mandatory)**

Applicants must:

- **Discuss long-term employee recruitment and training plans** with CEIC.
- **Participate in CEIC programs** related to:
  - Employment counselling
  - Manpower adjustment
  - Mobility and training

> This ensures that incentives support **local employment and workforce development**, aligning with broader social objectives.

> These conditions remain in force until:
> - The final payment is made, or  
> - December 31, 1984 (whichever is later).
