### **Detailed Summary of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**

The **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)** is a foundational federal privacy law in Canada that establishes comprehensive rules governing how private personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by private organizations. Enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of both the Senate and the House of Commons, PIPEDA aims to balance the rights of individuals to privacy with the legitimate needs of organizations to manage personal information in a commercial context.

## **5. Principles Governing Collection, Use, and Disclosure**

- **Exception**: Consent is not required in certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies, public interest, legal obligations).

### 🔹 Principle 3: **Limiting Collection**
- Organizations should collect only the **minimum amount** of personal information necessary for a specific purpose.
