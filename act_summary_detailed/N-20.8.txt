  - The *Department of Energy, Mines and Resources* or the *Department of Forestry*  
  → Shall be **read as a reference** to the **Minister of Natural Resources** or the **Department of Natural Resources**, **unless the context otherwise requires**.

This ensures a smooth and seamless transition across all federal legislation, regulations, contracts, and administrative instruments without requiring individual amendments.
