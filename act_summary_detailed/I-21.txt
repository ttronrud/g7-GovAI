**Detailed Summary of the Interpretation Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Interpretation Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the principles and rules governing how statutes (Acts of Parliament) and regulations are interpreted. It provides a comprehensive framework for legal clarity, consistency, and fairness in the application of laws across Canada. While not a law that creates new rights or obligations, it ensures that laws are understood and applied in a manner consistent with their intended purpose, constitutional principles, and the broader legal system.

This Act applies to **all Acts of Parliament** and **regulations**, whether enacted before or after its own coming into force. It serves as a guide for judges, lawmakers, legal practitioners, and administrative bodies in interpreting legislation, particularly in cases where ambiguity arises.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanations**

---

### **1. Definitions and Scope**
The Act begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"** means any law passed by Parliament (an "Act of Parliament").
- **"Enact"** includes issuing, making, or establishing a law or regulation.
- **"Enactment"** refers broadly to any Act, regulation, or part thereof.
- **"Public officer"** includes any individual in federal public administration who has authority to enforce a law or perform a duty under an enactment.
- **"Regulation"** includes orders, rules, proclamations, by-laws, tariffs, letters patent, commissions, warrants, and other instruments made under legislative authority.
- **"Repeal"** includes revocation or cancellation.

> These definitions establish a consistent legal vocabulary and ensure clarity in how laws are understood and applied.

---

### **2. Automatic Repeal of Outdated or Replaced Enactments**
- Any enactment that has been **replaced** is deemed **repealed**.
- Any enactment that has **expired, lapsed, or ceased to have effect** is also **deemed repealed**.

> This ensures that outdated or obsolete laws do not continue to bind legal proceedings or administrative decisions.

---

### **3. Applicability of the Act to All Enactments**
- Every provision of this Act applies to **every enactment**, whether enacted before or after the Act's commencement.
- The Act's own provisions apply to **its own interpretation**.
- No rule of construction (such as those derived from common law or civil law) is excluded from applying to an enactment unless it contradicts this Act.

> This ensures uniformity in legal interpretation across time and jurisdiction.

---

### **4. Enacting Clause and Structure of Acts**
- The standard form of an enacting clause is:
  > *"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"*
- The enacting clause follows the **preamble**, if present.
- The body of the Act must contain provisions in a **concise and enunciative form** (clear, direct, and precise).

> This promotes transparency and clarity in legislative drafting.

---

### **5. Date of Assent and Commencement**
- The **date of assent** (when the Act is formally approved by the Crown) is the default date of commencement **unless otherwise specified**.
- If a provision states that it comes into force on a later date, it is **deemed to come into force on the date of assent**.
- All **other provisions** of the Act are deemed to come into force on the **date of assent**, unless otherwise stated.
- Where an enactment specifies a **particular day** for coming into force:
  - It is construed as coming into force at the **end of the previous day**.
  - If it specifies a day of **expiration, lapse, or cessation**, it is construed as ceasing on the **start of the following day**.

> These rules prevent ambiguity in timing and ensure predictable legal effects.

---

### **6. Default Commencement Dates**
- For **Acts**: Comes into force at the **end of the day before the date of assent**.
- For **Regulations**: Comes into force at the **end of the day before registration** under the *Statutory Instruments Act*, or if exempted, at the end of the day before the regulation is made.

> This ensures that laws are effective without requiring explicit date-setting.

---

### **7. Judicial Notice of Published Regulations**
- A regulation published in the *Canada Gazette* is **taken as judicially noticed** regarding its effective date.

> This gives courts a reliable source of legal information without needing to determine the date of enactment from other sources.

---

### **8. Powers to Make Enactments Effective**
- If an enactment contains a power to make regulations or take actions, that power may be exercised **before** the enactment comes into force to ensure effectiveness.
- However, any such regulation or action **has no effect until the enactment begins**, except where necessary to make the enactment effective.

> This allows for practical implementation without invalidating the enactment's official start date.

---

### **9. Territorial Application**
- Every enactment applies to the **whole of Canada**, unless otherwise stated.
- When an enactment is **amended**, no new provision applies to any part of Canada to which the original enactment did not apply—**unless explicitly stated** in the amendment.
- Enactments related to **natural resources** (mineral, non-living, or living organisms) have **extra-territorial application**:
  - To the **exclusive economic zone (EEZ)** of Canada.
  - To the **continental shelf** in cases involving seabed or subsoil resources (e.g., minerals or sedentary marine species).

> This reflects Canada’s sovereign rights over its natural resources in maritime zones.

---

### **10. Extra-Territorial Operation of Pre-1931 Acts**
- Any Act enacted **before December 11, 1931** that was **intended to have extra-territorial effect** is interpreted as if Parliament had full power under the *Statute of Westminster, 1931* to create such laws.

> This recognizes the historical development of Canadian autonomy and the ability to legislate beyond Canadian borders.

---

### **11. Common Law vs. Civil Law in Property and Civil Rights**
- Both **common law** and **civil law** are equally authoritative in Canada regarding **property and civil rights**.
- When interpreting legislation, reference must be made to **provincial rules, principles, or concepts** in force at the time of application.
- **Terminology differences**:
  - In **Quebec**, civil law terminology is used.
  - In **other provinces**, common law terminology applies.

> This reflects Canada’s bilingual and dual legal system, particularly in Quebec.

---

### **12. Aboriginal and Treaty Rights**
- Every enactment is to be interpreted as **upholding** the **Aboriginal and treaty rights** of Indigenous peoples as recognized in **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- It **cannot be interpreted as abrogating or derogating** from these rights.
- "Indigenous peoples" has the same meaning as defined in **Section 35(2)** of the Constitution Act, 1982.

> This is a critical constitutional safeguard ensuring Indigenous rights are protected in all legislation.

---

### **13. Private Acts and Rights**
- A **private Act** (a law affecting specific individuals or entities) only affects the rights of those **explicitly mentioned or referred to** in it.
- It does not extend to others.

> Protects individuals from unintended legal exposure.

---

### **14. The Law "Speaks Always"**
- When a law uses the **present tense**, it applies to the **current circumstances** (as they arise), not as a hypothetical or future condition.
- This ensures that laws are applied in a way that reflects their **true spirit, intent, and meaning**.

> Prevents laws from being interpreted as outdated or conditional.

---

### **15. Interpretation of Key Words**
- **"Shall"** is **imperative** (mandatory).
- **"May"** is **permissive** (optional).

> Clarifies the obligations and discretion conferred by legislation.

---

### **16. Remedial Nature of Enactments**
- Every enactment is **deemed remedial** and should be given a **fair, large, and liberal construction** to achieve its intended purpose.

> Encourages a practical and purposive interpretation, especially in complex or ambiguous situations.

---

### **17. Preamble as Part of the Enactment**
- The **preamble** of an Act is read as part of the enactment and helps explain its **purpose and object**.

> Provides context and guidance for interpretation.

---

### **18. Marginal Notes and References**
- Marginal notes and references to **former enactments** at the end of a section are **not part of the enactment**.
- They are included only for **convenience of reference**.

> Prevents confusion and ensures that legal texts remain precise and binding only on their text.

---

### **19. Application of Definitions and Interpretation Rules**
- Definitions or rules of interpretation apply to **all provisions** of the enactment, including those containing the definitions.
- If an enactment contains an interpretation section, it applies:
  - **By default**, unless a contrary intention is expressed.
  - To **other enactments on the same subject matter**, unless otherwise stated.

> Promotes consistency in interpretation across related laws.

---

### **20. Consistency Between Enactment and Regulations**
- Where a regulation is made under an Act, **expressions used in the regulation** have the **same meaning** as in the original Act.

> Ensures coherence between primary
