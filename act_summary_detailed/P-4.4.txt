### **Detailed Summary of the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act**

The **Payment Clearing and Settlement Act (PCSA)** is a comprehensive piece of legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada to enhance the **stability, efficiency, and resilience** of Canada’s financial system by establishing a robust regulatory and supervisory framework for **payment clearing and settlement systems**. The Act recognizes that such systems are foundational to the functioning of the national economy and that their failure can lead to systemic risks — disruptions that ripple through financial institutions, markets, and broader economic activity.

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the Act, organized by key components and themes:

---

## **I. Legislative Purpose and Background**

The Act is grounded in several core policy objectives:

1. **Financial System Stability**:  
   Parliament recognizes that the stability of Canada’s financial system is essential to national economic health. Payment clearing and settlement systems are central to this stability.

2. **Role of Clearing and Settlement Systems**:  
   These systems — which facilitate the netting of payment obligations among financial institutions — are critical to preventing settlement failures, reducing counterparty risk, and ensuring smooth financial transactions.

3. **Bank of Canada’s Role**:  
   The Bank of Canada plays a key role in promoting financial stability through:
   - Providing settlement infrastructure (e.g., settlement via Bank accounts),
   - Acting as a lender of last resort,
   - Developing risk management standards for clearing and settlement systems.

4. **Need for Supervision and Resolution**:  
   To prevent systemic risk, Parliament mandates that clearing and settlement systems be **supervised, regulated, and, where necessary, resolved** in a way that minimizes public financial exposure.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The Act introduces precise definitions to ensure clarity and consistency across all provisions:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Bank** | Refers to the Bank of Canada. |
| **Clearing and Settlement System (CSS)** | A system that clears/settles payment obligations among participants. Must meet three criteria: (1) at least three participants (one Canadian, one outside the clearing house’s jurisdiction); (2) payments in Canadian dollars; (3) settlement ultimately occurs via account adjustments at the Bank (except for derivatives). Includes systems handling securities, derivatives, FX, etc., if they clear payment obligations. |
| **Clearing House** | A third-party entity that provides clearing, settlement, or message exchange services. Excludes stock exchanges and the Bank of Canada. Includes securities and derivatives clearing houses. |
| **Central Counter-Party (CCP)** | An entity that nets all participant obligations, resulting in a single net amount due between each participant and the CCP. |
| **Participant** | Any party involved in the CSS. |
| **Canadian Participant** | A participant incorporated under federal or provincial law. |
| **Systemic Risk** | Risk that a failure in a CSS could spread to other participants, financial institutions, or the broader financial system. |
| **Payments System Risk** | Risk that a disruption or failure in a CSS would impair payment capabilities or erode confidence in the overall Canadian payments infrastructure. |
| **Eligible Financial Contract** | Defined under the *Winding-up and Restructuring Act*; applies to certain financial instruments protected from resolution. |
| **Oversight Information** | As defined in regulations; information required for monitoring and supervision. |

## **III. Designation of Clearing and Settlement Systems**

A key feature of the Act is the **designated status** of certain clearing and settlement systems.

### **Designation Process**
- The **Governor of the Bank** may designate a CSS as being subject to the Act if:
  - It poses a **systemic risk or payments system risk**, and
  - The **Minister of Finance** agrees it is in the public interest to do so.
- The Governor may **revoke** designation if the system no longer poses such risks and the Minister agrees.
- Designation or revocation must be:
  - Notified in writing to the clearing house,
  - Published in the *Canada Gazette*.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that only systems with significant systemic importance are subject to enhanced oversight.

---

## **IV. Supervisory Powers of the Bank of Canada**

The Bank of Canada is granted broad powers to supervise and intervene in designated systems to mitigate risk.

### **1. Directives**
The Governor may issue **written directives** requiring corrective actions to:
- **Clearing House**: If systemic or payments system risk is inadequately controlled due to:
  - Design or operation of the system,
  - Ownership or control,
  - Organizational structure or governance,
  - Management or operations,
  - Acts or omissions by the clearing house or participants.

- **Participants**: If:
  - The clearing house fails to comply with a directive,
  - There is no Canadian-based clearing house,
  - A participant’s act or omission is not covered by system rules or documentation.

> **Limitations**:
> - Directives **cannot** address:
>   - Capital adequacy,
>   - Investment management,
>   - Corporate governance,
>   - Customer relationships outside the system,
>   - Ownership structure.
> - Must consider **nature, severity, and imminence** of risk.

### **2. Opportunity to Respond**
- Before issuing a directive, the Governor must provide the clearing house or participant with an opportunity to make representations.
- **Exception**: If providing representation would undermine the directive’s effectiveness, the Governor may issue a **15-day directive** (extendable once for another 15 days).

## **V. Legal Effect of Settlement Rules**

The Act affirms the **binding force** of settlement rules within designated systems:

### **Key Provisions**
1. **Validity of Settlement Rules**:
   - Settlement rules (rules governing payments, netting, delivery, or default) are **valid and binding** on all parties (participants, clearing house, CCP, Bank).
   - Payments, deliveries, or transfers made under these rules **cannot be reversed, repaid, or set aside**.

2. **No Stay of Settlement Activities**:
   - Entries or payments to/from Bank accounts for settlement purposes are **not subject to stay orders** or legal injunctions.
   - Rights and remedies regarding **collateral** used to secure obligations are protected from being stayed — ensuring creditors can enforce rights without interference.

3. **Exemption for Eligible Financial Contracts**:
   - Certain financial contracts (as defined in the *CDIC Act*) are **exempt** from these provisions if they are prevented by specific clauses in that Act (e.g., under section 39.15(7.12)).
   - Clearing houses must comply with CDIC obligations and refrain from actions prohibited by those sections.

4. **Application of Canadian Law**:
   - Even if a system operates outside Canada or under foreign law, **Canadian courts may determine** that rights and obligations are governed by Canadian law.
   - In such cases, the provisions of this Act **apply** to the extent that Canadian law governs the rights and obligations.

> **Significance**: Ensures that settlement operations remain final and enforceable, even in the face of legal challenges or insolvency proceedings.

## **VI. Requirements for System Changes**

To prevent sudden or unregulated changes that could increase risk:

- A clearing house must provide **reasonable notice** to the Bank before making:
  - Significant changes to the system,
  - Changes to system design, rules, or documentation,
  - Changes to the clearing house’s by-laws or constituting documents.

- **Approval Required**:
  - Any significant change that could affect risk control (e.g., structural changes, new rules) **must be approved in writing** by the Governor of the Bank.

- **Immediate Notification**:
  - After any change (except those under subsection 2), the clearing house must provide **written notice** to the Bank, including:
    - Changes in board composition,
    - Appointment of new auditors.

> **Purpose**: Ensures transparency, accountability, and timely risk assessment.

---

## **VII. Audits and Inspections**

- The Bank has the authority to **audit and inspect** clearing houses.
- Clearing houses must **assist** the Bank in carrying out these audits.
- The Bank has **powers equivalent to a commissioner under the Inquiries Act** to obtain evidence under oath.
