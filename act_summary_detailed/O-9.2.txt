**Detailed Summary of the *Olympic and Paralympic Marks Act* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Olympic and Paralympic Marks Act* is a Canadian legislative instrument enacted to protect the integrity and exclusive use of official Olympic and Paralympic marks. The Act establishes legal rules governing the use, adoption, and commercialization of marks associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games, ensuring that these prestigious symbols are not misused or exploited for commercial gain by unauthorized entities. It balances the need for brand protection with exceptions for legitimate uses—such as by organizing committees, government bodies, athletes, and in non-commercial contexts like news reporting or artistic expression.

The Act came into force on **December 17, 2007**, with certain provisions (notably Section 13) taking effect on **December 31, 2010**.
