### **5. Transitional Provision – Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**
- **Subsection 114(2) of the Canada Pension Plan does not apply** to the amendments made in this Act.
- This means that the normal rules governing pension plan contributions or benefits (such as the requirement for certain changes to be subject to a specific notice period) **do not apply** to the changes introduced in this Act.

- The relevant part of the Act (Part 4) came into force on **January 31, 2005**, as noted in the Statutory Instrument SI/2005-6.

> *This transitional clause ensures that the implementation of these budget measures does not trigger additional administrative or legal delays under the CPP framework.*

---

### **6. Repeal Provision**
- A section (s. 86) of the Act, which was **repealed in 2005 under Bill C-30**, is noted in the text. This indicates that a previous provision in the Act (likely a transitional or temporary measure) was removed during subsequent legislative review.

> *This reflects the dynamic nature of budget implementation legislation, which may be revised or adjusted over time based on policy evaluation or political changes.*
