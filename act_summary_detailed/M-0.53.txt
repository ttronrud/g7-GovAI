**Detailed Summary of the *Manitoba Claim Settlement Implementation Act (Norway House Cree Nation)***

---

### **Overview**
The *Manitoba Claim Settlement Implementation Act (Norway House Cree Nation)* is a Canadian federal statute enacted to implement and formalize the financial and land-related obligations arising from the **Flood Agreement of 1977** between the Government of Canada, the Government of Manitoba, the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, and the **Norway House Cree Nation** (a First Nation). This Act provides a legal framework to ensure that the terms of the original agreement are properly administered, respected, and enforced—particularly regarding payments, land rights, and dispute resolution—while also clarifying how these arrangements interact with broader Indigenous and provincial laws.

The Act came into force on **October 20, 2000**, and was later partially amended or repealed in 2018 (specifically sections related to arbitration and certain procedural provisions). However, the core provisions related to land, payments, and governance remain central to the rights of the Norway House Cree Nation.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Citation and Purpose**
- **Citation**: The Act is officially titled *The Manitoba Claim Settlement Implementation Act (Norway House Cree Nation)*.
- **Purpose**: To implement the terms of the **Flood Agreement** and the subsequent **Agreement** (a more comprehensive settlement) between the Crown, Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro, and the Norway House Cree Nation.

> This Act ensures that the rights, benefits, and obligations established in these agreements are legally binding and enforceable under Canadian law.

### **2. Definitions (Section 1)**
Key definitions used throughout the Act:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Agreement** | The 2000 settlement agreement concluded between: <br> - Her Majesty in right of Canada <br> - Her Majesty in right of Manitoba <br> - Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board <br> - Norway House Cree Nation <br> (Relates to comprehensive implementation of the Flood Agreement) |
| **First Nation** | Refers specifically to the **Norway House Cree Nation** |

> These definitions establish clarity and jurisdictional boundaries for the Act’s application.

### **3. Exclusion of Payments from "Indian Money" (Section 2)**
- **Provision**: Any amount paid to the Norway House Cree Nation under the Agreement (whether before or after this Act comes into force) is **not considered "Indian money"** under **subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act***.

> **Significance**:  
> - This is crucial because under the *Indian Act*, "Indian money" is subject to strict legal and administrative controls, including reporting requirements, restrictions on use, and oversight by the federal government.  
> - By excluding these settlement payments from being classified as Indian money, the Act **grants the Norway House Cree Nation greater autonomy** over how these funds are used—free from federal restrictions and controls typically applied to Indigenous financial resources.

> This supports self-determination and financial independence for the First Nation.

---

### **4. Transfer of Funds (Section 3)**
- **Provision**: As soon as practicable after the coming into force of this Act, all amounts collected, received, or held by the **federal government (Her Majesty in right of Canada)** for the benefit of the Norway House Cree Nation under the Agreement must be **transferred directly to the First Nation**, in accordance with the Agreement.

> **Significance**:
> - Ensures timely and transparent transfer of funds.
> - Prevents the federal government from retaining or mismanaging settlement monies.
> - Reinforces the principle of direct accountability and trust between the Crown and the First Nation.

---

### **5. Exemption from Indian Act Provisions (Section 4)**
- **Subsection 35(4) of the Indian Act** (which governs the use of land by Indigenous peoples) **does not apply** to any land held or transferred under the Agreement, **provided** that:
  - The holder or transferee of the land is **not** Her Majesty in right of Canada.

> **Significance**:
> - This means that once land is transferred under the Agreement to the Norway House Cree Nation or its members, **it is no longer subject to Indian Act restrictions** (such as restrictions on development, sale, or use) that would otherwise apply if the land were held directly by the Crown.
> - This enhances the **autonomy and sovereignty** of the First Nation over its lands and resources.

---

### **6. Eligibility for Claims (Section 5)**
- A claim provided for in **both the Flood Agreement and the Agreement** may only be exercised by the following entities **in accordance with the Agreement**:

1. The **Council of the First Nation**  
2. The **First Nation itself**  
3. A **member** of the First Nation  
4. A **group or unincorporated association** that is wholly or substantially comprised of members of the First Nation  
5. An **unincorporated association established by the Council**  
6. A **share capital corporation** whose shares are wholly or substantially owned and controlled by the First Nation or its members  
7. A **non-share capital corporation** whose membership consists wholly or substantially of the First Nation or its members  

> **Key Point**:  
> - These entities are **only allowed to exercise claims under the Agreement**—they cannot act independently outside the terms of the Agreement.  
> - This ensures that claims are made in a **structured, transparent, and culturally appropriate manner**, with governance and decision-making aligned with the First Nation’s internal structures.

> This provision protects against arbitrary or uncoordinated claims and ensures that all actions are consistent with the negotiated settlement.

---

### **7. Applicability of Manitoba Arbitration Law (Section 6)**
- **Provision**: Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, **Manitoba’s legislation on arbitration** applies to any dispute between the parties to the Agreement that is to be settled by arbitration.

> **Significance**:
> - Gives the dispute resolution process **local jurisdiction and procedural rules** under Manitoba law.
> - Provides a **familiar, accessible, and culturally sensitive** method of resolving disagreements—especially important in Indigenous communities where traditional or community-based approaches may be preferred.
> - Avoids the use of federal or court-based mechanisms, which may be seen as distant or impersonal.

> **Note**: This section was **repealed in 2018** (by *c. 27, s. 682*), meaning that **arbitration under Manitoba law no longer applies** to disputes arising under this Act. This may have been done to align with broader federal policy shifts or to allow for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.

> **Implication**: The repeal suggests a shift in how Indigenous land and settlement disputes are managed—potentially favoring judicial or federal-level oversight over provincial arbitration.

---

### **8. Land Designation and Transfer Provisions (Section 7 – Repealed in 2018)**
> **Original Content (before 2018 repeal)**:
> If the Council of the First Nation has, by resolution, requested that the Minister set apart certain lands as a reserve under the Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act, and those lands have **not been designated as reserves** on the day this section comes into force, then:
>
> - Any designation or grant of interest under **Section 12** of the Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act (as it existed before the section came into force) is **deemed to have been made under Section 5** of the *Addition of Lands to Reserves and Reserve Creation Act*.
> - Any ongoing process under the Indian Act for a proposed designation is **continued under the Addition of Lands to Reserves and Reserve Creation Act**.
> - Any permit or consent issued under Section 13 (as it existed before) is **deemed to have been issued under Section 6** of the *Addition of Lands to Reserves and Reserve Creation Act*.

> **Significance (before repeal)**:
> - This provision provided **legal continuity** for land claims and designations that were in progress but not yet finalized.
> - It ensured that land designation processes would not be disrupted by changes in legislation or administrative delays.
> - It facilitated a **smooth transition** from the old land settlement framework to the new reserve creation regime under Manitoba law.

> **Current Status**:  
> This section was **repealed in 2018** (*c. 27, s. 682*), meaning it no longer applies.  
> As a result, any land designation or permit process under the original Act is now subject to current laws and may require re-evaluation or new approvals.

> This repeal reflects a broader legislative shift toward modernizing Indigenous land governance and potentially aligning with federal policies that emphasize direct negotiation and self-governance.
