### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Policy Context**

The **Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act** is a foundational piece of legislation enacted by the Government of Canada to establish a **nationwide, equitable, and inclusive early learning and child care (ELCC) system**. The Act is rooted in a deep recognition of the **transformative impact of early childhood development** on children’s lifelong outcomes, family well-being, gender equality, economic prosperity, and Canada’s broader social and economic infrastructure.

The Act builds upon several key principles and commitments:

- **Child Development and Well-being**: Early learning and child care are essential for children’s social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development.
- **Gender Equality and Economic Participation**: Access to affordable child care enables parents—especially mothers—to participate fully in the workforce, promoting gender equity and economic growth.
- **Social Justice and Inclusion**: The system must be inclusive of children from marginalized groups, including those with disabilities, linguistic minorities, and Indigenous children.
- **International Obligations**: The Act aligns with international human rights frameworks, including:
  - *Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)* – recognizing the right to early childhood services.
  - *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)* – supporting women’s economic participation.
  - *Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)* – ensuring inclusive access.
  - *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)* – emphasizing Indigenous sovereignty and cultural relevance.

#### **2. Key Principles Guiding the ELCC System**

The Act establishes four core principles that govern all federal investments in early learning and child care:

| Principle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accessibility** | Programs must be available to all families, regardless of geographic location, income, or background. Special attention is given to rural and remote communities. |
| **Affordability** | Child care must be affordable for families across all income levels, especially low-income households. This supports economic participation and reduces financial barriers. |
| **Inclusivity** | Services must be accessible to children from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities, English/French linguistic minorities, and other historically marginalized groups. |
| **High Quality** | Programs must meet provincial or Indigenous governance standards and reflect evidence-based best practices in early childhood education. |

These principles apply universally, but with **additional emphasis for Indigenous communities** and **official language minority communities**.

#### **3. Commitment to Indigenous Peoples**

A central and distinctive feature of the Act is its **explicit recognition of Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination** in early learning and child care.

- **Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Framework (IELC CF)**: Co-developed with Indigenous peoples, this framework sets out guiding principles that ensure:
  - Programs are **culturally appropriate**, grounded in **Indigenous knowledge, languages, and traditions**.
  - Early learning and child care are **led by Indigenous peoples**, not imposed from outside.
  - Indigenous communities have the **right to free, prior, and informed consent** in any federal policy or legislation affecting Indigenous children.

- **Reconciliation and Nation-to-Nation Relationships**: The Act supports the Government of Canada’s commitment to reconciliation through:
  - Renewed **government-to-government and Inuit-Crown relationships**.
  - Implementation of **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action**, particularly those related to culturally appropriate early childhood education for Indigenous families.

- **Federal Investment Guidelines**: All federal investments for Indigenous communities must be guided by the IELC CF *in addition to* the general principles of accessibility, affordability, inclusivity, and quality.

#### **4. Official Languages and Linguistic Minority Communities**

The Act recognizes the importance of **linguistic diversity** in Canada. Federal investments in early learning and child care in **English and French linguistic minority communities** must be guided by the **Official Languages Act**, ensuring that services are accessible and provided in both official languages.

This includes:
- Ensuring equitable access to services for children and families in both English and French-speaking regions.
- Promoting bilingualism and cultural preservation in early learning settings.

---

#### **5. Long-Term, Sustainable Funding**

The Government commits to **long-term, stable funding** for early learning and child care programs across Canada. This funding is not a one-time initiative but a **sustainable investment** in the future of Canadian families and society.

- Funding will be primarily delivered through:
  - **Agreements with provincial governments**.
  - **Agreements with Indigenous governing bodies** (e.g., First Nations, Inuit, Métis councils).
- These agreements will define the terms, responsibilities, and shared goals for delivering high-quality, accessible, and inclusive child care services.

> The Act acknowledges that **funding is a partnership**, not a top-down transfer. It emphasizes shared responsibility and accountability between federal, provincial, and Indigenous governments.
