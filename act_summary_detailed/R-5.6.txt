**Detailed Summary of the Representation Act, 1985**

The *Representation Act, 1985* (often referred to as the *Constitution Act, 1985 (Representation)*) is a significant piece of Canadian federal legislation that reformulates the process for adjusting electoral boundaries in Canada following each decennial census. It was enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, and came into force on **March 6, 1986**, as noted in the statutory instrument SI/86-49.

### **1. Citation and Legal Framework**
- The Act is officially titled the **Representation Act, 1985**.
- A key provision establishes that this Act may be cited as the *Constitution Act, 1985 (Representation)*.
- Crucially, a reference to the *Constitution Acts 1867 to 1982* is deemed to **include** a reference to this 1985 Act. This means that the provisions of this Act are considered part of Canada’s constitutional framework when discussing electoral representation, particularly in relation to constitutional rights and procedures governing electoral boundaries.

---

### **2. Purpose and Core Objective**
The primary purpose of the Act is to **reform and standardize the process of electoral boundary readjustment** in Canada, particularly in relation to the 1981 decennial census. It ensures that electoral boundaries are adjusted in a manner consistent with constitutional principles, specifically those derived from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, as amended.

The Act effectively **resets the timeline** for the application of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA) after the 1981 census, treating it as if the constitutional provisions governing representation had always been in force from that point onward.

### **3. Key Provisions and Legal Effect**

#### **(a) Retroactive Application of Constitutional Amendments**
- **Section 1 (Amendment)**:  
  Despite any prior actions taken under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA) in respect of the 1981 census, **the EBRA, as amended by Part III of this Act**, shall be applied **as if** subsection 51(1) of the *Constitution Act, 1867* (as amended by Part I of this Act) had been in force immediately after the 1981 census.
  
  - **Constitutional Background**:  
    Subsection 51(1) of the *Constitution Act, 1867* provides that "the representation of the people of Canada in the House of Commons shall be apportioned among the provinces according to the number of persons residing in each province." This provision is foundational to equitable representation and has been interpreted as requiring that electoral boundaries reflect population changes fairly and constitutionally.
  
  - **Effect**:  
    By treating the 1981 census as if it occurred under the full force of this constitutional provision, the Act ensures that the boundary adjustments made in 1981 are now subject to constitutional standards, rather than being based on earlier, potentially less rigorous or non-constitutional practices.

#### **(b) Establishment of Electoral Boundaries Commissions**
- The Act mandates that **electoral boundaries commissions** be established and empowered to carry out their duties **in all respects as though nothing had been done** under the EBRA after the 1981 census.
- This means:
  - All prior decisions, reports, or actions taken under the EBRA in 1981 are **set aside**.
  - The process is **restarted from scratch**, with commissions operating under the new constitutional and procedural framework established by this Act.
  - The commissions are required to follow the rules and principles of the amended EBRA and the constitutional provisions (especially 51(1)).

> **Exception**: This reset applies **only to the provinces**. The **Northwest Territories** are treated differently and are subject to a special provision.

#### **(c) Treatment of the Chief Statistician’s Certified Return**
- Despite the fact that the *certified return* of the Chief Statistician of Canada (a key document outlining population data) was sent to designated persons (e.g., the Speaker of the House of Commons) **after the 1981 census**, this Act **deems that return to have been sent and received on the day this Act comes into force**.
  
  - **Purpose**:  
    This ensures that the official population data is treated as if it had been received immediately upon the Act’s coming into force. This is essential for the commissions to have access to the correct demographic data when determining new boundaries.

---

#### **(d) Special Provisions for the Northwest Territories**
- Sections 19 and 20 of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (as amended by this Act) apply **to the Northwest Territories** in respect of the 1981 census, **even if prior actions under those sections had already been taken**.
- A specific procedural change is introduced:
  - The copy of the **electoral boundaries commission report** for the Northwest Territories from 1981, which was previously transmitted to and received by the Speaker of the House of Commons under the old version of section 19(1) of the EBRA, is now to be **immediately referred** to the relevant committee under the **amended version** of section 19(1).
  
  - **Effect**:  
    This ensures that the 1981 Northwest Territories boundary report is not finalized or accepted as valid. Instead, it is now subject to review under the updated procedural rules, allowing for potential revisions or challenges based on current constitutional and democratic standards.

---

### **4. Coming Into Force**
- The Act does **not come into force immediately** upon enactment.
- Its effective date is set by **proclamation** (a formal government announcement).
- The **actual date of coming into force is March 6, 1986**, as confirmed by SI/86-49.

### **Conclusion**

The *Representation Act, 1985* is a foundational piece of legislation that restructured Canada’s electoral boundary adjustment process following the 1981 census.

It effectively **resets the timeline** of boundary adjustments, **nullifies prior decisions**, and **reinstates the process** under modern constitutional and democratic standards.
