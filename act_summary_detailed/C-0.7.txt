#### **5. Determination of Resident Status**
Resident status is crucial for determining which country has taxing rights. The rules are structured hierarchically:

##### **For Individuals**
1. **Permanent Home**: The individual is deemed a resident only of the State where they have a permanent home.
2. If permanent home exists in both countries:
   - Resident is deemed to be in the State where their **centre of vital interests** (personal and economic ties) is located.
3. If centre of vital interests cannot be determined or no permanent home exists:
   - Resident is deemed to be in the State where they have an **habitual abode**.
4. If habitual abode exists in both or neither:
   - Resident is deemed to be in the State of which the individual is a **national**.
5. If the individual is a national of both or neither:
   - The **competent authorities** of both countries must resolve the issue by mutual agreement.

##### **For Companies**
- A company is deemed a resident only in the State where it is **incorporated**.
- If not incorporated in either country:
  - Resident status is determined by the **place of effective management**.

##### **For Other Persons (e.g., trusts, partnerships)**

##### **Special Rules for Agents and Representatives**

- However, if a person:
  - Has **authority to conclude contracts** in the name of the enterprise, **or**
  - Habitually maintains a stock of goods and regularly delivers them on behalf of the enterprise,
  → Then the enterprise is deemed to have a PE in that country.

##### **Insurance Exception**
