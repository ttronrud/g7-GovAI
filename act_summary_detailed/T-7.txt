### **Detailed Summary of the *Territorial Lands Act***  
*(Cited as the Territorial Lands Act)*

---

#### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The *Territorial Lands Act* governs the administration, disposition, use, and protection of **territorial lands** in the **Northwest Territories (NWT)** and **Nunavut**, which are lands vested in the Crown or under the power of the Government of Canada to dispose of. The Act establishes a comprehensive legal framework for how these lands may be granted, leased, managed, protected, and regulated — with a strong emphasis on **environmental protection**, **public interest**, **indigenous rights**, and **government accountability**.

The Act applies only to territorial lands under the administration of the **Minister of Northern Affairs** (or, in specific cases, the Minister designated under the *Northern Pipeline Act*). It also specifies that certain provisions apply to lands in Nunavut through the **Commissioner of Nunavut**, particularly under sections 9, 12–16, and paragraph 23(k).

#### **5. Reserved Rights and Interests (Crown Reservations)**

Every grant of territorial land automatically includes **certain rights reserved to the Crown**:

- **Strip of land (100 feet wide)** reserved from:
  - The sea or inlet
  - Shoreline of navigable waters
  - Boundaries between provinces/territories (e.g., NWT–Yukon, NWT–Nunavut, NWT–Manitoba, etc.)

  - The right to enter and occupy land for mining purposes
- **All rights of fishery and fishing** adjacent to or on the land are reserved.
- **No exclusive rights** to lakes, rivers, streams, or water bodies are granted — unless explicitly stated in a document.

> *This ensures that the Crown retains control over natural resources and waterways, even after land is granted.*

#### **6. Protection of Pre-Existing Timber Infrastructure (Section 18)**

No grant, lease, or disposition of land:
- Conveys rights to **timber-related structures** (e.g., slides, dams, piers, booms) built **before the date of the grant**.
- Affects the **unimpeded right** to:
  - Use, repair, or maintain such structures
  - Use streams, lakes, portage roads, trails, or land to move timber past natural obstacles.

> *This preserves historical and operational rights for existing timber transport systems.*
