**Detailed Summary of the Farm Debt Mediation Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *Farm Debt Mediation Act* is a Canadian legislation designed to provide a structured, fair, and accessible process for farmers facing financial distress due to debt. It establishes a formal mediation framework that allows farmers to temporarily halt creditor actions, review their financial affairs, and negotiate mutually acceptable debt repayment arrangements with their creditors—particularly secured creditors—without resorting to bankruptcy or court proceedings.

This Act balances the need for farmer protection with the rights of creditors and ensures transparency, accountability, and procedural fairness throughout the process.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Title and Purpose**
- **Title**: The Act is known as the *Farm Debt Mediation Act*.
- **Purpose**: To enable farmers in financial difficulty to resolve debt issues through mediation, avoid immediate enforcement of debts, and reach sustainable financial arrangements with their creditors.

---

### **2. Definitions**
Key terms are defined to ensure clarity and consistency in application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Farmer** | Any individual, cooperative, partnership, or association engaged in farming for commercial purposes and meeting prescribed criteria. Includes production of crops, livestock, eggs, milk, maple syrup, wood, etc. |

### **3. Applicability and Binding Effect**
- The Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or any province.
- It applies to all farmers across Canada, regardless of location.

---

### **4. Appointment of Administrators**
- **Administrators** are appointed under the *Public Service Employment Act*.
- The Minister may designate **non-employee individuals** (e.g., private professionals) as administrators if needed, based on regulations and specified terms.
- Administrators may:
  - Enter into agreements for **mediators** and **experts** (e.g., financial advisors).
  - These agreements may cover **remuneration and travel/living expenses**.

> This ensures flexibility in staffing while maintaining independence and professionalism.

---

### **5. Who Can Apply for Mediation?**
A farmer may apply under **section 5** if they meet **one of the following conditions**:

1. Unable to meet obligations as they become due.
2. Has ceased paying current obligations in the ordinary course of business.
3. The aggregate value of their property (at fair valuation) is insufficient to pay all debts, even if sold under legal process.

> This ensures that only genuinely distressed farmers can access the process, preventing misuse.

---

### **6. Application Process and Initial Review**
Upon receiving a **duly completed application**:

- The administrator must:
  - **Notify all listed creditors** (in case of general application under 5(1)(a)) or **secured creditors** (in case of secured application under 5(1)(b)).
  - **Notify the Minister** if the Minister is a guarantor of a debt owed to a listed creditor.
  - **Issue a 30-day stay of proceedings** against all creditors (in general applications).
  - **Determine eligibility** based on a preliminary review of financial affairs.

> The stay of proceedings is a critical protection mechanism during the negotiation period.

#### **Finality of Determination**
- In **section 5(1)(b)** applications (mediation with secured creditors only), the administrator’s determination is **final and not appealable**.

---

### **7. Request to Amend Application**
- A farmer may request to change an application from (1)(a) to (1)(b) or vice versa **before the mediation ends**.
- The administrator may grant this change **only if the farmer is eligible** under the new category.
- An **amended application is treated as having been made on the original filing date** for purposes of section 20 (e.g., time limits).

> This provides flexibility in strategy without disrupting timelines.

---

### **8. Financial Review by Administrator**
If the farmer is found eligible, the administrator must conduct a **detailed financial review**, which includes:

- Preparation of:
  - A full **inventory of all assets**.
  - **Financial statements** of the farming operation.
- In **applications under (1)(b)**, the review may:
  - Recommend that **non-secured creditors** (and the Minister, if applicable) participate in mediation.
  - Prepare **recovery plans** to help creditors and the farmer reach financial agreements.

> The review is foundational to ensuring transparency and informed negotiation.

#### **Choice of Recovery Plan Preparer**
- If the farmer chooses a third party to prepare recovery plans, the administrator may enter into an agreement with that person, subject to regulations.

> This allows for farmer input in financial planning while maintaining oversight.

---

### **9. Appointment of Mediator**
Once the financial review is complete:

- The administrator **appoints a neutral mediator** who:
  - Is **unbiased and free from conflict of interest**.
  - Is selected according to regulations.

#### **Notice Requirements**
- For **general application (5(1)(a))**: Notify the farmer, all creditors, and the Minister (if applicable).
- For **secured application (5(1)(b))**: Notify the farmer, secured creditors, recommended non-secured creditors, and the Minister (if applicable).

- A **copy of the financial report** is provided to both the mediator and all participants.

> The mediator facilitates discussion but **does not give advice** to the farmer or creditors.

---

### **10. Duration and Termination of Mediation**
#### **General Application (5(1)(a))**
- Mediation ends when:
  - The stay of proceedings terminates (via subsection 14(2) or (5)).
  
#### **Secured Application (5(1)(b))**
- Mediation ends if:
  - The administrator determines that:
    - The farmer or **majority of creditors refuse to participate** in good faith.
    - The mediation will **not result in a mutually acceptable arrangement**.
  - Or, upon **signing of a formal arrangement** under section 19.

> The administrator must **inform all parties** of any termination.

---

### **11. Stay of Proceedings**
During the stay period (initially 30 days), **no creditor may**:
- Enforce remedies against the farmer’s property.
- Commence or continue any legal or extrajudicial proceedings (e.g., lawsuits, executions) for debt recovery or asset seizure.

> This provides a critical breathing period for negotiation.

#### **Extensions of Stay**
- The administrator may extend the stay in **three 30-day increments**, if essential for reaching an agreement.
- If an **appeal is pending** and the stay expires before the appeal is decided, the administrator **automatically extends** the stay until the appeal is resolved.
- If the **Appeal Board reverses** a decision not to extend, the extension starts from the **end of the original or previous stay**.

> This prevents creditors from acting prematurely during negotiations.

#### **Termination of Stay**
- Stay ends when:
  - The arrangement is signed under section 19.
  - The farmer makes an assignment under the *Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act*.

> The stay is a temporary protection, not a permanent suspension of rights.

---

### **12. Appointment of Guardian**
If a stay is issued, the administrator must **appoint a guardian** of the farmer’s assets immediately.

#### **Who Can Be Guardian?**
- The **farmer themselves**, if qualified.
- Otherwise:
  - A person nominated by **one or more secured creditors**.
  - A person chosen by the **administrator**.

> The guardian acts as a custodian of the farmer’s assets during the stay.

#### **Funding of Guardian’s Expenses**
- If the guardian is nominated by a secured creditor → **expenses paid by that creditor**.
- If appointed by the administrator → **expenses paid by the administrator**.

#### **Duties of Guardian**
- Prepare and maintain an **inventory of assets**.
- **Verify the presence and condition** of assets regularly.
- **Advise the administrator** of any actions or omissions that could jeopardize assets.

> This ensures asset protection and accountability.

#### **Termination of Guardian Appointment**
- The guardian’s role ends when the stay terminates or expires.

---

### **13. Arrangements and Enforcement**
- If a farmer reaches an agreement with a creditor or the Minister through mediation:
  - The administrator ensures the agreement is **formally signed** by all parties.

> This promotes enforceability and legal clarity.

---

### **14. Restrictions on Re-Application**
To prevent abuse and encourage stability, **re-application is restricted**:

#### For **General Application (5(1)(a))**:
- A farmer or related person **cannot reapply** for up to **two years** after:
  - The **first application date**, if **no agreement** was reached.
  - The **date of agreement signing**, if an
