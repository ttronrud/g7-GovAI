The **Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement Act** is a comprehensive piece of federal legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada to legally ratify and implement the **Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement** — a treaty and land claims agreement between the Tsawwassen First Nation, the Government of Canada, and the Government of British Columbia. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the Act, covering its purpose, key provisions, legal significance, and implications.

---

## **1. Purpose and Context of the Act**

### **Background and Constitutional Foundations**
- The Act is grounded in **Section 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, which recognize and affirm the **existing Aboriginal and treaty rights** of Indigenous peoples in Canada.
- The Tsawwassen First Nation is part of the **Coast Salish people**, an Aboriginal group with deep historical and cultural presence in the region.
- Reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and the Crown is seen as essential for **social and economic well-being** across Canada.
- Canadian courts have consistently held that **reconciliation is best achieved through negotiation**, not litigation — a principle reflected in this Act.

### **Objective of the Agreement**
The primary goal of the Act is to:
- Legally ratify the **Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement** (the "Agreement").
- Establish a **new, respectful, and mutually beneficial relationship** between the Tsawwassen First Nation, the federal government, and the provincial government of British Columbia.
- Provide legal certainty and enforceability to the terms of the Agreement, which includes land rights, governance, economic development, and self-determination.

## **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Agreement** | The Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement, including all amendments. |
| **Tax Treatment Agreement** | A separate agreement under Chapter 20 of the main Agreement, concerning tax treatment of Tsawwassen members and entities. |
| **Tsawwassen Lands, Members, Government, etc.** | Terms defined in Chapter 1 of the Agreement and used throughout the Act. |

> These definitions ensure consistency in how the terms are understood across legal, administrative, and judicial contexts.

## **3. Legal Status and Binding Nature**

### **The Agreement is a Treaty and Land Claims Agreement**
- The Agreement is explicitly recognized as both a **treaty** and a **land claims agreement** under **Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- This means it is:
  - Legally binding on all parties.
  - Protected from invalidation by ordinary laws.
  - Subject to constitutional protection and review.

### **Binding Effect on All Parties**
- The Agreement is **binding on all persons and bodies**, including private individuals and institutions.
- It **prevails over any conflicting federal law** to the extent of inconsistency.
- However, **this Act (the enabling legislation)** also prevails over other federal laws in case of conflict — a balance to ensure both flexibility and consistency.

## **4. Land Rights and Ownership**

### **Ownership of Tsawwassen Lands**
On the **effective date of the Agreement**, the Tsawwassen First Nation acquires **fee simple ownership** (absolute ownership) of:
- The **Tsawwassen Lands** as described in **Clause 1 of Chapter 4** of the Agreement.
- **Other Tsawwassen Lands** as specified in **Subclause 18.a of Chapter 4**.

> This is a significant transfer of land title, marking a major step toward Indigenous self-governance and control over traditional territories.

### **Effect on Prior Land Titles**
- Any land interest previously granted or approved under the **Indian Act** or the **First Nations Land Management Act (pre-Framework Agreement)** that existed on the effective date **continues in effect** unless replaced under Chapter 4.
- The **rights and obligations** of the Crown as grantor in respect of such interests are **transferred to the Tsawwassen First Nation**.

> This ensures continuity of existing rights while transitioning to a new legal framework under the Agreement.

---

## **5. Exclusions and Limitations**

### **Tax Treatment Agreement is Separate**
- The **Tax Treatment Agreement** is:
  - Not part of the main Agreement.
  - Not a treaty or land claims agreement under Section 25 or 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
- It governs tax treatment for members and entities but does not carry the same constitutional status or binding force.

### **Harvest Agreement is Separate**
- The **Tsawwassen First Nation Harvest Agreement** (Clause 102, Chapter 9):
  - Is **not part of the Agreement**.
  - Is not a treaty or land claims agreement.
- However, despite **Section 7 of the Fisheries Act**, the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** may enter into and implement this agreement — showing a special exception to protect Indigenous harvesting rights.

> This demonstrates a balance between federal environmental laws and Indigenous rights to traditional practices.

---

## **6. Application of the Indian Act**

### **Indian Act Does Not Apply (with Exceptions)**
- As of the effective date of the Agreement:
  - The **Indian Act does not apply** to:
    - The Tsawwassen First Nation
    - Tsawwassen Members
    - Tsawwassen Government
    - Tsawwassen Public Institutions
  - **Except** for determining whether an individual is an **"Indian"** under the Act.

> This is a major shift from traditional governance structures, allowing the Tsawwassen First Nation to govern itself without being subject to federal Indian Act regulations (e.g., band councils, status, reserves).

> This reflects a core principle of **self-determination** and **decolonization**.

---

## **7. Exclusion of Other Laws and Frameworks**

### **Excluded from Application**
- The **Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act** and the **Tsawwassen Land Code** (adopted under the old First Nations Land Management Act) **do not apply** to:
  - Tsawwassen First Nation
  - Tsawwassen Members
  - Tsawwassen Lands
  - Tsawwassen Government or Public Institutions

> This ensures that the Tsawwassen First Nation can develop its own **distinct land management system**, independent of broader provincial or federal frameworks.

### **Tsawwassen Laws Are Not Statutory Instruments**
- Tsawwassen Laws and instruments made under the Agreement are **not considered statutory instruments** under the **Statutory Instruments Act**.
- This means they do not require prior approval or publication under that process and are treated as **autonomous, self-governing laws**.

---

## **8. Jurisdiction and Applicability of Provincial Laws**

- Where a **British Columbia law** would not otherwise apply due to **federal exclusive jurisdiction (Class 24, Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867)**, that law **applies to the Tsawwassen First Nation** by virtue of the Agreement.
- This ensures that the Tsawwassen First Nation is not left without access to essential provincial services or regulations, even in areas where federal law takes precedence.

---

## **9. Judicial and Administrative Procedures**

### **Judicial Notice**
- The **Agreement and Tax Treatment Agreement** are taken as **judicially noticed** — meaning courts and tribunals must treat them as true and valid, without requiring evidence.
- Similarly, **Tsawwassen Laws** are judicially noticed.

> This strengthens the enforceability and reliability of the Agreement in legal proceedings.

### **Public Publication and Evidence**
- Copies of the Agreement and Tax Treatment Agreement published by the **Queen’s Printer** are **evidence of the agreement and its contents**.
- A copy purporting to be published is deemed valid **unless proven otherwise**.

> This ensures transparency and accessibility.

---

## **10. Regulatory and Implementation Powers**

### **Governor in Council Powers**
- The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may make **orders and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement or Tax Treatment Agreement.

> This allows for practical, flexible implementation of complex provisions.

---

## **11. Effective Date and Timeline**

- **Sections 19, 31, and 32** came into force on **June 26, 2008** (on assent).
- The **remainder of the Act** came into force on **April 3, 2009**, by order of the Governor in Council (as per SI/2008-147).

> This phased implementation allowed for preparation and transition.

### **Pre-Decision Notice Requirement**
- In any judicial or administrative proceeding involving:
