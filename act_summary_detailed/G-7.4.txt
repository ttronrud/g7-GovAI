The **Government Services Act, 1999** is a key piece of Canadian legislation that governs the operation of public service employment relations during periods of collective agreement expiration or transition. It was enacted to ensure continuity of government services and to provide a legal framework for the resumption of operations following a period of industrial disruption—specifically, when existing collective agreements have expired and no new agreement has yet been reached.

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the Act, organized by its key provisions and purposes:

---

## 🔹 **Overview of the Act**
- **Official Title**: *Government Services Act, 1999*
- **Purpose**: To ensure the uninterrupted delivery of government services during transitional periods when existing collective agreements expire, and to establish clear rules governing employee conduct, strike activity, and the implementation of interim employment terms.
- **Applicability**: Applies to employees in the Canadian Public Service who are bound by group-specific agreements or the master agreement.
- **Effective Date**: The Part comes into force on the expiration of the twelfth hour after the Act is assented to (i.e., 12 hours after royal assent). *Note: Part 2 and Schedule 2 became effective on March 29, 1999, at 11:30 p.m., as per Statutory Instrument SI/99-35.*

## 🔹 **Key Definitions (Defined in the Act)**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Bargaining Agent** | The *Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC)* — the official representative of public service employees in collective bargaining. |
| **Employee** | A person employed in the Public Service who is bound by a *group specific agreement*. |
| **Employer** | *Her Majesty in right of Canada*, represented by the **Treasury Board**. |
| **Government Services** | The services provided by the part of the Public Service where employees are employed. |

| **Master Agreement** | The overarching collective agreement between the employer and the bargaining agent, signed on **May 17, 1989**, and amended/extended since then. |

> All terms used in this Part have the same meaning as in the *Public Service Staff Relations Act*, unless otherwise specified.

## 🔹 **Immediate Effect Upon Coming Into Force**

1. **Resumption of Services**  
   - The employer (Treasury Board) must **resume or continue** government services without delay.
   - Every employee must **resume or continue** their duties without delay.

2. **Notice to Employees**  
   - The bargaining agent (PSAC) and its officers/representatives must:
     - Immediately notify employees that:
       - Any prior **strike declarations, authorizations, or directions** issued before this Part came into force are **invalid**.
       - Government services are now to be resumed or maintained.
       - Employees must resume or continue their duties.
     - Take **all reasonable steps** to ensure compliance with these duties.
     - **Refrain from any conduct** that could discourage employees from complying.

3. **Protection of Employees from Retaliation**  
   - No officer or representative of the employer may:
     - Impede an employee from complying with duty resumption.
     - Discharge, discipline, or authorize discipline **solely because** the employee was lawfully on strike prior to the Act coming into force.

---

## 🔹 **Continuity of Existing Agreements**

- The **master agreement** and **each group-specific agreement** are **deemed to have had effect** from the date they expired **until the coming into force of this Part**.
- These agreements **continue to apply** until the earlier of:
  - The day the employer and bargaining agent reach a **new single collective agreement**.
  - The day they become bound by the **collective agreement referred to in subsection 20(3)** (i.e., the interim agreement established under the Act).

> This ensures that employees are not left without employment terms during the transition period.

---

## 🔹 **Interim Employment Terms (Prescribed by Governor in Council)**

The **Governor in Council** (on recommendation of the Treasury Board) may prescribe:

1. **Terms and conditions of employment** applicable to employees.
2. The **period** during which those terms are in effect.

Additional flexibility:
- The Governor in Council may specify that any term or condition takes effect **before or after** the start of the prescribed period.

> These prescribed terms constitute a **new collective agreement** for each group of employees bound by a group-specific agreement (as listed in Schedule 2).

---

## 🔹 **Application of the Public Service Staff Relations Act**

- The *Public Service Staff Relations Act* applies to the interim collective agreements created under this Act.
- These interim agreements are **binding and effective** for the duration of their applicability, **despite any conflicting provisions** in the Staff Relations Act.

> This ensures legal enforceability and consistency with broader public service labor rules.

---

## 🔹 **Exclusion of Statutory Instruments Act**

- The *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to any action or provision taken under this Act.
- This means that the Governor in Council's power to prescribe terms is not subject to procedural requirements typically found in Statutory Instruments.

---

## 🔹 **Spent Provisions (If a New Agreement Is Reached Early)**

- If, **before** the interim terms are prescribed, the employer and bargaining agent reach a **new collective agreement**:
  - Subsections (1) to (5) and **Section 22** (the strike prohibition) are **deemed to be spent** (i.e., no longer in force).
- This prevents overlap and ensures that the new agreement governs the relationship.

---

## 🔹 **Prohibition of Strikes During the Transition Period**

During the period from the coming into force of this Part until the expiration of the interim agreement (whichever comes first):

- **No officer or representative of the bargaining agent** may:
  - Declare, authorize, or direct a strike.
- **No employee** bound by the interim agreement may participate in a strike.

> This is a critical mechanism to ensure **service continuity** during negotiations.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Nothing in this Part restricts the parties’ right to **amend** any provision of the interim collective agreement or to give effect to such amendments.

---

## 🔹 **Offences and Penalties**

### 1. **Individual Offences**
- Any individual who contravenes a provision of this Part is guilty of an offence punishable on **summary conviction**.
- Fines:
  - **Up to $50,000** if the offender was an officer/representative of the **employer or bargaining agent**.
  - **Up to $1,000** in all other cases.

### 2. **Offence by the Bargaining Agent**
- If the bargaining agent contravenes the Act, it is guilty of an offence.
- Fines: **Up to $100,000** per day or part of a day the offence continues.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Despite **section 787(2) of the Criminal Code**, **imprisonment cannot be imposed** in default of payment of a fine.

---

## 🔹 **Enforcement and Recovery of Fines**

- Fines imposed under this Act are **debt obligations** payable to *Her Majesty in right of Canada*.
- They may be recovered:
  - In any court of competent jurisdiction.
  - By any method provided under any Act of Parliament.
- **Special recovery mechanism**:
  - If a fine is imposed on the bargaining agent or one of its officers/representatives, the amount may be **deducted from membership dues** that the employer is required to deduct and remit to the bargaining agent under a collective agreement.
  - The amount deducted is **deemed deposited** into the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** on behalf of the Receiver General.

> This ensures that fines are collected even if the bargaining agent is not directly paying from its own funds.

---

## 🔹 **Legal Status of the Bargaining Agent**

- For the purposes of this Part, the **bargaining agent (PSAC)** is deemed to be a **"person"** under the law.
- This allows it to be held liable for offences, enter into binding agreements, and be subject to the same legal obligations as individuals or organizations.
