### **Detailed Summary of the Accessible Canada Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Legislative Context**

The **Accessible Canada Act** (ACA) is a landmark piece of federal legislation enacted by Parliament to advance the realization of a **barrier-free Canada** by **January 1, 2040**. It is grounded in fundamental Canadian legal and human rights principles, including:

- The **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, which guarantees the right to **equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination**, especially on the basis of disability.
- The **Canadian Human Rights Act**, which affirms that all individuals — particularly persons with disabilities — have the right to **make their own lives** and to have their needs met without discrimination.
- Canada’s commitment under the **United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)** to take appropriate measures to ensure accessibility and to develop and monitor **minimum accessibility standards**.

The Act recognizes that **barriers to accessibility** — physical, technological, attitudinal, informational, or policy-based — hinder full and equal participation in society and disproportionately affect people with disabilities and their families.
