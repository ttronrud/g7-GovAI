## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Marine Transportation Security Act**

### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**
The *Marine Transportation Security Act* (MTSA) was enacted to enhance the security of marine transportation in Canada by establishing a legal framework for the prevention of unauthorized threats—such as weapons, explosives, and incendiaries—on vessels and at marine facilities. It applies to both Canadian-registered and foreign vessels operating in Canadian waters and offshore structures, with the goal of protecting people, goods, vessels, and critical infrastructure from acts of terrorism, sabotage, or unlawful interference.

The Act is designed to:
- Ensure the security of marine operations through screening, inspection, and monitoring.
- Provide flexibility for operators to develop their own security rules, subject to ministerial review and approval.
- Empower the Minister of Transport to take emergency action when threats are suspected.
- Establish clear accountability for non-compliance and security failures.
