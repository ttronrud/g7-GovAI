**Detailed Summary of the *Public Servants Inventions Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Servants Inventions Act* establishes the legal framework governing intellectual property rights arising from inventions created by public servants in Canada. The Act ensures that inventions made by public servants—whether during the course of their duties or with support from the government—are vested in **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, rather than in the individual inventor. It outlines the procedures for reporting inventions, filing patents, appeals, administration of rights, and potential compensation for inventors.

This Act is designed to balance the public interest in leveraging government-funded research and development with the rights of individual public servants to be fairly recognized and compensated when they contribute to innovation.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Public Servant** | Any person employed in a department, including members of the Canadian Forces or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. |
| **Department** | As defined in the *Financial Administration Act*, including agent corporations listed in Part I of Schedule III to that Act. |
| **Appropriate Minister** | The minister responsible under the *Financial Administration Act* for the department in which the public servant is employed. If multiple ministers are involved, any one may act as the appropriate minister. |

## **Ownership of Inventions**

### **Section 2: Vesting of Invention Rights**
The following inventions are **vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada**:

1. **Inventions made by a public servant while acting within the scope of their duties or employment**, or  
2. **Inventions made with facilities, equipment, or financial aid provided by or on behalf of Her Majesty**, or  
3. **Inventions that resulted from or are connected with their duties or employment**.

> This means that even if a public servant develops an invention independently, if it arises from their job responsibilities or is supported by government resources, the government owns the intellectual property rights.

> Importantly, **this ownership applies regardless of whether the invention is patented or not**.

---

## **Obligations of the Public Servant**

### **Section 3: Responsibilities of the Inventor**
Every public servant who makes an invention must:

1. **Inform the appropriate minister** of the invention and provide all required information and documentation.
2. **Not file a patent application outside Canada** without the **written consent** of the appropriate minister.
3. **Disclose in any Canadian patent application** that they are a public servant.

> These provisions ensure transparency and prevent unauthorized exploitation of government-supported inventions abroad.

---

## **Role of the Commissioner of Patents**

### **Section 4: Notification by the Commissioner**
If the Commissioner of Patents determines that a patent application relates to an invention made by a public servant, they must:

- Notify the appropriate minister.
- Provide the minister with all relevant information.

> This creates a formal mechanism to identify government-owned inventions early in the patent process.

---

## **Determining Whether an Invention is Government-Owned**

### **Section 5: Determination Process**
- Whenever a question arises about whether an invention is vested in Her Majesty, the **appropriate minister must determine it within three months** of being referred.
- The minister must **notify the inventor in writing** of the determination.
- If no decision is made within the three-month period, the inventor (or any interested party) may apply to the **Federal Court** within 30 days of the expiry of the time limit.

> This establishes a clear timeline and judicial recourse for disputes over ownership.

---

## **Appeals and Judicial Review**

### **Section 6: Right to Appeal**
- If the appropriate minister determines that an invention is vested in Her Majesty, the inventor or any other interested party may **appeal to the Federal Court**:
  - Within **30 days** of receiving notification, or
  - Within a **longer period** allowed by the minister.

> This provides a legal pathway for public servants to challenge government ownership claims.

---

## **Patent Filing and Administration**

### **Section 7: Government Filing of Patents**
- Despite provisions in the *Patent Act*, the **appropriate minister may file a patent application** on behalf of Her Majesty for inventions vested in the Crown.
- The patent will be issued **in the name of Her Majesty** or as otherwise directed by the minister.

> This allows the government to protect and commercialize inventions without requiring the inventor to file independently.

### **Section 8: Obligations of the Inventor**
- The public servant must **execute all necessary documents** required by the minister to file a patent in Canada or elsewhere.

> This ensures compliance with procedural requirements and facilitates smooth government processing.

---

## **Transfer, Waiver, and Abandonment of Rights**

### **Section 9: Authority of the Minister**
The appropriate minister (or other designated minister/agency) may:
- **Waive, abandon, or transfer** all or part of the rights in an invention vested in Her Majesty.
- Execute instruments to effect such transfers.

> This gives the government flexibility to manage intellectual property portfolios strategically.

### **Section 10: Restrictions on Waiver/Transfer**
- **No waiver, abandonment, or transfer** of rights related to inventions falling under:
  - **Section 20 of the Patent Act** (inventions involving defence or national security) → requires **approval of the Minister of National Defence**.
  - **Section 22 of the Patent Act** (inventions involving nuclear technology) → requires **approval of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)**.

> These safeguards protect sensitive technologies and ensure appropriate oversight in high-risk areas.

---

## **Administration and Control of Inventions**

### **Section 11: Oversight and Management**
- The **appropriate minister** (or successor agency) has full **administration and control** over:
  - The invention itself,
  - Any patent issued,
  - Any certificate of supplementary protection (e.g., for pharmaceuticals).

> This includes the power to:
- Transfer administration to another minister or to a **corporate agency of Her Majesty**.
- Develop and exploit the invention.
- Enter into agreements with private parties to license, commercialize, or otherwise use the invention.

### **Section 12: Capacity of Corporate Agencies**
- Even though a corporate agency may be subject to its own charter or incorporation rules, **it has full legal capacity** to:
  - Receive, hold, administer, control, develop, and exploit the invention.
  - Carry out all provisions of this Act with respect to the invention.

> This grants corporate bodies the autonomy to manage government IP as if they were private entities.

## **Financial Benefits and Awards**

### **Section 13: Payment of Awards to Inventors**
- The appropriate minister **may authorize payment of an award** to a public servant who made an invention vested in Her Majesty.
- The amount may be:
  - Agreed upon by the minister and the public servant, or
  - Determined unilaterally by the minister.
- The award may be paid **in such amount and manner as the minister decides**.

> This provides a **compensation mechanism** to recognize and reward public servants' contributions to innovation, though it is not a guarantee or automatic entitlement.

> **Note:** The award is not tied to commercial success or profit; it is a recognition of effort and contribution.

## **Penalties for Violations**

### **Section 14: Offences**
- Any person who:
  - Fails to inform the appropriate minister of an invention (subsection 4(1)), or
  - Files a patent application **outside Canada** without the minister’s written consent (section 7)
  
  is guilty of an **offence**.

> Penalties:
- **Fine not exceeding $500**, or
- **Imprisonment for up to six months**, or
- **Both**.

> This enforces compliance and protects the integrity of the government's ownership regime.

---

## **Regulatory Authority**

### **Section 15: Power to Make Regulations**
The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) may make **regulations** to implement this Act, including:

1. **Rules of practice and procedure** for:
   - Patent applications under this Act,
   - Determining ownership questions,
   - Appeals or applications to the Federal Court.

2. **Information required** in patent applications involving public servants.

3. **Amounts, methods, and timing** of awards to inventors.

> These regulations provide operational detail and flexibility to adapt to emerging technologies and practices.

---

## **Special Provisions**

### **Section 16: Multiple Appropriate Ministers**
- If more than one minister is appropriate for a given invention (e.g., due to cross-departmental work), **any one of them may act as the appropriate minister** for that invention.

> This simplifies administrative coordination in complex or shared projects.

---

### **Section 17: Joint Inventions**
- If an invention is made **jointly by a public servant and a non-public servant**, this Act applies **only to the public servant’s interest** in the invention.

> The non-public servant’s rights are governed by other laws (e.g., the *Patent Act* or contract law), but the government retains ownership of the public servant’s share.
