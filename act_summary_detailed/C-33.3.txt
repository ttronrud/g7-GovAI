**Detailed Summary of the *Coasting Trade Act***  

---

### **Overview**

The *Coasting Trade Act* is a Canadian statute that regulates the **engagement of foreign ships and non-duty-paid ships in the coasting trade**—defined broadly as the movement of goods and passengers within Canadian waters and above the continental shelf. The Act establishes conditions under which such foreign vessels may operate in Canada, ensuring national economic interests, maritime safety, environmental protection, and the primacy of Canadian shipping services.

It was enacted by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, and may be cited as the **Coasting Trade Act**.

## **Core Provisions**

### **1. General Prohibition on Foreign Ship Operation (Section 1)**

> **No foreign ship or non-duty-paid ship may engage in the coasting trade unless authorized by a licence.**

This establishes a **strict baseline**—foreign vessels are prohibited from operating in the coasting trade unless they obtain a licence from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP).

#### **(c) Government-Sponsored Scientific Research**
- Foreign government-operated vessels conducting marine scientific research may operate if:
  - The foreign government has obtained **consent from the Minister of Foreign Affairs**.

#### **(d) Seismic Activities**
- Seismic surveys in waters above the continental shelf for mineral or non-living natural resource exploration are exempt.

#### **(e) Salvage Operations**
- Exempt **only if conducted outside Canadian waters**; otherwise, not exempt.

---

### **3. Pre-Application Requirements for Exemptions (Section 2.5)**

Before a ship engages in any activity listed in subsections (2.11) to (2.21) and seeks an exemption, the **owner must provide information to an enforcement officer** (designated under section 12), in a form and manner specified by the Minister, to prove that the vessel meets all applicable conditions.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with regulatory standards.
