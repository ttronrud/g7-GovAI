**Detailed Summary of the *Civil Service Insurance Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Civil Service Insurance Act* is a Canadian federal statute enacted on April 24, 1975 (in force upon assent), which establishes a framework for providing life insurance to certain civil and military employees of the federal public administration. The Act governs the conditions under which the Minister of Finance (the "Minister") may enter into life insurance contracts with individuals in permanent federal government positions, specifying the beneficiaries, apportionment of benefits, and administrative procedures. It also defines key terms and includes provisions for premium calculation, payment, and the treatment of insurance proceeds in various circumstances.

This Act is primarily designed to offer financial protection to federal employees and their dependents upon the death of the insured, while ensuring administrative clarity, legal enforceability, and fiscal accountability.

## **Apportionment and Succession Rules (When Beneficiaries Die During the Insured’s Lifetime)**

If one or more named beneficiaries die **before the insured’s death**, the following rules apply:

### For Men (Sections 6–8):
- The insured may, by **declaration**, provide that the deceased beneficiary’s share goes to:
  - The wife and children of the insured, or
  - One or more of them, in any proportion the insured chooses.
- **In default of such declaration**, the share goes to the **survivors** of the deceased beneficiaries, in **equal shares** if more than one.

### For Women (Section 10):
- The insured may, by declaration, provide that the deceased beneficiary’s share goes to:
  - The persons who may be her beneficiaries under this Act (e.g., husband, children, parents, etc.), or
  - One or more of them, in any proportion.
- **In default**, the share goes to the **survivors** of the deceased beneficiaries, in **equal shares**.

> If **all** named beneficiaries die before the insured, the rules are:
- The insured may by declaration allocate the benefit to the eligible persons (spouse, children, etc.) in any proportion.
- **In default**, the insurance money goes to the insured’s **spouse and children**, in **equal shares**.
- If the insured **survives all beneficiaries**, the insurance money becomes part of their **estate**.

## **Effect of Wills and Declarations**

### 1. **Validity of Apportionment in a Will**
- An apportionment in a will is **not invalid** simply because the will is invalid or the apportionment is invalid under will law.
- However, **a later declaration** (e.g., a new written agreement) **overrides** any apportionment in a prior will.

### 2. **Revocation of Apportionment**
- If a will containing an apportionment is **revoked by operation of law** (e.g., by death of the testator, or by statutory provisions), the apportionment is **revoked**.
- Similarly, if a will that purports to be valid would be revoked later (e.g., by probate laws), the apportionment is **revoked**.

> This ensures that the most recent, legally valid declaration governs the distribution.

---

## **Default Rule: Equal Shares**
- If **no apportionment** is made in the contract or declaration, **all interested persons** (beneficiaries) are deemed to share the insurance money **equally**.

---

## **Payment and Discharge of Liability**

- A payment of insurance money made **before** the Superintendent of Financial Institutions receives:
  - A court order,
  - A notarial copy,
  - Or a statutory declaration verifying a challenge to the payment,
- **Discharges Her Majesty (the Crown)** from liability to the extent of the amount paid, **as if no such instrument or order existed**.

> **Important**: This provision only affects the Crown’s liability and **does not affect the rights of any other person** (e.g., beneficiaries or heirs).

---

## **Premiums and Financial Administration**

- The Minister is responsible for constructing **premium tables** to determine the cost of insurance.
- These tables are based on:
  - The **H.M. Mortality Table** of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain,
  - A **6% annual interest rate**,
  - **No allowance for administrative or operating expenses**.
- Premiums may be paid in:
  - One lump sum,
  - Annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly installments,
  - Either during the insured’s lifetime or over a limited period.

> The **minimum** insurance sum is **$1,000**, and the **maximum** is **$10,000**.

---

## **Medical Certification Requirement**
- Every applicant must provide a **medical certificate** in the form prescribed by the Minister.

---

## **Designation of Beneficiaries**

  - Spouse,
  - Common-law partner,
  - Children,
  - Father, mother,
  - Brother, sister,
  - Any other person dependent on the insured.
