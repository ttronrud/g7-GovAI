**Detailed Summary of the *Criminal Records Act***  
*(As in force, with reference to key provisions and context)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Criminal Records Act* (CRA) is a federal statute in Canada that governs the **suspension of criminal records** for individuals who have been convicted of offences. Its primary purpose is to **promote rehabilitation, reduce stigma, and allow individuals to reintegrate into society** as law-abiding citizens—particularly where the conviction is not a serious or repeat offence, and the individual has demonstrated good conduct since their conviction.

The Act establishes a **clear, structured process** for applying for a record suspension, outlines **eligibility criteria**, defines the **powers and responsibilities of the Parole Board of Canada (the "Board")**, and sets out **strict rules on record confidentiality and disclosure**—balancing individual privacy with public safety and the need for transparency in certain circumstances.

## **Eligibility for a Record Suspension**

### **General Eligibility (Section 4(1))**
A person may apply for a record suspension **after the expiration of a specified period**, depending on the nature of the offence:

| Offence Type | Minimum Waiting Period |
|------------|------------------------|
| Prosecuted by indictment OR service offence with a punishment of more than $5,000, detention >6 months, dismissal from service, imprisonment >6 months, or punishment >1 year (in scale of National Defence Act) | **10 years** |
| Offence punishable on summary conviction OR service offence not falling under the above | **5 years** |

> ❗ *Note*: The period of **long-term supervision** (under the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act*) is **not included** in the waiting period.

---

### **Exclusions from Eligibility (Section 4(3))**

A person is **ineligible** to apply for a record suspension if:
1. Convicted of an offence listed in **Schedule 1** (e.g., serious violent crimes like murder, sexual assault, or offences involving minors).
2. Convicted of **more than three offences** where:
   - The offence was prosecuted by indictment **or**
   - It is a service offence with a maximum punishment of life imprisonment, and
   - For each such offence, the person was sentenced to **imprisonment for two years or more**.

> ✅ Exception: A person convicted only of an offence in **Schedule 1** may apply **if** the Board is satisfied that:
> - The offender was **not in a position of trust or authority** toward the victim;
> - The victim was **not in a dependent relationship** with the offender;
> - The offender was **less than five years older** than the victim;
> - No violence, intimidation, or coercion was used.

> ⚠️ This exception applies **only** to Schedule 1 offences and is designed to protect vulnerable individuals.

---

### **Special Provisions for Offences in Schedule 3**

Schedule 3 includes **non-violent, minor offences** (e.g., traffic violations, minor drug offences).

- A person convicted **only** of an offence in Schedule 3 may apply for a record suspension **before** the 5- or 10-year waiting period expires.
- However, if the person has **other offences**, they must wait until the full waiting period has expired (excluding Schedule 3 offences).
- A person is **ineligible to apply** for a record suspension related to Schedule 3 offences **until all fines and victim surcharges** have been paid (unless the fine/victim surcharge is for a Schedule 3 offence and the person has only one such offence).
- **Exception**: For fines and victim surcharges imposed on both Schedule 3 and other offences, the person must wait until **all** such payments are made.

> ✅ This ensures that individuals do not use record suspension as a way to avoid paying financial penalties.

---

### **Onus of Proof**

- The **applicant bears the burden of proof** to show that:
  - The conditions in Section 4(3) are met (for Schedule 1 offences);
  - The applicant has been convicted **only** of an offence in Schedule 3 (for subsection 4(3.1));
  - The record suspension would provide a **measurable benefit** to the applicant and support their rehabilitation.

> ⚠️ The Board may **not require** a certified copy of court records unless the applicant's criminal history (from police or military records) is insufficient to prove eligibility.

## **Process for Applying and Reviewing Applications**

### **Steps in the Process**
1. **Eligibility Check**:
   - The Board must first determine if the applicant is eligible (based on time elapsed, type of offence, and number of convictions).
2. **Conduct Inquiry**:
   - The Board conducts inquiries into the applicant’s conduct since the conviction.
   - These inquiries **do not include**:
     - Non-payment of fines or victim surcharges for Schedule 3 offences (for Schedule 3 applications).
     - Offences listed in Schedule 3 (for most applications).
3. **Disrepute Assessment (for serious offences)**:
   - For offences prosecuted by indictment, the Board may consider:
     - Nature, gravity, and duration of the offence;
     - Circumstances surrounding the offence;
     - Criminal history (including service offence history);
     - Any factors prescribed by regulation.

> ✅ The Board may **consider whether granting a record suspension would bring the administration of justice into disrepute**—a key safeguard against undermining public confidence in the justice system.

4. **Notification and Right to Respond**:
   - If the Board proposes to **refuse** the application, it must notify the applicant in writing.
   - The applicant has the right to make **written or oral representations** (with Board authorization) before a decision is made.
   - The Board must **consider all representations** within a reasonable time.

5. **Reapplication Rule**:
   - An applicant **cannot reapply** until **one year after the Board refuses** the application.

## **Board Powers and Decision-Making**

- The Board has **exclusive jurisdiction** to:
  - Order, refuse to order, or revoke a record suspension.
- A **panel** of one Board member makes decisions on most applications.
- The Chairperson may **increase the panel size** (e.g., to two or more members) for complex or sensitive cases.
- A record suspension ordered under **Section 4(1.1)** (for minor offences) **cannot be revoked** under Section 7(b).
- For Schedule 3 offences, the Board **must grant** a record suspension if the applicant has:
  - Been convicted **only** of a Schedule 3 offence;
  - Not been convicted of any other offence under an Act of Parliament.
