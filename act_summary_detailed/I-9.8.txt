**Detailed Summary of the *Injured Military Members Compensation Act***

---

### **Overview**
The *Injured Military Members Compensation Act* establishes a statutory framework for providing financial compensation to members of the Canadian Armed Forces who suffer injuries during service — whether in the regular force or in the reserve forces — that result in specific physical or sensory losses. The Act is designed to ensure that eligible service members and their estates receive timely, fair, and equitable compensation based on clear criteria, while also protecting the integrity of the claims process and respecting privacy and administrative efficiency.

The Act was enacted by Her Majesty in Right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, and may be cited as the *Injured Military Members Compensation Act*.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Definitions**
The Act begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Class “A” Reserve Service**: Defined as per Article 9.06 of the *Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces* — typically refers to reserve service with a shorter duration or lower level of commitment than Class B or C.
- **Class “B” Reserve Service**: Defined under Article 9.07 — involves more substantial reserve service, generally requiring 180 days or more of active duty.
- **Class “C” Reserve Service**: Defined under Article 9.08 — the most extensive reserve service, often involving long-term or full-time reserve commitments.
- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of National Defence**, who has primary responsibility for administering the Act.
- **Personal Information**: Defined under Section 3 of the *Privacy Act* — includes any information relating to an individual’s identity, health, or service records, and is subject to privacy protections.

> These definitions ensure consistency with existing military regulations and legal frameworks.

### **2. Designation of Officers and Powers**
- The Minister may designate any individual to exercise powers or perform duties under the Act (e.g., to make decisions or review claims).
- **Important Limitation**: A person designated to *make a decision* cannot also be designated to *review* that same decision. This prevents conflicts of interest and ensures impartiality in review processes.
