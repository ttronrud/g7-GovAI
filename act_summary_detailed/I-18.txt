**Detailed Summary of the *International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act***

---

### **1. Act Title and Citation**
The Act is formally titled the *International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act* and may be cited accordingly. This legislation establishes a legal framework for Canada to provide financial support to international financial institutions (IFIs) with the primary objective of promoting **social and economic development in developing countries**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Institution"**: Refers to any international financial institution listed in the *Schedule* to the Act. These are organizations that operate globally and provide financial services or development financing to developing nations (e.g., World Bank, International Monetary Fund, regional development banks).

> *Note: The Schedule is a critical component of the Act, defining which institutions are eligible for assistance.*

---

### **3. Types of Financial Assistance Available**
The Minister of Foreign Affairs (in consultation with the Minister of Finance) may provide financial assistance to qualifying institutions through the following methods:

1. **Direct Payments**  
   - Canada can make direct cash payments to the institution.

2. **Issuance of Non-Interest-Bearing, Non-Negotiable Demand Notes**  
   - Canada may issue demand notes (a type of short-term debt instrument) to the institution.  
   - These notes are:
     - **Non-interest-bearing** (no interest is charged)
     - **Non-negotiable** (cannot be transferred or sold)
     - **Demand notes** (can be redeemed immediately upon request)
   - The form of these notes is determined by the Minister of Finance.

3. **Purchase of Shares on Behalf of Canada**  
   - The Government of Canada may buy shares in the institution on its behalf.  
   - This allows Canada to gain a stake in the institution, potentially influencing its operations or development priorities.

4. **Guarantees (with Minister of Finance’s written concurrence)**  
   - Canada may provide guarantees (promises to repay if the institution defaults) to support lending or investment activities.  
   - Requires **prior written approval** from the Minister of Finance due to fiscal and risk implications.

5. **Other Methods (at Minister’s Discretion)**  
   - The Minister of Foreign Affairs may authorize **any other method** they deem appropriate for achieving the Act’s purpose of promoting development in developing countries.

> All forms of assistance are strictly aimed at advancing **social and economic development** in developing nations.

### **4. Amendments to the Schedule (Governor in Council Power)**
The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may amend the Schedule to:
- **Add** a new international financial institution to the list if it is recognized as a financial institution that can help achieve the Act’s goals.
- **Delete** an institution whose name has changed and replace it with its current name.
- **Remove** an institution that has ceased to exist or is no longer recognized as fulfilling the Act’s purpose.

> This power ensures the list remains current and relevant to Canada’s development objectives.

---

### **5. Parliamentary Oversight and Approval Process**
Amendments to the Schedule (i.e., orders under Section 4) must go through a **transparent, structured, and democratic review process** involving both Houses of Parliament.

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Laying Before Parliament**  
   - An order amending the Schedule must be **laid before Parliament** no later than the **fifteenth sitting day** after it is made.

2. **Public Review and Motion Opportunities**  
   After laying:
   - **Option A (Motion to Confirm)**:  
     If a motion is filed by a **minister of the Crown** requesting confirmation of the order, the House of Commons must consider it within **six sitting days** of filing.  
     - The motion is debated for **no more than three hours**.  
     - After debate, the Speaker puts the question immediately without further amendments.  
     - If the motion is **not adopted**, the order is **revoked**.

   - **Option B (Motion to Revoke)**:  
     If **30 or more members** of the House of Commons file a motion requesting revocation, the order is **revoked**.  
     - If no such motion is filed, the order proceeds to the Senate.

3. **Senate Review Process**  
   - If the order proceeds to the Senate:
     - The Senate must take up the motion within **five sitting days** of receiving the request from the House of Commons.
     - Debate is limited to **three hours**.
     - After debate, the Speaker puts the question immediately.
     - If the Senate **concurs**, the order **comes into force immediately**.
     - If the Senate **does not concurs**, the order is **revoked**.

4. **Alternative Path for Revoke Motion (Senate-Initiated)**  
   - If a motion to revoke the order is filed by **15 or more Senators**, and the House of Commons fails to adopt the motion (i.e., the motion to confirm is rejected), then:
     - The order **comes into force** on the **fifth sitting day after the failure** of the House of Commons to adopt the motion — **unless** a Senate revocation motion is filed.

5. **Final Outcome Rules**  
   - If the House of Commons **adopts** a motion to revoke (in either case), the order is **revoked**.
   - If the Senate **does not concurs**, the order is **revoked**.
   - If the Senate **concurs**, the order **comes into force immediately**.

6. **Revocation on Dissolution or Prorogation**  
   - If Parliament is **dissolved or prorogued**, any order that has been laid but not yet come into force is **automatically revoked**.

> This process ensures **parliamentary accountability**, transparency, and democratic legitimacy in decisions affecting foreign financial assistance.

### **6. Funding and Appropriation Controls**
- The Minister of Foreign Affairs may make payments under this Act **out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund** (Canada’s main public fund).
- Payments are **strictly limited** to the amount **appropriated by Parliament** for this purpose in any given period.
- This prevents uncontrolled spending and ensures that all financial support is **funded by parliamentary authorization**.

---

### **7. Definition of "Sitting Day"**
- A "sitting day" is defined as **any day on which either House of Parliament is in session**.  
- This ensures that timelines for parliamentary consideration are based on actual legislative activity, not calendar days.

---

### **8. Purpose and Policy Objective**
The overarching goal of the Act is to:
- Promote **sustainable social and economic development** in developing countries.
- Use **strategic financial instruments** (direct payments, guarantees, share purchases) to influence or support development initiatives through international institutions.
