## **Detailed Summary of the Oceans Act**

### **1. Legislative Purpose and Policy Foundations**

The *Oceans Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes and reinforces Canada’s legal framework for managing its ocean territories. The Act is grounded in several core principles:

- **Common Heritage**: Canada recognizes that the oceans — including the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and all maritime areas — are the common heritage of all Canadians.
- **Leadership in Marine Management**: Parliament affirms Canada’s role as a global leader in responsible and sustainable ocean and marine resource management.
- **Sovereign Rights and Jurisdiction**: The Act clearly defines and affirms Canada’s sovereign rights, jurisdiction, and responsibilities within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), including the continental shelf and adjacent waters.
- **Ecosystem-Based Conservation**: Conservation based on an **ecosystem approach** is considered fundamental to preserving marine biodiversity and productivity.
- **Precautionary Principle**: Canada promotes the **precautionary approach** in managing marine resources — meaning that where there is scientific uncertainty, actions should be taken to prevent harm to the marine environment.
- **Economic Opportunity**: The Act acknowledges that oceans offer significant potential for **economic diversification and wealth generation**, especially for coastal and Indigenous communities.
- **Integrated Management**: It supports the **integrated management** of marine ecosystems, recognizing the interdependence of environmental, economic, and social factors.

The Act also emphasizes **collaborative governance**, involving:
- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**,
- Other federal ministers,
- Provincial and territorial governments,
- Aboriginal organizations,
- Coastal communities,
- And entities established under land claims agreements.

This collaborative approach is central to the development of a **national strategy for the management of estuarine, coastal, and marine ecosystems**.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Act introduces or clarifies several key legal terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Artificial Island** | Any man-made extension of the seabed, whether it breaks the water surface or not. |
| **Marine Installation or Structure** | Includes ships, offshore drilling platforms, pipelines, storage facilities, anchors, and other works, including those prescribed under regulation. |
| **Ship** | Any vessel, boat, or craft designed or capable of being used for marine navigation, regardless of propulsion method. |
| **Federal Laws** | Acts of Parliament, regulations under the Interpretation Act, and other rules of law within federal jurisdiction. Excludes laws of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. |
| **Law (in respect of a province)** | Provincial laws currently in force, excluding federal laws. |

> *Note: The 2024 repeal of a section (s. 15) is noted but not elaborated upon in the text provided.*

### **3. Territorial Sea and Internal Waters**

#### **Territorial Sea**
- Extends **12 nautical miles** from the **baseline** (low-water line along the coast or on a low-tide elevation).
- The baseline is:
  - The **low-water line** along the coast or on a **low-tide elevation** (land above water at low tide but submerged at high tide).
  - In areas where geographical coordinates are prescribed, the baseline is defined as **straight lines (geodesics)** connecting those coordinates.
  - For areas not otherwise defined, the baseline is the outer limit of any area where Canada has a **historic or sovereign title**.

> *This ensures that Canada’s territorial sea is defined with precision, including in complex or disputed coastal zones.*

#### **Internal Waters**
- The waters **on the landward side** of the territorial sea baseline.
- These waters are **fully under Canadian sovereignty** and form part of Canada’s territory.

> *For clarity, both internal waters and the territorial sea are explicitly stated to form part of Canada.*

#### **Ownership of Seabed and Subsoil**
- In areas **not within a province**, the **seabed and subsoil** below internal waters and the territorial sea are **vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This establishes federal ownership of these resources, even though provincial laws may apply in certain areas.

> *This provision ensures that the federal government retains jurisdiction over submerged lands and resources in non-provincial waters.*

---

### **4. Application of Provincial Laws**

The Act establishes a nuanced framework for when **provincial laws apply** in ocean areas:

#### **When Provincial Laws Apply**
- In areas that:
  - Are part of **internal waters** or **territorial sea** of Canada,
  - Are **not within any province**, or
  - Are **prescribed by regulation**.

> *This allows for a degree of provincial influence in marine governance, especially in coastal zones.*

#### **Limitations on Provincial Law Application**
- Provincial laws **do not apply** to provisions that:
  - Impose **taxes or royalties**, or
  - Relate to **mineral or non-living natural resources**.

> *This protects federal control over resource extraction and taxation in marine zones.*

#### **Application as if Within Province**
- Provincial laws are applied **as if the area were within the province’s territory**.
- Any sums due under such laws belong to **Her Majesty in right of the province**.

> *This prevents provinces from claiming ownership or jurisdiction over marine areas where their laws apply.*

#### **No Basis for Jurisdictional Claims**
- The Act explicitly **prevents provinces from claiming legislative jurisdiction or interest** in marine areas where provincial laws apply.
- It also **does not limit the application of federal laws**.

> *This reinforces federal supremacy in marine governance, especially in the EEZ and continental shelf.*

### **5. Contiguous Zone (24 Nautical Miles)**

- Extends **24 nautical miles** beyond the territorial sea.
- **Purpose**: Allows Canada to enforce **federal laws** related to:
  - Customs,
  - Fiscal matters,
  - Immigration,
  - Sanitary regulations.

#### **Enforcement Powers**
- A federal law enforcement officer may:
  - Prevent entry into Canada,
  - Prevent commission of an offence,
  - Exercise powers of **arrest, entry, search, and seizure**.
- These powers are **subject to Canada’s international obligations**.

> *Exception*: A power of arrest **cannot be exercised on a ship registered outside Canada** without the **consent of the Attorney General of Canada**.

> *This ensures that enforcement actions are not arbitrary and respect international law.*

---

### **6. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) – 200 Nautical Miles**

- Extends **200 nautical miles** from the baseline.
- **Sovereign Rights**:
  - To **explore, exploit, conserve, and manage** all natural resources (living and non-living) in the waters above the seabed and in the seabed and subsoil.
  - To conduct **marine scientific research**.
  - To **protect and preserve** the marine environment.

> *These rights include energy production from water, currents, and wind.*

#### **Jurisdiction and Rights**
- Canada has **jurisdiction** over:
  - Artificial islands,
  - Marine installations,
  - Scientific research,
  - Environmental protection.

> *This gives Canada broad control over marine activities in the EEZ, including energy and resource development.*

#### **Ownership of Seabed and Subsoil**
- All rights in the **seabed and subsoil** of the EEZ are **vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> *This ensures that the federal government holds legal title to these resources.*

> *No abrogation of pre-1991 rights*: Existing rights or interests established before **February 4, 1991**, are not affected.

### **7. Continental Shelf**

- The **seabed and subsoil** extending beyond the territorial sea, in the natural prolongation of Canada’s land territory.
- Extends:
  - To the **outer edge of the continental margin** (the submerged extension of land),
  - Up to **200 nautical miles** from the baseline (if the margin doesn’t reach that distance),
  - Or to lines determined by coordinates prescribed by regulation.

> *The continental margin includes the shelf, slope, and rise, but excludes deep ocean floor and oceanic ridges.*

#### **Sovereign Rights**
- Canada has **sovereign rights** to:
  - Explore and exploit **mineral and non-living natural resources** (e.g., oil, gas, minerals),
  - Harvest **sedentary living organisms** (organisms that are immobile or attached to the seabed).

> *This is distinct from the EEZ and emphasizes Canada’s rights to seabed resources.*

#### **Ownership**
- All rights in the continental shelf are **vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> *Again, pre-1991 rights are preserved.*

---

### **8. Application of Federal and Provincial Laws in Marine Zones**

#### **Federal Laws in Marine Installations and Artificial Islands**
- Federal laws apply:
  - On or under **any marine installation or structure** from the time it is anchored or attached to the continental shelf until it is removed.
  - On or under **any artificial island** built on the continental shelf.
  - Within a **safety zone** around such installations or islands (as determined by regulation).

> *Federal laws are applied as if the area were part
