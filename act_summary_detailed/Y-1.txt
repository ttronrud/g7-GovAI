The provided text consists entirely of repeated annotations indicating that **specific provisions of a statute have been repealed**. There is **no substantive content** of an actual act or regulation — only a series of "[Repealed, ...]" entries.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Text:**
- The content is a list of repeals, not a summary of an active or existing law.
- Each entry follows the format:  
  `[Repealed, Year, Chapter, Section]`  
  For example: `[Repealed, 2002, c. 1, s. 199]` means that a particular section (s. 199) of a statute (Chapter 1 of the 2002 Act) has been officially repealed.

**2. Frequency and Pattern:**
- The majority of the entries (over 90) are identical: `[Repealed, 2002, c. 1, s. 199]`.
- A few variations exist:
  - `[Repealed, 1995, c. 19, s. 14]`
  - `[Repealed, R.S., 1985, c. 24 (2nd Supp.), s. 40]`

These indicate that multiple provisions from various statutes and years have been repealed — likely across different sections or parts of a legal code.

**3. Interpretation:**
- The repeated references suggest that **a large number of provisions** in a legal framework (possibly a provincial or territorial statute, such as in Canada — given the format) were **officially removed or replaced** by a legislative amendment.
- The repeal of **s. 199 of Chapter 1 of the 2002 Act** (c. 1, s. 199) appears to be the most frequent, implying that this section was a central or commonly referenced part of a prior law that was abolished.
- The repeal of **s. 14 of Chapter 19 in 1995** and **s. 40 of a 1985 supplementary chapter** indicates that the repeal process spanned several years and affected different parts of the legal code.

**4. Legal Significance:**
- A repeal means the law is **no longer in force**.
- Repealed sections are typically removed from the current legal framework, and their provisions are **no longer enforceable**.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative reform, consolidation, or modernization effort to simplify or update the law.

**5. Conclusion:**
There is **no detailed summary of an active act** because the provided text does not contain any substantive legal provisions. Instead, it is a **list of repeals** — indicating that multiple sections of a legal code have been formally abolished.

### Final Summary:

> The provided text is not a summary of an act but rather a list of repeals. It indicates that numerous provisions — primarily section 199 of Chapter 1 of a 2002 Act, and a few others from earlier years (e.g., 1995 and 1985) — have been officially repealed. These repeals suggest that the underlying legislation has been amended, consolidated, or replaced, and the referenced sections are no longer in force. As such, there is no detailed content or legal framework to summarize — only a record of legislative removals.

If you have a specific act or section you'd like summarized (e.g., the original act that was repealed), I can provide a detailed analysis of that.
