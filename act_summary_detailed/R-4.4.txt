**Overview:**

The *Recognition of Charlottetown as the Birthplace of Confederation Act* is a legislative measure passed by the Parliament of Canada to formally recognize and affirm **Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island**, as the **birthplace of Canadian Confederation**.

**Background and Historical Context:**

- **September 1, 1864:** Leaders from the governments and legislatures of **Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick**, and the **Province of Canada** (comprising present-day Ontario and Quebec) convened in **Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island**. This meeting, known as the **Charlottetown Conference**, marked the first formal step toward the unification of British North American colonies into a single dominion.
  
- The conference established a shared vision for a **federated union** of the colonies, laying the foundational ideals of Confederation — including cooperation, self-governance, and a common defense — that would later evolve into the modern nation of Canada.

- The discussions at Charlottetown were instrumental in shaping the political framework that led to:
  - The **Quebec Conference (1864)**, which further developed the structure of Confederation.
  - The **London Conference (1866–1867)**, which finalized the details of the proposed union.
  - The eventual passage of the **Constitution Act, 1867**, which established the Dominion of Canada.

- **Province House**, the historic building where the Charlottetown Conference took place, is recognized as a **National Historic Site of Canada**. Other sites in Charlottetown are also designated for their strong association with the birth of Canada.

- In **1996**, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien issued a **Proclamation** officially recognizing Charlottetown as the birthplace of Confederation, affirming its place in Canada’s national heritage.

- On **September 1, 2014**, the 150th anniversary of the Charlottetown Conference was commemorated, reinforcing public and political awareness of its foundational role in Canadian history.
