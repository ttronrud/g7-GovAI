**Detailed Summary of the Government Annuities Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Government Annuities Act* establishes a legal framework for the government to offer annuities to individuals, couples, and certain groups (such as employees or fraternal societies) in Canada. The Act governs the issuance, terms, conditions, and financial obligations associated with annuities purchased under government sponsorship. It is designed to provide a safe, regulated, and accessible form of income for individuals—particularly those in retirement or facing financial uncertainty—while protecting the interests of both the purchaser and the government.

The Act is administered by the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, unless otherwise designated by the Governor in Council. It remains in force as a key piece of social policy related to retirement income and financial security.

## **Core Provisions and Functions**

### **1. Government as Seller of Annuities**

Her Majesty, acting through the Minister, may contract with individuals or groups to sell annuities under the following conditions:

- **For life of the annuitant**  
- **For a term of years (not exceeding 20 years), or for the life of the annuitant, whichever is shorter**  
- **For a term of years (not exceeding 20 years), or for the life of the annuitant, whichever is longer**

Annuities may also be offered to **two persons jointly**, during their **joint lives**, with or without continuation to the survivor.

> **Purpose**: Provides flexibility in retirement planning, including joint life annuities for couples.

---

### **2. Purchase of Annuities**

- A purchaser may buy an annuity by:
  - Paying a **minimum of $10** at any time, or  
  - Paying a **stipulated sum periodically** at fixed intervals.

- The **amount payable** under the annuity is **subject to the values set in official tables** (as regulated under section 13).

> **Note**: The 1980–1983 repeal of section 56 indicates that some specific provisions were removed or replaced, but the core structure remains.

---

### **3. Eligibility and Participation by Groups**

#### **(a) Fraternal, Benevolent, Religious, or Other Associations**
- Any body corporate (e.g., mutual aid societies, religious groups) may contract with the Crown to offer annuities to its members who are domiciled in Canada.
- The association may pay directly to the Minister for these annuities.

#### **(b) Employers and Employees**
- Employers may enter into agreements with employees (approved by the Minister) to offer annuities.
- These annuities are available to employees domiciled in Canada.
- Employers may fund these purchases from:
  - Employee wages alone  
  - A combination of employee and employer contributions  
  - Employer contributions alone  
- **Important**: Unless otherwise stated, funds paid by employers are held **exclusively** for the benefit of the named employee.

> **Purpose**: Encourages employer-sponsored retirement planning and financial support for workers.

---

### **4. Value Determination and Table-Based Pricing**

- All annuity contracts must be based on **official valuation tables** prepared and approved by regulations under **section 13**.
- These tables determine the **value of annuities** based on:
  - Age of the annuitant
  - Life expectancy
  - Interest rates
  - Mortality rates

> **Regulatory Flexibility**: The Governor in Council may revise, revoke, or introduce new tables, as long as they are consistent with the Act.

---

### **5. Limitations on Annuity Amounts**

- Annuities **cannot be granted** for:
  - Any person other than the actual annuitant
  - Less than **$10 per year**
- The **total annual amount** payable to any annuitant or joint annuitants **shall not exceed $1,200 per year**.

> **Purpose**: Prevents excessive financial exposure and ensures affordability and fairness.

---

### **6. Age Adjustment for Purchase Price**

- Any annuity that begins to pay **after age 85** is treated **as if it began at age 85** for purposes of determining the purchase price.
- This ensures that annuities for older individuals are not priced at a disadvantage due to age-based assumptions.

> **Impact**: Provides a level playing field for older applicants.

---

### **7. Conversion of Annuity to Spouse/Common-Law Partner**

A purchaser may apply to convert a portion of their annuity to be paid to their **spouse or common-law partner**, provided:

1. The application is made **within three months before the annuity becomes payable**  
2. The converted amount does **not exceed half** of the original annuity  
3. All requirements of the Act and applicable regulations are met  

> **Note**: The Minister has discretion to approve or deny such conversions.

> **Purpose**: Supports spousal financial security and family planning.

---

### **8. Minister’s Discretion to Refuse Contracts**

The Minister may **refuse to enter into an annuity contract** if they believe there are **sufficient grounds** for refusal (e.g., fraud, financial risk, lack of legitimacy).

> **Purpose**: Ensures integrity and prevents misuse of the annuity system.

---

### **9. Non-Transferability of Annuities**

- **No property, right, title, benefit, or interest** in an annuity contract is **transferable**, either at law or in equity.
- This means:
  - The annuity cannot be sold, gifted, or assigned to another person.
  - It remains strictly tied to the original annuitant.

> **Purpose**: Protects the integrity of the annuity and prevents fraud or exploitation.

---

### **10. Protection from Bankruptcy and Insolvency**

- The annuity and all payments or rights under the contract are **exempt from bankruptcy or insolvency laws**.
- The annuity **cannot be seized or levied upon** by any court or creditor.

> **Purpose**: Ensures retirees receive their income regardless of personal financial difficulties.

---

### **11. Fraudulent Intent and Creditor Protection**

If a purchaser applies for an annuity **with intent to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors**, then:

- Creditors may **establish such intent** in a court of competent jurisdiction.
- The Minister is authorized to **pay back** to creditors:
  - The sum paid as consideration, **plus interest at 3% per annum compounded yearly**
  - Or, if only part is needed, a portion certified by the court
- **Consequences**:
  - The annuity contract is **cancelled**
  - Or the annuity is **proportionally reduced**
  - If the annuity is already payable, the payment may be made from the **present value** of the annuity, and the contract is similarly adjusted

> **Purpose**: Prevents abuse of the annuity system to evade debts.

---

### **12. Limitation on Cancellation of Annuities**

- **No legal action** can be brought to cancel an annuity **after two years** from the date of payment.
- This provides **finality and stability** to annuity contracts once established.

> **Purpose**: Encourages long-term financial planning and protects against frivolous challenges.

---

### **13. Repayment Upon Death Before Payment**

If the annuitant or last surviving joint annuitant **dies before the annuity starts**, and money has been paid as consideration:

- The **amount paid** is **returned to the purchaser or their legal representatives**
- With **interest at 4% per annum compounded yearly**

> **Exception**: If an **express agreement** exists between the purchaser and the Minister, repayment follows that agreement.

> **Purpose**: Protects purchasers from losing their investment if the annuitant dies prematurely.

---

### **14. Payment to Purchaser After Annuitant Dies (Term-Based Annuity)**

If the annuity is payable for:
- A fixed term (e.g., 10 years), or  
- For the life of the annuitant (whichever is longer)

And the annuitant **dies before the term ends**, then:

- The remaining **unexpired portion** of the term is paid to the **purchaser or their legal representatives**

> **Exception**: If there is an **express agreement** to the contrary, the payment follows that agreement.

> **Purpose**: Ensures the purchaser benefits from the contract even if the annuitant dies early.
