**Detailed Summary of the *Fishing and Recreational Harbours Act***

---

### **1. Act Title and Purpose**
The *Fishing and Recreational Harbours Act* (hereinafter referred to as the "Act") establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the **management, regulation, development, and enforcement** of fishing and recreational harbours in Canada. The primary objective is to ensure the **safe, orderly, and sustainable use** of these facilities—particularly those serving fishing and recreational vessels—by centralizing control under the federal government while allowing for cooperation with provincial governments and private entities.

The Act applies specifically to **fishing or recreational harbours**, which are defined as any structure (e.g., wharf, pier, marina, breakwater) or facility located on or adjacent to water where accommodation or services are provided primarily for fishing or recreational vessels and their occupants.

### **11. Charges and Debts**

- All **fees or charges** for harbour use constitute a **debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This debt is **joint and several**—meaning the **owner of the vessel or goods** and any person in charge are jointly liable.
- The debt may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction or through other legal remedies.

> This ensures accountability and financial accountability for harbour usage.

---

### **12. Seizure and Detention of Vessels or Goods**

#### **Abandoned Vessels or Goods**
If an enforcement officer believes a vessel or goods:
- Impede, interfere with, or make the harbour unsafe or unusable,
they may **direct removal** to a suitable location.

If the person fails to comply or no one is in charge, the officer may **seize and remove** the vessel/goods.

> **Costs of seizure and removal** are recoverable as a debt under the Act.

#### **Seizure for Non-Compliance**
An enforcement officer may seize and detain a vessel or goods if:
- Charges are due and unpaid.
- A provision of the Act or regulations has been violated.

#### **Forfeiture Process**
- If, at the time of seizure, **no person has possession or right to possession**, the **Minister may apply to a court** for an order of **forfeiture** to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- The court may:
  - Order forfeiture if it finds no rightful owner.
  - Order return of the vessel/goods if not forfeited.

> Upon forfeiture, the Minister may **dispose of the property** as they see fit (e.g., sell, auction).

#### **Application of the Fisheries Act**
Sections 74–77 of the *Fisheries Act* apply to forfeited property **as if it were an article forfeited under subsection 72(1)**—providing enhanced legal procedures for handling such forfeitures.

#### **Alternative Disposition**
If the court determines that forfeiture is not warranted, the vessel or goods are:
