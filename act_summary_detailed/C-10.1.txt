**Detailed Summary of the Canada Prize Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Prize Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that establishes the legal framework for the **jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada in matters of prize** — that is, the seizure, adjudication, and condemnation of ships, aircraft, or goods captured during times of war or conflict. The Act provides for the legal authority of Canada to take such property as prize under international law and admiralty principles, and it ensures that these actions are conducted in accordance with established rules of maritime law and the law of nations.

Although the Act is largely historical and has been largely superseded or amended over time (notably by the repeal of certain sections in 1970), its provisions remain significant in understanding the evolution of Canada’s maritime and wartime legal powers.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**

- **Citation**: The Act is known as the *Canada Prize Act*.
- **Definition of "ship"**: The term "ship" includes vessels and boats, along with their **tackle, furniture, and apparel**. This broad definition ensures that all components of a maritime craft are considered part of the subject matter of prize jurisdiction.
- **Other terms**: Words and expressions have the same meaning as in the *Admiralty Act*, ensuring consistency with established maritime legal terminology.

> **Purpose**: Clarifies the scope of what constitutes a "prize" under Canadian law.

---

#### **2. Jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada**

> *"The Federal Court of Canada has and shall exercise, subject to this Act, jurisdiction in all matters of prize in Canada."*

- The **Federal Court of Canada** is granted **exclusive jurisdiction** over all matters involving the seizure, adjudication, and condemnation of ships, aircraft, or goods taken as prize.
- This jurisdiction applies to:
  - Seizures or captures made under the authority of **Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
  - Ships, aircraft, or goods belonging to **enemy nations**, their citizens, or persons residing in enemy territories.
  - Goods that are otherwise deemed "condemnable" as prize under international law.

> **Significance**: Establishes a centralized judicial body to handle prize cases, ensuring consistency and legal accountability in wartime seizures.

---

#### **3. Repealed Provisions (Historical Note)**

- Sections related to the appointment of **registrars, marshals, or other officers** were **repealed in 1970** (R.S., 1970, c. 10(2nd Supp.), s. 65).
- This indicates that the appointment of administrative officers was later transferred to other regulatory mechanisms or is no longer a formal part of the Act.

> **Implication**: The Act now focuses more on judicial and procedural aspects rather than administrative staffing.

#### **4. Application of UK Law (Pre-1939) to Canadian Cases**

> *"Subject to any orders or regulations made under this Act and until otherwise provided by or pursuant to any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, all Acts enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and all orders, regulations or rules made pursuant thereto, in force in the United Kingdom on the 10th day of September 1939... shall apply in Canada, mutatis mutandis, in respect of ships, aircraft or goods taken as prize under the authority of Her Majesty in right of Canada."*

- This provision is a **critical historical bridge** between British and Canadian law during wartime.
- It means that **pre-existing UK prize laws** (in force on **September 10, 1939**) are **automatically applicable in Canada** for prize cases involving ships, aircraft, or goods.
- The application is **"mutatis mutandis"** — meaning with necessary adjustments to account for differences in jurisdiction or legal systems.

> **Purpose**: Ensures continuity and legal coherence during the early years of World War II, when Canada was a dominion of the British Crown and relied on British legal traditions.

> **Extent of Application**:
> - Applies to:
>   - Seizures made under Canadian authority within Canadian waters or territorial waters.
>   - Matters relating to the taking, condemnation, or disposal of prize goods.
> - The Federal Court must exercise its prize jurisdiction **in a manner and to the same extent** as the **High Court of Justice in England** would have exercised it on that date.

> **Significance**: Reflects Canada’s status as a British dominion and the legal continuity of British maritime law during wartime.

#### **5. Restrictions on Claims for Services in Retaking Prize Property**

> *"No proceedings to enforce a claim for services rendered in retaking a ship, aircraft or goods taken by an enemy shall be instituted and no such claim shall be made or relied upon in any proceedings by way of defence or otherwise without the consent of the Attorney General of Canada."*

- This provision **prohibits private claims** (e.g., by private individuals or contractors) for compensation for services rendered in recovering a prize.
- Any such claim must be **authorized by the Attorney General of Canada**.
- Evidence of such consent may be presented via a **document signed by the Attorney General**.

> **Purpose**: Prevents exploitation of prize recovery efforts by private parties and ensures that all recovery-related financial claims are state-controlled and subject to government oversight.

> **Impact**: Reinforces the state’s monopoly over prize-related financial matters during wartime.

#### **6. Regulatory Authority of the Governor in Council**

> The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) may, **on recommendation of the Minister of Justice**, make orders or regulations to:
> - Regulate **practice and procedure** in prize cases.
> - Fix **costs, charges, and fees** for parties involved in prize proceedings.
> - Regulate **taxation** of costs awarded.
> - Fix **fees payable to the Court or its officers**.
> - Prescribe the **powers and duties** of registrars, marshals, deputies, and other officers.
> - For **other purposes** deemed necessary to implement the Act or govern prize jurisdiction.

> **Purpose**: Grants flexibility to adapt procedural rules to changing circumstances and to ensure fair and efficient administration of prize cases.

> **Note**: This power allows for the development of detailed procedural rules that can be tailored to modern needs while remaining within the framework of the Act.

#### **7. Extension of Jurisdiction via Consent from Foreign Governments or Co-Belligerents**

> **Section 8**: Where a foreign government (not Canada) or a **co-belligerent** (a nation allied with Canada) **consents** to the taking of ships, aircraft, or goods as prize under Canadian authority:
> - The **Federal Court has jurisdiction** over such property **in the same manner and to the same extent** as if the seizure occurred on the high seas and was brought into Canadian waters.
> - This includes:
>   - Seizures within the territory or territorial waters of that foreign government.
>   - Seizures of goods taken outside those waters and brought within the foreign government’s territory.

> **Section 9**: If consent is given, **any prior seizures** (before the consent was given) of such property are **deemed to have occurred with that consent**, unless explicitly excluded in the consent.

> **Section 10**: The Court may **receive evidence** from prize courts of other nations (e.g., British or allied courts) if:
> - The evidence would have been admissible in a Canadian court.
> - The seizure or matter occurred within the territory or waters of a foreign government or co-belligerent.
> - The evidence was recorded by a prize court under that government’s authority.

> **Section 11**: The Governor in Council may **authorize the Secretary of State for External Affairs** to consent on behalf of Canada to prize actions under the authority of a foreign government or co-belligerent, on terms deemed advisable.

> **Section 12**: If a foreign government or co-belligerent **undertakes to bear all expenses** related to a prize seizure:
> - The Court may **order the prize property to be held in its custody** until a prize court (under that foreign government) issues an order on release or disposal.

> **Section 13**: The Court must **recognize and give effect to** any orders or proceedings made by a prize court of a foreign government or co-belligerent regarding the release or disposal of such property.

> **Section 14**: The Court may **receive and record evidence** in prize matters involving foreign governments or co-belligerents **if application is made** on their behalf.

> **Section 15**: **Notice of consent** (under Sections 8 or 9) must be published in the *Canada Gazette* by proclamation.
> - Such proclamation is **conclusive evidence** of the consent and its terms.

> **Purpose**: Enables Canada to engage in **international cooperation** in wartime prize operations, particularly during conflicts involving allied or neutral nations.

> **Legal Effect**: Expands the reach of Canadian prize jurisdiction beyond Canadian waters through **consensual international agreements**.

#### **8. Re-enactment of Pre-1945 Rules**

> *"General orders and rules in force immediately prior to the 18th day of December 1945 in respect of the exercise of jurisdiction in prize by the Court and the practice and procedure therein are, except in so far as they are inconsistent with this Act or orders or regulations made under this Act, deemed to have been re-enacted under this Act on the 18th day of December 1945, and shall govern the exercise by the Court of
