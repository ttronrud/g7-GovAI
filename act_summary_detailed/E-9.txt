### **Detailed Summary of the *Energy Supplies Emergency Act***  

The **Energy Supplies Emergency Act** is a federal statute enacted in Canada to establish a legal and operational framework for managing national emergencies related to shortages or disruptions in the supply of petroleum and petroleum products. The Act provides the authority for the government to implement **mandatory allocation programs** and **rationing programs** during periods of national emergency, ensuring that essential energy supplies are preserved, distributed equitably, and used efficiently to protect national security, economic stability, and public welfare.

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope of the Act**

The primary purpose of the Act is to **respond to emergencies involving petroleum supply shortages or market disturbances** that threaten Canada’s national security, economic stability, or public welfare. It enables the government to:

- Control and allocate supplies of petroleum and related products;
- Prevent wasteful or non-essential use;
- Ensure equitable distribution during times of scarcity;
- Coordinate with international bodies and provincial authorities;
- Provide legal protections for officials and institutions acting under emergency measures.

The Act applies specifically to **petroleum and petroleum products**, including crude oil, refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel), natural gas derivatives, and certain alternative fuels like natural gas or coal-based fuels.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Board** | The *Energy Supplies Allocation Board*, established under the Act to oversee emergency energy allocation. Composed of a Chairperson (Deputy Minister of Natural Resources) and up to six other members appointed by the Governor in Council. |
| **Controlled Product** | Any product whose supply is subject to mandatory allocation under a program established under Part I. Includes petroleum and derived products. |
| **Mandatory Allocation Program** | A government-led program that controls how suppliers distribute petroleum products to wholesale customers, setting priorities and allocation rules. |
| **Rationing Program** | A mandatory allocation program that is formally converted into a rationing regime under Section 29, typically when supply is critically low. |
| **Supplier** | Any entity (importer, refiner, distributor, terminal operator, broker, etc.) supplying a controlled product in bulk at any level of distribution. |
| **Wholesale Customer** | Any entity purchasing a controlled product in bulk, including provinces, public utilities, transportation operators, and large industrial users. |
| **Large Volume User** | A person or group designated by the Governor in Council as a significant consumer of a controlled product; such users are treated as wholesale customers for retail purchases. |

> **Note:** The Act defines "regulation" broadly to include orders issued by the Board under its powers, as well as directives from the Governor in Council or the Board, all of which are treated as *statutory instruments* under the *Statutory Instruments Act*.

## **3. Establishment and Structure of the Energy Supplies Allocation Board**

- **Composition**:
  - Chairperson: The **Deputy Minister of Natural Resources**.
  - Up to **six other members**, appointed by the **Governor in Council** for a term at the Governor’s pleasure.
  - Members receive **remuneration and reasonable travel/living expenses**.

- **Support Staff**:
  - The Board may appoint officers and employees under the *Public Service Employment Act*.

- **Government Support**:
  - The Governor in Council may **second officers or services** from any federal department or agency to the Board for specific periods.
  - The Board may **seek advice** from any federal department or agency, subject to privacy and confidentiality rules.

  - The Chairperson is the **chief executive officer** and presides over meetings.
  - A **Vice-Chairperson** may be designated to step in if the Chairperson is absent or incapacitated.

- **Legal Status**:
  - Board members and temporary staff are considered **public servants** in federal administration.
  - However, those engaged under Section 5(2) (technical experts) are **not considered part of the public service** for employment purposes.

- **By-Laws and Delegation**:
  - The Board may adopt **by-laws** to govern internal operations.
  - It may delegate powers to individual members or senior officers (except those involving regulation or order-making).

## **4. Powers and Duties of the Board**

The Board is empowered to perform a wide range of functions to ensure effective emergency management:

### **Core Responsibilities:**
- **Study and monitor international petroleum markets** and report findings to the Minister of Natural Resources.
- **Develop and maintain contingency plans** even when no emergency is active.
- **Report regularly** to the Minister of Natural Resources and to Parliament.

### **Reporting Requirements:**
- During any period of a mandatory or rationing program, the Board must submit **monthly written reports** to the Minister.
- These reports must be **laid before Parliament** immediately upon being made or within the first 15 days after Parliament resumes sitting.

### **International Engagement:**
- Canada’s representative on the **International Energy Agency (IEA) Standing Group on Emergency Questions** must be an official of the Board or the Department of Natural Resources.
- This representative is **accountable to both the Chairperson and the Minister**.

---

## **5. Declaration of National Emergency**

The **Governor in Council** may declare a **national emergency** if:

- There are **actual or anticipated shortages** of petroleum or significant market disturbances.
- These shortages or disturbances **threaten national security, welfare, or economic stability**.

Upon declaration:
- The Governor in Council issues an **order** establishing a **mandatory allocation program**.
- This order becomes effective **immediately upon issuance**.
- A **motion for confirmation** must be laid before **each House of Parliament** and considered under **Section 46** (a parliamentary procedure for confirming emergency measures).

> **Note:** The declaration is not permanent; it can be revoked, and if so, the mandatory allocation program **immediately terminates**, though prior actions remain valid.

---

## **6. Mandatory Allocation Program – Key Components**

Once a mandatory allocation program is established, the Board must create a detailed plan that includes:

1. **Geographic Scope**:
   - Specifies regions where the program applies (or whether it covers the entire country).

2. **Products Covered**:
   - Lists which petroleum products are subject to allocation (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel).

3. **Priorities of Use or Supply**:
   - Establishes a hierarchy (e.g., essential services like hospitals, transportation, heating) for allocating supplies.

4. **Allocation System**:
   - Outlines the method by which supplies are distributed (e.g., based on volume, need, or regional demand).

The program comes into force on a date set by the Governor in Council via order and terminates as per **Section 44**.

---

## **7. Amendments to the Mandatory Allocation Program**

The Governor in Council may amend the program by:

- Extending or reducing its geographic reach (e.g., expanding to new provinces or excluding certain areas);
- Adding or removing specific petroleum products;
- Changing priority rankings or allocation systems;
- Adding **alternative fuels** (e.g., natural gas, coal-based fuels) to the program.

> **Note:** The addition of alternative fuels is treated **as if they were petroleum products** for the purposes of allocation.

---

## **8. Alternative Fuel Management**

Two pathways exist for managing alternative fuels:

### **Option 1: Centralized Regulation**
- The Board may **add alternative fuels** to the mandatory allocation program.
- The Act applies to these fuels as if they were petroleum products.

### **Option 2: Provincial Cooperation**
- With **Governor in Council approval**, the Board may enter into **agreements with provincial authorities**:
  - To regulate the **allocation and pricing** of alternative fuels **within provinces**.
  - To reduce demand on domestic petroleum supplies by managing energy use in sectors like electricity generation.

### **Electric Power Regulation**
- With approval, the Board may also enter into arrangements to:
  - Regulate **electric power supply and pricing** in provinces.
  - Reduce the demand for petroleum-based energy (e.g., in industrial or transportation sectors).
