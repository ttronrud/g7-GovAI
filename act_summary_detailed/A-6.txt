### **Detailed Summary of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context (Whereas Clauses)**

The **Agricultural Products Marketing Act** is introduced with four key objectives:

- **To improve marketing methods** for agricultural products across Canada, addressing inefficiencies and inconsistencies in how these products are sold and distributed.
- To **recognize existing provincial legislation**, noting that several provinces have already established rules governing the local marketing of agricultural products.
- To **promote national cooperation** by creating a unified framework for interprovincial and export trade in agricultural products—ensuring consistency and fairness across provincial boundaries.
- To **facilitate equitable distribution of marketing revenues** by allowing the imposition of levies or charges that can be used to equalize income among producers, especially when prices fluctuate due to market conditions.

This Act thus serves as a federal mechanism to harmonize and strengthen the marketing system of Canadian agricultural goods beyond provincial limits.

#### **2. Name of the Act**

The Act is officially titled:  
**The Agricultural Products Marketing Act**  
(For citation purposes)

---

#### **3. Definition of "Agricultural Product"**

- The term **"agricultural product"** is broadly defined to include **wood**.
- This broad definition ensures that not only traditional crops (like grains, fruits, and livestock) but also forestry products fall under the scope of the Act, enabling a more comprehensive approach to agricultural marketing.

> *Note: Including wood is significant because it reflects the importance of the forestry sector in Canada’s agricultural economy and allows for coordinated marketing strategies in timber and wood products.*

---

#### **4. Granting Authority to Provincial Boards and Agencies**

**Section 2 (Power to Grant Interprovincial and Export Authority)**

The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting on advice of ministers) may, by **order**, grant authority to any **provincial board or agency** that already regulates local agricultural marketing to:

- Regulate the **marketing of agricultural products in interprovincial and export trade**.
- Exercise **all or any powers** similar to those it currently holds for local marketing within the province.

This enables provincial bodies (e.g., grain boards, dairy commissions, or forestry marketing agencies) to extend their regulatory reach beyond provincial borders, ensuring continuity and consistency in market operations.

> *Example:* A provincial grain marketing board could now manage the sale of wheat from Ontario to British Columbia or export to the U.S., using the same standards and oversight as it does domestically.

---

#### **5. Authority to Impose Levies or Charges**

Under **subsection (2)**, the Governor in Council may grant additional powers to such boards or agencies to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from producers or marketers of agricultural products.
- Classify individuals or businesses into **different groups** (e.g., small farmers vs. large cooperatives).
- Set **different levies or charges** based on group classification—ensuring fairness and equity.
- Use these levies for:
  - Creation of **reserves** (e.g., to stabilize prices during downturns),
  - Payment of **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of agricultural products,
  - **Equalization or adjustment** of revenues among producers—especially when some producers benefit more than others due to market volatility.

> *Key Purpose:* This mechanism helps prevent unfair advantages and ensures that producers who may be disadvantaged by market fluctuations (e.g., poor harvests or low demand) receive financial support through redistribution.

---

#### **6. Legal Status of Levies and Charges**

- Levies or charges imposed under this Act are **treated as debts**.
- They are **enforceable in court**—meaning the board or agency can sue for recovery if payments are not made.
- This gives the bodies legal standing to collect funds and ensures accountability.

> *Implication:* This strengthens the financial foundation of provincial marketing agencies, allowing them to operate effectively in national and international markets.

---

#### **7. Revocation of Authority**

- The **Governor in Council may revoke any authority** granted under this Act at any time.
- This provides **flexibility and oversight**, allowing the federal government to adjust or terminate powers if needed—e.g., due to economic shifts, disputes, or inefficiencies.

---

#### **8. Regulatory Powers**

- The Governor in Council may make **regulations** to:
  - Specify the **terms and conditions** for granting or revoking authority under Section 2.
  - Provide general guidance on how the Act is to be implemented.
- These regulations are essential for operational clarity and enforcement.

> *Example:* Regulations might define how levy rates are calculated, what constitutes a "producer," or how disputes over classification are resolved.

---

#### **9. Offences and Penalties**

- Any person who **violates a regulation**, or an order, rule, or regulation made by a board or agency under this Act in relation to interprovincial or export marketing is guilty of an **offence**.
- Penalties include:
  - A **fine of up to $500**, or
  - **Imprisonment for up to three months**, or
  - Both.

> *Note:* The penalties are relatively modest, reflecting the nature of administrative compliance rather than criminal intent. However, they provide a deterrent against non-compliance.

---

#### **10. Interpretation in Prosecutions**

- In any prosecution under this Act, the act or omission in question is **presumed to relate to interprovincial or export marketing**, unless the accused can prove otherwise.
- This ensures that enforcement focuses on the intended scope of the Act—marketing beyond provincial borders.

---

#### **11. Legal Continuity (For Greater Certainty)**

- All **orders made by the Governor in Council before the coming into force of this Act** under Section 2 of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* (prior to this legislation) are deemed:
  - **Validly made**,
  - And continue to have **full legal force and effect** until revoked.
- All actions taken before the Act came into force under those orders are also deemed **valid**.

> *Purpose:* This provision ensures **legal stability and continuity**. It prevents disruption in ongoing marketing operations and protects the rights and obligations of producers and agencies that were operating under prior authority.

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The Act **does not regulate production or farming practices**—only marketing.
- It relies on **provincial bodies** to implement and enforce provisions, so effectiveness depends on their capacity and transparency.
- The **levy system** may be criticized as potentially creating financial burdens on small producers if not carefully designed.
- There is **no explicit oversight mechanism** to ensure that levies are used solely for equalization and not for profit or political purposes.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Agricultural Products Marketing Act** is a foundational piece of federal legislation designed to harmonize and strengthen the national marketing system for agricultural products. By empowering provincial boards and agencies to regulate interprovincial and export trade and to impose levies for equalizing producer incomes, it promotes stability, fairness, and economic resilience in Canada’s agricultural sector. The inclusion of wood and the emphasis on legal continuity ensure that the Act is both practical and forward-looking, supporting a robust and adaptable system for Canada’s diverse agricultural economy.
