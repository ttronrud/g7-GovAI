**Detailed Summary of the *Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation and Offshore Renewable Energy Management Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation and Offshore Renewable Energy Management Act* (the "Act") is a comprehensive legislative framework that establishes the legal and regulatory structure for managing **offshore petroleum and renewable energy activities** in the shared offshore area between Canada and Nova Scotia. It implements the long-standing **Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord (the "Accord")** of 1986 and introduces a modern, balanced approach to managing both traditional oil and gas development and emerging offshore renewable energy projects.

The Act establishes a joint regulatory body—the **Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator (the "Regulator")**—to oversee activities in the offshore area, ensuring equitable governance, transparency, and accountability between federal and provincial authorities. Importantly, the Act also **excludes offshore renewable energy resources from the scope of the original Accord**, recognizing them as a distinct and evolving sector.

## **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

### **1. Definitions and Scope**

#### **Offshore Area**
- Defined in **Schedule I** as the lands and submarine areas within specific geographic boundaries.
- The Federal Government may, by regulation, **amend or update the boundaries** of the offshore area (subject to section 6).
- Charts issued by the Federal Minister are **conclusive evidence** of the offshore area's limits, without requiring proof of signature or authority.

#### **Bay of Fundy and Sable Island**
- **Bay of Fundy** refers to submarine areas within the limits in **Schedule II**.
- **Sable Island** includes all areas above or below water within the limits in **Schedule III**.
- These areas are specifically designated for environmental and jurisdictional clarity.

#### **Offshore Renewable Energy Project**
Defined broadly to include:
- Research or assessment of renewable energy resources (excluding government or educational institutions),
- Exploitation of renewable resources (e.g., wind, wave, tidal),
- Storage of energy products derived from renewables,
- Transmission of such energy products.

> This definition reflects a forward-looking policy to support the transition to clean energy while maintaining regulatory clarity.

#### **Petroleum and Gas**
- **Petroleum** = oil or gas.
- **Oil** = crude oil (by weight or gravity) and hydrocarbons from oil sands, bitumen, shale, or seabed deposits.
- **Gas** = natural gas and associated substances, *excluding* coal-bed methane from coal mines.

#### **Field and Pool**
- A **field** is a surface area underlain by one or more **pools** (natural underground reservoirs of petroleum).
- Pools are defined as accumulations of petroleum separated from other such accumulations.

#### **Abandoned Facility**
- Refers to pipelines, installations, equipment, or systems abandoned in accordance with an authorization under **Part III** of the Act.

### **2. The Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator (Regulator)**

#### **Establishment**
- Created jointly by **this Act** and the **Provincial Act** (Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation (Nova Scotia) Act).
- The Regulator operates as a **corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act**, with full legal powers and capacities, including those under the *Interpretation Act* (e.g., capacity to enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued).

#### **Composition**
- **Five members** total:
  - **Two appointed by the Federal Government** (Minister of Natural Resources),
  - **Two appointed by the Provincial Government** (Minister responsible for offshore energy),
  - **One Chairperson appointed jointly** by both governments.
- Each government may appoint **one alternate member** to serve in the absence or incapacity of a member.

> *Note: Section 115 (repealed in 2024) previously included a board; it is now obsolete.*

#### **Term of Office**
- Members serve **six-year terms**.
- Reappointment is allowed after expiration.
- Chairperson may serve multiple terms.

#### **Public Servants and Conflict of Interest**
- **No more than two members** may be public servants (civil servants), and **only one** per government.
- Of those two public servants, **only one may be appointed by each government**.
- The **Chairperson must not be a public servant** during their term.
- All members are subject to **jointly established conflict of interest guidelines** by the Federal and Provincial Ministers.
- Public servants hold office at the **pleasure of the government**; non-public servants serve during **good behaviour** and may be removed "for cause."

#### **Appointment of Chairperson**
- Consultation begins **six months before the incumbent Chairperson's term ends**, or upon notice of death, resignation, or termination—whichever comes first.
- If the two governments fail to agree within **three months**, a **panel** (as per section 47) selects the Chairperson within **60 days**.
- The panel’s decision is **final and binding** on both governments.
- During absence or incapacity, a designated member acts as Chairperson with full powers.

#### **Salary and Conditions**
- Salaries and terms of appointment for members appointed by **both governments** are set by **joint orders** from the Federal and Provincial Governments.
- Members appointed by either government must have their terms agreed upon by **both governments**.
- All appointments and conditions are subject to **prescribed terms and conditions**.

#### **Indemnification**
- The **Government of Canada** indemnifies members, officers, and employees of the Regulator against **reasonable costs, claims, or expenses** arising from civil, criminal, or administrative actions related to their duties.
- If the **Province** has already indemnified a person under its Provincial Act, the **Federal Government pays half** of the indemnity.
- All indemnity payments are made from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.

### **3. Regulatory and Governance Framework**

#### **Federal-Provincial Consultation**
- Before making regulations under numerous provisions (e.g., development plans, environmental standards, spill response), the **Federal Minister must consult the Provincial Minister**.
- The regulation **cannot be enacted without the Provincial Minister’s approval**.
- In cases involving **occupational health and safety**, the Federal Minister must also consult the **Provincial Minister responsible for OH&S**.

> This ensures **cooperative governance** and prevents unilateral regulatory action.

#### **Precedence of This Act**
- In case of conflict between this Act and any other federal or provincial law, **this Act and its regulations take precedence**.
- This provides **clear jurisdictional clarity** in overlapping areas.

#### **Exclusion of Certain Laws**
- The **Canada Petroleum Resources Act**, **Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act**, and **Part 5 of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act** **do not apply** within the offshore area.
- This allows the Act to establish a **distinct regulatory regime** tailored to the offshore context.

### **4. Fundamental Decisions and Offshore Renewable Energy Recommendations**

#### **Fundamental Decisions**
- A "fundamental decision" is any regulatory decision that:
  - Involves the exercise of a power or performance of a duty under this Act,
  - Is subject to **sections 32 to 37** (which likely include environmental, public interest, or procedural safeguards).
- These decisions require **procedural fairness**, public consultation, and review.

#### **Offshore Renewable Energy Recommendations**
- The Regulator may issue **recommendations** (not binding) on proposed amendments to:
  - This Act,
  - The Provincial Act,
  - Regulations made under them,
  - Other relevant legislation.
- These recommendations are subject to **sections 38.1 to 38.3**, which likely include environmental, public interest, or procedural standards.

> This enables proactive policy development in the renewable energy space.

### **5. Indigenous Peoples of Canada**

- The Government of Canada (and Nova Scotia) may **consult with Indigenous peoples** regarding potential adverse impacts of offshore activities on **existing Aboriginal and treaty rights** under **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**.
- The Regulator may **accommodate adverse impacts** on these rights if appropriate.
- This reflects Canada’s commitment to **Indigenous rights and reconciliation** in resource development.

---

### **6. Information Access and Disclosure**

- The **Federal and Provincial Ministers** have **unrestricted access** to all information or documentation related to petroleum or renewable energy activities in the offshore area.
- Such information may be **disclosed to either Minister without consent** from the provider.
- **Section 122** (likely related to disclosure rules) applies **with modifications** to ensure that disclosures made by Ministers are treated as if they were related to the enforcement of the Provincial Act.

> This ensures transparency and enables effective oversight by both governments.

---

### **7. Application and Jurisdiction**

- The Act applies **within the offshore area**, as defined in Schedule I.
- It **does not apply to offshore renewable energy resources**, which are explicitly excluded from the Accord.
- This allows for **separate regulatory pathways** for oil/gas and renewable energy.

> This distinction is crucial for policy flexibility and innovation in clean energy.
