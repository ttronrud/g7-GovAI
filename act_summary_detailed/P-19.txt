|------|-----------|
| **Apply (in relation to a mark)** | Includes any application, attachment, use, or placement of a mark on an article, anything attached to it, or anything to which the article is attached. It also includes use that leads a reasonable person to believe the mark is intended to be on the article. |

| **Commissioner** | The Commissioner of Competition appointed under the *Competition Act*. Responsible for overseeing enforcement and issuing orders. |

#### **3. Prohibitions on Unauthorized Marking**

> **Section 3 (Prohibition on Unauthorized Application of Marks)**  
> Except as authorized by this Act, **no dealer may apply a mark** to an article — or bring such an article into Canada — that **suggests or implies** the article is a precious metal article.

- This provision prevents false or misleading representations.
- The prohibition applies even if the article is not actually made of a precious metal.
- The goal is to avoid consumer deception regarding the nature, value, or composition of items.

#### **4. Authorization for Quality Marks**

> **Section 4 (Permitted Use of Quality Marks)**  
> A **quality mark may be applied** to a precious metal article **only if**:
1. The actual precious metal content and quality meet standards set in the regulations for that metal.
2. The mark is **authorized by regulation** for use with that specific precious metal.
3. The mark is applied in a manner authorized by regulation.
4. If the article is **hallmarked under UK law** or has a **foreign government-authorized mark** that correctly indicates its quality, then subsection (3) does not apply — meaning the quality mark can be applied under sections (1) and (2).

> **Additional Permitted Marks**  
> A quality-marked article may also bear:
- Numerals identifying the article or pattern (not misleading),
- The name or initials of the dealer,
- Any other mark that does **not mislead or deceive**.

> **National Mark (Maple Leaf "C")**  
> For articles **wholly manufactured in Canada** that:
- Are composed of a precious metal of a quality prescribed in regulations,
- Have a quality mark applied in accordance with Section 4,
A **national mark** — a maple leaf surrounded by the letter “C” — **may be applied** by a dealer authorized under an order from the Commissioner.

- The Commissioner may issue such authorizations.
- The national mark serves as a Canadian origin indicator and promotes domestic manufacturing.
