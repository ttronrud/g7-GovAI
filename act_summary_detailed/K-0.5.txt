### **Detailed Summary of the Kanesatake Interim Land Base Governance Act**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose**

The *Kanesatake Interim Land Base Governance Act* (the "Act") was enacted on **June 14, 2001**, by Her Majesty in right of Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons. It serves as a legal framework to implement the **Agreement with respect to Kanesatake Governance of the Interim Land Base**, signed on December 21, 2000, and tabled in Parliament on March 27, 2001.

**Primary Objectives of the Act:**
- To establish that certain lands within the Kanesatake Mohawk interim land base are **"lands reserved for the Indians" under Class 24 of Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867**, but **not classified as reserves under the Indian Act**.
- To provide a **legal framework for the Mohawks of Kanesatake** to exercise jurisdiction over the use and development of these lands.
- To promote **harmonious development** of the Kanesatake Mohawk neighbouring lands and adjacent areas in the Municipality of Oka.

#### **3. Constitutional and Jurisdictional Status**

- The Act affirms that the lands in the interim land base (excluding Doncaster Reserve No. 17) are:
  - **Reserved for Indians** under **Class 24 of Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867** (which grants federal power to make laws about Indian reserves).
  - **Not reserves under the Indian Act**, meaning they do not fall under the traditional definition of a reserve as defined in the Indian Act.

> This distinction is crucial: it grants the Mohawks of Kanesatake **autonomy over land use and governance** without triggering the full suite of rights and obligations tied to the Indian Act.

---

#### **4. Legal Capacity of the Mohawks of Kanesatake**

The Mohawks of Kanesatake are recognized as having the **capacity of a natural person**, enabling them to:
- Acquire and hold property
- Enter into contracts and agreements
- Borrow and invest money
- Be parties in legal proceedings
- Exercise other rights and privileges necessary for self-governance

> This capacity is foundational to their ability to govern independently.

---

#### **5. Governance Through the Council**

All jurisdiction and powers under the Act are exercised **through the Council**, which acts as the governing body for the Mohawks of Kanesatake.

---

#### **6. Jurisdiction Over Land Use and Development**

The Council has **exclusive jurisdiction** to make laws governing the use and development of the interim land base, including matters such as:

- Health and quality of life of residents  
- Protection and management of wildlife and fish  
- Law and order, prevention of disorderly conduct and nuisances  
- Prevention of trespass and unauthorized occupation  
- Residency rules  
- Fire safety and fire protection services  
- Construction, maintenance, and management of local infrastructure (e.g., water supplies)  
- Zoning regulations  
- Waste management and public sanitation  
- Traffic regulation  

> **Important Limitation**: This jurisdiction **does not extend** to matters under **Class 27 of Section 91** (e.g., property, civil rights, or labour relations), nor does it cover labour relations or working conditions.

---

#### **7. Enforcement Powers**

- The Council may create **offences punishable on summary conviction**.
- Sanctions include:
  - Orders
  - Fines
  - Imprisonment (limited to the maximum allowed under **section 787(1) of the Criminal Code**)
  - Restorative justice measures (prioritizing healing over punishment)

> **Note**: Fines and imprisonment are capped to avoid exceeding federal criminal code limits.

---

#### **8. Land Governance Code**

Before exercising any jurisdiction, the Mohawks of Kanesatake must adopt a **Land Governance Code** that establishes:

1. **Processes for law-making**:
   - Preparation, enactment, and publication of Kanesatake Mohawk laws  
2. **Land use assessment and approval processes**:
   - Review and approval of proposed developments  
3. **Accountability mechanisms**:
   - Conflict of interest rules  
   - Transparency and accountability to band members  
4. **Appeal and redress rights**:
   - Right to appeal decisions made by the Council  
5. **Amendment procedures**:
   - A clear process for updating or revising the code  

> The **Statutory Instruments Act does not apply** to either the land governance code or Kanesatake Mohawk laws.

#### **9. Land Use Planning and Environmental Standards**

A **land use plan** must be adopted before any development is approved that could:
- Result in environmental harm  
- Involve storage or transport of dangerous materials  
- Involve waste disposal  

> **Environmental Protection Principles**:
- If federal laws lack standards, the land use law must align with **provincial standards**.
- The Act **does not require environmental assessment**.
- The Mohawks may set **stricter standards than provincial ones**.
- **No changes** to land use or structures on Kanesatake Mohawk neighbouring lands may occur **without prior approval** unless consistent with the land use standards in **Schedule B to the Agreement**.

> **Harmonization Arrangement with Municipality of Oka**:
- If the Mohawks wish to introduce a land use or standard **significantly different** from those in Schedule B, they must enter into a **harmonization arrangement** with the Municipality of Oka.
- The arrangement must:
  - Define reciprocal obligations for land use harmonization  
  - Establish a dispute resolution process (e.g., arbitration)  
  - Set criteria for compatibility between Mohawk laws and municipal by-laws  

> **Exception**: If the Municipality of Oka amends its by-law to allow a significantly different land use **without being legally required to do so**, then subsection 10(1) does **not apply**.

> **Right to Override**: The Council may make a law despite the harmonization arrangement **if** the Municipality:
- Amends or repeals a by-law in breach of the agreement, or  
- Condones a violation that significantly harms rights of residents on neighbouring lands.

> **Conditions for Appointment of Justices of the Peace**:

  - Jurisdiction and qualifications  
  - Independence, impartiality, financial security, and tenure  
  - Supervision mechanisms  
  - Right to appeal  
  - Relationship with the existing justice system  

> This ensures that the new judicial body operates within constitutional and legal safeguards.

---

#### **12. Precedence of Kanesatake Mohawk Laws**

- **Provincial laws** that conflict with this Act or a Kanesatake Mohawk law are **invalid to the extent of the conflict**.
- **Federal laws** take precedence over Kanesatake Mohawk laws in case of conflict.
- In legal proceedings, a **certified copy of a Kanesatake Mohawk law** (by a duly authorized officer of the Council) is **evidence of enactment** — no further proof of signature or official status is required.

---

#### **13. Amendments to the Land Base**

- The **Governor in Council** (federal government) may, by order, **add new lands** to the interim land base if the Mohawks and the Government agree.
