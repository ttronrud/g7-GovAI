### **2. Designation of Lockdown Regions (Section 3)**

- The **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, may designate a region as a **lockdown region**.
- The Minister can only recommend such a designation if:
  - It is in the **public interest**; and
  - The lockdown order (as defined) applies in the region for **at least 14 consecutive days** (or a lower number if set by regulation).
- The **benefit period** begins on the **Sunday** when the lockdown order starts and ends on the **Saturday** when it ends.
- This ensures alignment between the start/end of public health restrictions and the eligibility window for the benefit.

### **3. Eligibility Criteria (Section 4)**

To qualify for the lockdown benefit in a given week, a person must meet **all of the following conditions**:

#### **(a) Basic Requirements**
- Has a **valid Social Insurance Number (SIN)**.

- **Had a 50% or greater reduction** in their average weekly employment or self-employment income compared to:
  - 2020 (for 2021 applications), or
  - 2020 or 2021 (for 2022 applications)

No other income may have been received during the week from:
- Maternity/parenting/adoption allowances

- Quitted employment or voluntarily stopped working unless it was **reasonable** to do so;
- Failed to return to work when requested by employer;
- Failed to resume self-employment when reasonable;
- Declined a reasonable offer to work during the week.

> This prevents fraud or abuse of the system by individuals who chose to leave work for personal reasons.

#### **(f) No Quarantine or Isolation (with exceptions)**
- The person must **not have been required to quarantine or isolate** upon entering Canada due to a public health order **during the week**, unless:

### **4. Exclusions and Disqualifications**

- **Refusal to be vaccinated** against COVID-19 is a **disqualifying factor**:
  - A person who lost income because they refused vaccination is **not eligible**.
  - Such refusal is **not considered a reasonable excuse** for quitting work or failing to return to employment.

> This reflects the government's stance that public health compliance is a condition of eligibility.

---

### **5. Application Process (Section 5)**

- Any eligible person may apply **in the form and manner established by the Minister**.
- Applications must be submitted **within 60 days** of the end of the week for which the benefit is claimed.

- If a person has previously received a lockdown benefit, they **do not need to attest to income** from that prior benefit.

> *The Minister may request additional information or documentation to verify claims.*

### **6. Payment of the Benefit (Section 6)**

- The **amount of the lockdown benefit is $300 per week**.
- Payments are made **only to those who are eligible** and have submitted a valid application.
- The benefit is **not subject to**:
  - Bankruptcy or insolvency laws
  - Assignment, charging, or garnishment
  - Deduction or set-off under any other Act (except this Act)
  - Garnishment under the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act*

> This ensures the benefit remains accessible and protected from external financial claims.

### **7. Regulatory Authority (Section 7)**

The **Governor in Council** may, by regulation:
- Amend the definition of "lockdown order"
- Fix a **lower number of days** for the 14-day threshold (e.g., 10 days)
