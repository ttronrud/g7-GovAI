**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Belt Water Act***  
*(British Columbia, enacted in 1927, now largely repealed or superseded)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Railway Belt Water Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian water law enacted in 1927 to regulate the use, ownership, and administration of water resources within a specific geographic area—the **Railway Belt**—in British Columbia. This area was historically designated for the construction of the **Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)** and remains a unique legal jurisdiction due to its special status under federal land tenure and water rights principles.

The Act establishes that **the Crown (specifically the Government of Canada)** holds **absolute, undivided ownership and control** over all water in the Railway Belt, subject to certain exceptions and historical rights. It also creates a framework for managing water use through provincial administrative mechanisms, while preserving the validity of pre-existing rights and applications.

Although the Act is now largely **repealed or superseded** by modern environmental and water legislation (especially post-1960s), it remains historically significant for understanding the evolution of water rights in Canada, particularly in relation to federal land grants and indigenous rights.

## **Key Definitions and Key Provisions**

---

### **1. Definition of Key Terms**

- **Board**: Refers to the tribunal established under the *Water Acts* of British Columbia, known as the **Board of Investigation**. It has jurisdiction over disputes and adjudications related to water rights in the Railway Belt.

- **Domestic purposes**: Includes household, sanitary, fire protection, and watering livestock. These are protected rights for riparian proprietors.

- **Minister**: The **Minister of the Interior** (a federal minister at the time), responsible for overseeing land and water administration in the Railway Belt.

- **Railway Belt**: Lands on the mainland of British Columbia granted to the Crown (Canada) by **Chapter 14 of the BC Statutes of 1884** for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.  
  → *Excludes* any reserves or areas designated as **Dominion Parks**.

- **Riparian proprietor**: A person lawfully occupying land adjacent to a watercourse within the Railway Belt. Has certain rights, especially for domestic use.

- **Water Acts**: Includes:
  - The original *Water Act of British Columbia* (1924, Chapter 271)
  - Its 1925 amendment (Chapter 61)
  - Any future provincial legislation made applicable to the Railway Belt under **Section 6** of this Act.

- **Watercourse**: All natural sources of water—rivers, lakes, creeks, springs, streams, ravines, gulches, and even dry channels that may contain water—regardless of whether they are currently flowing.

### **2. Crown Ownership of Water (Core Principle)**

> *"The property in and the right to the use of all the water at any time in any watercourse within the Railway Belt shall, for all purposes, be deemed to be vested in the Crown, unless and until and except only so far as some private right therein or in the use thereof inconsistent with the right of the Crown has been or may be lawfully established."*

- **Fundamental Principle**: Water in the Railway Belt is **owned by the Crown (Government of Canada)**.
- This ownership is **absolute and not divisible**—no private individual or entity can claim ownership of watercourses or their beds/shores unless a private right is lawfully established and recognized.
- Exceptions: Only **private rights inconsistent with Crown rights** may exist, and even then, they are limited and must be legally proven.

> This principle reflects a **federalized, public ownership model** of water, common in early 20th-century Canada, especially in areas tied to infrastructure projects like railways.

---

### **3. Prohibition of Exclusive Water Rights in New Grants**

> *"No grant made after June 6, 1913, by the Crown of lands in the Railway Belt... shall vest in the grantee any exclusive or other right, title or privilege in, to or in respect of any watercourse, or in, to or in respect of the bed or shores of any watercourse, unless and except in so far as any right, title or privilege to the bed or shores of any watercourse is expressly set out and described in such grant."*

- Grants of land after **June 6, 1913**, cannot confer **exclusive rights to water** (e.g., for irrigation or industrial use).
- Only **explicitly stated rights** to the **bed or shores** of a watercourse are recognized.
- This prevents private landowners from gaining control over water resources through land grants—protecting the Crown’s overarching water rights.

> This provision is a **critical safeguard** against privatization of water in a public domain.

---

### **4. Validity of Pre-1913 Water Rights and Applications**

> *"All records, grants, licenses, orders in council, or contracts... granted on or before June 6, 1913... shall be and be deemed to be valid and effective and shall be given effect to."*

- All **pre-existing rights, licenses, or applications** made before **June 6, 1913**, are **preserved and recognized**.
- These include:
  - Grants from the Government of Canada
  - Licenses or claims made by individuals or authorities
  - Applications to the Minister or provincial bodies

> This ensures **legal continuity** and prevents retroactive invalidation of long-standing water rights.

---

### **5. Provincial Administration of Water (with Federal Oversight)**

> *"All water within the Railway Belt shall, during the pleasure of the Governor in Council, be under the control of the authorities of the province of British Columbia and be administered under and in accordance with the Water Acts, as if the said Acts were enacted by the Parliament of Canada."*

- Despite being a federal land zone, **day-to-day water administration** is delegated to **provincial authorities**.
- The provincial **Water Acts** govern the administration of water, **as if they were federal laws**.
- Provincial officers (e.g., water commissioners, inspectors) have the **same powers and duties** as they would in non-Railway Belt areas.

> This creates a **hybrid system**: federal ownership, provincial administration.

---

### **6. Recognition of Pre-1913 Provincial and Federal Applications**

> *"All applications or claims... made or pending on or before June 6, 1913... shall be deemed to be valid and effective... and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Board."*

- Applications made before June 6, 1913, to either **federal or provincial authorities** are treated as valid.
- These applications are **subject to the Board’s jurisdiction** and the **limitations of the Water Acts**—same as if they were made in non-Railway Belt areas.

> This protects historical claims and ensures fairness in adjudication.

---

### **7. Special Provisions for Indigenous Water Rights**

> *"All waters for irrigation allotted to Indians or Indian Reserves... and all applications to any provincial or local authority for the use of water within the Railway Belt in the interest of Indians or Indian reserves, shall be deemed to be valid and effective and subject to the jurisdiction of the Board and given effect to under the provisions of the Water Acts as if made, issued, authorized or pending by the competent provincial or local authority."*

- Indigenous water rights (especially for irrigation) are **recognized and protected**.
- These rights are treated as **valid and effective** under the Water Acts, even if they were granted before or after 1913.
- The Board has jurisdiction over such matters.

> This was an early, though limited, acknowledgment of **Indigenous water rights** in Canadian law.

---

### **8. Authority to Apply Provincial Water Laws to the Railway Belt**

> *"The Governor in Council may direct that any Act, or portion thereof, passed by the legislature of British Columbia after March 3, 1913, relating to water in the province not within the Railway Belt shall apply to the water in the Railway Belt as if such Act were enacted by the Parliament of Canada."*

- The **federal government (Governor in Council)** can **extend** provincial water laws to the Railway Belt.
- This allows flexibility in adapting modern water management practices (e.g., irrigation, environmental protection) to the Railway Belt.
- The extended law is treated as if it were **federal legislation**.

> This provision enables **modernization** of water governance without requiring new federal statutes.

---

### **9. Retroactive Effect of Orders in Council**

> *"Every order in council passed under the authority of this section shall be deemed to relate back to and to take effect from the date of the coming into operation of the Act, or the portion of an Act, the application of which to the water in the Railway Belt is directed by the order in council."*

- Orders made under this authority **take effect from the date the Act comes into force**.
- Ensures continuity and avoids gaps in enforcement.

> This strengthens administrative coherence.

---

### **10. Publication and Parliamentary Scrutiny**

> *"Every such order in council shall be published for four consecutive weeks in the Canada Gazette, and shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within the first fifteen days of the session next after the date thereof."*

- Federal orders must be **publicly announced** and **subject to parliamentary review**.
- Ensures **transparency and democratic accountability**.

---

### **11. Repeal of Section 5 (Water Administration)**

> *"The Governor in Council may, at any time, repeal the provisions of
