**Detailed Summary of the *Dental Care Measures Act***

---

### **Overview of the Act**
The *Dental Care Measures Act* is a federal statute designed to support the administration and enforcement of the **Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP)**, a public health initiative aimed at improving access to dental care for Canadians. The Act establishes a mechanism by which individuals who receive certain types of income payments—specifically those related to employment or former employment—are required to report whether themselves or their family members were eligible for dental care coverage during a given tax year.

This legislation operates primarily through collaboration between the **Minister of National Revenue** (responsible for income tax administration) and the **Minister of Health** (responsible for the Canadian Dental Care Plan), ensuring that data on dental coverage eligibility is collected and used to monitor and improve the effectiveness of the plan.

### **Key Definitions and Provisions**

#### **1. Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP)**
- Refers to the government-funded dental service plan established under the *Department of Health Act*.
- Provides access to dental services for eligible individuals, particularly those with low or moderate incomes.
- The Act enables the collection of information about eligibility for such coverage to help the Government assess needs and ensure equitable access.

#### **2. Binding Nature of the Act**
- The Act applies to **His Majesty in right of Canada or any province**, meaning it is enforceable at both federal and provincial levels, though its primary implementation is federal due to the role of the Department of Health and the Income Tax Regulations.

### **Core Requirement: Reporting on Dental Coverage Eligibility**

#### **Section 4 – Mandatory Disclosure in Income Tax Returns**
- **Applicability**: Applies only to **taxation years beginning on or after 2023**.
- **Who Must Comply**:
  - Any person required to file an **information return** under **subsection 200(1) of the Income Tax Regulations** (e.g., employers or payers making payments to employees or former employees).
- **What Must Be Reported**:
  - For each **payee** (the individual receiving the payment), the person must indicate in the return whether:
    - The **payee**, or any of their **family members**, were eligible (as of **December 31** of the relevant tax year) to access:
      - Dental care insurance, or
      - Any coverage of dental services (of any kind), offered by the **payer** (the employer or entity making the payment).
- This includes coverage provided through:
  - Employer-sponsored plans,
  - Private insurance,
  - Government programs (including the CDCP).

> **Note**: The requirement is not about whether the payee personally used dental care, but whether they or their family had access to such coverage.

### **Definition of "Family Member" (for the purpose of this Act)**

A "family member" of a payee includes:
1. The payee’s **spouse or common-law partner**;
2. A **child** of the payee (including a child of the spouse or common-law partner) who is:
   - Under **18 years of age**, or
   - 18 years or older but **dependent** on the payee due to **mental or physical infirmity** (e.g., disability requiring ongoing support).

> This definition ensures that dependents, especially those with disabilities, are included in the eligibility assessment.

---

### **Role of the Minister of National Revenue**

- The Minister of National Revenue may, in the required income tax return, **request** the information specified in Section 4(1) (i.e., dental coverage eligibility).
- This information is collected **solely for the purposes of administering and enforcing the Canadian Dental Care Plan**, **not** for income tax assessment or audit purposes.
- The collection is strictly limited to supporting policy development, enforcement, and monitoring of the CDCP.

---

### **Use and Disclosure of Collected Information**

The Minister of National Revenue or any representative may share the collected information with:
1. **The Minister of Health** – for:
   - Administration and enforcement of the CDCP,
   - Formulation or evaluation of policies related to the plan.
2. **An official of the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)** – to assist the Minister of Health in administering and enforcing the CDCP.

> **Important**: All data sharing is strictly for administrative and policy purposes under the CDCP and does not extend to other uses, such as employment decisions or personal profiling.

---

### **Penalties for Non-Compliance**

#### **Violation Definition**
A violation occurs if:
- A person **fails to provide** the required information under Section 4(1), or
- A person **knowingly makes a false or misleading statement** in the return regarding eligibility.

> The violation is not about fraud or tax evasion but about **accurate reporting of dental coverage access**.

#### **Penalty Amount**
- The **Minister of Health** may impose a penalty of **$100 per violation**.
- The penalty is **not punitive** but **incentivizes compliance** to ensure accurate data collection for the CDCP.

#### **Time Limit for Penalties**
- Penalties **cannot be imposed more than three years** after the date on which the violation occurred.
- Example: If a return was filed in 2023, the Minister may only impose a penalty for a violation that occurred in 2023 or earlier.

#### **Review and Rescission of Penalties**
- The Minister of Health may:
  - **Rescind** a penalty, or
  - **Reduce** it, if:
    - New facts emerge, or
    - The Minister determines that the penalty was imposed without knowledge of, or based on a **mistake regarding**, a material fact.

> This provision provides a safeguard against unjust penalties and promotes fairness in enforcement.

#### **Legal Status of Penalties**
- A penalty imposed under this Act constitutes a **debt due to His Majesty**.
- It is **payable immediately upon imposition** and may be **collected by the Minister of Health**.
- This gives the Government a legal mechanism to recover non-compliance financially.

---

### **Use of Social Insurance Number (SIN)**

- The Minister of Health is authorized to collect and use a person’s **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** when they make an application to the Canadian Dental Care Plan.
- This is necessary to verify identity, eligibility, and link applications to individuals in the system.
- The use of SIN is limited to the **administration and enforcement of the CDCP** and is subject to privacy and data protection standards.

### **Purpose and Intent of the Act**

The primary goals of the *Dental Care Measures Act* are:
1. **Improve data accuracy** on dental care coverage access among Canadians.
2. **Support policy development** by providing reliable data on who has or lacks access to dental services.
3. **Ensure equitable access** to dental care by identifying gaps in coverage—especially among low-income workers and vulnerable populations.
4. **Promote transparency and accountability** in employer-sponsored dental benefits.
5. **Encourage compliance** through a clear, enforceable reporting mechanism, without punitive intent.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Tax Return Linkage** | Uses existing income tax return infrastructure to gather coverage data—cost-effective and widely accessible. |
| **Focus on Family Members** | Expands coverage awareness beyond the individual to include dependents, especially those with disabilities. |
| **No Tax Penalties** | The information is not used for tax purposes, reducing concerns about privacy and misuse. |
| **Time-Limited Penalties** | Prevents long-term penalties and encourages timely compliance. |
| **Review Mechanism** | Provides fairness and due process in enforcement. |
| **Data Use Restrictions** | Limits data sharing to CDCP-related purposes only. |

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Applies only to 2023 and later** – No requirement for prior years.
- **Does not apply to all payments** – Only applies to payments under paragraph 153(1)(a) or (b) of the Income Tax Act (e.g., employment-related payments like wages, bonuses, or severance).
- **No obligation to disclose actual use of coverage** – Only eligibility is reported.
- **Privacy protections** are emphasized, with data used solely for CDCP administration.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Dental Care Measures Act* is a targeted, data-driven piece of legislation that strengthens the Canadian Dental Care Plan by requiring employers and payers to report on dental coverage eligibility for employees and their families. By integrating this reporting into the existing income tax return system, the Act achieves broad reach with minimal administrative burden. The inclusion of a fair, time-limited penalty system ensures compliance without excessive punishment, while strict data use and privacy safeguards protect individual rights.

Ultimately, the Act supports a more informed, equitable, and responsive dental care system—one that identifies underserved populations and helps shape future policy to expand access to essential dental services across Canada.
