### **Detailed Summary of the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act***  
*(Cited as the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act)*

---

## **Overview**

The *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian federal legislation designed to ensure equitable financial support for provinces by establishing mechanisms for **provincial revenue equalization**, **revenue stabilization**, **succession duty support**, and **post-secondary education funding**. It was enacted to address disparities in provincial fiscal capacity and to promote fiscal fairness across Canada, particularly during a period of significant economic and demographic change in the 1960s.

The Act operates within a framework of **fiscal transfers** from the federal government to provinces, with payments calculated based on population, revenue structure, and specific provincial needs. It replaced the earlier *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, 1960–61* (the "former Act") and introduced more refined formulas and transitional provisions.

## **Core Provisions and Financial Mechanisms**

---

### **1. Provincial Revenue Equalization Payment (Section 3)**

- **Purpose**: To compensate provinces for lower-than-average revenues due to differences in population, economic base, or tax structure.
- **Eligibility**: Applies to all provinces from **April 1, 1967**, to **March 31, 1972**.
- **Maximum Amount**: Not to exceed the amount calculated under **Section 8**.
- **Calculation**: The equalization payment is the **greater of**:
  - The **general equalization** (based on per capita revenue alignment with national average)
  - A **guaranteed equalization** for certain provinces (for specific years)

> **Note**: The guaranteed equalization ensures a minimum floor of support for historically disadvantaged provinces.

---

#### **General Equalization (Section 8)**

- **Formula**:  
  Equalization = (Population of Province × Per Capita Revenue Needed)  
  Where per capita revenue needed is derived from:
  - Total national revenue from all revenue sources (multiplied by population of all provinces)
  - Divided by total national population

- **Per Capita Target**: Ensures that the average per capita revenue across provinces equals the national average.
- **Adjustments**:
  - For **personal income tax**, the Minister may deduct federal income tax savings due to:
    - Schooling allowances under the Youth Allowances Act
    - Application of the *Established Programs (Interim Arrangements) Act*
  - These deductions reflect the federal government’s share of income tax revenue, which is reduced when provinces provide public education.

> This mechanism ensures that provinces that spend heavily on education (which reduces federal income tax receipts) receive greater equalization support.

---

#### **Guaranteed Equalization (Section 9)**

- Applies to specific provinces with historical fiscal disadvantages:
  - **Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland**: $10.5 million each
  - **Prince Edward Island**: $3.5 million
  - **Saskatchewan (Special Provision)**:
    - 1967: 4/5 of 1966 equalization amount
    - 1968: 3/5
    - 1969: 2/5
    - 1970: 1/5

> This phased reduction reflects a transitional approach to fiscal adjustment in Saskatchewan, recognizing its unique economic and demographic context.

### **2. Provincial Revenue Stabilization Payment (Section 4)**

- **Purpose**: To prevent sudden drops in provincial revenues due to economic fluctuations.
- **Eligibility**: Available annually from **April 1, 1967**, onward.
- **Calculation**:
  > Stabilization Payment = (95% of previous year’s net general revenue) – (Adjusted current net general revenue)

- **Net General Revenue**:
  - Based on data from the *Provincial Government Finance, Revenue and Expenditure* publication
  - Adjusted to reflect:
    - Average revenue over **3 years** (for succession duties)
    - Average revenue over **5 years** (for motor fuel tax)
    - Deductions for federal tax credits (Section 8(3))

- **Adjustment Payment**:
  - A stabilization payment is **only payable** if the province submits an application to the Minister **within 18 months** of the fiscal year ending.

> This provision aims to smooth out revenue volatility and protect provincial budgets from downturns.

---

### **3. Succession Duty Support Payments (Sections 5 & 6)**

- **Purpose**: To compensate provinces for their inability to collect estate taxes or for maintaining stable succession duty rates.

#### **(a) Provinces NOT levying succession duties**:
- Receive a payment equal to the **basic estate tax** applicable to them.

#### **(b) Provinces levying succession duties but not increasing rates beyond 1964 levels**:
- Receive **one-third** of the basic estate tax.

> This incentivizes provinces to maintain stable succession tax rates without increasing them, which could lead to reduced revenue.

#### **Basic Estate Tax Definition (Section 5)**:
- Based on 75% of total estate tax collected in the province:
  - Property in the province, from residents dying in the province
  - Property in the province, from residents dying outside the province
  - Non-real property outside Canada, passing to residents in the province

> This formula captures the economic impact of estate transfers on provincial revenue.

### **4. Post-Secondary Education Adjustment Payment (Section 12–14)**

- **Purpose**: To compensate provinces for **federal revenue abatements** (i.e., federal tax reductions) related to post-secondary education funding.
- **Eligibility**: Available from **April 1, 1967**, to **March 31, 1972**.
- **Authorized by**: Secretary of State of Canada
- **Maximum Amount**: Not to exceed the amount calculated under Section 13.

#### **Calculation (1967 Only)**:
> Adjustment Payment =  
> **Greater of**  
> - 50% of provincial operating expenditures for post-secondary education  
> - $15 × Population of province (1967)  
> **Minus**  
> - Federal revenue abatement applicable to the province  
> - In cases of Nova Scotia, NB, NL, PEI: lesser of  
>   - Portion of equalization attributable to abatement  
>   - Difference between general and guaranteed equalization  
> - For other provinces: portion of equalization attributable to abatement

#### **Calculation (After 1967)**:
- If the 50% operating expenditure amount exceeds the product formula, then the **50% amount applies**.
- Otherwise, the adjustment payment is based on a **proportional formula**:
  > = (Previous year’s adjustment payment) × (Total operating expenditures in current year / Total in previous year)  
  > Minus federal revenue abatement

> This creates a **self-correcting mechanism** that adjusts for growth in education spending.

#### **Critical Rule (Section 14)**:
- If the calculated adjustment payment is **less than**:
  - 50% of operating expenditures  
  - Minus federal abatement  
  → Then the province is **deemed to be a "special province"** (like in 1967), and will receive the 50% operating expenditure amount going forward.

> This prevents provinces from being penalized for underfunding or for being caught in a revenue cycle where federal abatements reduce their ability to fund education.

#### **Operating Expenditures (Section 14)**:
- Includes all **day-to-day costs** of post-secondary institutions during the financial year related to the fiscal year.
- **Excludes**:
  - Student financial aid
  - Capital costs (land, buildings, equipment)
  - Interest or depreciation
  - Rent (except as prescribed)
  - Ancillary enterprises (as prescribed)

> Only **operating expenses** are included, ensuring that funding supports ongoing educational services, not infrastructure.

#### **Deductions in Operating Expenditure Calculation**:
- Amounts received from:
  - Research grants (assisted, sponsored, or contract)
  - Canada or Canada Council
- May be deducted **unless otherwise regulated**

> This ensures that institutions are not overfunded by federal grants and that only true operating costs
