The provided text appears to be a partial or incomplete excerpt of a Canadian Act of Parliament, specifically indicating that a certain provision has been **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or removed) by **Bill C-26, 2017**, under section 66.

### Detailed Summary:

**Title of the Document:**  
The text does not specify the name of the original act being repealed. It only states that multiple sections (or provisions) of an act were repealed by *An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and other Acts* (commonly known as **Bill C-26, 2017**), specifically under **section 66**.

**Key Elements of the Summary:**

1. **Repeal of Provisions**:  
   The repeated line `[Repealed, 2017, c. 26, s. 66]` indicates that **multiple sections** of a prior act were officially removed from law on **April 18, 2017**, when **Bill C-26** received royal assent. This means the content of those sections no longer exists in Canadian legislation.

2. **Legal Authority**:  
   The enactment is formally attributed to "Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada," which is the standard legal phrasing for a Canadian statute passed through Parliament.

3. **Context of Bill C-26, 2017**:  
   Bill C-26, 2017, is officially titled *An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and other Acts*. It was introduced to modernize and update various aspects of Canadian labor law, including:
   - Improving workplace safety standards,
   - Updating provisions related to employment standards (e.g., minimum wage, working hours),
   - Addressing issues such as unionization and collective bargaining,
   - Revising the structure and enforcement of labor regulations.

   Section 66 of this bill specifically included provisions for **repealing outdated or redundant sections** from existing legislation — in this case, from prior acts related to labor or employment standards — to streamline and clarify the legal framework.

4. **Purpose of Repeal**:  
   The repeals were likely intended to:
   - Remove obsolete or conflicting provisions,
   - Eliminate legal ambiguities,
   - Align current laws with modern workplace realities,
   - Improve clarity and consistency in the application of labor laws.

5. **Status of the Original Act**:  
   Since the original act (or its sections) is not named in the excerpt, it is not possible to identify exactly which laws were repealed. However, such repeals often involve older employment standards, labor rights, or occupational health and safety regulations that were no longer relevant or had been superseded.

6. **Significance**:  
   The repeal of multiple provisions under section 66 reflects a broader legislative effort to **modernize and simplify** Canada’s labor law framework. This aligns with the government’s goal of making employment regulations more accessible, effective, and responsive to current economic and social conditions.

### Conclusion:

The provided text is a **repeal notice** indicating that **a number of sections from a prior Canadian statute were formally removed** by **Bill C-26, 2017**, under **section 66**. These sections were likely outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with updated labor standards. The repeal was part of a larger legislative initiative to modernize and streamline Canada’s labor laws.
