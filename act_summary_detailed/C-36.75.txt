**Detailed Summary of the Consumer-Driven Banking Act**

---

### **1. Act Title and Purpose**
The *Consumer-Driven Banking Act* (CDBA) is a legislative framework designed to empower consumers—particularly small businesses—as active participants in the management and sharing of their financial data. The core objective of the Act is to give individuals and small businesses **greater control over their personal financial information**, allowing them to **directly choose which financial institutions (participating entities)** may access and use their data.

This is intended to promote **financial transparency, competition, and innovation** in the banking and financial services sector by enabling consumers to share their data securely and safely among selected financial institutions—such as banks, credit unions, investment firms, or payment providers—without being forced into a one-size-fits-all data-sharing model.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Agency**: Refers to the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)*, established under the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*. The Agency is responsible for overseeing, regulating, and enforcing compliance with the CDBA.

- **Derived Data**: Defined as data that has been enhanced by a participating entity to significantly increase its usefulness or commercial value.  
  → **Important Note**: The Act **explicitly excludes derived data** from its scope. This means that while raw financial data (e.g., balance, transaction history) may be shared, processed or analyzed data (e.g., credit scoring, risk assessments, predictive analytics) is not covered under this Act.

- **Entity**: A broad term encompassing corporations, trusts, partnerships, funds, and unincorporated associations or organizations. This includes banks, insurers, payment platforms, and other financial service providers.

- **Minister**: Refers to the *Minister of Finance*, who has key administrative and policy-making responsibilities under the Act.

- **Senior Deputy Commissioner**: The senior official within the FCAC specifically appointed to oversee the implementation and enforcement of the Consumer-Driven Banking Act. This role is central to monitoring compliance and managing the regulatory framework.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

The Act applies to data related to the following financial products and services:

- **Deposit accounts** (e.g., savings, chequing)
- **Registered and non-registered investment accounts** (e.g., RRSPs, TFSAs, regular brokerage accounts)
- **Payment products**, including:
  - Credit cards
  - Prepaid payment products (e.g., gift cards, prepaid debit cards)
- **Lines of credit, mortgages, or hypothecs** (mortgages), and other types of loans
- **Other products or services** as may be specified in regulations

> ✅ **Note**: The Act **does not apply to derived data**, meaning that enhanced or analyzed data (such as credit scores or risk profiles generated by an institution) is outside the scope of consumer control under this law.

---

### **4. Data Sharing Rules and Safeguards**

- **Data Sharing Must Be Non-Editable**:  
  When data is shared between participating entities, the receiving entity **must not edit** the data on servers that are operated by the original data provider. This ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications or manipulations.

- **No Override of Existing Restrictions**:  
  Nothing in this Act overrides restrictions imposed under the *Bank Act* regarding the sharing of consumer information with **insurance companies, agents, or brokers** for insurance purposes. This preserves existing regulatory safeguards in the insurance sector.

---

### **5. Public Registry of Participating Entities**

- The **FCAC (Agency)** is required to maintain a **public registry** listing all entities that are officially recognized as “participating entities.”
- This registry will include detailed information about each participating entity, such as:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Type of services offered
  - Date of registration
  - Compliance status
- The registry enhances **transparency and accountability**, allowing consumers to verify which institutions have access to their data.

---

### **6. Technical Standards Body (Designation and Oversight)**

To ensure that data is shared securely, safely, and efficiently, the **Minister of Finance** may designate a **technical standards body** responsible for establishing the technical specifications and protocols for data sharing.

#### Principles Guiding Designation:
- Safe, secure, and efficient data sharing
- Fairness, accessibility, transparency, and good governance
- Any other principle deemed relevant by the Minister
- Any principle specified in regulations

#### Designation Process:
- The Minister must **publish the designation order** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- The designation is subject to **review every three years**.
- The Minister may **revoke** the designation if:
  1. The Senior Deputy Commissioner advises revocation;
  2. The designation is no longer aligned with the principles above;
  3. It poses a **risk to national security**;
  4. It poses a **risk to the integrity or security of Canada’s financial system**.

> ⚠️ The *Statutory Instruments Act* does **not apply** to these designations or revocations, meaning they can be made without going through the usual statutory instrument approval process—providing flexibility and urgency in response to emerging risks.

#### Reporting Obligations:
- The designated technical standards body must submit an **annual report** to the Senior Deputy Commissioner.
- It must also **notify the Senior Deputy Commissioner promptly** (within 7 days) of any significant changes, including:
  - Changes in governance structure
  - Changes in leadership or membership
  - Changes in operational procedures or technical standards

This ensures ongoing accountability and adaptability in the technical framework.

---

### **7. Prohibitions on Misrepresentation**

To prevent fraud and confusion, the Act prohibits:

- **Use of misleading terminology**: No individual or entity (other than a participating entity) may:
  - Use the term “participating entity” or any variation, abbreviation, or equivalent (in any language)
  - Represent themselves as a participating entity in any way
- **Providing false or misleading information** about participation in the Act

This protects consumers from being misled by third parties claiming to be part of the data-sharing network.

---

### **8. Offences and Penalties**

Violations of sections 14 (misrepresentation) and 15 (false information) constitute **criminal offences**.

#### Penalties:

| Conviction Type | Individual (Max Penalty) | Entity (Max Penalty) |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **On indictment** | Fine up to $1,000,000 OR imprisonment up to 5 years OR both | Fine up to $5,000,000 |
| **On summary conviction** | Fine up to $100,000 OR imprisonment up to 1 year OR both | Fine up to $500,000 |

#### Additional Penalties:
- If the offender **gained monetary benefits** (or benefits accrued to spouse, common-law partner, or dependant), the court may impose an **additional fine equal to three times** the estimated amount of those benefits—regardless of the maximum fine allowed.

#### Liability of Officers and Directors:
- If an **entity** commits an offence, any **director, officer, agent, or principal officer** who:
  - Directed, authorized, assented to, or participated in the offence
  → Is personally liable as if they were the individual committing the offence.
- This applies even if the entity itself is not prosecuted.

---

### **9. Time Limits for Prosecution and Evidence**

- **Summary conviction proceedings** may begin **at any time within two years** of when the Senior Deputy Commissioner becomes aware of the offence.
- A document issued by the Senior Deputy Commissioner certifying the date the subject matter became known is **admissible in evidence** without needing to prove the signature or official status of the person who issued it.
- This provision ensures **timely and efficient enforcement** while reducing procedural delays.

---

### **10. Regulatory Powers (Governor in Council)**

The Governor in Council (on recommendation of the Minister) may make **regulations** to:

- Define what types of data are included under the Act (e.g., expand or narrow product coverage)
- Specify which products and services are covered under the Act (e.g., adding new financial products)
- Establish principles for technical standards (e.g., data format, encryption, access controls)
- Set requirements for the **annual report** of the technical standards body, including:
  - What information must be included
  - How and when it must be submitted

> These regulations are essential for operationalizing the Act and adapting it to evolving financial technologies and consumer needs.

---

### **11. Coming into Force**

Sections 4 to 7, 12, and 13 (which cover definitions, scope, data sharing rules, registry, technical standards, and offences) come into force on a date or dates to be **fixed by order of the Governor in Council**.

This allows for a phased rollout, ensuring that the regulatory infrastructure is in place before implementation begins.
