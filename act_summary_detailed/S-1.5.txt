### **Detailed Summary of the Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act**

The **Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act** is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that legally recognizes, validates, and implements the rights of the **Sahtu Dene and Metis** peoples in the Northwest Territories, particularly in relation to their traditional lands and resources. It serves as the legal framework for the **Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (CLCA)** signed between the Government of Canada and the Sahtu Dene and Metis, represented by the **Sahtu Tribal Council**, in 1993.

Below is a comprehensive, detailed summary of the key elements and provisions of the Act:

---

### **1. Historical and Legal Background (Whereas Clauses)**

- **Traditional Occupation**: The Act begins by acknowledging that the **Slavey, Hare, and Mountain Dene** of the Sahtu region have **traditionally used and occupied lands in the Northwest Territories from time immemorial**. This establishes a strong foundation of historical and cultural connection to the land.
  
- **Constitutional Recognition**: It references **Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, which recognizes and affirms the **existing Aboriginal and Treaty Rights** of Indigenous peoples in Canada. This constitutional principle is central to the Act’s legitimacy and purpose.

- **Negotiation Process**: The Government of Canada and the Sahtu Dene and Metis entered into negotiations to clarify and define rights regarding land ownership, use, and resource management — aiming to bring certainty and legal clarity to long-standing Indigenous claims.

- **People’s Approval**: A significant milestone was the **vote by the Sahtu Dene and Metis from July 5 to 8, 1993**, which approved the comprehensive land claim agreement. This democratic process affirmed the people’s consent to the terms of the settlement.

- **Signing of the Agreement**: The Agreement was officially signed on **September 6, 1993**, by Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Sahtu Tribal Council.

- **Amendments**: The Sahtu Tribal Council approved two amendments to the Agreement on **January 13 and February 11, 1994**, which were incorporated into the final legal instrument.

- **Parliamentary Approval Requirement**: The Agreement is explicitly defined as a **land claims agreement under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982**, and its validity is **conditioned upon approval by Parliament**. This ensures that the settlement is not only a negotiated agreement but also a legally binding and constitutionally recognized outcome.

---

### **2. Enactment and Title**

- The Act is formally titled:  
  **"The Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act"**  
  and may be cited as such.

---

### **3. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Agreement"** refers to:
  - The Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement signed on September 6, 1993.
  - Any amendments made to it from time to time.
  - This definition ensures that future changes to the agreement are legally recognized and incorporated into the Act.

---

### **4. Legal Validity and Binding Nature**

- The Act **approves, gives effect to, and declares the Agreement valid**.
- It is **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada and on any province** — meaning all levels of government must respect and comply with the terms of the Agreement.

---

### **5. Rights and Powers Under the Agreement**

- **Exercise of Rights**: Any individual or organization may **exercise the powers, rights, privileges, and benefits** granted under the Agreement and must **perform duties and be subject to liabilities** imposed by it. This clause ensures that the rights are accessible and enforceable.

- **Land Title**: For greater certainty, **title to lands in the Sahtu region vests in one or more designated Sahtu organizations** as specified in the Agreement. This establishes clear ownership and governance structures, transferring land title from the Crown to the Sahtu communities.

- **Renewable Resources Board (RRB)**:
  - The RRB, established under the Agreement, is granted **the capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person**.
  - This means the Board can act independently, enter into contracts, sue or be sued, and manage renewable natural resources (such as fish, wildlife, and forestry) on behalf of the Sahtu people — effectively giving it a legal personhood.

---

### **6. Regulatory Authority**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet) has the authority to **make orders and regulations** necessary to implement the Agreement. This provides flexibility for administrative and operational implementation.

---

### **7. Access to the Agreement**

- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (now Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs) is required to:
  - Deposit a **certified copy of the Agreement and any amendments** in the following locations:
    1. The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in the **National Capital Region** (Ottawa).
    2. The **regional office in the Northwest Territories**.
    3. The **legislative library of the Government of the Northwest Territories**.
    4. Any **other places** the Minister deems necessary.
  - This ensures transparency, public access, and accountability.

---

### **8. Precedence Over Conflicting Laws**

- In the event of **inconsistency or conflict** between this Act or the Agreement and any other law, **this Act or the Agreement prevails** to the extent of the conflict.
- This provision ensures that the rights and obligations established in the Agreement are not undermined by existing legislation.

---

### **9. Financial Obligations**

- The **Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada is authorized to pay out the **monetary obligations** of the federal government under **Chapters 8 and 10** of the Agreement.
- These chapters typically cover compensation, funding for infrastructure, and other financial commitments made as part of the settlement.

---

### **10. Effective Date and Implementation Timeline**

- The Act **comes into force on the later of**:
  - **April 1, 1994**, and
  - The day it is **assented to by Parliament**.
- This ensures that implementation begins only after formal parliamentary approval, providing a clear and structured transition.

- **Sections 11 and 12** (which relate to governance and administrative functions) are **deemed to have come into force on December 22, 1992**, even before the official enactment of the Act. This allows for early operational planning and implementation.

---

### **11. Reference Updates (Modernization Clause)**

- Due to government restructuring, the Act includes **modernization provisions** to reflect current departmental names:
  - Every reference to the **"Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development"** is read as a reference to the **"Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs"** (CIRNA), **unless the context requires otherwise**.
  - Similarly, every reference to the **"Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development"** is read as a reference to the **"Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations"**, **unless the context requires otherwise**.
- These updates ensure that the Act remains relevant and applicable in the current administrative structure of the federal government.

---

### **12. Repeal and Amendments**

- **Section 337 of the Act was repealed in 2009** (via *c. 23, s. 337*), indicating that certain outdated or redundant provisions were removed during legislative modernization.
