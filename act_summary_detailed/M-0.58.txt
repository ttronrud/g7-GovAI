#### **4. Transfer of Shares from CN to the Minister**

- The **Minister of Transport** is authorized to **acquire all common shares of Marine Atlantic Inc. currently held by the Canadian National Railway Company (CN)**.
- The shares acquired by the Minister are to be held **in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This means the federal government holds the shares as a trustee for the Crown, not as a private owner.

> **Implication**: The federal government gains full ownership of the company, but the ownership is held in trust for the Crown, preserving accountability and constitutional governance.

---

#### **5. Authority for CN to Transfer Shares**

- The **National Company (CN)** is authorized to **transfer** its shares in Marine Atlantic Inc. to the Minister.

> **Note**: This provision ensures that the transfer is not unilateral and is subject to ministerial direction, adding a layer of administrative oversight.

---

#### **6. Exemption from Financial Administration Act**

- **Section 101(1) of the Financial Administration Act** (which typically requires parliamentary approval for certain financial transactions) **does not apply** to the transfer of shares under this Act.
- This exemption allows the transfer to proceed **without requiring additional parliamentary approval**, streamlining the process.

- These shares were previously held by the federal government (Minister and Minister of Finance).

> **Purpose**: This is a **reciprocal transaction**—the federal government gives up ownership of CN shares in return for gaining control of Marine Atlantic Inc. It functions as a **compensation or balancing mechanism** in the transfer of assets between the federal government and CN.

> **Note**: This effectively transfers ownership of CN shares back to CN, which then cancels them upon acquisition.

---

#### **8. Cancellation of Transferred Shares by CN**

- The **National Company (CN)** is empowered to **acquire the shares transferred to it** and **forthwith cancel them** upon acquisition.
