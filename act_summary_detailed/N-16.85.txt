**Detailed Summary of the *National Strategy Respecting Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice Act***

---

### **Overview**

The *National Strategy Respecting Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice Act* is a landmark piece of Canadian legislation designed to formally recognize, address, and combat **environmental racism**—the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities, particularly Indigenous, racialized, and other historically disadvantaged populations. It establishes a **comprehensive national strategy** to advance **environmental justice** by ensuring equitable access to a healthy environment and meaningful participation of all Canadians—especially vulnerable groups—in environmental decision-making.

This Act reflects the Government of Canada’s commitment to upholding human rights, eliminating systemic racism, and achieving sustainable, inclusive environmental policies across the country.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Legislative Purpose and Policy Foundations**
The Act begins with a series of **"Whereas" clauses** that establish foundational principles:
- The Government recognizes the need to advance **environmental justice** across Canada.
- It acknowledges that **racism and racial discrimination** exist in all forms and must be actively addressed.
- A disproportionate number of people living in areas with environmental hazards (e.g., landfills, polluting industries) are members of **Indigenous, racialized, or marginalized communities**.
- The siting of environmentally hazardous facilities in such communities constitutes a form of **racial discrimination**—a concept defined as **environmental racism**.
- Meaningful involvement of marginalized communities in environmental policy development is essential.
- Racial discrimination in environmental policy-making is inherently **environmental racism**.

These clauses provide the moral, legal, and ethical grounding for the Act, framing environmental justice as a matter of **human rights, equity, and social justice**.

---

#### **2. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of the Environment** (or their designated representative), who is responsible for implementing the Act.

---

#### **3. Core Mandate: Development of a National Strategy**
The Minister is required to:
- **Develop a national strategy** to:
  - Promote environmental justice.
  - Assess, prevent, and address environmental racism.

This strategy must be comprehensive, evidence-based, and forward-looking, with clear objectives and measurable outcomes.

---

#### **4. Consultation and Inclusivity Requirements**
In developing the strategy, the Minister **must consult or cooperate with**:
- Interested persons, organizations, and communities.
- Other federal ministers.
- Representatives of provincial and territorial governments.
- **Indigenous communities**, particularly in a way that respects and aligns with **Indigenous rights and governance**.

Crucially, the strategy must be **consistent with Canada’s framework for the recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights**, ensuring that Indigenous knowledge, sovereignty, and self-determination are central to the process.

This provision emphasizes **collaborative governance** and **decolonizing environmental policy**.

---

#### **5. Required Components of the National Strategy**

The strategy must include two core elements:

##### **A. A Study on Environmental Risk and Social Determinants**
The study must:
- Examine the **link between race, socio-economic status, and environmental risk**.
  - This includes analyzing how systemic racism and poverty intersect to increase exposure to pollution, toxic waste, and poor air/water quality.
- Provide **information and statistics** on:
  - The **location of environmental hazards** (e.g., landfills, industrial sites, chemical plants).
  - The **demographics of communities** near these sites.
  - Patterns of disproportionate exposure among racialized and Indigenous populations.

This data-driven approach aims to **identify and quantify environmental racism** across Canada.

##### **B. Specific Measures to Advance Environmental Justice**
The strategy must propose **practical, actionable measures** to prevent, assess, and address environmental racism. These may include:
- **Amendments to federal laws, policies, and programs** to eliminate discriminatory practices (e.g., zoning laws, permitting processes).
- **Increased community involvement** in environmental decision-making (e.g., public consultations, community-led monitoring).
- **Compensation mechanisms** for individuals or communities harmed by environmental racism (e.g., health-related damages, loss of livelihood).
- **Systematic collection of health outcome data** for communities living near environmental hazards, to link environmental exposure to adverse health effects (e.g., respiratory diseases, cancer).

These measures ensure the strategy is not just theoretical but **action-oriented and community-centered**.

#### **6. Timeline and Reporting Requirements**

##### **Timeline 1: Initial Strategy Report (Within 2 Years)**
- Within **two years** of the Act coming into force, the Minister must:
  - Prepare a **detailed national strategy report**.
  - **Table the report** in each House of Parliament on any of the **first 15 days** after the House convenes following completion.

This ensures **transparency, accountability, and public access** to the government’s environmental justice plan.

##### **Timeline 2: Public Publication**
- The report must be **published on the official website of the Department of the Environment** within **10 days** of being tabled in both Houses.

This makes the strategy accessible to all Canadians, including affected communities and researchers.

##### **Timeline 3: Periodic Evaluation Reports (Every 5 Years)**
- Within **five years** of the initial report being tabled, and **every five years thereafter**, the Minister must:
  - Prepare a **report on the effectiveness** of the national strategy.
  - This report must:
    - Summarize the Minister’s **conclusions** about what has worked or not worked.
    - Include **recommendations** for improvement or new actions.
  - Table the report in each House of Parliament on any of the **first 15 days** after the House convenes.

This creates a **cycle of accountability and iterative improvement**, ensuring the strategy evolves in response to new data, community feedback, and changing conditions.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Legal Recognition of Environmental Racism**  
   The Act formally acknowledges environmental racism as a **legally recognized form of racial discrimination**, giving it weight in policy and legal discourse.

2. **Policy Shift**  
   It marks a significant shift from traditional environmental policy, which often prioritizes economic development or technical efficiency, to one that prioritizes **social equity, health, and justice**.

3. **Support for Marginalized Communities**  
   By focusing on vulnerable populations—especially Indigenous and racialized communities—the Act aims to rectify historical injustices, such as the siting of toxic waste facilities in low-income or minority neighborhoods.

4. **National Coordination**  
   The requirement for a coordinated national strategy ensures that efforts are not fragmented or inconsistent across provinces and territories.

5. **Foundation for Future Action**  
   The Act sets a precedent for future legislation and policies on climate justice, pollution control, and public health equity.

### **Challenges and Considerations**

- **Data Gaps**: Accurate, reliable, and disaggregated data on race, socio-economic status, and environmental exposure may be limited, requiring significant investment in data collection and methodology.
- **Implementation Capacity**: The success of the strategy depends on the Minister’s ability to build trust with Indigenous and marginalized communities and to enforce policy changes.
- **Political Will**: Sustained political commitment over time is needed to ensure long-term funding and enforcement of measures.
- **Legal Enforcement**: While the Act establishes a framework, actual enforcement of anti-discrimination measures may require further legal tools or regulatory amendments.

### **Conclusion**

The *National Strategy Respecting Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice Act* is a transformative piece of legislation that institutionalizes environmental justice as a central pillar of Canadian environmental policy. By formally recognizing environmental racism, mandating evidence-based research, and requiring regular public reporting and community engagement, the Act represents a critical step toward building a more **equitable, inclusive, and sustainable future** for all Canadians.

It not only addresses environmental harm but also confronts the deeper structures of **racism and inequality** embedded in Canadian society. As such, it serves as both a policy tool and a moral commitment to justice, equity, and human dignity.
