### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. CEBA Loan Recovery Limitations (Section on Debt Collection)**

This section establishes a clear and time-bound framework for recovering money owed under **Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) loans**, which were part of the government’s emergency financial assistance program for small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic.

##### **Core Elements:**
- **Recovery Deadline**:  
  Any legal action or proceeding to recover money owed under a CEBA loan must be initiated **no later than six years after the date of default**.

- **Definition of "Date of Default"**:  
  The date of default is defined as the **earlier of**:
  - The day the person making the claim first **knew** the default had occurred, or  
  - The day they **ought reasonably to have known** the default had occurred.  
  This establishes a reasonable standard for when the obligation begins to accrue.

- **Right to Set-Off or Deduction**:  
  A person who owes money under a CEBA loan may have that debt **deducted, set off, or compensated** against any other amount payable by the Government of Canada to them — **except** amounts payable under **section 122.61 of the Income Tax Act** (which relates to tax credits or refunds).

- **Effect of Acknowledgment of Liability**:  
  If a debtor acknowledges their liability (in any form) **during or after** the six-year limitation period, a legal action may be brought **within six years of the acknowledgment date**, subject to certain conditions.

  **What constitutes "acknowledgment of liability"?**  
  This includes:
  - A **promise to pay** the debt (by the debtor or their representative);
  - An **acknowledgment of the debt** (even if no payment is promised);
  - A **partial payment** of the debt;
  - An acknowledgment made during **bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings**, including by a trustee or administrator.

- **Suspension of Limitation Periods**:  
  The six-year limitation period is **suspended** during any period when it is **prohibited to commence or continue legal action** against the debtor (e.g., due to court closures, pandemic-related restrictions, or other legal moratoria).

- **Exemption from Section Application**:  
  This section **does not apply** to actions related to:
  - The **execution, renewal, or enforcement of a court judgment**.

- **Applicability Regardless of Timing of Default**:  
  The rules apply **regardless of whether the default occurred before or after** the Act came into force. Furthermore, even if the prior limitation period expired before the Act was passed, the new rules still apply.

> ✅ **Purpose**: This provision provides **predictability and fairness** in debt recovery for businesses that received CEBA loans. It prevents undue hardship while ensuring that creditors have a reasonable window to pursue recovery.
