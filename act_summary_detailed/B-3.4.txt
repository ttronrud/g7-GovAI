**Detailed Summary of the Act:**

The Act, enacted by Her Majesty in Canada, with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, establishes a specific financial mechanism to support the development of hydro-electric power at Beechwood on the St. John River in the province of New Brunswick. Here is a detailed breakdown of its key provisions:

---

**1. Purpose of the Act:**  
The primary objective of this legislation is to facilitate and finance expenditures related to the development of hydro-electric power at the Beechwood site on the St. John River. This initiative aims to promote renewable energy generation and enhance New Brunswick’s energy infrastructure.

---

**2. Authorization of Loan Funding:**  
The Minister of Finance is granted the authority to draw funds from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**—Canada’s central pool of public funds—to provide loans to the **Government of New Brunswick**.  

- The total amount of loans authorized under this Act is **not to exceed thirty million Canadian dollars (CAD)** in the aggregate.  
- This cap ensures fiscal responsibility and limits the total financial exposure of the federal government to the project.

---

**3. Conditions of the Loan:**  
Each loan granted under this Act must meet the following conditions:

- **Interest Rate:**  
  The interest rate on the loan shall be set by the **Governor in Council** (a formal body composed of senior federal officials, including the Governor General and Cabinet ministers).  
  However, the rate must **not exceed four and three-eighths per cent per annum (4.375%)**.  
  This cap ensures that the borrowing cost remains relatively low and affordable for New Brunswick.

- **Repayment Terms:**  
  The principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest, shall be repaid in **eight equal annual instalments**.  
  This structured repayment plan provides a predictable financial obligation for New Brunswick, helping to manage long-term budget planning.

- **Additional Terms and Conditions:**  
  The Governor in Council may prescribe **any other terms and conditions** necessary to ensure the effective and responsible use of the funds. These may include:
  - Reporting requirements
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Environmental or community impact safeguards
  - Restrictions on how the funds may be used (e.g., only for hydro-electric development at Beechwood)
  - Conditions for early repayment or modification of terms

---

**4. Oversight and Governance:**  
- The **Governor in Council** retains authority to determine the interest rate and to establish any additional conditions.  
- This reflects a federal oversight role to ensure that public funds are used appropriately and efficiently, while still allowing flexibility to meet project-specific needs.

---

**5. Legal and Financial Implications:**  
- The loan is a **federal financial assistance arrangement**, not a direct transfer of funds.  
- It is a **non-reimbursable** form of support under the principle of federal-provincial cooperation in infrastructure development.  
- The repayment of the loan is a **financial obligation of the Government of New Brunswick**, not a condition of federal grants or subsidies.

---

**6. Scope and Limitations:**  
- The loan is **specifically limited to expenditures for the development of hydro-electric power at Beechwood**.  
- It does not extend to other energy projects, infrastructure, or general government operations.  
- The total amount remains capped at CAD 30 million, preventing overextension of federal resources.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This Act serves as a targeted, financially structured mechanism to support New Brunswick’s renewable energy ambitions through the development of hydro-electric power at Beechwood. By enabling a federally funded loan with a low-interest rate and a fixed repayment schedule, the Act balances fiscal prudence with strategic investment in sustainable energy infrastructure. The involvement of the Governor in Council ensures accountability, oversight, and alignment with broader federal financial and environmental policy goals.

It exemplifies a model of intergovernmental cooperation where the federal government provides financial assistance to a provincial government for specific, infrastructure-driven projects, with clear conditions to ensure transparency, cost-effectiveness, and public accountability.
