The provided text appears to be a legal provision from a repealed or amended statute, specifically related to the **Fitness and Amateur Sport Act** in Canada. Below is a **detailed summary** of the content, taking into account the context, legal structure, and implications of the provisions — despite the fact that the act itself has been repealed.

---

### 📝 **Detailed Summary of the Provision**

#### **1. Repeal Status**
- The provision is **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) under:
  - **2003, c. 2, s. 39** (the *Statutes of Canada, 2003*, section 39)
  - **1995, c. 29, s. 45** and **c. 11, s. 22**
- This means that the content **no longer has legal force or effect** in current Canadian law.
- The repeal indicates that the **National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport** (NACFAS) was formally dissolved or its legal authority terminated, and the associated provisions were removed from the statute book.

#### **2. Interpretation of References to the National Advisory Council**
> *"Every reference to the National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport, established by subsection 7(1) of the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, in any deed, contract or other document executed by the Council in its own name shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be read as a reference to Her Majesty."*

##### 🔍 Meaning:
- This provision is a **legal interpretation rule** (a "constructive amendment" or "reading as" clause).
- It mandates that **any document** (such as contracts, deeds, or agreements) that refers to the **National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport** (NACFAS) — particularly if it was executed by the Council in its own name — should be interpreted as referring to **Her Majesty the Queen** (the Crown), not the actual body.
- This effectively **transfers legal authority** from the Council to the Crown.
- The purpose is to ensure **legal continuity and validity** of existing documents, even after the Council’s dissolution, by treating the Council as a body acting under the Crown.

##### ⚖️ Legal Significance:
- This rule helps prevent legal uncertainty or invalidity in documents where the Council was a party.
- It aligns with the principle that **certain public bodies act in the name of the Crown**, and their legal identity is ultimately derived from the Crown.
- It enables courts or other authorities to treat such documents as having been issued or executed by the Crown, preserving their enforceability.

#### **3. Authority to Close Out the Council’s Affairs**
> *"The member or members of the Queen’s Privy Council of Canada designated by the Governor in Council as the Minister for the purposes of the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act may do and perform all acts and things necessary for and incidental to closing out the affairs of the National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport."*

##### 🔍 Meaning:
- This grants **executive authority** to a designated Minister (appointed by the Governor in Council — i.e., the federal Cabinet) to **wind down or close out** the affairs of the National Advisory Council.
- The Minister has the power to:
  - Finalize financial obligations
  - Transfer assets or records
  - Dissolve or terminate ongoing operations
  - Close legal or administrative proceedings
- The term "closing out" implies **formal administrative closure**, including audit, settlement of debts, and final reporting.

##### ⚖️ Legal Significance:
- This provision provides a **clear mechanism** for the government to formally terminate the Council’s operations.
- It reflects a transition from a consultative advisory body to a defunct entity.
- The power is exercised by a **Minister of the Crown**, ensuring that the closure is carried out within the framework of government authority.

### 🏁 Overall Purpose and Context

- The **National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport** was established under the *Fitness and Amateur Sport Act* to provide advice to the federal government on matters related to fitness and amateur sports in Canada.
- However, due to changes in policy, public interest, or administrative restructuring, the Council was **repealed or dissolved** in the early 2000s.
- The provisions in question were designed to:
  1. **Preserve legal validity** of existing documents referencing the Council by reinterpreting them as Crown actions.
  2. **Enable a smooth administrative closure** of the Council’s operations by delegating authority to a Minister.

### 🚩 Important Note

- The functions of the Council may now be carried out by other federal departments (e.g., Sport Canada), depending on current policy frameworks.

---

### Conclusion

While the text appears to be a technical legal clause from a now-repealed statute, its purpose was to **facilitate the legal and administrative closure** of the National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport. It achieved this by:
- Interpreting the Council’s references as Crown actions in existing documents.
- Granting a Ministerial authority to formally wind down the Council’s affairs.

As such, it serves as a **historical and transitional legal mechanism** rather than a current regulatory provision.
