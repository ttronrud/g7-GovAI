**Detailed Summary of the National Strategy for Eye Care Act**

---

### **Overview**
The *National Strategy for Eye Care Act* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation designed to address the growing public health challenge of vision loss. It establishes a formal, coordinated national approach to the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of eye diseases, with a strong emphasis on equity, research, intergovernmental collaboration, and timely access to new treatments.

The Act recognizes that vision loss—caused by conditions such as macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy—impacts millions of Canadians, imposes significant economic and social costs, and severely diminishes individuals' independence and quality of life. In response, Parliament enacts this strategy to promote proactive, evidence-based action across federal and provincial jurisdictions.

### **Key Provisions and Objectives**

#### **1. Purpose and Scope**
- The Act aims to create a comprehensive national strategy focused on:
  - Preventing and treating eye diseases
  - Supporting vision rehabilitation
  - Improving health outcomes for all Canadians, particularly those from marginalized or underserved communities
- It acknowledges that vision loss is not only a medical issue but also a major contributor to reduced well-being, social isolation, and economic burden.

#### **2. Development of the National Strategy**
- The **Minister of Health** is responsible for developing the national strategy.
- This development must be done **in consultation with**:
  - Representatives of **provincial governments** (responsible for health care delivery)
  - **Indigenous groups** (to ensure cultural relevance and address health disparities)
  - Other **relevant stakeholders**, including patients, eye care professionals, researchers, and advocacy organizations
- The strategy must:
  - Identify and describe the various forms of eye disease (e.g., macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy)
  - Address the training and guidance needs of healthcare and rehabilitation professionals
  - Promote **research initiatives** and **improve data collection** on:
    - Prevention and treatment of eye diseases
    - Vision rehabilitation outcomes
  - Foster **information and knowledge sharing** between federal and provincial governments
  - Enable the Minister to **rapidly examine applications** under the *Food and Drugs Act* for medical devices and drugs intended for eye diseases (e.g., treatments for macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy)

> This provision is particularly significant as it streamlines regulatory review processes to accelerate access to innovative therapies for eye conditions—something that has historically been slow due to complex approval timelines.

#### **3. Incorporation of Existing Frameworks and Equity Considerations**
- The strategy must take into account:
  - Existing national and provincial policies, strategies, and best practices
  - Specific efforts to **address health inequities**—such as disparities among Indigenous populations, rural residents, or low-income groups
- This ensures that the strategy is both evidence-based and socially just.

#### **4. Public Engagement and Consultation**
- The Minister must hold **at least one conference** with the stakeholders listed in subsection (1) to gather input and ensure inclusive development of the strategy.

#### **5. Timelines and Reporting Requirements**
- **Within 18 months** of the Act coming into force:
  - The Minister must prepare and **table a comprehensive national strategy report** in each House of Parliament on **any of the first 15 days** after the House resumes sitting.
  - The report must be **published on the Department of Health’s official website within 10 days** of being tabled in Parliament.
- **Within five years** of the initial report being tabled:
  - The Minister must prepare and table a **second report** evaluating:
    - The **effectiveness** of the national strategy
    - The **current state** of eye disease prevention and treatment
    - The Minister’s **conclusions and recommendations** for improvement or future actions
  - This evaluation will provide critical feedback to refine and adapt the strategy over time.

#### **6. Awareness and Education Initiative**
- Starting in each year, **February is designated as "Age-Related Macular Degeneration Awareness Month"**.
- This designation serves to:
  - Raise public awareness about macular degeneration (a leading cause of vision loss in older adults)
  - Encourage early detection and preventive measures
  - Promote education among patients, caregivers, and health professionals

### **Challenges and Considerations**
While the Act sets a strong foundation, its success depends on:
- Effective implementation at the provincial level
- Adequate funding for research, training, and screening programs
- Sustained political will and cross-sectoral cooperation
- Ensuring equitable access to services, especially in rural and remote areas
- Continuous monitoring and adaptation of the strategy based on real-world outcomes

### **Conclusion**
The *National Strategy for Eye Care Act* represents a landmark step toward a more proactive, equitable, and coordinated national response to vision loss in Canada. By integrating prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, research, and public education, the Act not only addresses immediate health concerns but also lays the groundwork for long-term improvements in eye health and overall well-being across all communities.

It reflects a shift from reactive to **proactive public health policy**, recognizing vision loss as a critical public health issue with far-reaching consequences for individuals and society. With strong governance, stakeholder engagement, and measurable accountability, this strategy has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence and impact of vision loss in Canada.
