## **3. Key Provisions and Interpretive Principles**

### **A. Disposition of Property: Transfer at Undervalue**
- A transfer of property or service for **no consideration** or **consideration significantly below fair market value** is considered a **disposition at undervalue**.
- This is a critical concept in insolvency law, as such transfers may be challenged and set aside to prevent fraud or preferential treatment.

> **Example**: If a debtor sells a business asset to a relative for $100 when its market value is $10,000, this may be deemed a transfer at undervalue and subject to revocation.

---

### **B. Beneficiary Designation in Insurance Contracts**
- A **change in beneficiary** in an insurance policy is **deemed a disposition of property** under the Act.
- This ensures that insurance benefits do not escape scrutiny during insolvency proceedings.

---

### **C. Notification and Communication to the Superintendent**
- All required notifications, documents, or information (except for license applications under subsection 13(1)) must be sent to the **Superintendent’s division office**, as specified in Superintendent directives.
- This ensures centralized oversight and record-keeping in bankruptcy administration.
