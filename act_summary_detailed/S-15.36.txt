### **Detailed Summary of the *Specific Claims Tribunal Act***

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**

The *Specific Claims Tribunal Act* (SCTA) was enacted to address long-standing unresolved grievances of First Nations in Canada by establishing a **specialized, independent tribunal** to adjudicate **specific claims** — claims for compensation arising from historical wrongs or breaches of legal obligations by the Crown (the Government of Canada) or its predecessors.

The Act recognizes that:
- First Nations have specific, legitimate claims that must be recognized and addressed.
- Resolving these claims is essential for **national reconciliation** and the **self-sufficiency and development** of First Nations communities.
- A dedicated tribunal is needed because specific claims involve unique historical, legal, and cultural contexts that differ from general land claims or court litigation.

This legislation follows years of collaborative work between the **Assembly of First Nations (AFN)** and the **Government of Canada**, culminating in a legislative proposal that ensures a fair, just, and timely resolution process.

#### **3. Mandate of the Tribunal**

The primary purpose of the Tribunal is to:
- Determine the **validity** of specific claims.

It operates independently of other courts and is designed to:
- Respond fairly and efficiently to the unique nature of First Nation claims.
- Promote reconciliation between First Nations and the Crown.

#### **4. Jurisdiction and Scope**

##### **Who Can File a Claim?**
A First Nation may file a claim only if:
- The claim is based on one of the following grounds:
  1. Failure to fulfill a treaty or agreement obligation to provide lands or assets.
  2. Breach of legal obligations under the *Indian Act* or other legislation related to Indigenous rights or lands.
  3. Breach of obligations regarding reserve land administration (including fiduciary duties).
  4. Illegal lease or disposition of reserve lands.
  5. Failure to provide adequate compensation for land taken or damaged under legal authority.
  6. Fraud by Crown employees or agents in land transactions.

> *Note:* For claims involving areas that were part of British colonies before joining Canada, the Crown includes the Sovereign of Great Britain and its colonies **to the extent that liability would have passed to the Crown in right of Canada** — especially where time or delay would otherwise limit claims.

##### **Exclusions from Eligibility**
A First Nation **cannot file a claim if**:
- The claim is based on events within the **15 years before filing**.
- The claim relates to a land claims agreement signed **after December 31, 1973**, or any related agreement or Act.
- The claim involves an Act or agreement listed in the **Schedule** (e.g., those that already provide dispute resolution mechanisms).
- The claim concerns **programs or services** like policing, health, education, or child protection.
- The claim is based on **aboriginal rights or title** (except for treaty rights to specific assets such as hunting ammunition or farming plows).
- The claim is based on **ongoing, variable treaty rights** (e.g., harvesting rights).
- There are **concurrent proceedings** in another tribunal or court that could lead to irreconcilable outcomes and have not been adjourned.
- The claim seeks **non-monetary remedies** (e.g., injunctive relief, apologies).
- The claim exceeds the **claim limit** (maximum compensation cap).

> *Exception:* A claim for treaty rights to **specific assets** (e.g., tools for hunting or farming) is allowed.

#### **5. Filing Process and Requirements**

A claim must first be submitted to the **Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations** and meet strict criteria:

- The Minister establishes a **reasonable minimum standard** for the information required (e.g., documentation, evidence).
- This standard is **published on the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs’ website**.
- The claim must be filed in the **form and manner** specified by the Minister.

Only claims meeting these standards are eligible to proceed.

---

#### **6. Eligibility to File with the Tribunal**

A First Nation may file a claim with the Tribunal **only if**:
1. The claim was previously filed with the Minister and the Minister:
   - Notified the First Nation in writing that it would **not negotiate** the claim (in whole or part);
   - Or, **three years passed** after the filing date and no decision was made;
   - Or, the Minister **consented in writing** to the claim being filed with the Tribunal;
   - Or, **three years passed** after the Minister notified the First Nation that it would negotiate, and no settlement was reached.

This process ensures that claims are only brought to the Tribunal after negotiation attempts have failed or been formally declined.

The Tribunal is strictly limited in what it can award:

- **Only monetary compensation** is allowed.
