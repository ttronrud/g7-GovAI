### **Detailed Summary of the Financial Institutions and Deposit Insurance System Amendment Act**

#### **1. Title and Citation**
- The Act is formally titled: **"The Financial Institutions and Deposit Insurance System Amendment Act"**.
- It is commonly cited as such and may be referenced in legal, regulatory, or financial policy discussions under this name.
- This Act is an **amending legislation**, meaning it modifies existing laws related to financial institutions and the deposit insurance system. It does not establish a new standalone framework but builds upon or revises provisions of the original **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act** (OSFI Act).

> **Note**: The inclusion of "[See Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act]" indicates that the core regulatory framework for financial institutions (such as banks, credit unions, and other deposit-taking entities) is governed by the OSFI Act, and this Amendment Act updates or modifies its provisions.

#### **2. Purpose and Scope of Amendments**
While the provided text does not specify the exact nature of the amendments, the title and context suggest that the Act aims to:
- Strengthen the regulatory oversight of financial institutions.
- Improve the stability and resilience of the financial system.
- Enhance the effectiveness and adequacy of the **deposit insurance system**, which protects depositors' funds in case of financial institution failures.
- Potentially address emerging risks such as systemic banking failures, fraud, or financial crises.

- Resolution and recovery procedures for failing institutions.
- Reporting and transparency obligations.

#### **3. Commencement Clause**
- The Act, or any of its provisions, **comes into force on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation**.
- This is a common feature in legislation, allowing the government (typically through a proclamation issued by the Governor-General or relevant authority) to determine when the law will become effective.
- The proclamation may be issued to ensure that the amendments are implemented at a time that is operationally and politically appropriate—e.g., after public consultation, regulatory readiness, or economic stability.

> The text includes a footnote:  
> **"[Note: Act in force July 2, 1987, see SI/87-146]"**  
> This indicates that the Act was officially **implemented on July 2, 1987**, and the reference to **SI/87-146** refers to the **Statutory Instrument No. 87-146**, which is the official government proclamation or order that brought the Act into force.
