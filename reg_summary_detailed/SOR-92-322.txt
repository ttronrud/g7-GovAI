### **Overview**
The *Disclosure of Interest (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations*, made under sections 427 to 429 of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (Act), came into force on **June 1, 1992**. These regulations establish clear requirements for trust and loan companies in Canada to **transparently disclose interest rates and interest calculation methods** related to deposit accounts and debt obligations. The goal is to ensure that consumers are fully informed when opening or managing financial products, thereby promoting fair, informed decision-making.

The regulations may be cited as the **Disclosure of Interest (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**.

### **Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which governs the operations and responsibilities of trust and loan companies in Canada.
- **Deposit Account**: Defined as an *interest-bearing deposit account*. This includes savings accounts, term deposits, and other accounts that earn interest.
- **Point of Service**: A physical location where the public can access a company’s services and where individuals open or initiate the opening of deposit accounts. Examples include bank branches or retail offices.

### **Mandatory Disclosure Requirements**

#### **1. Disclosure at Time of Account Opening**
A company must provide a **written statement** to a customer who requests to open a deposit account, specifying:

- The **annual rate of interest** applicable to the account.
- The **frequency of interest payment** (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- The **manner, if any, in which the account balance affects the interest rate** (e.g., variable rate based on balance).
- **Any other circumstances** that influence the interest rate (e.g., minimum balance requirements, promotional periods).

This disclosure must be provided in one of the following ways:

- **With the statement of account** delivered to the customer **at or before the time the account is opened**; or
- **If no statement of account is provided**, then:
  - A **written statement** (copies of which are available and displayed in every branch** where the company keeps deposit accounts; or
  - A **general notice** displayed in all branches, at all points of service, and on the company’s websites offering deposit accounts in Canada.

#### **2. Telephone-Initiated Account Openings (Subsection 431(3) of the Act)**
When a customer opens a deposit account via **telephone request**, the company must:

- Provide a **written statement** to the customer **not later than seven business days after the account is opened**.
- The statement must clearly state:
  - The annual interest rate.
  - The frequency of interest payment.
  - How the account balance affects the interest rate.
  - Any other factors influencing the interest rate.

This ensures that individuals who open accounts remotely are not left without essential information.

#### **3. Content of Written Statements and General Notices**
All required written statements and general notices must include the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Annual Rate of Interest** | The stated interest rate per year (e.g., 2.5% per annum). |
| **Frequency of Interest Payment** | How often interest is paid (e.g., monthly, annually). |
| **Balance Impact on Interest Rate** | If interest varies based on the account balance (e.g., "interest is reduced if balance falls below $1,000"). |
| **Other Circumstances Affecting Interest** | Any conditions such as promotional rates, minimum balances, or caps on interest. |

> These details must be **clear, accurate, and easily understandable** to ensure consumer comprehension.

#### **4. Timing of Delivery (Mail-Provided Statements)**
- A written statement sent by **mail** is considered delivered to the customer on the **fifth day after the postmark date**.
- This ensures a reasonable timeframe for the customer to receive and review the information, even if postal delivery takes time.

---

#### **5. Disclosure of Interest Rate Changes**
If a company changes the interest rate or the method of calculating interest (e.g., switching from a fixed to variable rate), it must **immediately disclose the change** to the affected customer through one of the following:

- A **written statement delivered directly** to the account holder;
- A **written statement available and displayed** in every branch where deposit accounts are held; or
- A **general notice** displayed in all branches, at all points of service, and on the company’s websites.

> This ensures that customers are promptly informed of any changes that could affect their returns.

> ⚠️ *Note*: The provision was repealed by SOR/2009-47, section 4 — however, the original requirement remains relevant in regulatory context and may have been incorporated into later amendments or successor rules.

#### **6. Disclosure in Advertisements (Under Section 428 of the Act)**
In all **advertisements** promoting interest-bearing deposits or debt obligations, companies must include a clear statement that explains:

- For **interest-bearing deposits**:
  - How the **account balance affects the interest rate** (e.g., "interest is reduced when the balance drops below $500").
  - Any **other factors** that affect the interest rate (e.g., promotional terms, eligibility conditions).

> The statement must be **clear, prominent, and not hidden** in fine print or supplementary footnotes. It must be easily accessible to consumers reviewing the advertisement.
