**Detailed Summary of the Exit Information Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Exit Information Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under the *Customs Act* (S.C. 2001, c. 25, s. 8(2); S.C. 2018, c. 30, s. 2; and other statutory provisions). These regulations establish specific procedures for collecting and transmitting exit-related information from commercial air travel departing Canada, with a focus on ensuring timely, accurate, and secure data exchange between Canadian customs authorities (the Canada Border Services Agency or CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or its successors.

The primary purpose is to support **border security and intelligence sharing** by enabling the CBSA to obtain real-time information about individuals and flights leaving Canada, particularly in cases involving persons departing by land or air to the United States.

### **Section 3 to 5: Information Collection from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**

#### **Purpose**
To define the **source, circumstances, and method** of collecting information under **subsection 92(1)** of the *Customs Act*.

#### **Key Provisions**
- **Source of Information**: The CBSA may collect exit-related information from the **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** or its successor agency.
- **Circumstances**: This applies when a person is **leaving Canada by land** (e.g., crossing into the U.S. via land border).
- **Method of Collection**: All information must be collected **electronically**, as soon as it becomes available from CBP.

> ✅ This ensures real-time, digital sharing of exit data to enhance cross-border monitoring and threat detection.

### **Sections 7 to 12: Requirements for Providing Exit Information to the CBSA**

These sections outline **who must provide what information**, **when**, and **how** under **subsection 93(1)** of the *Customs Act*.

#### **1. Prescribed Information to Be Provided**
Under paragraph 93(1)(a), the following must be provided:
- **Flight code** (identifies the commercial carrier)
- **Flight number** (identifies the specific flight)

> This allows the CBSA to track and verify the identity and route of departing flights.

#### **2. Prescribed Conveyances**
- Applies to **all commercial conveyances** (aircraft) **except**:
  - Those operated by or on behalf of:
    - The Department of National Defence (DND)
    - The Canadian Armed Forces
    - A visiting foreign military force
  - Those used for **diplomatic missions** to Canada

> ✅ Exemptions apply to government and diplomatic operations to avoid unnecessary data collection in non-commercial contexts.

#### **3. Prescribed Classes of Persons Who Must Provide Information**
- **Commercial carriers** (airlines)
- **Individuals who charter a commercial conveyance** (e.g., private charter operators)

> These are the entities most directly responsible for managing passenger details and flight operations.

#### **4. Circumstances When Information Must Be Provided**
Information must be given when:
- A commercial conveyance **departs from or is expected to depart from a place inside Canada** with a **final destination outside Canada** (typically the U.S.).

> This ensures proactive data sharing before departure.

---

### **Section 9: Mandatory Disclosure of Passenger and Crew Details**

If a person (commercial carrier or charterer) becomes aware of the following details **within a specific time window**, they must provide them to the CBSA **as soon as possible**:

#### **Time Window**
- From **72 hours before scheduled departure** to **check-in time**.

#### **Information to Be Disclosed**
For each person expected on board:
- **Surname, first name, middle names**
- **Date of birth**
- **Sex**
- **Unique passenger reference** (for all persons *except crew members*)

> This enables the CBSA to identify individuals and cross-reference them with databases for security screening.

#### **Crew Members**
- The same information applies to crew members, but with a different deadline:
  - Must be provided **no later than one hour before scheduled departure**.

> This ensures crew details are available for security checks prior to flight.

---

### **Section 10: Post-Departure Reporting Requirements**

Within **30 minutes after departure**, the following information must be submitted electronically to the CBSA:

- Unique passenger reference of **each passenger (non-crew)** on board
- Flight code and flight number
- **Last place inside Canada** from which the conveyance departed
- **Date and time** of that departure

> This ensures the CBSA has up-to-date, real-time data on actual departure points and flight movements.

---

### **Section 11: Electronic Transmission Requirements**

All information must be submitted via **electronic means**, in accordance with the **CBSA Carrier Messaging Requirements**, which are:
- Published as a formal document
- May be amended over time
- Specify technical standards, formats, and protocols for secure data exchange

> This ensures interoperability, data integrity, and cybersecurity compliance between Canadian and U.S. agencies.

---

### **Section 12: Correction of Incomplete or Inaccurate Information**

Any person who realizes they have provided **incomplete or inaccurate information** to the CBSA must:
- Act **without delay**
- Submit the **corrected or missing information** using the same electronic process outlined in Section 11

> This establishes a mechanism for accountability and data accuracy, reducing the risk of errors in border security systems.

   - Facilitates secure, automated data exchange between Canada and the U.S. through CBP, improving situational awareness.

3. **Compliance with International Agreements**  
   - Supports Canada’s obligations under bilateral agreements (e.g., U.S.-Canada border cooperation frameworks).

4. **Efficiency and Accuracy**  
   - Mandates electronic submission to reduce delays, human error, and administrative burden.

5. **Proactive Monitoring**  
   - Requires advance reporting of passenger details and flight details, allowing for pre-departure checks and alerts.

### **Conclusion**

The *Exit Information Regulations* represent a modern, data-driven approach to border management. By mandating timely, electronic reporting of flight and passenger details, the regulations strengthen Canada’s ability to monitor and respond to potential security threats at the border, particularly in cross-border air travel. The integration with U.S. CBP systems ensures seamless cooperation and real-time intelligence sharing, while clear timeframes and technical standards promote consistency, accountability, and operational efficiency.

These regulations reflect a broader trend toward **automated, secure, and interoperable border systems** in North America, aligning with global best practices in customs and security operations.
