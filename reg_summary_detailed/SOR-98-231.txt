Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, which is part of the *Portions of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Divestiture Regulations* (S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22), enacted under authority from the *Public Service Superannuation Act* and the *Financial Administration Act*.

---

## **Detailed Summary of the Divestiture Regulations**

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
- The **Treasury Board**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, has issued these regulations.
- The authority stems from two key provisions:
  - **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSA)**: Allows the Treasury Board to make regulations regarding superannuation for individuals transitioning from the public service to new employers.
  - **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**: Grants the Treasury Board the power to issue regulations concerning the administration of public service benefits and pension systems.

> **Purpose**: These regulations govern the treatment of public service superannuation rights for individuals who transition from the Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS) to a new employer through a divestiture agreement — a process where government departments are transferred or privatized.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSA). |
| **New Employer** | A person or entity that, through a formal agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, takes over the operations previously conducted by a portion of the DPWGS. This includes any entity acting on behalf of or for that new employer. |

> These definitions are critical for determining who qualifies under the rules and what rights apply during the transition.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply **only to individuals** who:
  - Cease employment in the public service **due to an agreement** between Her Majesty in right of Canada and a **new employer**.
  - Become employed by that new employer as a result of the divestiture.

- **Exclusions**:
  - **Re-employment**: The regulations **do not apply** to individuals who later return to work with the new employer.
  - **Sections 4 to 9**: These sections (which may relate to pension or contribution rules) **do not apply** if the individual has exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSA (likely a transfer or continuation option).
  - **Effective Date for Certain Provisions**: Sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSA (which deal with retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death benefits) only apply **on and after the date the person ceases employment with the new employer**.

---

### **4. Return of Contributions (Section 12 and 12.1)**

- **Right to Request Return of Contributions**:
  - If, **without these regulations**, the individual would have been entitled to a **return of superannuation contributions** under:
    - Subsection 12(3) of the PSA (return of contributions upon leaving public service), or
    - Subsection 12.1(4) (for certain categories of employees),
    - Then the individual may **request a return of contributions** in writing **within one year** of ceasing public service employment and becoming employed by the new employer.

- **Right to Exercise Transfer Option (Section 13.01)**:
  - If, without these regulations, the individual would have been entitled to **exercise an option in favour of the transfer value** (i.e., the value of their superannuation entitlements transferred to the new employer), they may do so **within the same one-year period**.

> This ensures that individuals are not disadvantaged in terms of access to their superannuation funds during the transition.

---

### **5. Death Benefits and Survivor Benefits**

- If a person **dies while employed by the new employer**, their **survivor and children** are entitled to one of the following benefits — as if the individual had remained in the public service:
  - The **death benefit** under:
    - Subsection 12(8) or 12.1(8) of the PSA (for pension or superannuation death benefits).
  - The **allowances** under:
    - Subsection 13(3) or 13.001(3) of the PSA (for dependents’ allowances).

> This preserves the financial security of dependents even after the employee transitions to a new employer.

> ⚠️ *Note*: The provision regarding children born or adopted during the transition period was **repealed** by SOR/2016-203, section 59. Therefore, this specific benefit is **no longer in force**.

---

### **6. Special Provisions for Children (Repealed)**

- **Previously**, this section stated that a child born to, adopted by, or becoming a stepchild of the employee **during the period** between:
  - The date the person ceased public service employment
  - The date they ceased employment with the new employer
  - Was entitled to an allowance under Part I of the PSA.

> ❌ **Status**: This provision has been **repealed** (removed) by the amendment in SOR/2016-203, s. 59.  
> → **No longer applicable**. Any entitlements for children born during this period are now governed by other legislation or rules.

---

### **7. One-Year Period for Key Provisions**

- For **subsection 10(5)** of the PSA (which relates to the time frame for claiming certain benefits), the **one-year period** begins on the **date the individual ceases employment with the new employer**.

> This clarifies the timeline for benefit claims and ensures consistency in the administrative process.

---

### **8. Pensionable Service and Age Determination**

- **Pensionable Service**:
  - Includes **service with the new employer** that begins on the day the individual **ceases public service employment** and ends on the day they **cease employment with the new employer**.

> This means that time spent working with the new employer is counted toward pension eligibility under the PSA, which is significant for retirement planning.

- **Age at Cessation**:
  - The individual’s **age** for purposes of sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSA is their **age on the day they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This ensures that age-based pension calculations are based on the actual date of transition.

---

### **9. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on April 1, 1998**.

> This marks the start of the transitional framework for employees moving from DPWGS to new employers.

---

## **Key Takeaways and Implications**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Transition Protection** | Employees moving from DPWGS to private or new public sector entities retain key superannuation rights. |
| **Return of Contributions** | Employees can reclaim contributions if they would have been entitled to them under the PSA. |
| **Transfer Option** | Employees can choose to transfer their superannuation value to the new employer, with a one-year window. |
| **Survivor Benefits** | Dependents receive death benefits as if the employee had remained in the public service. |
| **Service Counting** | Time with the new employer is included in pensionable service — a major benefit for retirement planning. |
| **Age & Benefit Calculation** | Age is based on the date of ceasing public service employment. |
| **Child Allowances (Repealed)** | No longer available — this was a temporary provision removed in 2016. |

---

## **Critical Notes and Caveats**

- The regulation is **specific to the divestiture of a portion of the Department of Public Works and Government Services**. It does not apply broadly to all public service transitions.
- It is **not a general rule** for all public service employees; it applies only to those involved in divestiture agreements.
- The **repeal of the child allowance provision** in 2016 reflects a shift in policy, possibly due to changing family benefit frameworks or administrative simplification.
- The **one-year window** for claiming returns or exercising transfer options is strict and must be met to be valid.

---

## **Conclusion**

These regulations serve as a **critical transitional mechanism** to ensure that public service employees who move to new employers through divestiture are not disadvantaged in terms of their superannuation rights. They preserve key benefits such as:

- Return of contributions,
- Death and survivor benefits,
- Pensionable service credits,
- And eligibility for transfer options.

While some provisions (like child allowances) have been removed, the core structure supports a fair and equitable transition from public service to private or new public sector employment, aligning with broader public service pension principles.

---

✅ **Final Note**: This regulation is a **historical and specific** piece of legislation tied to a particular government restructuring (DPWGS divestiture). It remains relevant for individuals who were affected by that transition, particularly those who ceased public service employment in or after 1998 and are now employed by new entities under a divestiture agreement.
