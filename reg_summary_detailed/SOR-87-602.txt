### **Detailed Summary of the Sarnia Airport Zoning Regulations (1987)**

This regulation, officially titled **"Sarnia Airport Zoning Regulations"**, was enacted by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**. It **replaces and revokes** the previous Sarnia Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 107), which had been published in two successive issues of *The Canada Gazette, Part I* and *The Sarnia Observer* on June 13 and 20, 1987, providing a reasonable opportunity for public comment.

## **I. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- **Objective**: To establish clear zoning boundaries and height restrictions around **Sarnia Airport** in the Township of Sarnia, Ontario, to ensure aviation safety by minimizing obstacles that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, and approach paths.
- **Legal Authority**: The regulation is based on **Section 4.5** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which allows for the publication of proposed zoning regulations, and **Section 4.4**, which authorizes the Minister of Transport to adopt and implement such regulations after public consultation.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Sarnia Airport located in the Township of Sarnia, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point at an elevation of **179.5 meters above sea level**. Located 76.20 meters northeasterly at right angles from a point 898.06 meters northwesterly along the centerline of runway 14–32 from the southeasterly end of strip 14–32. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip to protect aircraft during approach. Different slopes and distances apply depending on the runway. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, except where this would be less than 9 meters above ground—then it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The actual runway and adjacent landing area designated for aircraft movement. Includes runways 05–23 and 14–32. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at specific gradients until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

---

## **III. Application Area**

The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances. These lands are precisely defined in **Part VI of the schedule**, referenced through a detailed boundary description based on a **Sarnia Airport Zoning Plan No. 38-028-84-133**, dated March 17, 1986.

---

## **IV. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:

1. **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (or add to an existing one) where:
   - The **highest point** of that object exceeds:
     - The **approach surface**,
     - The **outer surface**, or
     - The **transitional surface**.

> This means that all structures must remain below these imaginary surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft operations.

2. **Natural growths** (e.g., trees, shrubs) that exceed any of these surfaces may be **removed or trimmed** by the **Minister of Transport**, if required.

---

## **V. Prohibitions on Waste Disposal**

No owner or occupier of land under these regulations may:
- **Use the land for the disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** or
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This is critical to prevent bird strikes, which pose a major safety hazard to aircraft.

## **VI. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

### **1. Approach Surfaces (by Runway)**

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Runway 05 (approach)** | Inclined plane: 1:25 slope; rises to a horizontal line 1,110 m from end of strip; 141 m from centerline; 44.4 m above strip elevation. |
| **Runway 23 (approach)** | Inclined plane: 1:25 slope; rises to a horizontal line 1,115 m from end; 141.5 m from centerline; 44.6 m above strip elevation. |
| **Runway 14 (approach)** | Inclined plane: 1:50 slope; rises to **International Boundary** (a major geographic reference); 8,614.7 m from end of strip; outer ends at 1,747.5 m NE and 1,506.6 m SW from intersection point; elevation at intersection is 172.6 m above strip end. |
| **Runway 32 (approach)** | Inclined plane: 1:50 slope; rises to a horizontal line 15,000 m from end of strip; outer ends 2,400 m from centerline; 300 m above strip elevation. |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach and landing phases.

---

### **2. Outer Surface**

- A flat imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP (179.5 m AGL)**.
- If 45 m above ground would be less than **9 meters**, then the outer surface is **9 meters above ground**.
- This surface defines the upper limit for all structures in the airport’s surrounding area.

---

### **3. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **05–23** | 60 m wide (30 m on each side of centerline) | 1,030.72 m long |
| **14–32** | 300 m wide (150 m on each side) | 1,675.78 m long |

> These are the actual runways and associated landing areas.

---

### **4. Transitional Surfaces**

| Runway | Gradient | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **05–23** | 1:5 (vertical to horizontal) | Inclined plane rising from lateral edges of strip and approach surfaces, extending to outer surface or adjacent strip’s transitional surface. |
| **14–32** | 1:7 | Similar to above, but steeper gradient (less gradual rise). |

> These surfaces connect the approach zones to the outer surface and prevent obstructions from extending beyond the approach areas.

## **VII. Boundary of the Outer Limits of Lands**

The full boundary of the regulated area is described in a detailed, step-by-step compass and coordinate-based survey, referencing **registered land plans** and **public road allowances**. Key features include:

- Begins at the **intersection of Lake Huron and the production northerly of Lot 13, Front Concession**.
- Travels through several major roads and lots, including:
  - Westgate Crescent
  - Hamilton Street
  - Winslow Crescent
  - Kaymar Crescent
  - Lot 94, 40, 18
  - King’s Highway No. 7 (widened)
- Includes intersections with:
  - County Road No. 7 (New Lakeshore Road)
  - Block F
  - Douglas Drive
  - Esser Crescent
  - Errol Road
- Ends at the **south-westerly corner of Lot 14, Concession 5**, and continues westward through Concessions 5–8 to the **Front Concession**, then back to the starting point via Douglas Drive and Esser Crescent.

> This boundary ensures that the entire area surrounding the airport is clearly defined and legally protected.

## **VIII. Key Safety and Environmental Considerations**

1. **Aircraft Safety**:
   - The approach, transitional, and outer surfaces are designed to prevent aircraft from encountering tall structures or natural features during critical flight phases.
   - The steep gradients (e.g., 1:50, 1:25) ensure that even tall trees or buildings are not visible to pilots during approach.

2. **Bird Hazard Mitigation**:
   - Prohibition on waste disposal prevents food sources that attract birds, reducing the risk of bird strikes.

3. **Public and Environmental Protection**:
   - The regulation applies to both private and public land, including road allowances, ensuring consistent enforcement.
   - Natural growths are not exempt—any exceeding the height limits can be removed by the Minister.

---

## **IX. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of natural growths exceeding surface limits.
  - Enforce compliance through inspections and administrative action.
- Violations may result in penalties or orders to demolish or modify structures.
