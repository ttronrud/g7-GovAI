**Detailed Summary of the International Boundary Waters Regulations (S.C. 2001, c. 40, s.1)**

---

### **Overview**
The *International Boundary Waters Regulations* were established by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to **Section 21a of the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act (IBWTA)**. These regulations provide a detailed framework for managing the use of boundary waters—specifically, the removal of water from shared international waters—between Canada and the United States, with a focus on ensuring environmental protection, equitable resource management, and compliance with international treaty obligations.

The regulations came into force on **December 9, 2002**, and apply specifically to certain designated water basins across Canada’s international borders.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *International Boundary Waters Treaty Act* (IBWTA), the primary legislation under which these regulations operate.

2. **Non-commercial project**  
   A project involving the removal of boundary waters in bulk where **no individual or entity is required to pay for the water**.  
   - This excludes commercial activities where users pay for water.  
   - Examples: Water used for firefighting, humanitarian relief, or short-term operational needs.

3. **Removal of boundary waters in bulk**  
   Defined as the **taking of water from boundary waters and transporting it outside the water basin** in which it originates, via any of the following methods:
   - **Diversion** through pipelines, canals, tunnels, aqueducts, or channels;  
   - **Any other method** that results in the removal of **more than 50,000 liters (approximately 13.2 gallons) of boundary water per day**.  

   ⚠️ **Exclusions**:
   - Removal of water contained in **manufactured products** such as bottled water, packaged beverages, or other consumer goods is **not** considered "removal in bulk."
   - Water used for **ballast**, **operation of conveyances** (e.g., ships, aircraft, trains), or for **people, animals, or goods on board** is excluded.

### **Application for a Licence**

Any individual or entity seeking to carry out a project involving the **removal of boundary waters in bulk** must submit a formal application to the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**. The application must include the following information:

1. **Applicant’s details**  
   - Full name and address of the applicant.

2. **Project description**  
   - A clear explanation of the intended project, including its purpose and scope.

3. **Project location and affected waters**  
   - Specific geographic location and the boundary waters likely to be impacted.

4. **Impact on water flow (if applicable)**  
   - If the project involves **diversion, obstruction, or use of boundary waters** and requires a licence under **subsection 11(1) of the IBWTA**, the applicant must describe:
     - The **increase or decrease in natural flow or water level** on the **other side of the international boundary** (i.e., in the neighboring country).

5. **Impact on water levels (if applicable)**  
   - If the project involves **construction or maintenance of dams, obstructions, or protective works** in rivers flowing from or downstream of boundary waters, and requires a licence under **subsection 12(1) of the IBWTA**, the applicant must describe:
     - The **increase in water level** on the other side of the international boundary.

6. **Economic analysis**  
   - A concise assessment of both **direct and indirect benefits and costs** of the project to Canada’s economy.

7. **Environmental analysis**  
   - A concise evaluation of the environmental impacts of the project, including:
     - Measures to **protect the integrity of the local ecosystem**.
     - Mitigation strategies to prevent harm to aquatic life, habitat, and water quality.

8. **Permits or authorizations**  
   - A copy of any existing permits or regulatory approvals related to the project.

9. **Project compatibility with national interests**  
   - Any additional information demonstrating how the project aligns with Canada’s broader goals for **resource management, environmental protection, and economic development**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The application process is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and thorough evaluation of both environmental and economic implications.

### **Scope of Subsection 13(1) of the IBWTA**

- Subsection 13(1) of the IBWTA (which typically relates to the **protection of boundary waters** and limits on removal) **applies only to the Canadian portion** of the following three major water basins:

1. **Great Lakes – St. Lawrence Basin**  
   - All land areas from which water drains into the **Great Lakes** or the **St. Lawrence River**.

2. **Hudson Bay Basin**  
   - All land areas from which water drains into **Hudson Bay**.

3. **Saint John – St. Croix Basin**  
   - All land areas from which water drains into the **St. John River** or the **St. Croix River**.

> These basins are considered critical for shared environmental and hydrological stability between Canada and the United States.

### **Exclusions from Subsection 13(1)**

Despite the general application of subsection 13(1), it **does not apply** in the following situations:

1. **Use of boundary waters in conveyances**  
   - Water used as **ballast** (for stability) in vessels, aircraft, or trains.  
   - Water used to **operate** a conveyance (e.g., for engine cooling).  
   - Water used for **people, animals, or goods** on or in the conveyance.

2. **Non-commercial projects on a short-term basis**  
   - Projects involving the temporary use of boundary waters for:
     - **Firefighting**  
     - **Humanitarian or emergency purposes**  
   - These are considered **non-commercial and temporary**, and thus exempt from the licensing requirements under subsection 13(1).

> This exemption ensures flexibility during emergencies or urgent public needs without triggering full regulatory scrutiny.

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Environmental Protection**  
   - Prevents large-scale, unregulated diversion of boundary waters that could disrupt ecosystems, fish migration, and water quality.

2. **International Cooperation**  
   - Ensures that Canada and the United States can manage shared waters in a fair, transparent, and cooperative manner, consistent with the **International Boundary Waters Treaty**.

3. **Equitable Resource Use**  
   - Balances economic development with environmental sustainability by requiring detailed impact assessments.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - Mandates comprehensive applications that include economic and environmental analyses, promoting public and governmental oversight.

5. **Exemption for Essential and Temporary Uses**  
   - Recognizes legitimate, low-impact uses of water (e.g., firefighting) without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens.
