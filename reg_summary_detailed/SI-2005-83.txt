**Key Details of the Transfer:**

1. **Transfer of Sector:**  
   The **Public Access Programs Sector** is being transferred from the Department of Public Works and Government Services to the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.

2. **Jurisdictional Basis:**

3. **Programs Included in the Transfer:**  
   The Public Access Programs Sector is responsible for the following four key programs:

   - **Canada Site**  
     A national public access point that provides information, services, and support to Canadians on government programs, services, and policies. It serves as a central hub for public engagement and access to government information.

   - **Canada Enquiry Centre**  
     A service that provides information and assistance to the public regarding government services, programs, and procedures. It acts as a key point of contact for citizens seeking clarification or help with accessing federal services.

   - **Publiservice**  
     A program responsible for the development, management, and delivery of public information and communications services. It supports the dissemination of government information through various media and outreach channels to improve public understanding and trust in government.

   - **Gateways and Clusters**

- **Policy Alignment:** The transferred programs will now be integrated into HRSD’s broader mandate to develop and deliver public service programs that support workforce development, skills training, and public engagement.
