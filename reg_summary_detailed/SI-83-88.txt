**Detailed Summary of the Coffin or Casket Remission Order**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**. This indicates that the Order is a formal, government-sanctioned administrative measure designed to provide tax relief in specific circumstances involving imported coffins or caskets.

The Order is officially titled the **Coffin or Casket Remission Order** and may be cited by that name in legal or administrative contexts.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **remit (i.e., cancel or forgive) customs duty and sales and excise taxes** that would otherwise be payable on certain imported coffins or caskets under the **Excise Tax Act**. This tax relief is intended to support the transportation of human remains in specific cross-border funeral scenarios, particularly those involving non-residents or international burials/cremations.

---

**3. Eligible Importations**  
Remission of taxes is granted in three distinct circumstances:

#### **Scenario 1: Funeral Director Importing for a Non-Resident Deceased**
- A **funeral director who does not normally reside in Canada or carry on business in Canada** imports a coffin or casket.
- The purpose is to transport the **remains of a non-resident person who died in Canada**.
- The **funeral service and burial or cremation take place outside Canada**.

> *Example:* A Canadian-based funeral director (not a resident) brings a casket into Canada to transport the remains of a foreign national who died in Canada, with the funeral and final disposition occurring abroad.

#### **Scenario 2: Importation Containing Remains of a Person Who Died Outside Canada – Funeral in Canada, Final Disposition Outside Canada**
- The coffin or casket contains the **remains of a person who died outside Canada**.
- The **funeral service is held in Canada**.
- The **burial or cremation takes place outside Canada**.

> *Example:* A Canadian funeral service is conducted for a foreign national who died in the U.S., with the funeral held in Toronto, but the remains are transported to the U.S. for burial.

#### **Scenario 3: Importation Containing Remains of a Person Who Died Outside Canada – Final Disposition in Canada**
- The coffin or casket contains the **remains of a person who died outside Canada**.
- The **burial or cremation takes place in Canada**.

> *Example:* A foreign national dies in the U.S., and their remains are brought to Canada for burial or cremation in a Canadian cemetery or facility.

**4. Scope of Tax Remission**  
The remission applies to:
- **Customs duty**,
- **Sales tax**, and
- **Excise taxes** under **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act*, as well as **any other part** of the Excise Tax Act that may apply to the importation of coffins or caskets.

This means the tax relief covers both the duty on importation and any excise taxes that would normally be levied on such goods.

---

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
To qualify for tax remission under this Order, the following conditions must be met:

- A **written claim for remission** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- The claim must be in a form **satisfactory to the Minister** (i.e., it must meet the requirements of official form, content, and documentation).
- The claim must be made **within two years after the date of importation**.

> *Note:* The two-year deadline is a strict administrative requirement. Failure to submit a claim within this period will result in the loss of eligibility for remission, even if the circumstances meet the eligibility criteria.

---

**6. Key Implications and Intent**  
- The Order recognizes the **special nature of funeral arrangements involving international persons**, where cross-border movement of human remains is common.
- It aims to **reduce administrative and financial burdens** on funeral directors and related service providers who are acting in non-resident or international contexts.
- It reflects a **practical, humanitarian, and administrative policy** that balances tax compliance with the need for flexibility in sensitive situations involving death and burial.
- The requirement for a formal, timely claim ensures accountability and prevents abuse of the remission provision.

---

**7. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The remission **does not apply to all imported coffins or caskets**. It is limited to those used in the specified scenarios.
- The Order does **not extend to coffins used for general commercial or non-funeral purposes**.
- The requirement for a **written, timely claim** ensures that the remission is not automatic and is subject to review and verification.

---

**Conclusion**  
The **Coffin or Casket Remission Order** provides a targeted, legally sound mechanism for exempting certain imported coffins or caskets from customs duty and excise taxes in specific international funeral scenarios. It supports cross-border funeral services involving non-residents and ensures that the financial burden of transporting human remains is not disproportionately placed on funeral service providers. The regulation is both practical and administratively enforceable, requiring clear documentation and timely submission to ensure compliance and fairness.
