**Detailed Summary of the Wire Crossings and Proximities Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially known as the **Wire Crossings and Proximities Regulations**. They establish comprehensive rules governing the **construction, maintenance, and operation of electrical supply lines and communication lines** in proximity to or across railways, particularly those under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Across or cross** | Means crossing *under or over* a railway or line. |
| **Communication line** | A line used for telegraphic, telephonic, signalling, or other intelligence purposes. |
| **Construction** | Includes extensive modification or reconstruction. |
| **Line** | Encompasses both communication lines and supply lines, including wires, cables, conductors, and supporting structures. |
| **Maintenance** | Includes repairing. |
| **Near** | Refers to proximity that could lead to physical, inductive, or electrolytic interference. |
| **Supply line** | A line primarily used for transmitting electrical energy (not for communication). |

> These definitions are critical for interpreting the scope and application of the regulations.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- The **construction and maintenance** of:
  - Lines for the transmission of **electrical energy** (supply lines)
  - Lines for **communication purposes** (telegraph, telephone, signalling, etc.)
- Specifically, where such activities require **leave from the Commission** under **Section 317 of the Railway Act**, or where construction/maintenance is carried out by **consent** and in accordance with these regulations.

> **Exception**: The Commission may **direct or permit a departure** from these rules in specific cases.

---

### **4. Responsibility and Costs**

- The **line party** (the entity seeking leave or consent to construct or maintain a line) bears **all costs** associated with construction and maintenance.
- Work must comply with:
  - **Canadian Standards Association (CSA) rules, requirements, and specifications**
  - These standards must be **approved by the Commission**
  - Upon approval, they become **automatically incorporated into these Regulations** without further action.

---

### **5. Safety and Non-Interference Obligations**

- All construction and operation must be carried out in a manner that:
  - Does **not unduly interfere with or obstruct** railway operations
  - Does **not endanger** the safety of:
    - Railway personnel
    - The public using the railway
    - Workers on or near the railway
- The **Director of Engineering** may require **additional precautions** to ensure safety.

---

### **6. Consent Requirements Before Construction**

Before constructing a line that will:
- Be **along or across** a railway, or  
- Be **near** a line within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada,

The proposing party must:
1. **Apply for written consent** to the owner, operator, or controller of the railway or line.
2. If required, **submit detailed construction plans**.

**If consent cannot be obtained** or is only granted under **unacceptable terms and conditions**, the party may apply to the **Commission for leave** to proceed.

---

### **7. Application to the Commission**

When applying for Commission leave, the party must:
- File **three copies** of:
  - A **statement** of all relevant facts
  - A **combined plan, profile, and cross-section** showing:
    - The proposed works
    - The location of the proposed line relative to the railway or line it will cross or approach
- **Give notice** to the railway owner/operator, including the statement and plan.

---

### **8. Notice Requirements Before Work Begins**

- **Except for emergencies**, the line party must give **at least 72 hours’ written notice** to the railway owner/operator before starting any construction or maintenance work (except minor changes or repairs).
- In **emergencies**, work may begin immediately, but **telegraphic notice must follow as soon as reasonably possible**.

---

### **9. Inspection Rights and Costs**

- The railway or line owner may appoint an **inspector** to supervise construction.
- The **line party pays** the inspector’s wages and expenses **after receiving a detailed statement** from the railway party.
- **Exception**: If the work is on a highway within a municipality and the line party is a municipality or its agent, the **railway party pays** the inspector’s costs.

---

### **10. Existing Lines Must Conform to Standards**

- In any case where a new line is being constructed **along, across, or near** an existing railway or line:
  - The **existing line must conform** to applicable CSA standards and Commission-approved specifications.
  - If changes are needed to avoid interference, the **existing line owner** must:
    - Receive necessary information
    - Send revised plans to the proposing party
    - Upon receiving **written consent**, make the required changes **at the expense of the proposing party**.

---

### **11. Dismantling of Existing Lines**

- If a new line is constructed **across or near** an existing line:
  - The **existing line must be dismantled**, **unless**:
    - It has been constructed and is maintained in full compliance with Commission-approved CSA standards.

> This ensures that interference is minimized and safety is preserved.

---

### **12. Indemnification Obligations**

- The **line party is fully liable** (indemnified) for:
  - All **losses, costs, damages, injuries, or expenses** suffered by the railway or line owner due to:
    - Damage or injury caused by the construction, maintenance, or operation of the line
    - Negligence, imprudence, or lack of skill by the line party’s employees or agents
- This indemnity applies **unless** the damage can be traced to a cause outside the line party’s control.

> This is a strong legal obligation designed to protect railway operators from financial and operational risks.

---

### **13. Dispute Resolution**

- Any dispute regarding the **construction or maintenance** of a line may be referred to the **Director of Engineering** of the Commission.
- The Director’s decision is **subject to appeal** to the full Commission.

---

### **14. Vertical Spacing and Pole Use**

- **Two or more lines shall not be constructed in the same or approximately the same vertical plane** (to avoid interference).
- **Exception**: Joint use of poles is permitted under:
  - The **Joint Use of Poles Regulations**
  - Any other order issued by the Commission

> This prevents electromagnetic and physical interference between lines.

---

### **15. Reporting of Accidents**

- The line party must **immediately notify the Commission by telegraph** (as soon as possible) upon receiving information of:
  - An accident involving its line on railway land
  - Personal injury to a railway user or employee
  - Loss or damage to the railway company
- The notice must include **full particulars** of the incident.

> This ensures rapid response and accountability.

---

### **16. Railway Rights to Use Electric Power**

- Nothing in these regulations:
  - Prevents a railway company from adopting **electric or other motive power**
  - Prevents construction of **necessary lines** along or across its right-of-way for such purposes
- Any **removal, relocation, or modification** of other lines required due to such electrification will be:
  - Costed and allocated **by the Commission**
  - Based on the **application of interested parties**

> This preserves the railway’s right to modernize and operate efficiently.

---

### **17. Remedy and Right of Action**

- These regulations **do not deprive any party** of their existing legal rights or remedies.
- Any party may still pursue **legal action** against another for:
  - Loss or damage caused by construction, maintenance, or operation of a line

> This maintains the integrity of common law and civil liability.

---

### **18. Approved Standards**

- **Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Standard C22.3 No. 1-1970**, titled *"Overhead Systems and Underground Systems"*, is specifically approved under these regulations.
- This standard forms part of the **Canadian Electrical Code, Part III** and covers:
  - Construction of:
    - Supply lines and trolley lines **along or across railways**
    - Communication lines **along or across railways**
    - Communication lines **near or across** other communication lines
- This standard is **on file with the Commission under Case 4707** and serves as the primary technical reference for compliance.
