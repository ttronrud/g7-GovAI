The provided text consists of four identical entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-181, s. 3]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2016-181, section 3**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation is **repealed**. This means it is no longer in force and does not apply to current legal or administrative practices.
  
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-181**, which is a **Supplemental Order of the Minister of Health** (or another relevant ministry, depending on the context) issued in 2016. This order is part of the official regulations published in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* (SOR) series, which is the official source of federal and provincial regulations in Canada.

- **Section 3 of SOR/2016-181**: This specific section contains the legal provision that formally **cancels or removes** the referenced regulation. The exact content of the repealed regulation (e.g., its subject matter—such as licensing, safety standards, or administrative procedures) is not provided in the given text, but the repeal implies that it was previously governing a specific area of regulation.

- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, administrative procedures, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are now **no longer enforceable**. Entities or individuals previously subject to it must refer to the current, applicable regulations in place after the repeal.

- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed to:
  - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions.
  - Align with new legislation or policy directions.
  - Avoid legal inconsistencies or overlaps.
  - Streamline regulatory frameworks.

To determine the specific subject matter of the repealed regulation (e.g., workplace safety, product standards, environmental rules), one would need to consult the full text of the original regulation prior to its repeal or the explanatory notes accompanying SOR/2016-181.
