**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a formal administrative transfer of responsibilities within the Canadian public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. Here is a comprehensive breakdown:

1. **Issuing Authority**:  
   The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council. This is the formal method by which federal government decisions are made and enacted, typically acting on the advice and recommendation of the Prime Minister.

2. **Legal Basis**:  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to reorganize public service structures by transferring control and supervision of specific branches or functions from one department to another, provided such transfers are justified and within the scope of the Act.

3. **Subject of the Transfer**:  
   The specific unit being transferred is the **Communications Coordination Services Branch (CCSB)**. This branch is part of the **Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS)**, which historically has been responsible for infrastructure, government operations, and public service support functions.

4. **Nature of the Transfer**:  
   The transfer involves the **control and supervision** of the CCSB. This means that the branch will no longer be administratively managed or overseen by the Department of Public Works and Government Services. Instead, it will come under the authority, management, and operational oversight of the **Canada Information Office (CIO)**.

5. **Effective Date**:  
   The transfer becomes effective on **September 1, 2001**. This date marks the point at which the new administrative structure takes full effect, and all responsibilities, reporting lines, and operational functions of the CCSB are transferred to the Canada Information Office.

6. **Purpose and Implication**:  
   - The transfer likely reflects a strategic realignment to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government communications.  
   - By placing the Communications Coordination Services Branch under the Canada Information Office, the government may be aiming to strengthen the coordination of official communications, public information dissemination, and media relations.  
   - The Canada Information Office, as a key entity in managing government messaging and public outreach, is well-positioned to oversee communications functions, ensuring consistency and accuracy in official communications across federal institutions.

7. **Impact on Public Service Operations**:  
   - Staff within the CCSB will now report to the Canada Information Office, potentially leading to changes in reporting structures, performance metrics, and interdepartmental collaboration.  
   - The branch’s functions—such as managing official communications, coordinating messaging during emergencies, or supporting government public affairs—will now be integrated into the broader public information strategy of the Canada Information Office.

8. **Legal and Administrative Significance**:  
   This regulation exemplifies the flexibility of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act in allowing the federal government to restructure its public service units to meet evolving policy, operational, or strategic needs. It also underscores the importance of centralized coordination in government communications.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation formally transfers the administrative control and supervision of the Communications Coordination Services Branch from the Department of Public Works and Government Services to the Canada Information Office, effective September 1, 2001. The move is grounded in statutory authority and aims to enhance the coordination and effectiveness of government communications by aligning this critical function with a dedicated public information entity.
