**Detailed Summary of the CUSMA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *CUSMA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules of origin for specific categories of goods, including "casual goods," under the framework of the **Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**.

- **Primary Statutory Reference**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)* – Provides the enabling power for the regulation.  
  - *S.C. 1997, c. 36* – Likely refers to prior customs legislation or framework supporting origin rules.

These regulations are part of the broader implementation of CUSMA, which aims to promote trade by establishing clear rules determining the origin of goods for tariff treatment purposes.

### **2. Definition of "Casual Goods"**

**Casual goods** are defined as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, commercial, occupational, institutional, or similar use**.

- This means the goods are typically **personal, temporary, or non-commercial in nature** (e.g., items acquired for personal use, gifts, or incidental purchases).
- They are distinct from **commercial goods**, which are imported with a clear commercial purpose (such as resale, manufacturing input, or business operations).

This definition is critical because it establishes a **special rule of origin** for goods that do not enter the supply chain with commercial intent.

### **3. Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in the United States**

When casual goods are **purchased in the United States**, their origin is determined based on **marking requirements**:

#### ✅ Origin in the United States:
- The goods must:
  1. Be **marked in accordance with U.S. marking laws**, and  
  2. The marking must **indicate that the goods are the product of the United States or Canada**.

> Example: A U.S.-marked item stating "Made in USA" or "Made in Canada" qualifies as originating in the U.S.

#### ✅ Origin in Mexico:
- The goods must be **marked in accordance with U.S. marking laws** and **indicate that the goods are the product of Mexico**.

> Example: A U.S.-marked item stating "Made in Mexico" qualifies as originating in Mexico.

#### ⚠️ No Marking or Ambiguous Marking:
- If the goods **do not bear any mark**, or if the mark **does not indicate** that they are the product of the U.S. or Canada (or Mexico), then the origin is **not automatically established** under this rule.

> Note: The absence of a mark or an incorrect/incomplete mark may lead to uncertainty in origin, potentially requiring further assessment by customs authorities.

### **4. Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in Mexico**

When casual goods are **purchased in Mexico**, the origin is determined based on **Mexican marking laws**:

#### ✅ Origin in Mexico:
- The goods must:
  1. Be **marked in accordance with Mexican marking laws**, and  
  2. The marking must **indicate that the goods are the product of Mexico or Canada**.

> Example: A Mexican-marked item stating "Hecho en México" or "Hecho en Canadá" qualifies as originating in Mexico.

#### ✅ Origin in the United States:
- The goods must be **marked in accordance with Mexican marking laws** and **indicate that the goods are the product of the United States**.

> Example: A Mexican-marked item stating "Hecho en Estados Unidos" qualifies as originating in the U.S.

#### ⚠️ No Marking or Ambiguous Marking:
- If the goods **do not bear a mark**, or if the mark **fails to indicate** that they are from Mexico or Canada (or the U.S.), then the origin is **not established** under this rule.

> Again, the absence or inaccuracy of marking can result in ambiguity and may require customs review.

---

### **5. Effective Date and Implementation**

- These regulations **come into force on the day that Section 190 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act (CUSMA Implementation Act) comes into force**.
- If the regulations are **registered (published) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures alignment with the broader implementation timeline of CUSMA and provides a clear, predictable entry point for compliance.

### **6. Relevance and Practical Implications**

#### For Importers and Traders:
- These rules simplify the determination of origin for **non-commercial goods** (e.g., personal items, gifts, or items acquired incidentally).
- Importers do not need to prove substantial transformation or value addition—only that the **marking complies with the country of sale’s laws** and **correctly identifies the country of origin**.
- This supports **free movement of casual goods** under CUSMA, allowing them to benefit from preferential tariff treatment based on their **actual country of origin**.

#### For Customs Authorities:
- The rules provide a **clear, objective, and rule-based framework** to assess origin.
- Marking compliance is the key factor, reducing the need for complex documentation or value assessments.

#### For Consumers and Individuals:
- Individuals purchasing casual goods (e.g., souvenirs, personal items) can expect **tariff benefits** if the goods are properly marked and originate from a CUSMA partner country.

### **7. Amended Version and Current Status**

- These regulations were **first issued in July 2020** (as per SI/2020-33).
- They were **amended by SI/2020-46**, which updated or clarified certain provisions to ensure consistency with evolving CUSMA implementation and administrative practices.

> As of the current date, these are **in force and active**, forming part of the operational framework for determining origin under CUSMA.

### **Conclusion**

The *CUSMA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* establish a **simplified, marking-based rule of origin** for goods not imported for commercial or industrial purposes. By focusing on **marking compliance** and **country-specific labeling laws**, the rules enable casual goods to benefit from preferential tariff treatment under CUSMA—whether acquired in the United States or Mexico—without requiring complex documentation or proof of transformation.

This regulation reflects CUSMA’s emphasis on **practicality, transparency, and ease of compliance**, especially for small-scale or personal imports, while maintaining alignment with international trade standards.

**Key Takeaway**:  
*For casual goods, origin is determined by the marking on the product—provided it complies with the marking laws of the country where the goods were acquired and correctly identifies the country of origin.*
