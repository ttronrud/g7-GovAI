**Detailed Summary of the Pension Plan Transfer Agreements Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 18, s. 35)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Pension Plan Transfer Agreements Regulations* were enacted by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under two key statutory authorities:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(v.6)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**

These regulations establish the legal framework governing the **transfer of pension benefits** from certain private-sector registered pension plans to the **Public Service Superannuation (PSS) system** when public service employees move from non-public-sector employers to the federal public service.

The regulations came into force on **August 28, 1998**, and are designed to ensure **fair, consistent, and actuarially sound treatment** of pensionable service and benefit entitlements during such transfers.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA). |
| **Demand for Funds** | A formal request by the Minister for payment from an employer to cover pension benefits owed to a former employee who has transitioned into the public service. This is based on an agreement under section 40.2(2) of the PSSA. |
| **Employee** | A person who previously worked for an eligible employer and has ceased employment there, but is now or will become employed in the federal public service. |
| **Employer** | An "eligible employer" that has entered into a transfer agreement with the Minister under section 40.2(2) of the PSSA. |
| **Pensionable Service** | Service that counts toward pension entitlements under the PSSA. Includes past service where the employee is entitled to count it under section 147.1(10)(a) of the *Income Tax Act*. |
| **Registered Pension Plan (RPP)** | A pension plan registered under section 147.1 of the *Income Tax Act*. |

> **Note on Eligibility Criteria for a Pension Plan**:  
> A pension plan qualifies under section 40.2(1) of the PSSA if:
> - It has **at least 10 active participants** at the time the employer enters into a transfer agreement; **or**
> - It was established as a result of a **divestiture of service** under section 40.1 of the PSSA.

### **Core Provisions of the Regulations**

#### **1. Determination of the "Demand for Funds"**
The amount the Minister may request from an employer (i.e., the "demand for funds") is calculated as follows:

> **Total Demand = (A) + (B)**  
> Where:
> - **(A)** = The **actuarially calculated value** of all benefits that would have been payable under **Parts I and III of the PSSA** for the employee’s pensionable service.  
>   - This amount is capped at the value determined by the transfer agreement.
> - **(B)** = **Interest** on the amount in (A), calculated from the date of payment, as determined by the Minister under **subparagraph 40.2(3)(a)(ii)** of the PSSA.

> ⚠️ *This interest is not a simple interest rate but is set by the Minister in accordance with the Act’s prescribed methodology.*

#### **2. Treatment of Part-Time Service**
- Any period of **part-time service** credited to an employee by the employer is treated as **part-time service** under the Act.
- However, such periods are **not automatically converted** to full-time equivalents unless otherwise required by credit-splitting rules.

#### **3. Credit-Splitting Provisions**
- If an employee’s service period is subject to **credit-splitting** under a federal or provincial law (e.g., due to employment in multiple roles or across jurisdictions), the period is credited **on a pro-rata basis**.
- This ensures that service is fairly allocated between different pension plans or systems.

#### **4. Retention of Pensionable Service for Benefit Eligibility**
- The **total period of pensionable service** (as defined above) is retained when determining eligibility for any future pension benefit under the PSSA.
- This means that even if a portion of service is transferred, the full period remains relevant for pension calculations.

#### **5. Deemed Pensionable Service Upon Payment**
- If an employer has paid the **full amount** of the demand for funds into the **Superannuation Account**, the corresponding period of service is **deemed to be pensionable service** under subsection 6(1) of the PSSA.
- This allows the employee to count that service toward their pension entitlements without needing to re-verify it.

#### **6. Deemed Service When Payment Is Incomplete**
If the employer has **not fully paid** the demand for funds, the treatment of the service period depends on the nature of the service credited:

| Scenario | Treatment |
|--------|----------|
| **Only full-time service is credited** | The period is **pro-rated** based on the amounts paid by the employer and is deemed to be the **most recent period** of service. |
| **Service includes both part-time and full-time components** | The entire period is **converted to full-time service**, and then **costed as full-time service**. It is then deemed to be the **most recent period**. |

> ✅ This ensures that the employee’s service is fairly represented in the public service pension calculation, even if partial payments were made.

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

1. **Facilitate Transition**: Enables employees who leave a private-sector employer (with a registered pension plan) and join the federal public service to have their pension rights recognized and integrated into the PSS system.

2. **Ensure Fairness and Consistency**: Provides a standardized, actuarially sound method for calculating the value of transferred benefits, preventing under- or over-payment.

3. **Preserve Pension Entitlements**: Maintains the continuity of pensionable service, ensuring employees are not penalized for transitioning into public service.

4. **Administrative Clarity**: Defines how part-time service, credit-splitting, and partial payments are treated—providing clear guidance to employers, employees, and pension administrators.

5. **Compliance with Tax and Pension Laws**: Aligns with the *Income Tax Act* (e.g., section 147.1(10)(a)) regarding past service eligibility.

### **Key Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Employers must enter into a formal transfer agreement** with the Minister before any transfer can occur.
- The **Minister has discretion** in determining interest on unpaid amounts, based on established actuarial principles.
- Employees **retain full credit** for their pensionable service, even if only partially transferred.
- The **Superannuation Account** acts as the central repository for transferred benefits and records.
- The regulations **do not require the employee to re-qualify** for pension benefits—existing service is preserved and counted.

### **Effective Date**

### **Conclusion**

The *Pension Plan Transfer Agreements Regulations* provide a **comprehensive, equitable, and legally grounded mechanism** for transferring pension benefits from private-sector registered pension plans into the federal public service superannuation system. By clearly defining the calculation of demands for funds, treating part-time and split service appropriately, and preserving pensionable service for future benefits, these regulations ensure that public service employees are not disadvantaged when transitioning from private-sector employment.

They represent a critical piece of administrative infrastructure that supports **employee mobility**, **pension portability**, and **intergovernmental consistency** in public service retirement planning.

> **Note**: These regulations apply specifically to employees moving into the federal public service from eligible private-sector employers who have a registered pension plan meeting the defined criteria. They do not apply to all public service transfers or to employees in other public service contexts (e.g., provincial or municipal services).
