### **Key Provisions and Components**

#### **1. Definition of "Minister"**
- In this Order, *"Minister"* refers specifically to the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.
- This minister is responsible for administering and approving applications for ex-gratia payments.

---

#### **2. Eligibility Criteria for Ex-Gratia Payment**
An individual is eligible for a $20,000 ex-gratia payment if they meet **all of the following conditions**:

- **Paid the Head Tax or Had It Paid on Their Behalf**  
  The applicant must have:
  - Paid the head tax under one of the following laws:
    - *An Act to Restrict and Regulate Chinese Immigration into Canada*, **S.C. 1885, c. 71** (the original head tax law), or
    - Any **subsequent amendment** to that Act.
    - *An Act Respecting the Immigration of Chinese Persons*, **S.N. 1906 (6 Ed. VII), c. 2** (Newfoundland law), or
    - Any **subsequent amendment** to that Act.
  - The payment was made in connection with Chinese immigration to Canada.

- **Connection to Canada**
  The applicant must be:
  - A **Canadian citizen** or a **permanent resident of Canada**, OR
  - In the **opinion of the Minister**, have a **long-standing connection to Canada** (this allows for flexibility in cases where individuals may not be formal residents but have deep historical ties).

- **Date of Death or Survival**
  The applicant must have been **alive on February 6, 2006**.  
  This date marks the cutoff for eligibility, ensuring that only those who lived through the period of the head tax policy are eligible.

#### **3. Application Process and Deadlines**

- **Deadline for Applications**:  
  All applications must be submitted to the Minister **on or before March 31, 2008**.

- **Form Requirements**:  
  Applications must be submitted in a form **approved by the Minister**.

- **Supporting Evidence**:  
  Applicants must provide **such evidence as the Minister deems necessary** to verify their eligibility (e.g., tax records, immigration documents, birth certificates, affidavits, etc.).

- **Late Applications (Exception)**:  
  If an application is submitted **after March 31, 2008**, it may still be accepted **if the Minister is satisfied** that the applicant was **unable to submit it earlier due to facts or circumstances beyond their control** (e.g., illness, disability, death of a family member, or other unforeseen events).

---

#### **4. Nature of the Payment**

- Each payment is a **one-time, lump sum of $20,000**.
- The payment is **not a legal settlement** or a recognition of liability.
- It is an **ex-gratia** (voluntary, without legal obligation) payment.

---

#### **5. Legal and Policy Clarification**

- **No Admission of Liability**:  
  The payment **shall not be construed as an admission of liability** on the part of the Crown (i.e., the Government of Canada).  
  This is a critical legal distinction — the government is not acknowledging that it wrongfully imposed the tax or that it is financially responsible for the harm caused.

- **Purpose of the Payment**:  
  The payment is intended to **acknowledge the historical injustice** of the head tax and to provide **moral and financial redress** to those who were affected by discriminatory policies.

---

### **Historical Context**
The head tax was introduced in 1885 and continued in various forms until 1923. It was a discriminatory measure targeting Chinese immigrants, who were required to pay a fee (initially $50, later increasing to $500) to enter Canada. The policy reflected racial prejudice and was part of a broader system of exclusionary immigration laws. This Order is part of Canada’s ongoing efforts to address historical injustices and promote reconciliation.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Redress for Historical Injustice**:  
  The Order provides a formal mechanism for descendants and survivors of Chinese immigrants to receive compensation for a policy that caused significant financial and emotional hardship.

- **Symbolic and Moral Value**:  
  While not legally binding, the ex-gratia payment serves as a symbolic gesture of **apology and recognition** of past discrimination.

- **Limited Scope**:  
  The Order applies only to individuals who paid the head tax or had it paid on their behalf, and only under the specified laws. It does not cover all Chinese immigrants or those who faced other forms of discrimination.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Order Respecting Ex-Gratia Payments to Chinese Head Tax Payers* is a significant step in Canada’s process of **historical reconciliation**. It provides eligible individuals with a one-time, non-liability-based payment of $20,000 to acknowledge the burden imposed by discriminatory immigration policies. The regulation is carefully structured to ensure fairness, transparency, and historical accuracy, while clearly stating that the payment is not a legal admission of fault by the Crown.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to acknowledging its past, supporting affected communities, and promoting equity in immigration policy.
