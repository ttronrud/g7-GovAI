**Detailed Summary of the *Inuk of Fort George Observer Regulations* (S.C. 1984, c. 18)**

### **Overview**
The *Inuk of Fort George Observer Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the **Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act** to govern the appointment, election, and removal of an **Observer** representing the Inuk of Fort George within the Chisasibi Band. These regulations ensure that the voice of the Inuk community is formally recognized in the governance structure of the Chisasibi Band, particularly in matters affecting Indigenous rights and representation.

The regulations are made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to **subsection 36(2)** of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act. The regulations may be cited as the *Inuk of Fort George Observer Regulations*.

### **Trigger for Election or Vacancy of the Observer**

The regulations establish two main scenarios that trigger the need for an election or vacancy in the observer position:

#### 1. **General Election of Chisasibi Band Council**
- If the council elected during a general election **does not include an Inuk of Fort George**, then:
  - The office of any **Inuk of Fort George who is a council member** becomes vacant.
  - After a successor is elected, the council will no longer include an Inuk of Fort George.

#### 2. **Vacancy of the Observer Position**
- Under **section 12 or 13** of the Act, the observer position becomes vacant due to:
  - Death or resignation.
  - Conviction of a violation of regulations under paragraph 67(1)(b) of the Act (related to election misconduct).
  - Appointment as band secretary or treasurer.
  - Appointment as a judge or Crown prosecutor.
  - Commencement of imprisonment for an indictable offence.
  - Mental incompetence under provincial law.

> In either case (election or vacancy), the **landholding corporation must call a meeting within 30 days**.

---

### **Calling and Conducting the Election Meeting**

#### **Notice Requirements**
- The landholding corporation must **post a public notice** in **Chisasibi**, at least **three days before** the meeting date.
- The notice must be in **English, Cree, and Inuttituut** (the official languages of the Inuit community).
- It must clearly state:
  - Purpose, date, time, and place of the meeting.
  - Where nominations will be received.
  - That nominations for the observer will be accepted **up to 24 hours before** the meeting.

#### **Nominations**
- Any **eligible Inuk of Fort George** may nominate another eligible Inuk of Fort George.
- Nominations must be submitted in **writing** and signed by the person being nominated.
- The nomination is valid only if the nominee is eligible to run.

---

### **Eligibility to Vote or Nominate**

An Inuk of Fort George is eligible to:
- Vote,
- Nominate a candidate,
- Be a candidate for observer,

**provided they meet the following conditions**:

✅ Age: 18 years or older  
✅ Not declared mentally incompetent under provincial law  

❌ **Excluded if any of the following apply**:
1. Convicted of violating a regulation under **paragraph 67(1)(b)** of the Act within the **four years prior** to the meeting.
2. Serves as **band secretary or treasurer** of the Chisasibi Band.
3. Is a **judge** (under the Judges Act) or a **Crown prosecutor**.
4. Is **currently serving a term of imprisonment** for an indictable offence on the day of the meeting.

> This ensures that individuals with conflict of interest or criminal records are excluded from participating in the election.

---

### **Election Process**

- The **landholding corporation presides** over the voting process.
- Voting occurs by **show of hands** (a simple, accessible method).
- A candidate is selected **only if at least 15 eligible voters** attend the meeting.

#### **Tie-Breaking Procedure**
- If **two or more candidates receive an equal number of votes**, and an additional vote would make one candidate the clear winner:
  - A **re-vote is held**, limited to only those tied candidates (as per section 6 of the Act).
- This ensures a decisive outcome without invalidating the process.

#### **Insufficient Attendance**
- If **fewer than 15 eligible voters** attend:
  - The landholding corporation must **call another meeting**, following the same notice and nomination procedures.

---

### **Notification and Record-Keeping**

Within **seven days** of the observer being selected:
1. The landholding corporation must **post the name of the selected observer** in a public place in Chisasibi.
2. The corporation must send a **written communication** to:
   - The **band secretary** of the Chisasibi Band,
   - The **Secretary of the Council of the Kativik Regional Government**,
   - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

This ensures transparency and official recognition of the elected observer.

---

### **Term of Office of the Observer**

The observer serves a term that ends under **any of the following conditions**:

1. **On the day of a general election** of the Chisasibi Band council.
2. **When an Inuk of Fort George is elected** as a council member of the Chisasibi Band.
3. **When the observer’s position becomes vacant** under section 12 (e.g., resignation, death, conviction, appointment to a public office).
4. **When the landholding corporation declares the position vacant** under section 13 (e.g., repeated absence without cause).

> This ensures that the observer's role is time-limited and tied directly to the governance cycle of the band.

---

### **Vacancy Due to Absence**

A particularly significant provision allows the landholding corporation to **declare the observer’s office vacant** if:
- The observer is **absent from three or more consecutive council meetings**, **without permission** and **not due to illness or incapacity**.

This provision acts as a mechanism to ensure active participation and accountability in governance, preventing inactive or disengaged observers from holding office.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations:
- **Recognize the distinct identity and rights** of the Inuk of Fort George within the broader Indigenous governance framework of Quebec.
- **Ensure equitable representation** by providing a formal, transparent, and legally grounded process for selecting an observer.
- **Protect against undue influence or conflict of interest** through eligibility criteria.
- **Promote inclusivity and cultural sensitivity** by using Inuktitut, Cree, and English in all communications.
- **Balance autonomy with accountability**, with clear procedures for both election and removal.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations derive authority from **subsection 36(2)** of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*, which empowers the Minister to make regulations concerning the observer role.
- They operate within the broader framework of Indigenous self-governance in Quebec, recognizing the unique status of the Inuk of Fort George as a distinct community with rights to representation.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Inuk of Fort George Observer Regulations* establish a clear, fair, and culturally appropriate process for the election and removal of an observer to represent the Inuk of Fort George within the Chisasibi Band. By setting specific eligibility, procedural, and term conditions, the regulations ensure that the observer role remains meaningful, accountable, and aligned with the principles of Indigenous self-determination and community governance.

These regulations reflect a commitment to **inclusive representation**, **transparency**, and **cultural respect**, and serve as a model for Indigenous representation in Canadian governance structures.

*Note: While the regulations are titled in reference to the Inuk of Fort George, they are part of a broader legal framework under the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act, which primarily applies to Cree and Naskapi communities. However, the inclusion of Inuk representation in Chisasibi suggests a cross-community recognition of shared Indigenous rights in northern Quebec.*
