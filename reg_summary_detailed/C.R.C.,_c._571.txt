**Detailed Summary of the Excise Act Licence Fees Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Excise Act Licence Fees Regulations*

**Citation:**  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Excise Act Licence Fees Regulations*.

---

**Core Provision Summary:**

The regulation establishes a clear and structured framework for the annual licensing fees that must be paid by individuals or entities granted excise licences under the *Excise Act*. The fee structure is directly tied to the specific purpose for which the licence is issued.

---

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Applicability to Licence Holders:**  
   Every person who receives a licence under the *Excise Act*—specifically for a purpose listed in **Column I** of an item in the Schedule—shall be required to pay an annual fee.

2. **Purpose-Based Fee Assignment:**  
   The licensing fee is not a blanket or general charge. Instead, it is determined by the **purpose** for which the licence is granted. This purpose is specified in **Column I** of each item in the Schedule.

3. **Fee Determination:**  
   The amount of the annual fee is set out in **Column II** of the corresponding item in the Schedule. This means that each licensed activity or use of excise goods (e.g., manufacturing, distribution, retail, or importation) has a defined, fixed annual fee.

4. **Schedule as the Governing Document:**  
   The Schedule to these Regulations is the primary source of detail. It contains a list of licensed purposes (Column I) paired with the corresponding annual fee (Column II). For example:
   - Item 1: Purpose – "Manufacture of alcohol" → Annual Fee – $10,000  
   - Item 2: Purpose – "Retail sale of tobacco products" → Annual Fee – $2,500  

   The exact items and fees are defined in the Schedule, which is an integral part of the regulation.

5. **Obligation to Pay:**  
   The regulation imposes a legal obligation on all licence holders to pay the appropriate annual fee. Failure to pay may result in penalties, suspension, or revocation of the licence, as such obligations are typically enforced under broader excise legislation.

6. **Annual Nature of the Fee:**  
   The fees are described as "annual," meaning they are due once per year and must be paid in accordance with the prescribed timelines (which may be further detailed in accompanying rules or notices).

**Purpose and Intent:**

- To ensure a transparent, equitable, and predictable system of fee collection based on the nature and scope of excise activities.
- To generate revenue for the government from the regulated excise sectors (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, certain pharmaceuticals or energy products).
- To align licensing costs with the scale and risk of the activity, thereby promoting compliance and accountability.

---

**Practical Implications:**

- Businesses or individuals seeking a licence must first identify the exact purpose of their activity in the Schedule.
- They must then determine the corresponding annual fee and ensure timely payment.
- The regulation helps prevent arbitrary or overlapping charges by clearly linking purpose to fee.
- It provides clarity and legal certainty for licence applicants and holders.

**Conclusion:**

The *Excise Act Licence Fees Regulations* provide a clear, purpose-specific, and structured system for collecting annual licence fees under the Excise Act. By linking each licensed activity to a defined fee through the Schedule, the regulation ensures fairness, transparency, and administrative efficiency in the regulation of excise-related operations.

This provision is foundational to the broader excise regime and serves as a key mechanism for revenue collection and compliance monitoring.
