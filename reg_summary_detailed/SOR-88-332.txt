### **Detailed Summary of the Blouses and Shirts Remission Order (S.C. 1987, c. 49)**

---

#### **Overview**
The **Blouses and Shirts Remission Order**, made under section 101 of the *Customs Tariff*, grants **customs duty remission** to Canadian manufacturers of **blouses and shirts** and **coordinated apparel** for imports made between **January 1, 1989, and December 31, 1997**. This order aims to support the domestic manufacturing sector by reducing the cost of imported apparel, thereby promoting local production, protecting jobs, and encouraging the use of Canadian fabrics and equipment.

The remission is **not a blanket exemption** but is **conditional**, based on specific criteria related to manufacturing activity, fabric sourcing, financial performance, and compliance with reporting and security requirements.

## **Remission Provisions (Core Benefit)**

### **1. Scope of Remission**
- Applies to **blouses and shirts** imported into Canada between **January 1, 1989, and December 31, 1997**.
- Remission is granted to:
  - **Blouse and shirt manufacturers**
  - **Coordinated apparel manufacturers**

> The remission is calculated under **section 4 or 5** of the Order, depending on the type of manufacturer.

---

### **2. Remission for Blouse and Shirt Manufacturers**

#### **For 1989:**
- Remission = **20% of the average net factory value (NFV)** of blouses and coordinated apparel manufactured in Canada over the **three years immediately preceding 1989** (i.e., 1986–1988).

#### **For 1990 to 1997:**
- Remission = **20% of the average NFV** of blouses and coordinated apparel manufactured in Canada over the **three years immediately preceding the year of import** (e.g., for 1995, use 1992–1994).

**But only if** the manufacturer meets a **fabric purchase threshold**:
| Year | Required Fabric Purchase Threshold |
|------|------------------------------------|
| 1990 or 1991 | ≥ 5% of total fabric purchases in that year |
| 1992 or 1993 | ≥ 10% of total fabric purchases in that year |
| 1994 or 1995 | ≥ 15% of total fabric purchases in that year |
| 1996 or 1997 | ≥ 20% of total fabric purchases in that year |

> *Fabric purchases include those from Canada or the U.S., used in Canadian manufacturing of blouses and shirts by December 31, 1997.*

#### **If Threshold Not Met:**
- Remission = **15% of the average NFV** of blouses and coordinated apparel over the **three years immediately preceding the year of import**.

---

### **3. Remission for Coordinated Apparel Manufacturers**

- Remission = **10% of the average NFV** of coordinated apparel and blouses and shirts manufactured in Canada over the **three years immediately preceding the year of import**.

> This is a lower percentage than for blouse and shirt manufacturers, reflecting the different nature and market positioning of coordinated apparel.

---

## **Adjustment Mechanism: Net Factory Value Reduction**

> If the **net factory value (NFV)** in a given year is **less than** the average NFV over the prior three years, then:
- The **NFV used for the next year’s remission calculation is reduced by 2.5% for every 1% decrease** in NFV.

**Examples:**
- If NFV drops by 3%, the next year’s base NFV is reduced by 7.5% (3 × 2.5%).
- This acts as a **penalty mechanism** to discourage underperformance or declining sales.

#### **Exclusions from Adjustment:**
- The adjustment **does not apply** to the **1991 or 1992** calendar years.
- The adjustment **does not apply** to the **1993 or 1994** calendar years.

> This likely reflects a policy intention to allow recovery during early implementation or transitional periods.

## **Conditions for Remission (Mandatory Requirements)**

To qualify for remission, a manufacturer must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Minimum Business Duration**  
   - Must have been in business manufacturing blouses and shirts or coordinated apparel for **at least six months** in the calendar year when the goods are imported.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   - Must file a claim with the **Minister of Finance** **within three years** of the date of import.

3. **Reporting Obligations**  
   - Must provide the **Minister** with any information required for administration of the Order, in a form determined by the Minister.  
   - Must provide the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** with reports on manufacturing activities (e.g., production volumes, fabric use, sales) upon request.

4. **Guarantee Bond or Security**  
   - Must provide a **guarantee bond or other security** to the Minister:
     - Equal to **the customs duties payable on the blouses and shirts for which remission is claimed**, **or**
     - $1,000,000 (whichever is **less**)

> This ensures financial accountability and prevents abuse of the remission program.

## **Key Policy Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Support for Domestic Manufacturing** | Encourages Canadian firms to produce blouses and shirts, reducing reliance on foreign imports. |
| **Promotion of Canadian Fabric Use** | Requires manufacturers to source a significant portion of fabrics from Canada or the U.S., with a progressive increase in required domestic fabric purchases over time. |
| **Performance-Based Remission** | Remission is tied to actual manufacturing performance (NFV), creating incentives to maintain or grow production. |
| **Market Stability and Growth** | The gradual increase in fabric sourcing requirements (5% → 20%) encourages long-term investment in Canadian supply chains. |
| **Accountability and Oversight** | Mandatory reporting and bonding ensure transparency and compliance. |
| **Targeted Support** | Lower remission for coordinated apparel reflects its different market dynamics and lower volume. |
