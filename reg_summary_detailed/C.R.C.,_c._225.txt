**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Chicken Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled *The Prince Edward Island Chicken Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal instrument under the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Act), governing the marketing of chickens within and outside the province.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act*, the enabling legislation that provides the legal framework for the regulation of poultry marketing in the province.

- **"Chicken"**: Specifically means a chicken that is **six months of age or younger**, raised or produced in Prince Edward Island (PEI), and is **not raised for egg production**. This definition excludes layers (hens raised solely for egg output), focusing instead on meat-producing chickens.

- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Poultry Meat Commodity Marketing Board*, a statutory body established under the Act to oversee the marketing and pricing of poultry meat in PEI. It has regulatory authority over both local and external markets.

- **"Plan"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Poultry Meat Commodity Marketing Plan*, a policy document developed and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan outlines the objectives, strategies, and operational mechanisms for managing the marketing of poultry meat, including pricing, distribution, and market stability.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted broad powers to regulate the **marketing of chickens** in two key areas:

- **Interprovincial trade**: Sales of chickens between provinces.
- **Export trade**: Sales of chickens to foreign countries.

For these purposes, the Board may exercise **all or any powers** it has under the Act and the Plan when regulating local marketing of chickens within PEI. This means that the powers used in domestic markets (e.g., pricing, quotas, or distribution controls) can be extended to interprovincial and export markets.

This provision ensures consistency and coherence in marketing policies across all channels of trade.

**4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges (Revoked Section)**  
A key provision allows the Commodity Board to:

- **Make orders** that:
  - Fix, impose, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals or businesses within PEI who are involved in the **production or marketing of chickens**.
- **Classify persons into groups** based on their role or type of operation (e.g., small-scale farmers vs. large producers).
- **Set different levies or charges** for members of different groups, allowing for equitable and tailored financial obligations.

> **Note**: The section stating this authority was marked as **"Revoked, SOR/80-90"** — indicating that this specific power was **officially canceled or repealed** in 1980 (under Statutory Order No. 80-90). Therefore, **the current Order does not currently authorize the imposition of levies or charges** as previously outlined.

---

**5. Purpose of Levies and Charges (Historical Context)**  
Even though the levies are now revoked, the *intended purposes* of such charges — if they had been in effect — were:

- To **fund operational expenses** of the Commodity Board.
- To **create reserves** for future use (e.g., during market downturns).
- To **cover losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of chickens.
- To **equalize or adjust** financial outcomes among producers, ensuring that those who earned more from sales do not unfairly benefit at the expense of others who may have had lower returns.

This mechanism was designed to promote **market stability**, **fairness among producers**, and **collective financial resilience** in the poultry sector.

---

**6. Legal and Policy Implications**  
- The Order reflects a **market intervention model** where government-backed boards can regulate pricing and distribution to protect producers and stabilize supply.
- It underscores the importance of **cooperative marketing** in a small-scale agricultural economy like PEI’s, where producers may lack the market power to negotiate fair prices.
- The revocation of levy powers suggests a shift in policy — possibly due to economic, administrative, or political changes — toward **market-based solutions** or **reduced government intervention** in producer pricing.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Prince Edward Island Chicken Order* establishes a regulatory framework for the marketing of young, non-egg-producing chickens in PEI. While it grants the Commodity Board significant authority over interprovincial and export trade, a key financial tool — the imposition of levies or charges — has been **formally revoked** since 1980. This means that the Board currently **does not have the power to collect fees or charges from producers** for marketing activities, even if it can still regulate trade practices under the Act and the Marketing Plan.

The Order remains relevant as a foundational policy document that supports coordinated, equitable, and stable poultry marketing in PEI, though its financial mechanisms have been updated or removed in favor of alternative approaches.
