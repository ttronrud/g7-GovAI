**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Order Acknowledging Receipt of Assessments under the Species at Risk Act  
**Source:** S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutory Instrument of Canada, 2002, Chapter 29)  
**Issued by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
**On the recommendation of:** The Minister of the Environment  

---

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Purpose of the Regulation:**  
   This regulation serves as an official acknowledgment by the federal government that it has received and formally recognized scientific assessments of certain wildlife species. These assessments were conducted under the authority of subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA).

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is grounded in **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act**, which empowers the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) to assess the status of wildlife species and determine whether they are at risk of extinction. The assessments are a critical step in the process of identifying species that may require protection under SARA.

3. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is an independent scientific body responsible for evaluating the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada. Its assessments are based on scientific data and are used to inform government decisions on species protection.

4. **Scope of the Acknowledgment:**  
   The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) formally acknowledges receipt of these assessments **specifically for the species listed in the annexed schedule**. This means that the government recognizes the scientific findings and status determinations made by COSEWIC for those species.

5. **Implications of the Acknowledgment:**  
   - The formal recognition of the assessments initiates the next phase of the SARA process.  
   - It provides the basis for the Minister of the Environment to determine whether a species should be listed as **endangered, threatened, or special concern** under SARA.  
   - If a species is found to be at risk, it may be eligible for legal protection, recovery planning, and conservation measures.  
   - The acknowledgment also ensures transparency and accountability in the decision-making process by documenting the scientific input that informs policy.

6. **Timing and Effectiveness:**  
   The regulation takes effect upon its **making** (i.e., when it is formally issued and comes into force). This means that the acknowledgment is immediate and binding for the species listed in the schedule.

7. **Annexed Schedule:**  
   The regulation includes a schedule listing the specific species that have been assessed. While the full list is not included in this summary, it typically contains species such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates that are of concern due to population declines, habitat loss, or other threats.

**Overall Significance:**

This regulation is a foundational step in Canada’s species conservation framework. By formally acknowledging COSEWIC assessments, the federal government affirms its commitment to science-based decision-making in protecting biodiversity. It ensures that species at risk are identified and evaluated systematically, paving the way for targeted conservation actions, legal protections, and public awareness.

---

**In Summary:**  
This regulation formally recognizes the completion and submission of scientific assessments by COSEWIC for specific wildlife species under the Species at Risk Act. It marks the official government acceptance of these evaluations, which are essential for determining whether species should be listed as at risk and protected under Canadian law.
