**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Sawmill Bay N.W.T.) from Disposal Order**

**1. Title and Citation:**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Sawmill Bay N.W.T.) from Disposal Order*. It may be cited in legal or administrative references using this exact title, ensuring clarity and consistency in official documentation.

**2. Purpose and Objective:**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to permanently remove a specific parcel of land located in Sawmill Bay, Northwest Territories (N.W.T.), from the pool of land available for disposal under the *Territorial Lands Act*. This withdrawal is not for commercial development or general land use, but specifically to designate the land for the construction and operation of an airstrip.

**3. Legal Basis:**  
The Order is issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act*, which governs the administration, disposition, and use of land within the Northwest Territories. Section(s) of the Act related to land disposal and withdrawal procedures provide the legal foundation for this action. By withdrawing the land from disposal, the government ensures that the parcel will not be offered for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer to private or public entities for non-airstrip purposes.

**4. Description of the Land:**  
The specific parcel of land in question is located at Sawmill Bay, Northwest Territories. The exact boundaries of the land are defined in a detailed schedule attached to the Order. This schedule provides a legal description of the land, typically referencing survey numbers, coordinates, or legal descriptions used in land records.

**5. Visual Representation and Reference:**  
The land designated for the airstrip is clearly marked on a sketch plan that is officially on file. The sketch plan is identified as **"File No. 5-2-28"** and is maintained in the **Resources Division of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)** in Ottawa. On this plan, the area required for the airstrip is **bordered in red**, visually indicating the extent of the land being withdrawn. This visual reference serves as a key tool for planning, approval processes, and future land use assessments.

**6. Scope of Withdrawal:**  
The withdrawal applies exclusively to the **surface** of the land. This means that the surface rights (such as the right to use, develop, or dispose of the land) are being removed from the disposal pool. It does not necessarily affect subsurface rights (such as mineral rights), unless otherwise specified in accompanying legislation or regulations. The withdrawal is limited to the specific area required for the airstrip and does not extend to surrounding or adjacent parcels unless explicitly stated.

**7. Use and Intended Function:**  
The land is being set aside specifically for the construction and operational use of an airstrip. This may include infrastructure such as runways, taxiways, aprons, lighting systems, and associated facilities. The airstrip is likely intended to serve remote communities, support emergency services, facilitate transportation in a sparsely populated region, or aid in economic or environmental activities in the area.

**8. Administrative and Governance Implications:**  
- The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) retains responsibility for managing the land and ensuring compliance with the withdrawal.  
- The Order is binding and enforceable under the *Territorial Lands Act*.  
- Future land use planning, environmental assessments, or development approvals for the area will be subject to this withdrawal, ensuring that the land is not used for other purposes without formal authorization.

**9. Legal and Policy Significance:**  
This Order reflects a strategic land use decision by the territorial government to prioritize infrastructure development that supports accessibility, safety, and community needs—particularly in remote or northern regions where transportation is a critical factor. It also demonstrates the government’s commitment to balancing land management with practical, community-based needs.

**10. Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally and permanently withdraws a defined parcel of land at Sawmill Bay, N.W.T., from disposal under the *Territorial Lands Act* to serve as an airstrip. The action is supported by a detailed legal description and a visual plan on file, ensuring transparency and accountability. It represents a key step in the development of essential infrastructure in the region, with implications for transportation, emergency response, and regional connectivity.

**Key Takeaway:**  
This Order ensures that a specific piece of land in Sawmill Bay will be dedicated solely to airstrip development, preventing any future disposal or commercial use, and reinforcing the government’s commitment to infrastructure that supports remote community needs.
