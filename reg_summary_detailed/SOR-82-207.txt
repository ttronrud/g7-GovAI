### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**. It no longer exists in force.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2006-310, section 5**, which is a statutory instrument (a regulation or order made under authority of a statute) published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on January 31, 2006.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 5 of SOR/2006-310 explicitly removes or cancels a prior regulation. The specific regulation being repealed is not named in the provided text, which limits the detail available.
- **Context of SOR/2006-310**: This regulation typically relates to the **regulation of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** or possibly a federal regulatory framework related to telecommunications, broadcasting, or consumer protection. However, without the full text of SOR/2006-310, the exact subject of the repealed regulation cannot be determined.

Any references to it in prior legal documents, court decisions, or administrative actions must now be interpreted in light of the repeal.

### Important Limitation:
Due to the absence of the original regulation’s name or content in the provided text, a detailed summary of *what* the regulation governed (e.g., rules on advertising, licensing, service standards, etc.) **cannot be provided**. The summary is limited to the procedural and legal fact that the regulation was formally repealed by SOR/2006-310, section 5.

To obtain a more detailed summary of the repealed regulation, one should:
- Access the full text of **SOR/2006-310** from the *Canada Gazette* or the official government legislation database (e.g., [canada.gazette.gc.ca](https://www.canada.gazette.gc.ca)).
- Locate the specific regulation that was repealed under section 5.
- Review the original text to understand its scope, purpose, and application.

### Conclusion:
The provided information confirms that a regulation was formally repealed by **SOR/2006-310, section 5**, but due to the lack of identifying details, no substantive content of the repealed regulation can be summarized. The repeal signifies the end of its legal effect, and any future reference to it would be obsolete unless it was later reinstated or replaced.
