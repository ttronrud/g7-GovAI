**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulatory instrument is a **transfer of control and supervision** of specific public service components between two Canadian federal departments, as authorized under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

- The transfer is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign control and supervision of certain public service functions between departments.
- This particular transfer is formalized through a **statutory instrument** (SI/93-142), published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **June 30, 1993**, page 3234.
- The original transfer of certain public service responsibilities from the **Department of National Health and Welfare (DNHW)** to the **Department of Employment and Immigration (DEI)** occurred earlier via **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1488**, dated June 25, 1993.

### **Nature of the Transfer**

On the basis of the above legal authority, the **Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, now **reverses** the earlier transfer and **returns** specific units and programs to the **Department of National Health and Welfare**.

These units are located within the **Social Service Programs Branch** of the Department of Employment and Immigration and include the following:

1. **Family Violence Prevention Division**  
   – Focuses on policies, programs, and services aimed at preventing family violence and supporting victims.  
   – Includes prevention strategies, outreach, education, and support services for individuals and communities affected by domestic violence.

2. **Children’s Bureau and Attendant Brighter Futures Programs**  
   – The Children’s Bureau provides services related to child welfare, protection, and development.  
   – The *Brighter Futures* programs are designed to support children and youth in high-risk or disadvantaged circumstances through early intervention, education, and community-based initiatives.

3. **Community Action Program for Children**  
   – A program that empowers communities to develop and implement local initiatives to support children’s well-being, safety, and development.  
   – Emphasizes community-based, participatory approaches to child-related issues.

4. **HIV/AIDS Research and Development**  
   – Conducts and supports research into the causes, prevention, treatment, and social implications of HIV/AIDS.  
   – Aims to improve health outcomes and develop evidence-based strategies for public health policy and service delivery.

5. **Seniors Independence Research Program**  
   – Focuses on research into ways to promote the independence, health, and quality of life of older adults.  
   – Addresses issues such as aging in place, long-term care, accessibility, and social participation.

### **Key Implications**

- **Reversion of Responsibility**: The units previously under the DEI are now placed under the administrative and operational control of the **Department of National Health and Welfare**, which has a broader mandate related to health, social services, and welfare.
- **Policy Alignment**: This transfer aligns these programs with broader health and social services priorities, particularly those related to child welfare, family health, and aging populations—core areas of the DNHW’s mandate.
- **Improved Coordination**: By centralizing these programs under a health-focused department, the government aims to improve interdepartmental coordination, policy coherence, and service delivery in areas affecting vulnerable populations.
- **Continuity of Services**: The transfer is intended to ensure continuity in service delivery while allowing for more effective integration with health and social services frameworks.

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This regulation reflects a **restructuring of public service responsibilities** in response to evolving policy priorities and organizational needs.
- It demonstrates the flexibility of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act in enabling the government to realign departments based on strategic goals.
- The action is not a reorganization of personnel or budget, but a change in **control and supervision**—meaning the administrative oversight, policy direction, and accountability remain with the DNHW.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation marks a significant reallocation of public service functions, transferring five key programs from the Department of Employment and Immigration back to the Department of National Health and Welfare. The move strengthens the health and social services framework by integrating family violence prevention, child welfare, HIV/AIDS research, and senior independence initiatives under a department with a direct mandate in health and social well-being. It underscores the government’s intent to improve service delivery and policy coherence in vulnerable populations through better interdepartmental alignment.
