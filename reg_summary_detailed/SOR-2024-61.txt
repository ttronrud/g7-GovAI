### **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Sudan) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose**

The **Special Economic Measures (Sudan) Regulations** were introduced by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, in response to two critical concerns:

- The **grave breach of international peace and security** in the Republic of Sudan, which has led to or is likely to lead to a **serious international crisis**.
- The **gross and systematic human rights violations** committed in Sudan.

These concerns form the legal and moral foundation for imposing **economic sanctions** on individuals and entities linked to the Sudanese government, military, and affiliated organizations.

The regulations are enacted under specific provisions of the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**, including:
- Paragraph 4(1)(a)a: Authority to impose measures against persons undermining peace, security, or stability.
- Subsections 4(1.1)b, (2)c, and (3): Powers to list individuals and entities and to restrict dealings with them.

#### **2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- The **Republic of Sudan**, including all its political subdivisions (e.g., states, provinces).
- All **government bodies**, departments, agencies, and their political subdivisions.

#### **6. Ongoing Compliance Obligations (Section 6)**

Certain **financial institutions and businesses** must **continuously monitor** their operations to determine if they are in possession or control of property owned, held, or controlled by a listed person. These include:

- **Cooperative credit societies, credit unions, caisses populaires** (regulated by provincial laws).
- **Insurance companies** and **fraternal benefit societies** (regulated under provincial or federal law).

- **Loan companies**.
- **Entities** involved in opening client accounts (as per the *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act*).

All persons and entities listed in Section 6 must **disclose without delay** to either:
- The **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, or
- The **Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)**

The following information:
- The **existence of property** in their possession or control that they believe is owned or controlled by a listed person.
- Any **transaction or proposed transaction** involving such property.

> ⚖️ **No liability** arises for a person who makes such a disclosure in **good faith**. This encourages transparency and protects individuals from legal consequences when reporting suspected violations.

#### **8. Review and Removal of Listings (Section 8)**

- A **listed person** may apply in writing to the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** to have their name removed from the schedule.
- The Minister must assess whether there are **reasonable grounds** to recommend removal to the Governor in Council.
- If there has been a **material change in circumstances** since the last application, the person may submit a **new application**.
- The Minister must respond within **30 days** to such applications.

> This provides a **mechanism for review and correction** of listings, ensuring that sanctions are not applied indefinitely without justification.

---

#### **9. Name Dispute Resolution (Section 9)**

If someone whose name is **similar or identical** to a listed person claims they are **not** that person, they may apply to the Minister for a **certificate confirming they are not the listed person**.

- The Minister must issue the certificate **within 30 days** if it is established the applicant is not the listed person.
- If not, the applicant will be notified of the determination.

> This prevents confusion or misuse of names and protects individuals from wrongful inclusion.

#### **10. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- **Section 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act** allows these regulations to take effect **before publication in the Canada Gazette** — meaning they are immediately enforceable upon registration.
