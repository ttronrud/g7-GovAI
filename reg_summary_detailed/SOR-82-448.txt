**Detailed Summary of the Eggplants and Tomatoes Production (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 4 of the Plant Quarantine Act**. This provision empowers the government to implement measures to prevent the spread of plant pests and diseases that threaten agricultural production and food security.

The purpose of these regulations is to **restrict the production of eggplants and tomatoes** in specific areas of the Municipality of Central Saanich, British Columbia, due to the presence of the **Golden Nematode** (*Globodera rostochiensis*), a destructive soil-borne pest that can severely damage root systems of solanaceous crops (such as tomatoes and eggplants) and is particularly harmful to potatoes.

**2. Official Title**  
The regulations are officially titled:  
**Eggplants and Tomatoes Production (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations**

---

**3. Scope and Geographic Application**  
The restrictions apply to **a defined portion of the Municipality of Central Saanich** in British Columbia, specifically:  
- **All land east of West Saanich Road**, within the Municipality of Central Saanich.

However, **exceptions are made** for certain parcels located in the **South Saanich Land District**. These exempt areas include:

- All property included in **Plans 617R, 642R, and 643R**,  
- Specifically, **Parcel “A” north of Wallace Drive** in the **western half of Section 10**,  
- And **all of Sections 11 and 12 in Range 2 East**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The restriction does **not** apply to these exempt parcels. Thus, eggplant and tomato production is permitted in these specific areas, even though they are otherwise within the restricted zone.

---

**4. Prohibited Activities**  
Under **Section 2**, **no person** may:

- Plant from seed or by transplant,  
- Grow, produce, or harvest  
any **eggplants or tomatoes**  
in the restricted area (east of West Saanich Road),  
**except** as explicitly permitted under the exceptions in Section 2.

This restriction is intended to prevent the spread of the Golden Nematode, which can survive in soil and infect new crops when infected soil is used for planting.

---

**5. Exceptions to the Restriction**  

The regulations include **two key exceptions** where the production of eggplants or tomatoes is **permitted**, even within the restricted zone:

**Exception 1: Personal Consumption**  
A person may grow and harvest eggplants or tomatoes **for their own personal consumption** if:  
- The crops are grown **on their own property**,  
- The harvest is **limited to the property where it was grown**,  
- And the property was **not previously used** (at any time before the regulations came into force) for the **production of potatoes, eggplants, or tomatoes**.

> This exception supports small-scale, home-based gardening and ensures that individuals are not penalized for growing food for personal use, provided they did not engage in commercial or shared crop production in the past.

**Exception 2: Production in Controlled Environments**  
A person may grow eggplants or tomatoes in **artificial medium or sterilized soil** in a **greenhouse** located on their property **if**:  
- The greenhouse is not on land that was previously used (before the regulations came into force) for **field production** of potatoes, eggplants, or tomatoes.  
- The growing medium is **sterilized** (i.e., treated to eliminate pathogens like nematodes), and the environment is **controlled** (e.g., greenhouse with soilless or sanitized growing conditions).

> This exception recognizes that greenhouse cultivation using sterile, non-soil media can reduce the risk of nematode transmission and allows for safe, limited production in protected environments.

**6. Key Objectives of the Regulation**  
- **Protect agricultural and horticultural systems** from the spread of the Golden Nematode.  
- **Prevent contamination** of healthy soil and crops through the movement of infected plant material or soil.  
- **Limit economic and environmental damage** to local farms and gardens.  
- **Balance public health and safety** with the rights of individuals to grow food for personal use or in safe, controlled settings.

---

**7. Enforcement and Compliance**  
While not explicitly detailed in the regulation, enforcement would likely involve:  
- Inspections by agricultural or plant health officers,  
- Reporting of violations to the Ministry of Agriculture,  
- Potential penalties for non-compliance, such as fines or orders to cease production.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Eggplants and Tomatoes Production (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations* are a targeted, science-based intervention under the Plant Quarantine Act to protect the region from the threat of the Golden Nematode. By restricting field production of eggplants and tomatoes in vulnerable areas, while allowing limited personal or greenhouse-based cultivation under strict conditions, the regulation balances public health and agricultural safety with reasonable flexibility for individual use and sustainable horticulture.

This measure exemplifies proactive plant health management and reflects the government’s commitment to protecting British Columbia’s agricultural integrity.
