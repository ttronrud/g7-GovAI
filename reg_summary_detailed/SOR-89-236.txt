### **Detailed Summary of the Moosonee Airport Zoning Regulations (1988)**

The **Moosonee Airport Zoning Regulations**, enacted under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act* and approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, establish strict spatial and environmental controls around Moosonee Airport in the District of Cochrane, Ontario. These regulations are designed to ensure aviation safety by limiting the height and use of structures, natural features, and land adjacent to the airport.

---

## **1. Regulatory Basis and Process**

- **Legal Authority**: The regulations are made under **Section 5.4** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which authorizes the Minister of Transport to establish zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in two issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* (July 30 and August 6, 1988) and in two issues of the *Timmins Daily Press* (September 1 and 2, 1988). This provided a reasonable opportunity for interested parties (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations to the Minister.
- **Final Adoption**: After public comment, the Governor General in Council formally adopted the regulations, making them binding.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Moosonee Airport in the District of Cochrane, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for measuring all surfaces. Its elevation is **7.7 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. It ensures clear visibility for aircraft during landing approaches. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, except where terrain is too low—then it is set at **9 meters above ground level**. |
| **Strip** | The designated runway area (including runways) used for take-off and landing, with defined width and length. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

## **3. Regulatory Provisions**

### **3.1 Height Restrictions on Structures and Objects**

> **No person may erect or construct any building, structure, or object (or add to existing ones) on land subject to these regulations such that the highest point of that object exceeds:**
> - The **approach surface**,
> - The **outer surface**, or
> - The **transitional surface**.

This rule ensures that no obstruction (e.g., trees, buildings, towers) will interfere with aircraft visibility or flight paths during take-off, landing, or approach.

> **Exception – Natural Growth**:  
> If a naturally growing object (e.g., tree, bush) exceeds the height limits of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister may require the owner or occupier to remove the excessive growth**.

This provision allows for natural features to remain but prevents them from becoming hazards to aviation safety.

---

### **3.2 Prohibition on Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

> No owner or occupier may allow any land under these regulations to be used for the disposal of **waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

This is a critical measure to reduce the risk of bird strikes—common causes of aviation accidents. Waste such as food scraps, seeds, or organic matter can attract birds to the airport vicinity, increasing the danger during flight operations.

## **4. Geometric Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

All surfaces are precisely defined using coordinates and geometric rules based on the **Moosonee Airport Zoning Plan No. 56-090 85-59**, dated June 30, 1987.

---

### **4.1 Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

- Located at:
  - **Start**: Button 06 — the southwesterly end of Runway 06–24.
  - **Path**: 
    - 345.662 meters **northeasterly** along the runway centerline.
    - Then **northwesterly and perpendicular** to the runway centerline for 117.685 meters.
- **Coordinates**:  
  - **N 5,682,039.953** and **E 527,412.708** (Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 17, Central Meridian at 81°W).

---

### **4.2 Approach Surfaces**

Four approach surfaces are defined for runways 06, 24, 14, and 32:

| Runway | Surface Description |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Runway 06 (approach 06)** | - Inclined plane with 1:50 slope (1 meter up per 50 meters out).<br>- Rises to a horizontal line 15,000 meters from the end of the strip.<br>- Outer ends of this line are 2,400 meters from the runway centerline.<br>- The horizontal line is 300 meters above the strip’s end elevation. |
| **Runway 24 (approach 24)** | - Same slope (1:50).<br>- 15,000 meters from end of strip.<br>- Outer ends 2,400 meters from centerline.<br>- 300 meters above strip elevation. |
| **Runway 14 (approach 14)** | - Slope of 1:40 (steeper than 06/24).<br>- Only 1,752 meters from end of strip.<br>- Outer ends 220.2 meters from centerline.<br>- Horizontal line 43.8 meters above strip elevation. |
| **Runway 32 (approach 32)** | - Slope of 1:40.<br>- 1,800 meters from end.<br>- Outer ends 225 meters from centerline.<br>- Horizontal line 45 meters above strip elevation. |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final descent and landing, especially in low-visibility conditions.

---

### **4.3 Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal imaginary plane** located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation**.
- **Exception**: If the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is **set at 9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that even in low-lying areas, the height restriction remains safe and practical.

---

### **4.4 Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Runway 06–24** | 300 meters wide (150 m on each side of centerline) | 1,644 meters long |
| **Runway 14–32** | 90 meters wide (45 m on each side) | 1,339 meters long |

These define the primary areas where aircraft operate and where approach surfaces begin.

---

### **4.5 Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter up per 7 meters out).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its associated approach surfaces.
- Continue until they meet the **outer surface** or another transitional surface of an adjacent runway.
- These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway edges and the outer boundary, ensuring consistent clearance zones.

---

## **5. Boundary of the Regulated Area**

The **outer limits of the lands** subject to the zoning regulations are defined by a detailed, coordinate-based boundary that includes:

- **Moosonee Railway Terminal, Station, and Townsite grounds**
- **Parts of the Townships of Moose and Horden**
- **Unsurveyed territory north of Township of Moose**
- **Moose Factory Island, Maidmans Island, Butler Island, Big Buck Island, and four unnamed islands in Moose River**
- **Charles Island, Pilgrim Island, Moose Flats Islands, Little Duck Island, Ship Sands Island, Sawpit Island, Flats Island**
- **Part of the bed of the Moose River**, opposite parts of Moosonee Townsite, Township of Moose, and Moose Factory Island

### **Boundary Description (Key Path)**

The boundary is described using **grid bearings and UTM coordinates (Zone 17, 81°W)**:

1. Begins at the **most westerly corner of the Moosonee Railway Terminal**.
2. Proceeds **southeasterly** along the southwesterly limit of the terminal to intersect the **northwesterly limit of Runway 06’s approach surface**.
3. Follows the **northwesterly limit** of Runway 06’s approach surface for 4,800 meters to its most westerly corner.
4. Then follows the **southeasterly limit** of the approach surface to a circular arc of **4,000 meters radius from the ARP**.
5. Continues along the circular arc to intersect **Moose Factory Island** (top of the Moose River bank).
6. Moves **
