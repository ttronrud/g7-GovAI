### **Detailed Summary of the Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This establishes the legal foundation for regulating land use around Fort Nelson Airport to ensure aviation safety, particularly in relation to aircraft approach and take-off zones.

These regulations are formally titled the **Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Regulations** and apply specifically to land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Terminology**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Fort Nelson Airport, located near the Village of Fort Nelson in the Peace River District, British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point used as a datum for all measurements. It is defined as the intersection of two lines: one 91.44 meters (300 feet) east of the centerline of Runway 03-21 and one 91.44 meters west of the centerline of Runway 07-25. Its UTM coordinates are **6521809.94N, 523363.24E**, and it is marked by Department of Transport Monument No. 802303. The assigned elevation is **373.68 meters above sea level**. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area (runway and associated taxiway areas) for aircraft. Two strips are defined: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 03–21 | 300 meters wide (150 m on each side of centerline), 2,071.41 meters long. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 07–25 | 150 meters wide (75 m on each side), 1,537.55 meters long. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip to ensure safe aircraft approaches. Different slopes apply depending on the runway: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 03: 1:50 slope (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal) to outer surface. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 21: 1:50 slope to outer surface. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 07: 1.25:50 slope (1.25 m vertical per 50 m horizontal) to outer surface. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 25: 1.25:50 slope to outer surface. |
| The surfaces slope upward to intersect with the outer surface, then continue horizontally until reaching the outer boundary or a specified distance (e.g., 15,000 m or 3,000 m from the end of the strip). |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) from the lateral edges of each strip and its associated approach surface, extending upward and outward until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. This ensures a smooth transition between the runway edge and the outer surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface located at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP elevation (373.68 m = 418.68 m above sea level)**. However, if this elevation would be less than **9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to avoid unrealistic or unsafe conditions. |

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to all lands that fall within the following categories:
- Lands **within** the designated zones defined in the schedule (particularly Parts II through VI);
- Lands **directly under** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits described in **Part II** of the schedule.

This includes public road allowances and private lands adjacent to the airport.

---

#### **4. Prohibited Activities (Construction & Elevation Restrictions)**

**No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object** on land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces:
- The **approach surface**;
- The **outer surface**;
- The **transitional surface**.

> **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) that exceeds these surfaces may be removed by the Minister if it poses a hazard to aviation safety.

**The Minister has the authority to issue a direction requiring the removal of any natural growth** that exceeds the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces.

---

#### **5. Waste Disposal Prohibitions**

No owner or occupier of land subject to these regulations may:
- Permit the land or any part of it to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

This restriction is critical because bird strikes are a major aviation hazard. Preventing bird-attracting waste helps reduce the risk of collisions with aircraft during take-off or landing.

---

#### **6. Outer Limits of the Regulated Area**

The outer boundary of the regulated land area is defined by a detailed **survey description** involving multiple azimuths, distances, and curves. Key features include:

- The boundary starts at the **most northerly corner of Block G, District Lot 1535**.
- It follows a **grid azimuth of 0°00′00″** to intersect with the southerly boundary of Lot 2810.
- Then proceeds **northeasterly** to intersect with the northerly boundary of Lot 2811 (4,000 m from ARP).
- A **circular arc with a 4,000 m radius centered at the ARP** is used to connect to the northerly limit of the approach surface for Runway 21.
- The path continues along the approach surface (with defined azimuths and distances), eventually returning to the **southerly high water mark of the Muskwa River**.
- From there, it follows the riverbank to the **southerly production of the westerly boundary of Block H**.
- Another 4,000 m from ARP is reached, followed by a circular arc to intersect with the approach surface for Runway 25.
- Then proceeds to the **northerly boundary of Airport Road**, and finally returns to the starting point via the easterly boundary of Block G.

> This boundary is designed to create a **safe buffer zone** around the airport, ensuring that no structures or obstructions intrude into critical approach paths.

#### **7. Visual and Technical Reference**
All surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) are depicted on **Department of Transport Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Plan No. B.C. 1421**, dated **December 31, 1980**. This plan serves as the official technical reference for:
- The location and dimensions of strips;
- The slopes and extents of approach and transitional surfaces;
- The elevation profiles of all defined surfaces.

---

#### **8. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions in flight paths, especially during approach and landing.
- To **minimize the risk of bird strikes** by eliminating attractants.
- To establish **clear, measurable, and enforceable boundaries** around the airport that protect both aircraft and surrounding communities.
- To provide a **standardized framework** for land use and development near the airport, consistent with national aeronautical standards.

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** retains authority to:
  - Issue directions for removal of excessive natural growth;
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions;
  - Monitor and inspect land use in the regulated area.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in the text.

### **Conclusion**

The **Fort Nelson Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around a key regional airport. By defining clear elevation limits through approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, and by restricting construction and waste disposal, the regulations significantly reduce aviation hazards. The detailed geometric description of boundaries ensures that the protected zone is both scientifically grounded and practically enforceable. These regulations reflect a balance between **public safety**, **environmental protection**, and **regional development**, and serve as a model for similar airport zoning initiatives in Canada.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**
| Stakeholder | Key Implications |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Landowners** | Must ensure all structures and natural growth do not exceed defined elevation limits. |
| **Developers** | Cannot build or expand structures within the regulated zones without Ministerial approval. |
| **Environmental Groups** | Waste disposal near the airport must be strictly controlled to prevent bird attraction. |
| **Aviation Authorities** | These regulations support safe flight operations by maintaining clear flight paths. |
| **Local Government** | Must coordinate with Transport to ensure compliance with zoning boundaries. |
