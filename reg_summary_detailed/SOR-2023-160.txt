### **Regulation Summary: Certain Russian Goods Remission Order**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff**.
- It is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- The legal basis for the order is found in:
  - **S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)** – which authorizes remission of customs duties under specific conditions.
  - **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – the foundational statute governing customs duties and related provisions.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- To **grant a remission (i.e., a refund or cancellation)** of customs duties that were previously paid or are payable under the **Customs Tariff** for certain goods originating in **Russia**.
- The remission applies specifically to goods classified under **tariff item 2844.43.00**.

> **Tariff Item 2844.43.00**: This classification typically refers to **"certain types of processed or manufactured goods,"** such as **"other articles of plastics or rubber"** (exact nature may vary depending on tariff updates). The precise description would be confirmed in the full Customs Tariff, but this item is generally associated with non-ferrous or synthetic materials used in industrial or consumer applications.

#### **3. Scope of Application**
- The remission applies to goods that:
  - **Originate in Russia** (i.e., are produced or manufactured in Russia, meeting origin criteria under international trade rules).
  - Are **imported into Canada** during a specific time period:
    - Beginning on the **day after the date** on which the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Tariff Withdrawal Order (2022-2)** ceases to have effect.
    - Ending **five years after the day this Order comes into force**.

> This creates a **time-limited window** for eligible imports, starting from the end of the MFN tariff withdrawal and lasting for five years from the Order’s effective date.

#### **4. Conditions for Remission**
- A claim for remission **must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.
- The claim must be made **within two years of the date of importation**.
- This deadline is critical: failure to submit a claim within this period will result in **loss of eligibility** for remission.

> Note: The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is the designated authority responsible for handling claims related to customs duties in this context—likely due to the department’s oversight of border security and trade compliance during times of geopolitical tension.

#### **5. Duration and Repeal**
- The Order is **repealed on the seventh anniversary** of the day it comes into force.
- This means the remission provision will **expire seven years after registration**, even if the five-year import window has ended.

> This structure ensures that the policy is **temporary and time-bound**, aligning with the temporary nature of trade measures in response to geopolitical events.

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal legislation).

### **Key Implications and Context**

- **Geopolitical Background**: This regulation appears to be a response to the **Russia-Ukraine conflict** and Canada’s broader trade policy shifts. The withdrawal of MFN tariff treatment from Russia (as reflected in the 2022-2 Order) likely triggered a review of existing duties and led to this targeted remission to ease the burden on Canadian importers of Russian-origin goods.
  
- **Targeted Relief**: The remission is **not general**—it applies only to goods under tariff item 2844.43.00 and only to those imported during a defined window. This reflects a **precision-based policy** to support specific sectors or products.

- **Administrative Burden**: Importers must proactively monitor import dates, track the expiry of the MFN withdrawal, and ensure claims are submitted within two years—highlighting the importance of timely compliance.

- **Temporary Nature**: The five-year import window and seven-year repeal date indicate this is a **temporary measure**, not a permanent change to Canadian trade policy.
