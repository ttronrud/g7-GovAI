### **Regulation Summary: Radiocommunication Act (Paragraph 9(1)(c)) Exemption Order (National Defence and Security)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation Source**: The Minister of Industry.
- **Legal Basis**: Subsection 3(2)(a) of the *Radiocommunication Act* (S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 4).
- **Purpose**: To grant a specific exemption from certain provisions of the Radiocommunication Act, specifically paragraph 9(1)(c), in the interest of **national defence and security**.

---

#### **2. Scope of the Exemption**
- **Exempted Party**: Her Majesty in right of Canada (i.e., the federal government of Canada).
- **Exempted Provision**: Paragraph 9(1)(c) of the *Radiocommunication Act*, which generally prohibits the **interception, transmission, or use of encrypted subscription programming signals or encrypted network feeds** without authorization, unless authorized under specific conditions.
- **Effective Condition**: The exemption applies **only when**:
  1. The **encrypted subscription programming signal or encrypted network feed is decoded** solely for the purposes of **national defence or national security**.
  2. The signal or feed is **not available from a lawful distributor** (i.e., it is not accessible through authorized, legal commercial or subscription channels).

> This means that the government may legally decode encrypted content (such as pay-TV signals or network feeds) **only if**:
> - The decoding is strictly for defence or security operations.
> - There is no legal, authorized source from which the content can be obtained.

---

#### **3. Limitations and Conditions**
- The exemption is **not absolute** and is strictly conditional:
  - **Purpose Restriction**: Decoding is permitted **only for national defence or national security purposes**. It cannot be used for commercial, recreational, or non-security reasons.
  - **Availability Requirement**: The content must **not be available through a lawful distributor**. If a lawful, authorized source exists (e.g., a legal pay-TV provider), the exemption does not apply.
- This ensures that the exemption does not undermine existing licensing, distribution, or consumer protection frameworks.

---

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- Registration is a formal step required for the regulation to become legally effective.

---

#### **5. Regulatory Context and Significance**
- This exemption is a **security exception** under Canadian telecommunications law.
- It allows the federal government to bypass restrictions on accessing encrypted content when such access is essential for:
  - Intelligence gathering,
  - Surveillance for threat detection,
  - Emergency response,
  - Protection of critical infrastructure,
  - Or other national security functions.
- It reflects a balance between **protecting intellectual property and content distribution rights** and **ensuring national security**.

---

#### **6. Key Legal Principles Underlying the Order**
- **Public Interest Exception**: The government may act in the public interest (specifically national defence/security) even when such actions would otherwise violate a statutory restriction.
- **Proportionality and Necessity**: The use of the exemption must be necessary, limited in scope, and directly related to defence or security.
- **Non-Discrimination**: The exemption does not apply to private individuals or commercial entities; it is exclusively for the federal government.

---

### **Conclusion**
This *Radiocommunication Act (Paragraph 9(1)(c)) Exemption Order (National Defence and Security)* enables the Canadian government to legally decode encrypted subscription programming or network feeds **only when necessary for national defence or security**, and **when no lawful alternative source exists**. It is a narrowly tailored exception designed to protect national security interests while respecting the rights of content distributors and consumers. The exemption is strictly conditional and does not extend to any other use or individual.

---

> **Note**: This regulation is part of Canada’s broader framework for regulating telecommunications and ensuring that critical government functions are not hindered by technical or legal barriers related to encryption.
