### **6. Creditable Periods and Totalizing (Chapter 1)**

This is a **core mechanism** allowing individuals to accumulate contributions from both countries toward eligibility for benefits.

#### **General Principle**
If a person is not eligible due to insufficient creditable periods, eligibility is determined by **totalizing**:
- Creditable periods under the legislation of each Party
- Creditable periods under **third-party social security systems** (where both countries have agreements)

> Periods **do not overlap** when totalizing.

#### **Specific Rules for Canada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines**

##### **For Old Age Security (OAS) in Canada**
- If a person contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan during a period of residence in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines:
  - That period is counted as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (who are not covered by Saint Vincent’s legislation due to employment/self-employment).
- If a person is subject to Saint Vincent’s legislation during a period of residence in Canada:
  - That period is **not** counted as residence in Canada for OAS eligibility.
- Exception: If a person **ordinarily resides in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines** and is employed in Canada and contributes to CPP or provincial plans:
  - That employment period is **counted as residence in Canada** for OAS purposes.

##### **For Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**
- A **calendar year** in which the person has at least **13 creditable weeks** under Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is treated as **one full year of contributions** under the CPP.

##### **For Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (Contributory Age, Invalidity, Survivor Benefits)**
- A year commencing on or after **January 1, 1987** that is a creditable period under the **Canada Pension Plan** is treated as **52 weeks** of contributions under Saint Vincent and the Grenadines legislation.
- A week (from January 5, 1987 onward) that is creditable under the **Old Age Security Act** (and not part of a CPP creditable period) is treated as **one week** of contribution under Saint Vincent and the Grenadines legislation.

> These rules apply only to periods **after November 1, 1998**.

#### **Final Totalizing Rule**
If totalizing under the Parties' legislation still does not meet eligibility, the person may be eligible based on **creditable periods under a third country’s legislation**, provided both Parties are bound by social security agreements that allow totalizing.

> **Exception**: If a person has less than one year of total creditable periods and no right to a benefit exists under the legislation, the competent institution **is not required** to award benefits under this Agreement.

### **7. Calculation of Benefits**

#### **Chapter 2 – Benefits Under Canadian Legislation**

If a person is eligible for an **Old Age Security (OAS) pension or spouse’s allowance** through totalizing:

- **OAS Pension**:  
  - Calculated under the OASA, **only based on periods of residence** (as defined in Chapter 1).  
  - For persons outside Canada:  
    - Must have **at least the minimum residence period** required by OASA to qualify for a pension abroad.  
    - Otherwise, no pension is payable.

- **Spouse’s Allowance / Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**:  
  - Paid only to the extent allowed by OASA.

- **CPP-Related Benefits**:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based **only** on pensionable earnings under the CPP.
  - **Flat-rate portion**:  
    - Multiplied by the **fraction** of CPP contributions relative to the **minimum qualifying period** (e.g., 35 years).  
    - This fraction **cannot exceed 1** (i.e., no more than full benefit).

> These benefits are calculated **exclusively** based on the periods of contribution and residence under the applicable rules.
