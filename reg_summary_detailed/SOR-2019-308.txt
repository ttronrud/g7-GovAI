**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Round Hickorynut (Obovaria subrotunda) Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **Part 2 of Schedule 1**, which designates certain species as endangered and requires the identification and protection of their **critical habitat**. The legal foundation for this Order is rooted in the following provisions of SARA:

- **Section 58(1)**: Requires the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate critical habitat for species listed as at risk.
- **Section 58(4)** and **Section 58(5)**: Authorize the Minister to make an Order designating critical habitat when it is necessary for the recovery of a listed species.
- **Section 58(7)**: Requires consultation with the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (MINA) and the relevant Indigenous band when an Order would affect lands set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation.

The regulation is issued on **August 12, 2019**, and comes into force upon **registration** with the federal government.

### **2. Species at Risk: Round Hickorynut (Obovaria subrotunda)**

- The **Round Hickorynut** (*Obovaria subrotunda*) is a rare and endangered plant species native to Canada.
- It is officially listed as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**.
- This listing means the species is at significant risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

---

### **3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

- A **recovery strategy** for the Round Hickorynut was developed and formally adopted, identifying the **critical habitat** necessary for the species’ survival and recovery.
- This recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada that tracks species at risk and their associated recovery plans and critical habitat designations.
- The critical habitat identified in this strategy is now legally recognized and protected under SARA.

---

### **4. Jurisdictional and Land Use Considerations**

- The Order specifies that **no portion of the critical habitat** designated in the annexed Order falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.
  
  > **Section 58(2)(b)** of SARA prohibits the designation of critical habitat on lands that are **set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation** (i.e., reserve lands).

- This is a critical legal safeguard to ensure that Indigenous communities are not unduly affected by critical habitat designations. By confirming that **no designated critical habitat lies on First Nation reserves**, the Order avoids triggering the requirement for additional consultation under SARA, which would otherwise be needed if such lands were involved.

---

### **5. Consultation with Indigenous Communities**

- Despite the absence of critical habitat on reserve lands, the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** acknowledges that the Order may still affect **other lands set apart for the use and benefit of a band** (e.g., non-reserve lands used for cultural, traditional, or community purposes).
- Therefore, under **subsection 58(7)** of SARA, the Minister has:
  - Consulted with the **Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (MINA)**.
  - Engaged directly with the **specific Indigenous band** in question.
- This consultation process ensures that Indigenous rights, interests, and traditional knowledge are respected and considered in the decision-making process.

---

### **6. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Formally designate and legally protect** the specific areas of land and ecological conditions that are essential for the survival, recovery, and long-term viability of the Round Hickorynut (*Obovaria subrotunda*).
- Provide **legal clarity and enforceability** to the critical habitat identified in the recovery strategy.
- Support the species’ recovery by ensuring that activities that could degrade or destroy this habitat are regulated or restricted under SARA.

---

### **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- Once registered, the Order becomes legally binding.
- Any federal or provincial activity (e.g., development, land use planning, or resource extraction) that occurs within the designated critical habitat must comply with SARA, including:
  - Avoiding adverse effects on the species.
  - Seeking permits or approvals if such activities are unavoidable.
- The designation supports the broader goals of biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration.

---

### **8. Significance and Implications**

- This Order is a **key step in the recovery process** for the Round Hickorynut, one of Canada’s most endangered plant species.
- It demonstrates the government’s commitment to:
  - Science-based conservation.
  - Legal compliance with SARA.
  - Respect for Indigenous rights and consultation requirements.
- It also serves as a model for how critical habitat designations can be made without infringing on Indigenous land rights or triggering unnecessary regulatory burdens.

---

### **Conclusion**

This **Critical Habitat of the Round Hickorynut (Obovaria subrotunda) Order** is a legally sound, ecologically relevant, and culturally sensitive regulatory measure. It formally identifies and protects the essential habitat required for the recovery of an endangered plant species, while ensuring compliance with SARA and respecting Indigenous rights through proper consultation. The Order reflects a balanced approach to conservation that integrates scientific evidence, legal obligations, and Indigenous partnership.
