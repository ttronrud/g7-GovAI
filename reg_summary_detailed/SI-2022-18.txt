### **Regulation Summary: Discontinuance of the Northern Pipeline Agency Annual Report**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The directive is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources**.
- The authority for this action is derived from **section 157a of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**.
- Section 157a empowers the Governor in Council to **discontinue or modify documents** that are required to be laid before Parliament if they:
  - Contain **no additional or new information** compared to existing financial reports (such as Public Accounts or expenditure estimates), or
  - Contain **less information** than what is already available in those reports.

#### **2. Subject of the Regulation**
- The document in question is the **Northern Pipeline Agency Annual Report**, as required under **section 14 of the Northern Pipeline Act (R.S., c. N-26)**.
- This report was previously mandated to be submitted to both Houses of Parliament as a required parliamentary disclosure.

#### **3. Reason for Discontinuance**
- The Governor in Council has determined that:
  - The information contained in the **Annual Report** is **either identical to** or **less comprehensive than** the information already available in:
    - The **Public Accounts** of the government, or
    - The **estimates of expenditures** submitted to Parliament.
- In other words, the Annual Report does not provide **any new, valuable, or necessary financial or operational information** that Parliament would need to assess accountability, transparency, or fiscal responsibility.

#### **4. Legal and Procedural Implications**
- The discontinuance is not a rejection of the Northern Pipeline Agency’s operations, but a **rationalization of parliamentary reporting requirements**.
- By discontinuing the report, the government is **eliminating a redundant or duplicative submission**, thereby reducing administrative burden and streamlining the legislative process.
- The directive is formalized under **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47**, which is a statutory provision in the *Statutes of Canada* (1991, Chapter 24), indicating that this is a formal, legally binding directive.

#### **5. Context and Purpose**
- The purpose of this regulation is to ensure **parliamentary efficiency** and **financial transparency** by:
  - Preventing duplication of information.
  - Ensuring that Parliament receives only **relevant, non-redundant, and high-value reports**.
  - Aligning reporting obligations with actual accountability needs.

#### **6. Impact**
- The **Northern Pipeline Agency Annual Report is no longer required** to be submitted to either House of Parliament.
- Any future reporting obligations of the agency must now be structured in a way that provides **new or distinct information** not already available in Public Accounts or expenditure estimates.
- This may affect how the agency communicates with Parliament, requiring it to focus on **non-financial or strategic reporting** if it wishes to maintain accountability.

#### **7. Key Legal Principles Involved**
- **Parliamentary accountability**: Reports must serve a legitimate purpose in enabling Parliament to oversee government spending and operations.
- **Non-redundancy**: Reports must not simply restate information already publicly available.
- **Efficiency in governance**: The government is expected to eliminate unnecessary or duplicative reporting.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **practical and legally sound decision** to eliminate a redundant parliamentary submission. It reflects a principle of **fiscal accountability and transparency**, ensuring that Parliament receives only information that adds value. By discontinuing the Northern Pipeline Agency Annual Report, the government aligns its reporting practices with the core requirements of financial oversight under the Financial Administration Act, without compromising accountability or transparency.
