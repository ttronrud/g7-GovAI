### **Regulation Summary: Least Developed Country Tariff Withdrawal (2023 LDCT Review) Order**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 38(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff Act (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**.  
- This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to withdraw the tariff benefits granted to goods originating in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
- The withdrawal is made pursuant to a formal review process, in this case, the **2023 Least Developed Country Tariff (LDCT) Review**.

#### **2. Scope of Withdrawal**
The benefit of the **Least Developed Country Tariff (LDCT)** is **withdrawn** for all goods that originate in the following four countries:
- **Cape Verde**
- **Samoa**
- **Tuvalu**
- **Vanuatu**

> This means that goods originating in these countries will no longer be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Canadian tariff system (such as reduced or zero import duties) as of the effective date.

#### **3. Exemption for Goods in Transit**
An important exception is included:
- **Section 1 of the Order does not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada before January 1, 2025**.
- This means that goods that entered Canada or were being transported into Canada prior to that date — even if they originated in one of the listed countries — will **retain their eligibility** for LDCT benefits.
- This provision ensures that existing shipments are not retroactively affected and provides administrative and logistical stability for importers and carriers.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on January 1, 2025**.
- From this date onward, all new goods originating in Cape Verde, Samoa, Tuvalu, or Vanuatu will be subject to standard Canadian tariffs, unless otherwise exempted under other provisions.

#### **5. Purpose and Context**
- The withdrawal reflects a **review and reassessment** of the eligibility of certain LDCs for tariff benefits under Canada’s trade policy.
- The decision may be based on factors such as:
  - Changes in the economic status of these countries (e.g., improved GDP, reduced poverty, or increased trade integration).
  - Compliance with international development and trade criteria used to determine LDC status.
  - Canada’s broader trade policy objectives, including ensuring that tariff preferences are aligned with genuine development needs.
- The 2023 review indicates that Canada is periodically evaluating which countries meet the criteria for LDC status and whether they continue to qualify for preferential treatment.

#### **6. Implications**
- **Importers and exporters** of goods from these countries will face higher tariffs starting January 1, 2025, unless the goods were already in transit before that date.
- This may impact:
  - The cost of imported goods from these nations.
  - Supply chains and pricing strategies in Canadian markets.
  - Trade relationships between Canada and these Pacific and Atlantic island nations.
- The withdrawal may signal a shift in Canada’s trade policy, potentially reflecting broader global changes in LDC classifications or economic development trends.

#### **7. Amendments**
- The regulation includes a note of **amendments** (though the specific details of the amendments are not provided in the excerpt).
- These may include clarifications, procedural updates, or adjustments to the scope or application of the withdrawal.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally removes Canada’s preferential tariff treatment for goods originating in **Cape Verde, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu**, effective **January 1, 2025**. The decision is based on a 2023 review and reflects Canada’s ongoing assessment of LDC eligibility. A key exception protects goods in transit prior to the effective date, ensuring continuity for existing shipments. The move underscores Canada’s commitment to aligning trade preferences with evolving economic realities and international development criteria.
