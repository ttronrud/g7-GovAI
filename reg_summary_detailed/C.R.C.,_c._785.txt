The regulation provides for the **remission (exemption)** of certain duties and taxes on the importation of a representational gift under the following conditions:

  - A Minister of the Government of Canada,

- **Scope**: Applies only to gifts presented during official visits by or to designated Canadian officials.
- **Exclusions**: 
  - Gifts to individuals not in official government roles (e.g., private citizens or non-official officials).
  - Gifts that fall under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (e.g., alcohol, tobacco).
- **Conditions**: The gift must be presented in the context of an official visit and the recipient must be a recognized official.

### Status: **Repealed**

- The regulation was formally **repealed by Statutory Instrument 98-6, section 5**.
- This means that **as of the date of repeal**, the provisions outlined above **no longer apply**.
- Any current exemptions for representational gifts in Canada are governed by **other, updated regulations**, which may differ in scope, eligibility, or structure.

### Conclusion:

While the regulation provided a framework for tax exemptions on official gifts involving Canadian officials, it is **no longer valid** due to its repeal. Canadian customs and excise policies on gifts are now governed by more current legislation, which may include different criteria, thresholds, or oversight mechanisms.

For current information on gift exemptions, one should consult **modern Canadian customs regulations**, particularly those under the **Customs Act** and the **Excise Tax Act**, and any relevant updates from the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**.
