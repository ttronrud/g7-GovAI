**Detailed Summary of the Remission Order Concerning Interest Accruing on Certain Unemployment Insurance Overpayments**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Human Resources Development** and the **Treasury Board**.

It is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the government to make remission orders—specifically, to forgive or reduce interest and administrative charges—when it is in the public interest.

The regulation is part of a broader legislative and administrative effort to address the financial obligations associated with **unemployment insurance overpayments**, particularly in the context of the transition from the old *Unemployment Insurance Act* to the modern *Employment Insurance Act*.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this **Remission Order** is to **forgive or remit interest and penalties** that certain individuals had to pay under the *Interest and Administrative Charges Regulations* (the "Regulations") in respect of **unemployment insurance overpayments**.

Specifically, the order targets interest that accrued during two distinct time periods:

- **April 1, 1996 – June 30, 2002** (a period of six years)
- **July 1, 2002 and beyond** (a subsequent period)

This remission is intended to provide relief to individuals who received benefits under the former *Unemployment Insurance Act* (R.S.C. 1985, c. U-1), which was repealed and replaced by the *Employment Insurance Act* (S.C. 1996, c. 23) on **April 1, 1996**.

### **3. Key Definitions**

- **Misrepresentation**:  
  This refers to any act that constitutes fraud, falsification of documents, wilful misrepresentation, or any other offence committed by an individual or someone acting on their behalf that results in an **unemployment insurance overpayment**.  
  → This is a critical distinction: overpayments due to fraud or intentional misconduct are **excluded** from the remission.

- **Regulations**:  
  Refers to the *Interest and Administrative Charges Regulations*, which govern how interest and administrative charges are calculated and imposed on overpayments.

- **Unemployment Insurance Overpayment**:  
  A payment that exceeds the amount a person was entitled to under the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (the "former Act").  
  → This overpayment must have been established under **Section 159 of the Employment Insurance Act** and must relate to a claim for benefits during a **benefit period beginning before April 1, 1996** (the date the former Act was repealed).

### **4. Scope of Remission**

#### **(A) Interest Remitted (April 1, 1996 – June 30, 2002)**

- **All individuals** who had an unemployment insurance overpayment arising from a benefit period beginning **before April 1, 1996** are entitled to have **interest and penalties** (including interest on penalties) **forgiven** during the period from **April 1, 1996, to June 30, 2002**.

- This remission applies **regardless of whether the overpayment was due to misrepresentation**—**except** in cases where the overpayment resulted from fraud or wilful misrepresentation.

> ✅ **Note**: Overpayments due to **misrepresentation** are **not eligible** for remission during this period.

#### **(B) Interest Remitted (July 1, 2002 and Beyond)**

- Starting on **July 1, 2002**, the remission applies to **all individuals** (again, excluding those whose overpayment resulted from misrepresentation) who have an unemployment insurance overpayment related to a benefit period beginning before April 1, 1996.

- This means that **interest and penalties** that would have been payable from **July 1, 2002**, forward, are also **forgiven**.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Overpayments resulting from **misrepresentation** (fraud, falsification, etc.) are **excluded** from this remission, regardless of the date.

---

### **5. Exclusion of Misrepresentation Cases**

- The remission **does not apply** to individuals whose overpayment was due to **fraud, falsification of documents, wilful misrepresentation**, or any other offence committed by them or on their behalf.

- This exclusion ensures that individuals who acted dishonestly or intentionally misrepresented information to obtain benefits are not granted relief.

> This reflects a principle of **deterrence**—the government seeks to uphold accountability for fraudulent conduct.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- The **Remission Order comes into force on July 1, 2002**.

- This means that:
  - Interest and penalties from **April 1, 1996, to June 30, 2002** are forgiven **as of July 1, 2002**.
  - Interest and penalties from **July 1, 2002 onward** are also forgiven **as of July 1, 2002**.

---

### **7. Public Interest Justification**

The government asserts that it is in the **public interest** to grant this remission. This is likely due to:

- The **complexity and disruption** caused by the transition from the old Unemployment Insurance Act to the new Employment Insurance Act.
- The **long duration** of interest accrual (over six years), which could place a financial burden on individuals who were not at fault.
- A desire to **promote fairness and equity** in the administration of benefit claims, especially for those who had no intent to defraud the system.
