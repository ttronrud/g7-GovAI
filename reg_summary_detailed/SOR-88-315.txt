**Detailed Summary of the *Cree-Naskapi Band Elections Regulations* (S.C. 1984, c. 18)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Cree-Naskapi Band Elections Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the **Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act** to govern the procedures for electing members of the council in Cree and Naskapi Bands in Quebec. These regulations provide a comprehensive, structured framework for conducting democratic elections—both general elections and specific positions such as chief and councillors—ensuring transparency, fairness, and cultural appropriateness within Indigenous governance systems.

The regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to specific statutory provisions (Sections 67, 78(3), and 198 of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act).

These regulations may be cited as:
