The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal and revocation of a regulation under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*:

- **Repealed, SOR/2007-303, s. 44** — This indicates that the regulation in question was officially **repealed (cancelled or removed)** by **Regulation 303, Section 44**, which was published in the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* on **December 14, 2007**.
- **Revoked, SOR/83-792, s. 1** — This indicates that the regulation was also **revoked (cancelled)** earlier, by **Regulation 792, Section 1**, which was published in **1983**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Status of the Regulation:**
- The regulation is **no longer in force**.
- It has been **repealed twice**:
  - First, by **SOR/83-792, s. 1** (1983) — indicating an earlier revocation.
  - Second, by **SOR/2007-303, s. 44** (2007) — confirming the final removal of the regulation from the legal framework.

**2. Legal Effect:**
- Repeal means the regulation is **no longer valid or applicable**.
- Any legal obligations, duties, or provisions previously set out in the regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- The repeal is effective from the date of publication in the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* (SOR), which for SOR/2007-303 was **December 14, 2007**.

**3. Context:**
- The repeated entries suggest that this regulation was either:
  - A standalone rule that was previously issued and later removed.
  - A rule that was referenced in multiple contexts or sections and thus listed multiple times in a database or document.
- The fact that it was revoked in both 1983 and 2007 implies that the regulation may have been **replaced or superseded** by newer legislation or administrative rules, and its removal was part of a broader legal modernization or consolidation effort.

**4. Implications:**
- Any prior actions, decisions, or compliance measures based on this regulation are **no longer legally binding**.
- Legal or regulatory bodies, such as government agencies or courts, will not consider this regulation when interpreting or applying current laws.
- It may have been part of a sector (e.g., environmental, transportation, labor, or health) that underwent significant reform.

**5. Source of Authority:**
- The repeal authority comes from the **Ontario government's legislative process**, where regulations are issued and amended or removed through the *Statutory Rules of Ontario*.
- SOR/2007-303 is a regulation issued by a minister or agency (the specific body depends on the subject matter), and Section 44 explicitly cancels the regulation.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text is **fully repealed and no longer in effect**. It was first revoked in **1983** (SOR/83-792, s. 1) and definitively removed in **2007** (SOR/2007-303, s. 44). As such, it has **no current legal standing** and should not be cited or applied in any legal, administrative, or compliance context. The repeated entries are likely due to a data or indexing error or a system duplication, but the legal status remains clear: **repealed and revoked**.
