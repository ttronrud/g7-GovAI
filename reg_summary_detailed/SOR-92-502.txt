## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Federal Real Property Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 50)**

### 📌 **Background and Purpose**
This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice** and the **Treasury Board**, pursuant to **subsections 15(2) and 16(2) of the Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act (the "Act")**.

It **revokes and replaces** the following outdated regulations:
- *Government Land Purchase Regulations* (P.C. 1978-1749)
- *Public Lands Leasing and Licensing Regulations* (P.C. 1982-2718)
- *Public Lands Sale Regulations (Transport)* (C.R.C., c. 1327)
- *Public Works Leasing Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 1364)

The new regulations establish a **modern, coherent, and centralized framework** for how the Government of Canada acquires, disposes of, manages, and administers **federal real property and immovables** — including land, buildings, and other tangible assets under Crown ownership.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These regulations were **repealed in 2020** (SOR/2020-134, s. 2), meaning they are **no longer in force**. However, this summary provides a detailed historical and legal analysis of their content and intent, which may still be relevant for understanding the evolution of federal property governance.
