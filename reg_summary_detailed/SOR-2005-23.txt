### **Detailed Summary of the *Reporting of Exported Goods Regulations* (S.C. 2001, c. 25, s. 55)**

These regulations, made under **section 95a of the Customs Act**, establish a comprehensive framework for the **reporting of exported goods** in Canada. The objective is to ensure transparency, compliance with trade laws, and timely collection of export data for statistical and regulatory purposes. The regulations define key terms, specify who must report exports, when and how reports must be submitted, and outline exceptions where reporting is not required.

| **Carrier** | A person (other than the exporter) who transports goods from Canada. |
| **Chief Officer of Customs** | The manager of customs offices serving a specific area or place. |
| **Commercial goods** | Goods exported for sale or for industrial, commercial, institutional, or occupational use. |
| **Customs Service Provider** | Includes customs brokers, freight forwarders, agents, or representatives who provide customs-related services (excluding transport). |
| **Exporter** | A business holder with a business number who exports commercial goods or causes them to be exported. |
| **Export Reporting Office (ERO)** | A designated customs office where export reports must be filed. |
| **Homogeneous goods** | Goods that closely resemble each other in material and characteristics and are intended for the same purpose. |
| **Restricted goods** | Goods whose export is prohibited, controlled, or regulated under the *Customs Act* or another federal Act. |
| **Time-sensitive goods** | Goods that lose value or utility if not exported immediately (e.g., perishables, just-in-time inventory). |
