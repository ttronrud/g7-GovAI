**Detailed Summary of the Watson Lake Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Watson Lake Airport Zoning Regulations* were officially approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations establish spatial and environmental constraints to ensure the safe operation of aircraft at Watson Lake Airport in the Yukon Territory.

The regulations are formally titled:  
**"Watson Lake Airport Zoning Regulations"**, and may be cited as such.

They apply to specific lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, defining maximum allowable elevations for structures, natural growth, and waste disposal, with the primary objective of minimizing hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Watson Lake Airport in the vicinity of Watson Lake, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographical point used as a datum for all elevation and boundary measurements. Located 91.44 meters southwesterly from a point on the centerline of runway 08-26, 672.9 meters northwesterly from the 26 end of that runway. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runways (08-26 and 02-20), designed to ensure a clear path for aircraft during approach. The slope and horizontal extent vary by runway. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane 45 meters above the ARP elevation (or 9 meters above ground if closer to the surface), defining the upper boundary for all development. |
| **Strip** | A defined rectangular area of the landing zone, including runways, used for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. The strip is bounded by lateral and longitudinal limits. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surface, connecting it to the outer surface or adjacent strip. |

> **Assigned Elevation**: The elevation of the Airport Reference Point is officially set at **683.4 meters above sea level**.

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

1. All lands **within** the designated boundaries;
2. All lands **directly beneath** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the defined limits.

These include public road allowances and other adjacent lands as defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

---

### **Prohibited Activities (Building & Structures)**

No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land covered by these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds:

- The **approach surface** of any strip;
- The **outer surface**;
- The **transitional surface**.

> This means that any structure (e.g., buildings, towers, trees, antennas) must remain below the defined surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft operations.

---

### **Natural Growth Management**

If natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This ensures that vegetation does not create hazards during flight operations, such as wind shear, bird strikes, or visual obstructions.

---

### **Waste Disposal Prohibitions**

No owner or occupier may allow any land under these regulations to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical measure to reduce bird activity near the airport, which could lead to bird strikes — a major safety risk for aviation.

### **Geographic and Geometric Descriptions**

#### **1. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **91.44 meters southwesterly** from a point on the centerline of runway 08-26.
- That point is **672.9 meters northwesterly** from the 26 end of runway 08-26.
- Serves as the **origin point** for all measurements in the regulation.

#### **2. Outer Limits of Regulated Land (Boundary Description)**
The boundary is defined on **Watson Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1765**, dated January 9, 1984, and runs as follows:

1. **Starts** at a point on the westerly boundary of **Lot 1-67, Group 757, Plan 58737 (C.L.S.R.) 40016 (L.T.O.)**, where it intersects a **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered at the ARP.
2. **Travels clockwise** along the circumference of this circle to where it intersects the **easterly boundary of Lot 1-66**.
3. Proceeds **southerly** along the easterly boundary of Lot 1-66 to its **southeast corner**.
4. Moves **westward** along the southern boundaries of Lots 1-66 and 1-67, across intervening roads, to the **southwest corner of Lot 1-67**.
5. Returns **northerly** along the westerly boundary of Lot 1-67 back to the **point of commencement**.

> This boundary forms a large circular buffer around the airport, ensuring that development is restricted within a defined area.

#### **3. Approach Surfaces (Runway Ends)**

Each approach surface is an inclined plane rising from the end of a runway strip to a horizontal line, designed to provide a safe visual and physical buffer for approaching aircraft.

| Runway | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Runway 08 (approach)** | Inclined plane with **1:50 slope** (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal), rising to a horizontal line **300 m above the end of the strip**, **15,000 m horizontally from the end**, with outer ends **2,400 m from the runway centerline**. |
| **Runway 26 (approach)** | Same as 08: **1:50 slope**, 300 m vertical rise, 15,000 m horizontal distance, outer ends 2,400 m from centerline. |
| **Runway 02 (approach)** | **1:20 slope** (1 m vertical per 20 m horizontal), rising to a horizontal line **150 m above the end**, **3,000 m horizontally from the end**, outer ends **345 m from centerline**. |
| **Runway 20 (approach)** | Identical to 02: **1:20 slope**, 150 m vertical rise, 3,000 m horizontal distance, outer ends 345 m from centerline. |

> These surfaces ensure that aircraft have a clear visual and physical path during approach, especially in low-visibility conditions.

---

#### **4. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located **45 meters above the assigned elevation of the ARP (683.4 m)**, i.e., at **728.4 meters above sea level**.
- **Exception**: Where the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is **set at 9 meters above ground level** to avoid creating artificial elevation hazards.
- This surface acts as the **maximum allowable elevation** for all structures and natural features within the regulated zone.

---

#### **5. Strips (Runway Areas)**

The strips are the primary landing areas and are defined as follows:

| Runway | Width | Length | Lateral Boundaries |
|--------|------|--------|--------------------|
| **08-26** | 300 meters wide (150 m on each side of centerline) | 2,162 meters long | Centerline of runway 08-26 |
| **02-20** | 90 meters wide (45 m on each side) | 1,339 meters long | Centerline of runway 02-20 |

> These define the exact zones where aircraft take off and land, and where approach surfaces begin.

---

#### **6. Transitional Surfaces**

These connect the approach surfaces and strips to the outer surface, preventing abrupt changes in elevation.

| Runway | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **08-26** | Inclined plane rising at **1:7 slope** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal), extending at right angles to the centerline of the strip and its approach surfaces until it intersects the outer surface or an adjacent transitional surface. |
| **02-20** | Inclined plane rising at **1:5 slope** (1 m vertical per 5 m horizontal), extending at right angles to the centerline until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

> These surfaces ensure a smooth, gradual transition from the runway edge to the outer boundary, reducing the risk of sudden elevation changes that could affect aircraft performance.

### **Regulatory Objectives & Purpose**

The primary purposes of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Flight Safety**: To prevent obstructions (buildings, trees, terrain) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Visual and Spatial Clarity**: To maintain clear lines of
