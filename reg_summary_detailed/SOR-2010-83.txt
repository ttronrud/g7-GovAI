**Detailed Summary of the Fire and Boat Drills Regulations (S.C. 2005, c. 29, ss. 16(1))**

---

### **Overview**

The *Fire and Boat Drills Regulations*, made under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, are designed to ensure that Canadian vessels operating under safety certification standards maintain readiness to respond effectively to emergencies—particularly fires and life-saving operations—by mandating regular drills, clear communication procedures, and well-documented emergency response plans. These regulations apply specifically to self-propelled Canadian vessels that are either Safety Convention vessels or required to hold a safety certificate under the *Vessel Safety Certificates Regulations*.

The primary goal is to **enhance crew and passenger safety** through proactive preparedness, ensuring that all personnel understand emergency signals, evacuation procedures, and their assigned roles during an actual emergency or a simulated drill.
