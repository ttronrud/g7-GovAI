**Detailed Summary of the *Blainville Motor Vehicle Test Centre Benefit Eligibility Protection Regulations***  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22*  
*Enacted under: Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act and Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **protect the pension and benefit eligibility of public service employees who transitioned from employment with the Government of Canada to a private entity** — specifically, *PMG Technologies Inc.* — through the transfer of the **Blainville Motor Vehicle Test Centre** on June 15, 1996.

This regulation ensures that employees who were previously employed in the public service and then moved to a new employer (PMG Technologies Inc.) do **not lose eligibility for public service superannuation benefits** due to the nature of their employment transition. It provides a legal mechanism allowing such individuals to **count their service period during the transition phase** toward their eligibility for an annuity or other benefits under the *Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)*.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act*, which governs the pension and benefit system for public servants in Canada.
- **New Employer**: Defined as *PMG Technologies Inc.*, the private company to which Her Majesty in right of Canada transferred administrative control of the Blainville Motor Vehicle Test Centre on **June 15, 1996**.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to individuals who:
1. Were **employed in the public service** (i.e., under the federal government) on June 14, 1996;
2. **Ceased to be employed in the public service** to become employed by the new employer (PMG Technologies Inc.);
3. **Exercised an option under section 3 of the Public Service Superannuation Act** to have their service period during the transition counted toward benefit eligibility.

> This applies only to those who experienced a direct employment transition from the public service to PMG Technologies Inc. due to the transfer of the Blainville Centre.

---

### **Eligibility to Exercise an Option**

A person may exercise an option **within one year** of the coming into force of these regulations to:
- Count the period of time between:
  - The date they **ceased to be employed in the public service**, and  
  - The date they **ceased to be employed by the new employer**  
  — as **pensionable service** for purposes of determining eligibility for an annuity or other benefit under the Act.

#### **Conditions for Eligibility to Exercise the Option**:
1. On **June 14, 1996**, the person was a **contributor** under the Public Service Superannuation Act.
2. The person **ceased public service employment** to start working for the new employer.
3. The person has **not yet received** any annuity or benefit under:
   - Section 12 (pension),
   - Section 13 (survivor benefits),
   - Section 13.01 (disability benefits) of the Act.

> This means the individual must not have already retired or received a benefit before exercising the option.

---

### **Irrevocability and Formal Requirements**

- The option to count the transition period is **irrevocable once exercised**.
- It must be:
  - **In writing**,
  - **Dated and signed** by the individual,
  - And **submitted to the Minister** of Public Service and Procurement (or relevant ministerial office).

> This ensures accountability and formal recognition of the individual’s intent to claim the benefit.

---

### **Application of Sections 12, 13, and 13.01 of the Act**

- These sections (which govern pensions, survivor benefits, and disability benefits) **only apply to a person on and after the date they cease employment with the new employer**.
- This means that **during the transition period**, the employee is not subject to the full application of these sections as if they were still in public service.

> This protects the employee from being treated as if they had left the public service permanently and thus lost all rights to benefits during the transitional period.

---

### **Survivor and Child Allowances (Part I of the Act)**

The regulations extend certain family benefits to individuals during the transition period:

#### **1. Surviving Spouse Allowance (subsection 26(1))**
- A **surviving spouse** of a person who:
  - Became the spouse of that person **during the transition period** (from the date they ceased public service until the date they ceased employment with the new employer)
  - Is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the Act** (i.e., survivor benefits).

> This ensures that a spouse who married the employee during the transition period is not denied benefits due to the change in employment status.

#### **2. Child Allowance (subsection 26(2))**
- A **child** who:
  - Was **born to or adopted by** the employee, or
  - Became a **stepchild** of the employee  
  during the transition period  
  is entitled to an allowance under Part I of the Act.

> This protects the financial security of children born or adopted during the employment transition.

---

### **Service Period and Age Determinations**

#### **Pensionable Service (Section 12 and 13)**
- The period of service with the **new employer**, beginning on the date the person **ceased public service employment** and ending on the date they **ceased employment with the new employer**, is **included as pensionable service**.

> This means that time spent working at PMG Technologies Inc. during the transition is counted toward retirement eligibility.

#### **Age for Benefit Determination**
- The **age of the person when they ceased public service** is considered to be their **age on the date they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This avoids inconsistencies in age-based eligibility calculations, as the employee’s age at the end of the transition period is used instead of their age at the time of leaving public service.

---

### **Group 1 Contributor Status**

- Any contributor to whom these regulations apply is **automatically classified as a Group 1 contributor** under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

> Group 1 contributors typically include most federal public servants. This classification ensures that the employee is treated under the standard pension rules applicable to public service employees.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette).

> This ensures immediate applicability once formally adopted.

---

### **Significance and Context**

This regulation was introduced to address a **gap in pension continuity** created by the transfer of a public service asset (the Blainville Motor Vehicle Test Centre) to a private entity. Without such protections, employees who transitioned from public service to a private employer might have lost their eligibility for public pension benefits due to the change in employment status.

By allowing the counting of the transition period and extending family benefits, the regulation ensures **fairness, equity, and continuity** in the public service superannuation system — especially for those whose employment changed due to government asset transfers.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Blainville Motor Vehicle Test Centre Benefit Eligibility Protection Regulations* are a targeted, protective measure under the Public Service Superannuation Act. They ensure that employees who transitioned from public service to PMG Technologies Inc. during the 1996 transfer are not disadvantaged in terms of pension or family benefits. The regulations provide clear, enforceable rules for eligibility, service recognition, and benefit continuation during a transitional employment phase, aligning with broader principles of fairness and stability in public service retirement systems.
