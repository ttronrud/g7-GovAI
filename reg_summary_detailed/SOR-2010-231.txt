**Detailed Summary of the Annual Statement (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The *Annual Statement (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* are issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This action is authorized under two specific subsections of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*:

- **Subsection 292(2)a**: Grants the Minister the authority to prescribe the form and content of annual financial statements that cooperative credit associations must prepare and submit.
- **Subsection 463(1)b**: Provides the power to require cooperative credit associations to file prescribed financial statements with the appropriate regulatory body.

These provisions empower the government to establish standardized financial reporting requirements for cooperative credit associations (CCAs), ensuring transparency, accountability, and consistency in financial disclosures.

**Regulatory Text and Key Provisions:**

The Regulations prescribe the mandatory financial statements that all cooperative credit associations must prepare and submit annually. These statements are required to be prepared for each financial year and must conform to the following five core financial reporting formats:

1. **Balance Sheet as at the End of the Financial Year**  
   - A statement of the association’s financial position at a specific point in time (i.e., the end of the fiscal year).  
   - It details the association’s assets, liabilities, and equity, providing a snapshot of its financial health.  
   - Required to reflect all significant financial obligations and resources held by the organization.

2. **Statement of Income for the Financial Year**  
   - A summary of the association’s revenues, expenses, and net income (or loss) over the course of the fiscal year.  
   - Includes key income sources (e.g., loan interest, service charges) and operating costs (e.g., administrative, interest expense).  
   - Enables stakeholders to assess profitability and operational performance.

3. **Statement of Cash Flows for the Financial Year**  
   - Reports the inflows and outflows of cash during the year, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities.  
   - Provides insight into liquidity, cash management, and the ability to meet short-term obligations.  
   - Helps evaluate the association’s financial flexibility and cash generation capacity.

4. **Statement of Changes in Equity for the Financial Year**  
   - Tracks how the association’s equity has changed over the year, including contributions from members, retained earnings, and distributions (e.g., dividends).  
   - Highlights the impact of transactions affecting capital and reserves, such as share issuances or share buybacks.  
   - Ensures transparency in the movement of capital within the organization.

5. **Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Financial Year**  
   - Extends the income statement to include all changes in equity during the year that are not due to investments or dividends.  
   - Covers items such as foreign exchange gains or losses, unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments, and other comprehensive income (OCI) components.  
   - Offers a more complete picture of the association’s financial performance, including non-operating and non-cash items.

**Effective Date:**

These Regulations come into force on **June 1, 2011**. This date marks the start of their application, meaning that all cooperative credit associations operating in Canada must begin preparing and submitting these five financial statements annually from that date onward.

**Legal Context and Legislative References:**

- The Regulations are rooted in **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 195** and **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 208**, which provide the statutory framework for financial reporting in cooperative credit associations.  
- They also build upon earlier legislative foundations established in **S.C. 1991, c. 48**, which laid the groundwork for financial transparency and accountability in CCAs.

**Purpose and Objectives:**

The primary objectives of these Regulations are:

- To ensure **transparency and accountability** in the financial operations of cooperative credit associations.
- To provide **standardized, comparable financial information** to members, regulators, investors, and the public.
- To support **effective oversight** by financial regulators and ensure compliance with financial reporting best practices.
- To promote **trust and confidence** in the cooperative financial system by demonstrating sound financial governance.

**Implications for Cooperative Credit Associations:**

- CCAs must now establish internal financial reporting systems to generate and maintain these five statements.
- They must ensure that their financial reporting is accurate, complete, and prepared in accordance with prescribed formats and accounting standards (likely in line with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles—CGAAP).
- The statements must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authority (e.g., the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions or a designated body) as part of annual reporting requirements.

**Conclusion:**

The *Annual Statement (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* represent a significant step in enhancing financial accountability within the cooperative credit sector in Canada. By mandating the preparation and submission of a full set of standardized financial statements—balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity, and statement of comprehensive income—the regulations promote financial transparency, improve regulatory oversight, and strengthen public trust in cooperative financial institutions. These requirements became enforceable on **June 1, 2011**, and remain a cornerstone of financial governance for cooperative credit associations under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.
