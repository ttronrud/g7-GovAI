The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2015-99" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 99 of 2015 has been officially repealed.

However, without the full title or content of the original regulation (which would typically be included in the SI citation), a detailed summary cannot be provided. Statutory instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (or other jurisdictions that use the SI system), and SI/2015-99 would have been a piece of such legislation enacted in 2015.

Since the instrument is marked as **"Repealed"**, this means:

1. **Legal Status**: The regulation is no longer in force. It has been formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent piece of legislation or by a statutory instrument that explicitly repeals it.

2. **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted via a later statutory instrument, likely issued in 2015 or later, and the repeal is effective from the date specified in the repealing instrument (often in the same year or shortly after).

3. **Reason for Repeal**: Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
   - Obsolescence (it no longer serves a purpose).
   - Inconsistency with newer laws or policy.
   - Clarity or simplification of the legal framework.
   - Replacement by a more modern or comprehensive regulation.

4. **Impact**: Any legal obligations, duties, or requirements previously set out in SI/2015-99 are now null and void. Entities that were previously subject to it must now comply with the current, applicable legislation.

5. **Access to Original Content**: To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the original text of SI/2015-99, which may be found in:
   - The UK Statutory Instruments database (https://www.legislation.gov.uk)
   - The official UK legislation archive
   - Published legal databases such as Westlaw, LexisNexis, or the National Archives

**Conclusion**:
The regulation SI/2015-99 has been repealed and is no longer in force. A detailed summary of its original content cannot be provided without access to the full text of the instrument. To understand what it originally regulated, one must consult the original SI, which is now superseded.

👉 Recommendation: To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, search for "Statutory Instrument 2015 No. 99" on the UK legislation website (legislation.gov.uk) and review the original text or official summary before the repeal.
