## **II. Core Principles of Professional Conduct**

### **1. Integrity as the Foundation**
- **Integrity** is the most fundamental attribute of an agent.
- It is not just a formal requirement but an implicit, ongoing obligation that must guide every action.
- Agents must act with **highest standards of integrity and competence** to maintain public trust and respect within the profession.

> *"An agent must at all times conduct themselves with integrity and competence in accordance with the highest standards of the profession."*

---

### **2. Duty of Competence**
An agent owes a **duty to be competent** to perform any agency services and must provide such services to the standard expected of a competent professional.

#### Key Requirements:
- **Must not undertake or continue a matter** unless:
  - The agent believes they are competent to handle it, or
  - They can become competent **without undue delay, risk, or expense** to the client.
- If the agent reasonably believes they may lack competence:
  - Must **promptly advise the client**.
  - Must either:
    - **Decline to act**,  
    - Obtain **client consent** to become competent, or  
    - Obtain **instructions to retain or collaborate with another competent agent**.

> *Failure to meet professional competence standards occurs when there are deficiencies in knowledge, skill, judgment, attention to client interests, records, systems, or procedures — and such deficiencies lead to a reasonable apprehension that service quality will be compromised.*

#### Factors in Assessing Competence:
- Complexity and specialization of the matter
- Agent’s general experience
- Training and experience in technical fields and IP law
- Time and effort dedicated to preparation
- Whether referral to another competent agent would have been appropriate or feasible

> *Note: A single error does not necessarily constitute incompetence. However, **gross neglect**, **repeated mistakes**, or **patterns of failure** may constitute a breach of professional competence and could lead to disciplinary action.*

---

### **3. Professional Responsibility and Supervision**
- An agent assumes **complete professional responsibility** for all services provided.
- Must **maintain direct supervision** over staff, assistants, trainees, clerks, or legal assistants to whom tasks are delegated.
- Must ensure that all matters requiring professional judgment are handled directly by a qualified agent.

> *Especially important for sole practitioners or those operating branch offices or part-time practices.*

---

### **4. Office Procedures and Deadlines**
- Must maintain **appropriate office systems** that:
  - Meet all deadlines related to client matters
  - Properly handle and preserve client affairs
  - Prevent prejudice to clients

> *This includes systems for recordkeeping, communication, and timely responses.*

---

### **5. Continuous Education and Awareness**
- Agents must **keep abreast of developments** in:
  - Intellectual property law and practice
  - Patent agent privilege and trademark agent privilege

> *This ensures agents remain current and competent in evolving legal and technical landscapes.*

---

## **III. Duty of Confidentiality**

### **Core Obligation**
- Agents must **hold in strict confidence** all information obtained from clients during the professional relationship.
- May **only disclose** information if:
  - Client **explicitly or implicitly authorizes** disclosure
  - Disclosure is **required by law or court order**
  - Disclosure is **permitted or required by this Code**

> *This duty applies regardless of the nature or source of the information.*

---

### **Commentary on Confidentiality**
- The ethical duty of confidentiality is **broader** than statutory privilege.
  - It applies to all types of information — oral, written, technical, financial, strategic — regardless of whether others have knowledge of it.
- The duty **survives termination of the professional relationship** and continues **indefinitely**.

#### Exceptions to Confidentiality:
| Situation | Permitted Disclosure (with limits) |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Legal advice** | May disclose to legal counsel to seek advice on conduct |
| **Defending allegations** | May disclose to defend against claims of: <br> - Criminal offence involving client affairs <br> - Civil liability <br> - Professional negligence <br> - Professional misconduct or incompetence <br> *(Must not disclose more than necessary)* |
| **Fee collection** | May disclose to collect fees *(only as needed)* |
| **Conflict of interest detection** | May disclose limited information to detect or resolve conflicts arising from: <br> - Change of employment <br> - Merger or acquisition <br> - Change in firm ownership or structure <br> *(Only to necessary extent; must not compromise privilege or prejudice client)* |
| **Imminent risk of harm** | May disclose if there is a **reasonable belief** of imminent death or serious bodily harm to an individual |

> **In all disclosures**, agents must:
> - Disclose **only what is necessary**
> - Avoid unnecessary exposure of sensitive information
> - Ensure that disclosure is **limited to the essential facts**

#### Disclosure to New Firms (Conflict Detection)
- When transferring between firms or forming new partnerships:
  - Information may be shared **only to detect and resolve conflicts**
  - Must be shared with **as few individuals as possible** (ideally just one designated agent)
  - Must include:
    - Names of individuals involved
    - Brief summary of issues
    - Whether representation has ended
  - The new firm must provide an undertaking to:
    - Limit access to information
    - Not use it for any purpose other than conflict detection
    - Return, destroy, or securely store the information after screens are established

> *Client consent may be required in some cases (e.g., if disclosure would compromise privilege or prejudice a client).*

---

## **IV. Duty of Loyalty and Avoidance of Conflicts of Interest**

### **Core Principle**
- An agent must **not act for a client** if there is a **substantial risk** that their loyalty to that client will be **materially and adversely affected** by:
  - Their own interest
  - Duties to another client
  - Duties to a former client
  - Any other person

> *This is not a mere possibility — it must be a genuine, serious risk.*

---

### **What Constitutes a Conflict of Interest?**

Examples include:

1. **Representing a client in one matter while opposing them in another**  
   → Directly adverse interests

2. **Personal financial interest**  
   → e.g., owning shares in a company the agent is representing  
   → *Note: Owning a small number of shares in a public company does not automatically create a conflict if it doesn’t influence judgment.*

3. **Personal or close relationships**  
   → e.g., sexual or intimate relationships with a client  
   → May impair objectivity, compromise confidentiality, or allow exploitation

4. **Dual roles**  
   → e.g., serving as a director of a corporation while acting as its agent  
   → May impair independence, fiduciary duties, or loyalty

5. **Cost-sharing or space-sharing arrangements**  
   → Practicing with other agents who represent clients on opposite sides of a dispute  
   → Risk depends on integration of practices (physical, administrative)

> *Note: A conflict is not automatically imputed to a firm. If a sole agent or associate has a conflict, the firm is not automatically bound — the conflict may be cured by assigning the matter to another agent.*
