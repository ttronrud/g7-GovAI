**Detailed Summary of the Converted Company Ownership Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Converted Company Ownership Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act):

- **Subsection 407(4)a** and **(5)b** of the Insurance Companies Act  
- **Paragraph 703(b)** of the Insurance Companies Act  

These provisions provide the legal framework for determining ownership structures in life insurance companies that undergo a conversion from a life company to a company with common shares (i.e., a "converted company"). The regulations are designed to ensure that such conversions do not result in concentrated ownership that could undermine the stability, transparency, or public interest in the insurance sector.

### **Regulatory Text and Key Definitions**

#### **Definition of "Act"**
- In these Regulations, **"Act"** refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*.

---

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Definition of "Widely Held" Life Company (Under subsection 407(4) of the Act)**

A life company is considered **"widely held"** at a particular time if **none of the following conditions applies**:

1. **No individual or group has a significant interest in any class of shares** of the life company at that time.  
   → This means that ownership is dispersed among many investors, with no single person or entity holding a substantial stake.

2. **If another company acquired all of the voting shares of the life company as a result of the conversion** (i.e., the life company was converted into a company with common shares), then:
   - At the time of conversion, **no person has a significant interest** in:
     - Any class of shares of the **resulting converted company**, or  
     - Any class of **non-voting shares** of the original life company.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This provision ensures that after a conversion, ownership remains broadly distributed—preventing a single entity from gaining disproportionate control over the converted company, which could pose a risk to financial stability or regulatory oversight.

> 📌 *Note*: The "significant interest" is not defined in these regulations but is typically interpreted under the broader principles of the Act (e.g., ownership exceeding 10% of shares or voting power).

#### **2. Exemption from Subsection 407(4) – Small Life Companies (Under subsection 407(5) of the Act)**

Certain life companies are **exempt** from the "widely held" requirement under subsection 407(4) of the Act if they meet the following criterion:

> A life company is **exempt** if its **total assets in Canada were less than $7.5 billion** on **December 31, 1991**.

- This exemption applies **only to life companies** that were **not widely held** under subsection 407(4) at the time of conversion.
- The threshold of **$7.5 billion** is a historical benchmark based on the size of the company at a specific point in time (1991), reflecting the economic context of the insurance industry at that time.

> 📌 **Purpose**: Smaller life companies (by asset size) are not subject to the same ownership scrutiny as larger, more influential insurers. This recognizes that smaller companies are less likely to pose systemic risks and may not require the same level of ownership dispersion to maintain stability.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This exemption does **not** mean the company is automatically widely held—it only means that subsection 407(4) does **not apply** to it. The company may still be subject to other regulatory requirements.

### **Effective Date**

- These Regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

> This ensures that the rules are implemented immediately upon formal publication, providing clarity and enforceability for insurers and regulators.

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

These regulations are part of a broader framework to:

- Ensure **transparency and stability** in the ownership structure of life insurance companies undergoing conversion.
- Prevent **concentrated ownership** that could lead to conflicts of interest, reduced accountability, or systemic risk.
- Provide **clear, rule-based criteria** for determining whether a converted company qualifies as "widely held," which is critical for regulatory compliance and reporting.
- Recognize the **differences in scale** between large and small insurers, allowing proportionate regulation.

### **Conclusion**

The *Converted Company Ownership Regulations* establish a clear, legally binding framework for determining whether a life insurance company that has been converted into a common share company is considered "widely held." By setting thresholds for ownership dispersion and providing an exemption for smaller companies based on historical asset levels, the regulations balance regulatory oversight with practical considerations for different-sized insurers. This promotes stability, transparency, and fairness in the insurance sector’s corporate evolution.
