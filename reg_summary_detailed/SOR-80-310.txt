## 📚 **Detailed Summary of C.T.C. 1980-3 RAIL – Railway Costing Regulations**

### 🔹 **Overview and Purpose**
The *Railway Costing Regulations* (1980) were enacted under **Section 330 of the Railway Act** to establish a standardized, transparent, and legally sound methodology for determining **railway operating costs** for the purposes of assessing **actual loss**, **rate justification**, and **financial viability** of rail operations.

These regulations apply specifically to **cost submissions** filed by railway companies under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transport Commission (CTC), particularly for financial years **1979 and beyond**, and are designed to ensure that:
- Costs are fairly and consistently calculated,
- Losses due to discontinuation or abandonment of services are accurately measured,
- Rates are justified based on actual, recoverable costs,
- The financial health and operational realities of rail services are reflected in regulatory decisions.

### 🔹 **Key Definitions and Terms**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Railway Act* (and its associated provisions such as sections 252–261, 264, 272, 276–278, 329, and 330). |
| **Branch Line** | A railway line that is a subsidiary, secondary, local, or feeder line relative to a main line within the same company. Includes parts of such lines. |
| **Passenger-Train Service** | Any train or set of trains capable of carrying passengers, officially declared by the CTC (via order) as constituting a passenger-train service under sections 260 and 261. |
| **Uniform Classification of Accounts (UCA)** | A standardized accounting system prescribed by the CTC under Section 328 of the Railway Act. All cost submissions must align with this system or be reconciled to it. |
| **Committee** | The *Railway Transport Committee* of the Canadian Transport Commission, responsible for reviewing cost submissions and making decisions on rates and service viability. |

---

## 🔹 **Scope and Applicability**

- Applies to **all railway companies** under the jurisdiction of the CTC.
- Covers cost submissions for the **year 1979 and all subsequent years**.
- Subject to **Section 11** of the Railway Act and any **exemptions** granted by the CTC under **Section 46 of the National Transportation Act** (which allows for discretionary relief in specific cases).

> ⚠️ **Note**: The regulations do not apply universally to all cost calculations—different rules apply depending on whether the cost is being used to calculate **actual loss** or **variable rates**.

---

## 🔹 **Cost Definitions and Methodology**

### 1. **Definition of "Costs" for Actual Loss Calculations**
Costs are defined in two key contexts:

#### A. For **Branch Lines**:
> The costs that would have been **avoided** if the company had not maintained or operated the branch line in a given financial year. This includes:
- Variable costs of carrying traffic originating or terminating on the line (regardless of timing, method, or entity).
- Costs are adjusted after a **reasonable period of time** to account for operational adjustments.

#### B. For **Passenger-Train Services**:
> The costs that would have been **avoided** if the service had not been operated. Includes all costs related to passenger carriage, regardless of when or how incurred.

> ✅ Key Principle: Costs are not based on historical or average expenses, but on **what would have been avoided** in the absence of the service or line.

---

## 🔹 **Variable Costs for Goods Carriage (Section 278)**

- **Standard Basis**: Variable costs are calculated based on **carloads of 30,000 pounds** using standard railway equipment.
- **Alternative Routes**: If goods can be transported via **two or more railway companies**, variable costs are based on the **lowest cost rail route**.
- This ensures that companies are not unfairly charged for more expensive routes when alternatives exist.

---

## 🔹 **Cost Categories in Submissions (for Actual Loss Calculations)**

Costs must be categorized clearly and separated as follows:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Category I** | Direct expenses identifiable with the branch line or passenger service through company records (e.g., direct labor, materials used on the line). |
| **Category II** | Shared transportation and maintenance expenses that would be avoided if the line/service were discontinued. Includes off-line costs of traffic originating/terminating on the branch line. |
| **Category III** | All other avoidable expenses not covered in Categories I or II. Includes: <br> - Superintendence expense <br> - Traffic expense <br> - General expenses <br> - Communications expense <br> - Non-revenue freight expense |
| **Category IV** | Cost of capital, calculated using the rates specified in subsections 5(4) and (5) below. |

> ✅ This categorization enables the CTC to distinguish between **direct, shared, indirect, and capital-based** costs, improving transparency and accuracy.

## 🔹 **Allowances for Depreciation (Sections 256, 258, 261)**

Depreciation is included in cost calculations to reflect the **decline in value** of assets over time, especially when lines or services are discontinued.

### 1. **General Depreciation Allowance (for continued operation)**  
- Based on the **annual decline in salvage value** of depreciable road property that could be retired if the line/service were abandoned.
- Applied to **book value** of assets required for continued operation.

### 2. **Depreciation for Retained Services (after abandonment order)**  
- For the **last year before abandonment**, if the service was ordered to be retained:
  - An allowance is made for **new assets** required to comply with the retention order.
  - The allowance equals the **undepreciated cost** of these new assets, calculated as:
    > Actual cost – Salvage value – Accumulated depreciation (for subsidy purposes)

> 🔍 This ensures that companies are not unfairly penalized for investments made to maintain a service under regulatory orders.

---

## 🔹 **Allowances for Cost of Capital**

The cost of capital is a critical component in calculating actual loss and justifying rates. It reflects the **opportunity cost** of using capital in rail operations.

### A. **For Sections 253, 260 (actual loss and passenger services)**  
Two options available:

1. **Option 1 (Salvage Value-Based)**  
   - Apply the **rate of return on capital** (including income tax) to the **salvage value** of road property to be retired.  
   - Cap at **net book investment** (computed under group depreciation plan).

2. **Option 2 (Net Book Investment-Based)**  
   - Apply the rate to the **net book investment** of road property to be retired, **only if** the company can demonstrate depreciation and net investment calculations that reflect the **specific aging characteristics** of the assets.

3. **Additional Allowance**  
   - Apply the same rate to the **net book value of all other property** necessary for operation (e.g., buildings, equipment).

> ✅ The CTC determines the appropriate rate based on company-specific conditions and financial realities.

---

### B. **For Sections 256, 258, 261 (branch lines and services)**  
More detailed rules:

1. **For road property to be retired**:
   - Apply the rate of return to the **salvage value** of road property, **not exceeding net book investment** (based on group depreciation plan).

2. **For new assets required for continued operation**:
   - Apply the rate to the **net book value** of such investments, **at the time of investment**.

3. **For all other necessary property**:
   - Apply the rate to the **net book value** of property required for continued operation.

> 💡 This ensures that capital costs are fairly allocated and reflect both current and future investment needs.

## 🔹 **Variable Costs for Rates (Sections 264, 272, 276–278)**

When determining **rates for goods carriage**, costs must be **variable** and reflect changes in traffic volume.

### Key Rules:
- Based on **expense accounts under UCA** or **special studies** ordered by the Committee.
- Must include **changes in rail operations expenses** due to traffic volume changes, after allowing a reasonable adjustment period.
- Include an **allowance for cost of capital**:
  - Based on a **rate of return** (including income tax) that the CTC deems appropriate for **CP Rail (a Division of Canadian Pacific Limited)**.
  - Applied to the **variable portion of net book value** of assets related to traffic movement.

> ✅ This ensures that rates are economically responsive to traffic fluctuations and reflect true variable costs.

---

## 🔹 **Cost Submission Requirements**

### General Principles:
- Must be prepared in accordance with **costing manuals** issued by the Committee.
- Where specific costs are known and verifiable from company records, they **must be
