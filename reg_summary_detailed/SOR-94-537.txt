**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Automated Fingerprint Identification System Fees Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**  
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Automated Fingerprint Identification System Fees Regulations were established by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Treasury Board. This action was taken pursuant to **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empowers the government to establish and regulate fees for the use of certain government systems and services, including those involving administrative or operational costs.

**Regulation Title:**  
The regulations are formally known as the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Automated Fingerprint Identification System Fees Regulations*. They may be cited as such in official documents and legal references.

**Purpose:**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish a standardized, transparent, and accountable fee structure for law enforcement agencies that access and utilize the RCMP’s Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). This system is a critical tool used by police forces across Canada to identify individuals based on fingerprint data, supporting criminal investigations, missing persons cases, and other law enforcement activities.

**Key Provision – Fee Structure:**  
- The fee payable by law enforcement agencies is **$33.79 per sworn police officer annually**.  
- This fee is charged **per sworn police officer** who uses the AFIS, not per individual case or per query.  
- The annual fee is calculated based on the number of sworn officers employed by the agency who have access to or use the AFIS.

**Application and Scope:**  
- The regulations apply to all **law enforcement agencies** in Canada that have access to or use the RCMP AFIS.  
- This includes provincial and municipal police services, as well as federal law enforcement bodies that operate under the jurisdiction of the RCMP or require fingerprint identification capabilities.  
- The fee is intended to cover the administrative, technological, and operational costs associated with maintaining, securing, and operating the AFIS, including data management, system maintenance, and support services.

**Funding and Accountability:**  
- The fee is collected directly by the RCMP or through designated government channels and is used to fund the ongoing operation and development of the AFIS.  
- The fee structure ensures that the cost of access is fairly distributed among users, with the financial burden aligned with actual usage.  
- The Treasury Board and the Solicitor General are involved in the oversight and justification of the fee, ensuring compliance with financial administration principles and public accountability.

**Effective Date and Legal Status:**  
- The regulations were made effective on **March 26, 1991**, under *Statutory Instrument 1991, Chapter 24, Section 6*.  
- They are binding and enforceable under Canadian law and form part of the regulatory framework governing the use of government information systems.

**Significance and Impact:**  
- These regulations provide a clear, consistent, and legally grounded mechanism for funding the use of a vital national law enforcement tool.  
- They promote transparency by clearly defining who pays, how much, and for what purpose.  
- They also ensure that the AFIS remains a sustainable and secure system capable of meeting the evolving needs of law enforcement in Canada.

**Note on Amendments or Updates:**  
As of the current date (2024), no amendments to this regulation have been publicly announced or enacted. The $33.79 annual fee per sworn officer remains in effect, although future reviews may be conducted to assess inflation, system costs, or changes in usage patterns.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Automated Fingerprint Identification System Fees Regulations* establish a fair and legally compliant fee structure for law enforcement agencies to access the RCMP’s AFIS. By charging $33.79 annually per sworn police officer, the regulations ensure that the operational costs of maintaining this critical national identification system are covered while promoting equitable access and financial accountability.
