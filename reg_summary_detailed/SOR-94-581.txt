### **5. Special Privileges for the Director General**

The **Director General** of INMARSAT is granted **enhanced privileges and immunities**, comparable to those of **diplomatic representatives** under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations**.

| **Full immunity from criminal jurisdiction** | Immune from criminal prosecution, **except** in cases of a **traffic offence** involving a motor vehicle or other transport owned or operated by the Director General. |

> *Note:* This special status reflects the high-level nature of the Director General’s role and draws a parallel to diplomatic immunity, recognizing their role as a key representative of the organization.
