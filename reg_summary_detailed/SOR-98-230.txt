Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, which is an annex to the *Department of National Defence Divestiture Regulations* made under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* and the *Financial Administration Act*.

---

## **Detailed Summary of the Department of National Defence Divestiture Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22)**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The **Treasury Board**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, has issued these regulations.
- The authority stems from two key provisions:
  - **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSA)**: Allows the Treasury Board to make regulations governing the treatment of public servants who transition from the Department of National Defence (DND) to a new employer.
  - **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**: Grants the Treasury Board the power to make regulations related to public service superannuation and financial administration.

> This means the regulations are legally binding and apply specifically to public servants transitioning from DND to new employers due to divestiture (transfer of operations or assets).

---

### **2. Definitions in Scope**
Key terms used in the regulations:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSA), which governs pension and superannuation rights for public servants.
- **New Employer**: A person or organization that, through a formal agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, takes over the functions or operations previously carried out by a portion of the Department of National Defence. This includes any entity acting on behalf of or for the new employer.

> *Example*: A private company (e.g., Serco Facilities Management Inc.) that contracts to manage DND facilities and assumes certain operational responsibilities.

---

### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**
These regulations apply to:
- A public servant who:
  - Ceases employment in the public service due to a divestiture agreement;
  - Becomes employed by a **new employer** as a result of that agreement.

**Exclusions**:
- The regulations **do not apply** to a person who later returns to employment with the new employer (i.e., re-employment).
- **Sections 4 to 9** (which may relate to pension rights or service credit) do **not apply** if the individual has exercised an option under subsection 3(2) or (3) of the PSA (e.g., an option to transfer service or pension benefits).

---

### **4. Application of PSA Sections (12 to 13.01)**
Sections 12 to 13.01 of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (covering death benefits, survivor benefits, and children’s allowances) **only apply** to a person **on and after the date they cease to be employed by the new employer**.

> This means that once a public servant transitions to a new employer, their superannuation rights are governed by the PSA from that point forward — even though they were previously employed by the DND.

---

### **5. Return of Contributions (Special Provision)**
A significant provision ensures fairness for certain individuals who would have otherwise been entitled to a return of contributions under the PSA:

- **If, on or after April 1, 1998**, a person would have been entitled to a return of contributions under:
  - Subsection **12(3)** (return of contributions under a certain condition), or
  - Subsection **12.1(4)** (return of contributions for certain types of service),
  
  then the person may **request a return of contributions** in writing **within one year** of ceasing public service and becoming employed by the new employer.

- Similarly, if the person would have been entitled to **exercise an option in favour of the transfer value** under **section 13.01** (which allows for a transfer of pension value to a new employer), they may **exercise that option within the same one-year period**.

> This provision ensures that individuals who were previously in the public service and transition to a private sector role are not unfairly disadvantaged in terms of pension or contribution recovery.

---

### **6. Survivor and Child Benefits**
In the event of the death of a public servant while employed by a new employer, the **survivor and children** are entitled to benefits **as if the individual had remained in the public service**. Specifically:

- The **death benefit** under:
  - Subsection **12(8)** or **12.1(8)** of the PSA.
- Or, the **allowances** under:
  - Subsection **13(3)** or **13.001(3)** of the PSA.

> This ensures continuity of family support and pension entitlements, even when a public servant moves to a private employer.

---

### **7. Special Provisions for Children**
For the purposes of **subsection 26(2)** of the PSA (which provides allowances for children of public servants):

- A child who:
  - Is born to, adopted by, or becomes a stepchild of the person **during the period** between:
    - The date the person ceases employment in the public service;
    - The date they cease employment with the new employer,
  
  is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSA**.

> This protects children born or adopted during the transition period from losing access to public service benefits.

---

### **8. Timing of Key Periods**
- The **one-year period** referred to in **paragraph 10(5)(a)** of the PSA (for certain benefit claims or options) begins on the **date the person ceases to be employed by the new employer**.
- The **age of the person** for purposes of calculating pension entitlements under sections 12 to 13.01 is their **age on the day they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This ensures consistency in age and service calculation when transitioning to a new employer.

---

### **9. Pensionable Service and Service Credit**
- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period of service with the new employer that starts on the day the person ceases public service and ends on the day they cease employment with the new employer.

> This means that time spent working with the new employer is counted toward pension eligibility under the PSA, which is a critical feature for long-term retirement planning.

---

### **10. Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on April 1, 1998**.

> This marks the start of the legal framework governing transitions from DND to private-sector employers through divestiture.

---

### **11. Repeal Note**
- The provision previously stating that certain benefits were not available to children born during the transition period was **repealed by SOR/2016-203, section 56**.
- This means that the current version of the regulation (as of 2016) reflects updated policy and includes the protection of children born during the transition.

---

### **12. Example of Application**
**Scenario**: A public servant in the DND is transferred to Serco Facilities Management Inc. (a private company) under a divestiture agreement.

- The individual ceases public service employment and starts working with Serco.
- Under these regulations:
  - Their pensionable service includes time worked with Serco.
  - Their age for pension purposes is recorded on the day they joined Serco.
  - If they die while working for Serco, their spouse and children are entitled to death benefits and allowances as if they had remained in the public service.
  - If they would have been entitled to a return of contributions under the PSA, they can request it within one year of joining Serco.
  - If they have a child born during the transition period, that child is entitled to a PSA allowance.

---

## **Key Objectives of the Regulation**
1. **Ensure continuity of superannuation rights** for public servants transitioning to private employers.
2. **Protect family benefits** (death and children’s allowances) during and after transition.
3. **Provide clarity on contribution returns and pension service credit**.
4. **Support fair treatment** under the PSA, even when public service employment ends due to divestiture.

---

## **Conclusion**
These regulations serve as a **critical bridge** between public service and private sector employment in the context of DND divestiture. They ensure that public servants do not lose their pension rights, survivor benefits, or family protections simply because they move to a new employer. By clearly defining eligibility, timing, and application, the regulations promote fairness, legal certainty, and stability in the superannuation system.

**Note**: The reference to *Serco Facilities Management Inc.* at the end appears to be an example of a new employer and is not part of the regulatory text itself. It does not constitute a legal provision but rather illustrates a real-world application.
