**Detailed Summary of the Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations*, enacted on January 1, 1998 (S.C. 1997, c. 36), establish the criteria under which goods may be deemed to "originate" in a country that is a beneficiary of the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment. These rules are designed to ensure that only goods meeting specific origin requirements qualify for preferential tariff treatment under Canada’s MFN trade agreements.

The regulations are made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to subsection 16(2) of the *Customs Tariff*.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Definition of Originating Goods**

Goods are considered to originate in a country that is a beneficiary of the MFN tariff **if both of the following conditions are met**:

- **Cost of Production Threshold**:  
  Not less than **50% of the total cost of production** of the goods must be incurred in one or more countries that are beneficiaries of the MFN tariff, **or** in Canada.

- **Place of Final Manufacture**:  
  The goods must have been **finished in a country that is a beneficiary of the MFN tariff**, in the form in which they are imported into Canada.

> This means that even if some components are made in Canada, the final manufacturing step must occur in a beneficiary country (e.g., a country with which Canada has an MFN trade agreement), and at least 50% of the production cost must be attributable to that country or Canada.

---

#### **2. Exclusions from the Cost of Production**

When calculating the "cost of production" for the purpose of determining whether the 50% threshold is met, the following costs and charges are **excluded**:

- **Outside packing and related transportation expenses**:  
  Only packing required for transportation is excluded. However, **packing in which the goods are ordinarily sold for consumption** is **included**.

- **Gross profit** of the manufacturer or exporter, and **profit or remuneration** of any trader, broker, or other party dealing in the goods in their **finished manufactured condition**.

- **Royalties** (e.g., payments for intellectual property or licensing).

- **Customs or excise duties or taxes** paid or payable on imported materials.

- **Carriage, insurance, and other charges** from the place of production or manufacture to the port of shipment.

- **Any other costs or charges incurred or to be incurred after the completion of manufacturing**.

> This exclusion ensures that only direct, pre-manufacturing production costs are counted in the origin calculation, preventing the inclusion of post-manufacturing or profit-based elements.

---

#### **3. Shipping Requirements**

Goods are **only entitled to MFN tariff treatment** if they are:

- **Shipped directly to Canada**,  
  with or without transshipment,  
  **from a country that is a beneficiary of the MFN tariff**.

> This requirement ensures that goods are not indirectly routed through third countries (e.g., via a neutral country) to avoid origin requirements. The shipment must originate from a beneficiary country.

> **Note**: Transshipment is allowed, but only if the goods are ultimately shipped from a beneficiary country to Canada.

---

#### **4. Repeal Clause**

These regulations are **repealed** (i.e., replaced or cancelled) upon the date specified — **January 1, 1998**.

> This indicates that the regulations were temporary or transitional and were superseded by later rules or amendments.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Ensure **fair and transparent application** of MFN tariff benefits under Canada’s international trade agreements.
- Prevent **non-originating goods** (e.g., goods assembled in a country with no MFN status or assembled from components from non-beneficiary countries) from benefiting from preferential tariffs.
- Align Canada’s origin rules with international trade standards, particularly those related to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and bilateral trade agreements.

---

### **Practical Implications**

- **Manufacturers and exporters** must carefully track the cost structure of their products to ensure that at least 50% of the cost is attributable to either a beneficiary country or Canada.
- **Finished goods** must be manufactured in a beneficiary country to qualify — raw materials or components made elsewhere do not count unless they are part of the final production cost.
- **Post-production costs** (like shipping, insurance, or profit) are not included in the origin calculation, so companies must focus on pre-manufacturing costs.
- **Direct shipment** from a beneficiary country is mandatory — indirect routes (e.g., through a non-beneficiary country) disqualify goods from MFN treatment.

---

### **Limitations and Notes**

- The rules apply only to goods that are **imported into Canada** and **originating in a beneficiary country** under an MFN agreement.
- The 50% rule is a **minimum threshold** — if the cost of production in the beneficiary country exceeds 50%, the goods qualify.
- The regulations are **no longer in force** as of January 1, 1998, and have likely been replaced by updated rules under current Canadian trade legislation, such as the *Customs Tariff* or more modern *Rules of Origin* under the *Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)* or other bilateral agreements.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)* provided a clear, rule-based framework for determining the origin of goods eligible for MFN tariff treatment. By setting a 50% cost-of-production threshold and requiring final manufacture in a beneficiary country, the rules ensured that only genuinely origin-based goods received preferential treatment. However, due to their **repeal on January 1, 1998**, these regulations are **historical** and no longer apply in current Canadian trade policy. Modern origin rules are likely more detailed and may incorporate additional criteria such as value-added thresholds or specific product classifications.

For current compliance, stakeholders should refer to the **current Rules of Origin** under the *Customs Tariff* and applicable trade agreements in force.
