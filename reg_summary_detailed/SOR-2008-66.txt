**Detailed Summary of the *Prescribed Deposits (Trust and Loan Companies Without Deposit Insurance) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Trust and Loan Companies Without Deposit Insurance) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 413(5)a of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (TLC Act)**.  

- **Legal Basis**: The regulation is grounded in the **Trust and Loan Companies Act** (the "Act"), specifically subsection 413(5)a, which empowers the government to prescribe certain types of deposits that are not covered by deposit insurance.
- **Statutory Reference**: The regulation is referenced in **S.C. 2007, c. 6, s. 358** and also references **S.C. 1991, c. 45**, indicating its historical and current alignment with broader financial institution legislation.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Define what constitutes a "prescribed deposit"** — a type of deposit that is **exempt from coverage under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**.
- **Identify specific entities** that may make such deposits with trust and loan companies (which are not covered by deposit insurance).
- **Establish conditions under which such deposits are considered "prescribed"**, thereby allowing these companies to accept deposits without being subject to CDIC insurance requirements.

This is important because **CDIC insures deposits up to $100,000 per individual, per financial institution**, but **certain deposits are excluded** — particularly those from government or highly regulated entities — to avoid unintended risks or inefficiencies in the insurance system.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The following definitions are critical to understanding the scope and application of the regulations:

#### a) **"Act"**
- Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.
- Establishes the legal framework governing trust and loan companies in Canada.

#### b) **"Deposit"**
- Has the same meaning as defined in the **Schedule to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act**, **but excluding** subsections 2(2), (5), and (6) of that schedule.
- This means the definition of "deposit" is **narrowed** to exclude certain types of deposits (e.g., deposits that are not "deposits" for insurance purposes or that are held for non-financial purposes).
- This ensures that only **traditional, financial deposits** (like savings or term deposits) are included in the definition.

#### c) **"First Deposit Transaction"**
- Refers to the **initial deposit** made by a person into a trust or loan company in relation to a prescribed deposit.
- This is a key moment in determining whether a deposit qualifies as "prescribed" — it marks the beginning of a relationship between the entity and the company.

### **4. What Constitutes a "Prescribed Deposit"?**

A deposit is considered **"prescribed"** if it is **less than $150,000** and is taken from one of the following types of entities:

#### a) **Government Entities in Canada**
- Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province;
- An agent of the Crown (e.g., municipal or public bodies performing governmental functions);
- An entity controlled by the Crown in Canada.

#### b) **Foreign Government Entities**
- Government of a foreign country or its political subdivisions;
- Agencies or entities controlled by a foreign government.

- Includes:
  - Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
  - Asian Development Bank (ADB)
  - Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)

- Also includes any international agency that is a member of the **World Bank Group**.

#### d) **Financial Institutions**

#### e) **Pension Funds**
- Must meet two criteria:
  - Be maintained for a **pension plan registered for income tax purposes**;

### **5. Application of the Regulations**

- **Effective Date**:
  - The regulations come into force on the day that **section 358 of S.C. 2007, c. 6** (the amendment to the Trust and Loan Companies Act) comes into force.
  - If the regulations are **registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures a phased implementation, allowing for administrative and operational readiness.

- **Enforcement Context**:
  - These regulations apply to **trust and loan companies** that are referred to in **paragraphs 413(1)(b) or (c)** of the TLC Act.
  - These are institutions that typically engage in lending and investment activities but are not covered under the CDIC insurance scheme.

---

### **6. Regulatory Significance and Implications**

#### a) **Exemption from Deposit Insurance**
- Deposits that fall under the "prescribed deposit" category are **not covered by CDIC insurance**.
- This means that the **risk of loss** for these deposits is borne entirely by the **depositor or the institution**, not by the government insurance fund.

#### b) **Risk Management and Financial Stability**
- The exemption is justified because:
  - These deposits often come from **highly stable, well-capitalized, or government-backed entities** (e.g., foreign governments, international agencies, large pension funds).
  - The entities making such deposits are **less likely to default**, reducing systemic risk.
  - The **small size of the deposit** (<$150,000) limits potential exposure.

#### c) **Encourages Financial Services Activity**
- By allowing trust and loan companies to accept deposits from certain entities (especially international ones), the regulation **promotes financial innovation and cross-border financial services**.
- It supports **lending and investment activities** (e.g., foreign exchange, securities trading) by enabling access to capital.

#### d) **Alignment with International Standards**
- The inclusion of international agencies (like IDB, ADB) reflects Canada’s participation in global financial institutions and supports **international financial cooperation**.

### **7. Important Notes and Clarifications**

- **No CDIC Coverage**: Even though these deposits are "prescribed," they are **not insured** under the CDIC.
- **Definition of "Deposit" is Limited**: The definition excludes certain types of deposits (as per the CDIC Act schedule), ensuring only legitimate financial deposits are included.
- **First Deposit Transaction is Key**: The status of a deposit as "prescribed" is determined at the time of the **first transaction** between the entity and the trust/loan company.
- **Fiscal Year Requirement**: For revenue and asset thresholds, the fiscal year immediately preceding the deposit is used — not the year of the deposit itself.

---

### **8. Historical and Current Status**

- The regulations were **first introduced in 1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 45)** and **revised in 2007 (S.C. 2007, c. 6, s. 358)** to reflect evolving financial services and international relations.
- As of **March 8, 2008**, the regulations were in force (see SI/2008-33), indicating their current applicability.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Trust and Loan Companies Without Deposit Insurance) Regulations* provide a **targeted, risk-based exemption** from CDIC deposit insurance for deposits under $150,000 from specific, high-quality, and stable entities — including governments, international organizations, large pension and mutual funds, and financial institutions.

By doing so, the regulations:
- Maintain financial stability by avoiding insurance of low-risk, high-quality deposits;
- Support the operations of trust and loan companies in providing critical financial services;
- Promote international financial engagement;
- Ensure clarity and consistency in the definition of "prescribed deposits."

These rules are a **practical and necessary tool** in Canada’s financial regulatory framework, balancing insurance protection with operational flexibility for financial institutions.
