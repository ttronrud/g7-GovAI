**Order Citation:**  
*New Brunswick Hog Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order*  
Published in the Canada Gazette, Part II, page 183, on December 2, 1983 (SOR/82-42)  
Made pursuant to Section 4 of the *New Brunswick Hog Order*, established by Order in Council P.C. 1981-3629 dated December 17, 1981.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation establishes a levy system for producers of hogs in New Brunswick who market their hogs **outside the province**—including in interprovincial trade and export markets. The levy is designed to support the marketing and economic sustainability of the hog industry by funding marketing activities, such as promotion, transportation, and market access, through the New Brunswick Pork Board (Local Board).

**Key Definitions:**

1. **Agent**  
   - A person formally appointed by the Local Board (Porc NB Pork) to conduct business on its behalf.  
   - Includes individuals designated by the Local Board to **receive and collect levies** from producers.  
   - Ensures administrative efficiency and provides a designated point of contact for levy payments.

2. **Hog**  
   - Defined as an animal of the *porcine species* (i.e., pig) produced in the province of New Brunswick.  
   - This includes all pigs raised and raised for market, regardless of age or gender, as long as they are born or raised in NB.

3. **Local Board**  
   - Refers to *Porc NB Pork*, the official marketing organization responsible for managing the hog industry in New Brunswick.  
   - Acts as the collecting and administrative body for levies and funds raised under this regulation.

4. **Producer**  
   - A person directly engaged in the **production** of hogs, including farmers, ranchers, or any individual or entity involved in raising pigs for market.

**Levy Provisions:**

- **Levy Amount:**  
  Every producer who markets a hog **outside New Brunswick** must pay a levy of:  
  **$1.45 plus HST (Harmonized Sales Tax)** per hog.

- **Applicability:**  
  The levy applies to all hogs marketed in:
  - Interprovincial trade (e.g., sold to buyers in Ontario, Quebec, etc.)
  - Export trade (e.g., shipped to international markets)

- **Exclusions:**  
  Hogs marketed **within New Brunswick** are not subject to this levy.

---

**Collection and Deduction Mechanism:**

- Producers must remit the levy **directly to the Local Board or to its designated agent**.
- The levy is **deducted from the moneys payable to the producer** by the Local Board.  
  This means that when a producer receives payment from the Local Board for marketing or selling hogs (e.g., through a marketing agreement or sales program), the levy amount is automatically subtracted from that payment.  
  This ensures that producers do not pay the levy in cash but instead have it taken out of their net proceeds.

---

**Legal Basis and Authority:**  
The Order is enacted under **Section 4 of the New Brunswick Hog Order**, which grants the authority to the provincial government (via Order in Council) to establish levies on hogs produced in New Brunswick and marketed outside the province. This legislative framework ensures that the regulation is both legally sound and aligned with provincial agricultural policy.

---

**Effective Date and Jurisdiction:**  
- The Order came into effect on **December 2, 1983**.  
- It applies exclusively to hogs produced and marketed in **New Brunswick**.

**Significance and Implications:**

1. **Revenue for Marketing Activities:**  
   The levy funds marketing initiatives such as branding, promotion, export support, and market research, helping New Brunswick pork remain competitive in regional and international markets.

2. **Fairness and Accountability:**  
   By requiring producers to pay a levy only on hogs marketed outside the province, the regulation ensures that producers who sell locally do not bear the cost of interprovincial or export marketing.

3. **Simplified Compliance:**  
   The deduction from producer payments streamlines compliance—producers do not need to file separate tax forms or make direct payments; the levy is integrated into their regular revenue cycle.

4. **Support for Provincial Agriculture:**  
   The revenue supports the long-term viability of the hog industry in New Brunswick, helping to stabilize prices, improve quality, and promote sustainable farming practices.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The *New Brunswick Hog Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* is a targeted, transparent, and administratively efficient mechanism to ensure that producers of hogs marketed beyond New Brunswick contribute to the marketing and development of the province’s pork industry. By setting a clear levy structure and integrating it into the payment process, the regulation promotes equity, accountability, and economic sustainability in the province’s agricultural sector.
