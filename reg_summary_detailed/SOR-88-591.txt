The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  This means the regulation no longer exists or is in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework of the Canadian government.

- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  **SOR/2017-84** (Statutory Instrument 2017-84) is a regulatory amendment issued by the Government of Canada.  
  - "SOR" stands for *Statutory Instrument of Regulation*.
  - The instrument was published on **April 28, 2017**.
  - Section 1 of this instrument specifically **repeals** (cancels) the referenced regulation.

- **Original Regulation**:  
  The specific regulation being repealed was not named in your query. However, the repeated references suggest that multiple provisions or sections were repealed under the same section (s. 1) of SOR/2017-84. This is common in regulatory amendments where a broader repeal is applied to several outdated or redundant rules.

- **Purpose of Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant.
  - They have been superseded by newer, more effective legislation.
  - They create administrative burden or legal confusion.
  - They conflict with current laws or policies.

- **Implications**:  
  Any legal, operational, or compliance activity that previously relied on this repealed regulation is now **invalid or obsolete**. Legal or regulatory bodies must refer to current, active regulations in place after the repeal date (i.e., after April 28, 2017).

- **How to Find the Original Regulation**:  
  To identify the original regulation that was repealed, one would need to consult:
  - The full text of SOR/2017-84, particularly section 1.
  - The *Canada Gazette*, which publishes official statutory instruments.
  - The *Regulations and Statutes Database* (e.g., laws.justice.gc.ca) to search for historical references.
