**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **exempt certain goods** from the **use requirements** that are otherwise imposed under **tariff item 9807.00.00** of the Customs Tariff. These use requirements typically mandate that imported goods be used for a specific purpose (e.g., personal consumption or household use) within a defined timeframe or jurisdiction. This exemption allows specific categories of goods to be imported without being subject to such use conditions, thereby facilitating personal, familial, or cultural needs related to settlement and marriage in Canada.

**Exempted Goods and Conditions**  

The following categories of goods are explicitly exempt from the use requirements under tariff item 9807.00.00:

1. **Alcoholic Beverages Imported by a Settler**  
   - Exemption applies to **alcoholic beverages** imported by a **settler** (a person arriving in Canada to establish permanent residence).  
   - The settler must have reached the **minimum legal age** at which a person may lawfully purchase alcoholic beverages in the **province where the customs office is located**.  
   - This exemption ensures that new immigrants can bring in alcohol for personal consumption, provided they meet the provincial legal age threshold.

2. **Tobacco Products and Vaping Products**  
   - All **tobacco products** and **vaping products** (including e-cigarettes, vape pens, and related devices) are exempt from the use requirements.  
   - This exemption applies to settlers who import these items for personal use.  
   - The exemption supports the ability of new arrivals to bring in personal items such as cigarettes, cigars, or vaping devices for personal consumption, consistent with existing tobacco laws in Canada.

3. **Household Goods Acquired by a Settler**  
   - Goods acquired by a settler for use in their **household** are exempt if:  
     - The settler’s **marriage occurred within three months before their arrival in Canada**, or  
     - The marriage is **scheduled to occur within three months after their arrival in Canada**.  
   - The goods must be **set aside specifically for the settler’s household**.  
   - This provision recognizes the personal and familial significance of bringing household items to support a new life in Canada, especially in the context of marriage and family formation.

4. **Wedding Gifts Received Outside Canada**  
   - **Wedding gifts** received **outside Canada** by a settler in connection with their marriage are exempt from use requirements.  
   - The marriage must have occurred:  
     - Within **three months before** the settler’s arrival in Canada, or  
     - Within **three months after** the settler’s arrival in Canada.  
   - The exemption applies to gifts that are **received in consideration of the marriage**, such as furniture, clothing, or other personal items.  
   - This provision supports the cultural and social practice of receiving wedding gifts and ensures that such items may be brought into Canada without being subject to use restrictions.

**Key Interpretations and Implications**  

- **Settler Definition**: The term "settler" refers to individuals who are arriving in Canada to establish permanent residence, typically through immigration. The exemption is intended to support new arrivals in adjusting to life in Canada.  
- **Timeframe for Marriage**: The three-month window around the settler’s arrival is a critical condition. It ensures that the exemption applies only to goods related to a marriage that is either occurring during the initial settlement period or is planned shortly thereafter.  
- **Use Requirements**: The exemption removes the requirement that goods be used for a specific purpose (e.g., personal consumption or household use) within a set timeframe. This allows the goods to be imported and retained without immediate use or disposal obligations.  
- **Provincial Jurisdiction**: For alcoholic beverages, the legal age threshold is determined by the **province of customs entry**, meaning the exemption is location-specific.  
- **Exclusivity**: The exemption applies only to the specified goods and does not extend to other types of items or general personal effects.

**Policy Objectives**  
This Order serves several key policy goals:  
- To support the **integration of new immigrants** into Canadian society by easing customs burdens during the initial settlement phase.  
- To recognize and respect **cultural traditions**, such as bringing wedding gifts or household items, which are important to family formation.  
- To promote **fairness and practicality** in customs regulations by allowing personal and family-related items to be imported without unnecessary restrictions.  
- To ensure compliance with **provincial laws** (e.g., alcohol age limits) while providing flexibility for new arrivals.

**Conclusion**  
The *Tariff Item No. 9807.00.00 Exemption Order* is a targeted, humanitarian, and culturally sensitive regulation that simplifies the customs process for new immigrants. By exempting alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, household goods, and wedding gifts under specific conditions tied to marriage and settlement timelines, it supports the personal, familial, and cultural needs of Canadian settlers while remaining consistent with national customs and legal frameworks. This Order reflects a balance between regulatory oversight and the practical realities of immigration and family life in Canada.
