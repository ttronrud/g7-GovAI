### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in Nunavut from disposal**—that is, from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer—to **facilitate the negotiation and peaceful resolution of an ongoing territorial dispute** between **Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark** over **Hans Island**.

This action is not intended to transfer ownership or grant rights to any party, but rather to **ensure that the land remains neutral and available for diplomatic discussions** without being subject to potential commercial or legal complications that could interfere with the settlement process.

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

The Order withdraws the following:

- **Specific tracts of territorial land** located in the **Arctic Ocean**, specifically within:
  - The **Nares Strait**
  - The **Kennedy Channel**
  - **Quad 120B/15**, as depicted on the **1:50,000 scale maps of the National Topographic Series**

- The exact parcel described is:
  > *All of the landmass known as Hans Island, Nunavut, Canada, that lies above the mean low water mark and that contains an area of approximately 1.23 km².*

This includes:
- **Surface rights**
- **Subsurface rights** (i.e., rights to minerals, oil, gas, and other subsurface resources)

These rights are **fully withdrawn from disposal** and **cannot be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred** during the specified period.

---

### **Duration of the Withdrawal**

The withdrawal is effective for a **period of five years**, beginning on the **day the Order is made** (i.e., the date of its issuance by the Governor in Council).

During this five-year period:
- No government or private entity may initiate or proceed with any disposal process (such as a land sale or lease) involving the specified tracts.
- The land remains under the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada and is held in a **non-dispositional status** for the purpose of diplomatic negotiations.

### **Legal and Diplomatic Context**

- **Hans Island** is a small, uninhabited island (approximately 1.23 km²) located in the middle of the Nares Strait, between Canada and Greenland (a territory of the Kingdom of Denmark).
- The **territorial dispute** between Canada and Denmark dates back to the 19th century and was formally recognized in the **1973 Canada–Denmark Agreement**, which established the need for a peaceful and negotiated resolution.
- The **1973 agreement** provided for a **joint management framework**, but the final resolution of sovereignty remains pending.
- This Order is a **practical step** to ensure that the land is not subject to any commercial or administrative actions that could complicate or undermine the diplomatic process.

### **Significance of the Regulation**

- **Preserves neutrality**: Ensures that the land is not used for economic development or private interests during negotiations.
- **Supports international diplomacy**: Enables Canada and Denmark to focus on a fair, equitable, and legally sound resolution of the dispute.
- **Protects public interest**: Prevents potential exploitation of natural resources (such as oil or minerals) that could be contested or politically sensitive.
- **Compliance with constitutional and legal obligations**: The Order is authorized under the Territorial Lands Act, which grants the federal government the power to manage land in Nunavut, particularly in cases involving international disputes.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **temporary, targeted measure** to protect the integrity of the Hans Island territorial dispute. By withdrawing the surface and subsurface rights to Hans Island from disposal for five years, Canada ensures that the land remains available for diplomatic negotiations with Denmark. It reflects a commitment to peaceful resolution and underscores the importance of international cooperation in resolving historical territorial disagreements in the Arctic region.

This Order does not alter sovereignty or ownership rights, nor does it imply any final decision on the status of Hans Island. It serves as a **critical administrative and legal step** in the broader process of resolving one of Canada’s most enduring Arctic territorial disputes.
