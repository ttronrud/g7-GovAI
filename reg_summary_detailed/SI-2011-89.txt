## 📅 CREDITABLE PERIODS AND ELIGIBILITY CALCULATIONS

### 1. **Old Age Security (OAS) – Canada**
> Creditable periods in Macedonia are recognized as periods of residence in Canada **only if**:
- The individual made **contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial comprehensive pension plan during that time (via employment or self-employment).
> Similarly, periods in Canada under Macedonia’s legislation are **not** counted as residence in Canada for OAS purposes **unless** the person contributed under Canada’s system.

### 2. **Canada Pension Plan (CPP) – Creditable Periods**
> A calendar year in which the person had **at least 3 months** of creditable periods under Macedonia’s legislation is considered **one full creditable year** under CPP.

### 3. **Macedonian Pension System – Eligibility**
> - A calendar year of CPP contributions is treated as **12 months** of creditable time under Macedonia’s system.
> - A month of OAS contributions (not part of a CPP creditable period) is treated as **one month** of creditable time under Macedonia’s system.
> - For disability or survivor pensions: Same rule — 1 CPP year = 12 Macedonian months.

### 4. **Totalizing of Periods**
> If a person does not meet eligibility due to insufficient creditable periods, totalization applies:
- Totalize creditable periods from both Canada and Macedonia.
- Also include periods from **third countries** where both Parties have social security agreements allowing period totalization.

> **Exception**: If only Macedonia has an agreement with a third country, Macedonian citizens may totalize periods from that third country **unless otherwise specified** in that agreement.

> **Minimum Threshold Rule**:
> - If total creditable periods under a Party are **less than one year** and no right to a benefit exists under that Party’s law, **no benefit is payable** under this Agreement.

> **Partial Pension Calculation**:
> - For individuals eligible **only through totalization**, the amount of the OAS pension is calculated:
>   - **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on CPP pensionable earnings.
>   - **Flat-rate portion**: Multiplied by a fraction representing the ratio of actual CPP contributions to the minimum qualifying period (but capped at 100%).

> **Macedonian Pension Calculation**:
> - The **theoretical pension** is calculated as if all periods had been accumulated under Macedonia’s system alone.
> - The **actual pension** is then determined by applying the ratio of Macedonian creditable periods to the total (Canada + Macedonia).

> **Minimum Pension Guarantee**:
> - The Macedonian law’s **minimum pension guarantee** continues to apply to persons residing outside Macedonia.
