The regulation you provided pertains to a formal amendment to the *Canada Elections Act* (S.C. 2000, c. 9), enacted through a decision made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This action is grounded in the authority granted to the Governor General under subsection 2(1) of the *Canada Elections Act*, which defines the term "Minister" and allows for certain designations and procedural adjustments within the framework of electoral law.

Here is a detailed summary of the regulation:

---

**1. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-86 (February 12, 2025)**  
The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2025-86, issued on February 12, 2025. This order had previously established or modified certain provisions related to the eligibility, designation, or responsibilities of individuals involved in the governance of Canada’s electoral processes. By repealing this order, the government removes the prior legal framework or directive that was in place at that time.  

This repeal likely reflects a change in policy, administrative simplification, or a correction of a misalignment with current constitutional or statutory principles. It signals that the provisions of P.C. 2025-86 are no longer applicable or necessary and are being superseded by new legislative or interpretive arrangements.

**2. Designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as a Member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**  
Under the *Canada Elections Act*, the regulation designates the **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** (i.e., the Prime Minister) as a **member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada** for the purposes of that Act.  

This designation is significant because:

- The *Canada Elections Act* includes provisions that define who qualifies as a "Minister" or "designated official" with respect to the administration and oversight of electoral processes.
- The term "Minister" in subsection 2(1) of the Act is defined to include individuals who are members of the King’s Privy Council for Canada.
- By formally designating the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as a member of the Privy Council, the regulation ensures that the Prime Minister is recognized under the Act as a Minister, thereby granting them certain statutory rights and responsibilities related to electoral oversight, appointments, and governance.

This designation is not merely symbolic; it has practical implications for the exercise of powers under the Act, including the authority to appoint or remove electoral officers, to issue directives, or to act in official capacities during electoral periods.

**3. Legal and Constitutional Basis**  
The action is authorized under subsection 2(1) of the *Canada Elections Act*, which defines "Minister" as including any person who is a member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada. This provision ensures that key figures in the federal executive branch—particularly those in leadership roles—have formal recognition within the legal structure governing elections.

The Governor General in Council, acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, exercises the constitutional authority to make such designations. This reflects the principle of responsible government, where the head of government (the Prime Minister) is recognized as a central figure in the administration of federal affairs, including electoral governance.

**4. Purpose and Significance**  
The purpose of this regulation is to:

- Clarify and formalize the status of the Prime Minister under the *Canada Elections Act*.
- Ensure consistency and legal certainty in the application of the Act by explicitly recognizing the Prime Minister as a Minister under the Act’s definition.
- Remove outdated or superseded provisions (via repeal of P.C. 2025-86), thereby streamlining the electoral governance framework.

This action may also serve to reinforce the Prime Minister’s role in electoral administration, particularly in times of electoral disputes, by providing a clear statutory basis for their involvement in the oversight and management of federal elections.

**5. Regulatory Impact and Practical Effects**  
- The repeal of P.C. 2025-86 means that any provisions or interpretations derived from that order are no longer valid.
- The designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as a member of the King’s Privy Council ensures that the Prime Minister can exercise certain powers under the Act without ambiguity.
- It strengthens the legal foundation of the Prime Minister’s role in electoral processes, aligning with established constitutional practices.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a procedural and constitutional update to the *Canada Elections Act*. It removes an outdated order and formally affirms the Prime Minister’s status as a Minister under the Act through designation as a member of the King’s Privy Council. This ensures legal clarity, enhances the Prime Minister’s role in electoral governance, and reflects the evolving administrative structure of Canada’s democratic institutions.

It is a routine but important step in maintaining the integrity and coherence of Canada’s electoral laws, ensuring that key political leaders are properly recognized in their official capacities under federal legislation.
