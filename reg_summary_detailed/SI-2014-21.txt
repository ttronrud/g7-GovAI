**Regulation Title:**  
Order Designating the Minister of the Environment as the Minister Responsible for the Administration and Enforcement of Subsections 36(3) to (6) of the Fisheries Act

**Legal Authority:**  
Issued under **section 43.2a of the Fisheries Act**, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** and the **Minister of the Environment**.

**Statutory Citation:**  
S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 150; R.S., c. F-14

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation designates the **Minister of the Environment** as the official responsible for the **administration and enforcement** of **subsections 36(3) to (6)** of the *Fisheries Act*. This means that the Minister of the Environment now has the legal authority and responsibility to oversee and enforce these specific provisions related to fish habitat protection and the management of activities that may impact fish populations and their environments.

---

### **Scope of Responsibility**

The Minister of the Environment is designated for **all purposes and subject-matters** under subsections 36(3) to (6) of the *Fisheries Act*, **except** for two specific areas:

1. **Aquaculture Facilities**  
   - The construction, operation, modification, decommissioning, and any related activities involving aquaculture facilities.  
   - Any resulting effects of these activities on waters frequented by fish.  
   → *This area remains under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.*

2. **Aquatic Invasive Species and Pest Species**  
   - The control or eradication of any aquatic invasive species or species that are considered pests to the fisheries.  
   → *This responsibility remains with the Minister of the Environment only insofar as it does not fall under aquaculture-related activities.*

> **Key Point:** While the Minister of the Environment takes over enforcement responsibilities for most of subsections 36(3) to (6), the two exceptions are explicitly excluded and remain under the purview of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Enhanced Environmental Oversight**  
   The transfer of responsibility to the Minister of the Environment reflects a broader trend of integrating environmental protection with fisheries management. It strengthens the government’s ability to ensure that fish habitats are preserved and that activities impacting fish populations are properly regulated.

2. **Clarification of Roles and Responsibilities**  
   The regulation clearly delineates where the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans have authority. This reduces overlap, avoids confusion in enforcement, and ensures accountability.

3. **Focus on Habitat Protection**  
   Subsections 36(3) to (6) of the *Fisheries Act* are primarily concerned with protecting fish habitat, including the regulation of activities that may degrade or alter fish-bearing waters. By assigning enforcement to the Environment Minister, the government emphasizes the importance of environmental sustainability in fisheries policy.

4. **Exclusions Reflect Specialized Expertise**  
   The exclusion of aquaculture and invasive species control acknowledges that:
   - Aquaculture is a sector with unique technical and operational requirements, best managed by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) due to its direct impact on fish farming and aquaculture operations.
   - Invasive species management often requires specialized biological and ecological knowledge, which may be more effectively handled by the Environment Minister in coordination with DFO, though the regulation preserves DFO’s role in aquaculture-related activities.

5. **Legal Clarity and Consistency**  
   The regulation ensures that when officials, courts, or regulatory bodies refer to "the Minister" in the listed provisions, they are referring to the **Minister of the Environment**, thereby providing legal certainty in enforcement, compliance, and judicial interpretation.

### **Effective Date and Legal Status**

- The Order is part of **S.C. 2012, c. 19**, and came into force on the date specified in the statute.
- It is a binding regulation under the *Fisheries Act* and has the force of law.
- It is subject to review and potential amendment or repeal in the future as policy or environmental priorities evolve.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within Canada’s fisheries governance framework. It strengthens environmental protection by assigning the enforcement of critical habitat-related provisions to the Minister of the Environment, while preserving the specialized oversight of aquaculture and invasive species under the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. This balance ensures effective, science-based, and environmentally sound fisheries management across Canada.

**Summary in One Sentence:**  
The Minister of the Environment is now responsible for administering and enforcing key habitat protection provisions in the *Fisheries Act* (subsections 36(3) to (6)), with specific exclusions for aquaculture activities and invasive species control, which remain under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
