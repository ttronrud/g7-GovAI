Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Repeal of the Nova Scotia Milk Order and Introduction of the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission Order (S.O. 1984-316)**

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**
- The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture**.
- It is enacted under **subsections 2(1) and (2) of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empower the Governor General to make or repeal orders related to the marketing of agricultural products.
- This specific order **repeals the Nova Scotia Milk Order (P.C. 1984-1304)**, which had previously governed the marketing of milk in Nova Scotia.
- It **replaces** that repealed order with a new regulatory framework: the **Nova Scotia Dairy Commission Order**, which grants authority to the **Nova Scotia Dairy Commission (Commission)** to regulate the **interprovincial and export trade of milk produced in Nova Scotia**.

> **Note**: This order was later **repealed in full** by **SOR/2001-16, section 19**, meaning it is no longer in force as of 2001. However, this summary focuses on the content and intent of the regulation as it existed at the time of issuance.

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Dairy Commission Act of Nova Scotia* — the enabling legislation that creates and governs the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission. |
| **Commission** | The Nova Scotia Dairy Commission, a statutory body established under the Dairy Commission Act, responsible for managing milk marketing. |
| **Milk** | Defined as milk or cream from cows, produced in Nova Scotia for **consumer use in liquid form within Canada**. This excludes milk intended for non-consumer uses (e.g., industrial, animal feed, or non-liquid forms). |
| **Plan** | Any marketing plan established and amended over time under the Dairy Commission Act. These plans govern how milk is marketed, priced, and distributed, both locally and in interprovincial trade. |

---

#### **3. Core Authority Granted to the Commission**
The central purpose of this regulation is to **grant the Commission authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade** (i.e., trade between provinces) and **export trade** (i.e., trade outside Canada).

Key powers granted include:

- **Exercise of Powers Equivalent to Local Marketing Powers**:  
  The Commission may, with respect to persons and property located in Nova Scotia, **exercise all or any powers** it currently holds under the Dairy Commission Act and any applicable marketing plan **in relation to the interprovincial and export marketing of milk**.  
  → This means the Commission can perform functions such as setting prices, managing supply, regulating distribution, and overseeing quality standards — just as it does locally — but now applied to milk being sold outside the province or abroad.

> **Important Limitation**:  
> The authority granted **does not include** any powers exercised by the **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* in relation to interprovincial trade.  
> → This ensures that **federal-level oversight** (e.g., national pricing, export policy, or cross-provincial coordination) remains separate from the provincial Commission’s role.

#### **4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**
The Commission is empowered to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on:
  - Milk or any component of milk (e.g., butterfat, lactose).
- **Collect these levies** from persons engaged in:
  - The **production** or **marketing** of milk.
- **Classify producers** into different groups (e.g., by farm size, type of operation, or milk volume).
- **Set different levies or charges** for different groups, allowing for equitable or incentive-based pricing structures.

> Example: A small family farm may pay a lower levy than a large commercial dairy operation, based on classification.

---

#### **5. Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected from levies and charges may be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial stability during market downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, marketing, research).
- **Reimbursement for losses** incurred due to:
  - Poor market conditions.
  - Unfavorable sales or disposal of milk.
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among milk producers:
  - The Commission may use funds to **equalize payments** to producers during periods when market prices fluctuate.
  - This helps prevent economic hardship during low-price periods and supports fairer distribution of income across the sector.

> This mechanism is designed to **stabilize producer income**, reduce market volatility, and promote long-term sustainability in the dairy industry.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Implications**
This regulation reflects a shift from a **provincial-only marketing system** to a **more comprehensive, market-regulated model** that includes interprovincial and export markets.

- It allows the **Nova Scotia Dairy Commission** to play a central role in managing milk supply and pricing beyond provincial borders.
- It provides **financial tools** (levies and equalization) to support producers and stabilize the industry.
- It **preserves provincial autonomy** in dairy marketing by not overlapping with federal authority under the Canadian Dairy Commission Act.

---

#### **7. Legal Status and Repeal**
- The regulation was originally published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **April 20, 1984** (SOR/84-316).
- It was **repealed by SOR/2001-16, section 19**, which came into force in 2001.
- This means the **Nova Scotia Dairy Commission Order (1984)** is **no longer legally in effect** and has been replaced by newer legislation or regulatory frameworks, likely as part of broader reforms to agricultural marketing in Canada.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation was a significant step in modernizing Nova Scotia’s dairy marketing system by:

- Replacing outdated provincial milk marketing rules with a more flexible, market-responsive framework.
- Empowering the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission to manage interprovincial and export trade of milk.
- Introducing financial mechanisms (levies and equalization) to support producers and stabilize the industry.
- Clearly defining boundaries between provincial and federal roles in dairy marketing.

Although now **repealed**, it represents an important historical and policy development in Canadian agricultural regulation, illustrating the balance between provincial control and national market integration.

> ⚠️ **Note for Users**: While this regulation was once active, it is **no longer in force**. Any current compliance or operational decisions related to milk marketing in Nova Scotia should be based on **current legislation**, such as the *Dairy Commission Act* and more recent orders or policies. Always verify with up-to-date legal sources or the Nova Scotia government.
