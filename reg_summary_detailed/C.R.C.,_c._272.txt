**Detailed Summary of the *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially known as the **Saskatchewan Hog Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**. They govern the marketing of hogs in Saskatchewan, specifically in interprovincial trade and export transactions, and apply only to persons and property located within the Province of Saskatchewan.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972* of Saskatchewan (Loi). This is the foundational legislation under which the regulations operate.
  
- **Assembly Yard**: A designated facility where producers can deliver their hogs for storage, inspection, or resale. It serves as a central point for hogs before marketing.

- **Commission**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission*, established under the Act and the accompanying *Hog Marketing Plan*. The Commission acts as the primary marketing authority and oversees the regulation of hog sales.

- **Hog**: Any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) produced in Saskatchewan. This includes all stages of pig life from birth to slaughter.

- **Order Buyer**: A person who purchases sows at a public auction in an assembly yard with the intent to resell them to or on behalf of another party. This is distinct from direct buyers of hogs.

- **Plan**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. It sets out the framework for marketing, pricing, and distribution of hogs.

- **Processor**: Any individual or entity engaged in the business of slaughtering hogs or using them in manufacturing processes (e.g., meat processing).

- **Producer**: Broadly defined to include:
  - Anyone involved in producing or feeding hogs and making them available for slaughter;
  - The employer of such a person;
  - Anyone entitled to a share of hogs under a lease or agreement (e.g., a tenant or partner);
  - Anyone who takes possession of hogs as security for a debt (e.g., a lender).

- **Small Processor**: A processor that processed **less than 2% of all hogs slaughtered in Saskatchewan** during the previous calendar year, based on official reports from the *Department of Agriculture of Canada*. This category is granted special access to producers under certain conditions.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply **only** to:
- The **marketing of hogs** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside Canada).
- Persons and property **located within the Province of Saskatchewan**.

They do **not** govern intra-provincial sales or other agricultural products.

---

### **4. Core Marketing Restrictions (Subject to Sections 5–8)**

#### **General Prohibition on Direct Sales**
- **No producer may sell or offer to sell hogs** to any person **other than the Commission**.
- **No person other than the Commission may purchase hogs directly from a producer**.

> *Exception*: These restrictions are subject to **Sections 5 to 8**, which provide specific exceptions and authorized alternative pathways.

---

### **5. Exceptions to the General Prohibition**

Producers are permitted to sell hogs directly to the following entities:

1. **Small Processors**  
   – A small processor (defined as processing less than 2% of all Saskatchewan hogs annually) may purchase hogs directly from a producer.

2. **Consumers**  
   – A producer may sell hogs directly to a consumer for personal consumption.

3. **Other Producers**  
   – Producers may sell hogs to other producers (e.g., for breeding or feeding purposes).

4. **Designated Processors for Research**  
   – A processor designated by the Commission may purchase hogs directly to provide data for research purposes.

> These sales must be conducted through legitimate, documented channels and are subject to oversight.

---

### **6. Sales of Sows to Order Buyers**

- **Producers may sell sows** to any **order buyer** at public auctions in assembly yards.
- **Order buyers may purchase sows** from producers.

> This allows for flexibility in the breeding market, where sows are often resold to other farmers or operations.

> Note: Sows are **exempt from the general restriction** on direct sales to non-Commission entities.

---

### **7. Exempt Classes of Hogs**

Certain types of hogs are **exempt from the restrictions** in these regulations:

- **Breeding stock** (used for reproduction)
- **Weanling pigs** (pigs that have just been weaned, typically 3–6 weeks old)
- **Feeder pigs** (young pigs raised for feed before slaughter)
- **Boars** (male pigs used for breeding)

> These exemptions allow producers to manage breeding and early-stage pig development without being restricted by the marketing framework.

---

### **8. Interprovincial and Export Marketing via Dispensation Certificate**

A producer may market hogs **outside Saskatchewan** (interprovincial or export) **only if**:

1. The producer holds a **dispensation certificate** issued by the Commission; and  
2. The sale occurs through the **hog marketing system** in the destination province (if one exists).

#### **Issuance of Dispensation Certificate**

- The Commission may issue a dispensation certificate to any producer who:
  - Has obtained **prior approval** from the **hog marketing authority** in the province where the hogs are to be marketed (e.g., if selling to Ontario, approval from Ontario’s authority is required).
- The certificate is valid for a **period expiring on December 31st of the year following the issue date**.
- The certificate is issued **free of charge**.

> This ensures that interprovincial and export sales are regulated, monitored, and coordinated with destination provinces to maintain market stability and fair practices.

### **9. Payment Provisions for Producers Selling to the Commission**

When a producer sells hogs to the Commission, they are entitled to receive payments based on the sale proceeds, depending on whether the Commission conducts a **pooling system** or not.

#### **Case 1: Commission Conducts a Pool**
A "pool" refers to a system where the Commission collects proceeds from hog sales and distributes them to producers based on agreed-upon formulas.

- The producer receives:
  - An **initial payment** immediately after slaughter, determined by the Commission.
  - **Additional payments** at times and in amounts set by the Commission, until all proceeds are distributed to entitled producers.

> Payments are based on:
> - Quantity of hogs delivered
> - Quality, variety, grade, class, or size of the hogs

> Deductions are made for **disbursements and expenses** incurred by the Commission in connection with the sale (e.g., transportation, auction fees, marketing costs).

#### **Case 2: Commission Does Not Conduct a Pool**
If the Commission does not pool proceeds:

- The producer receives a **payment not exceeding** the price the Commission obtained from the sale of the hogs.
- The amount is calculated based on:
  - Quantity and quality/grade/size of hogs delivered
  - Less the Commission’s disbursements and expenses

> This ensures producers are fairly compensated, even in the absence of a pooling mechanism.

### **Key Objectives and Principles of the Regulations**

1. **Market Stability and Fair Pricing**  
   By centralizing hog marketing through the Commission, the regulations aim to prevent price volatility and ensure consistent, transparent pricing across interprovincial and export markets.

2. **Producer Protection**  
   Producers are guaranteed fair compensation through structured payment systems, especially when selling to the Commission.

3. **Flexibility for Specific Needs**  
   Exceptions are provided for small processors, consumers, breeding stock, and research, allowing for practical and efficient market operations.

4. **Provincial Coordination**  
   The requirement for prior approval from destination provinces ensures that interprovincial and export sales are coordinated and compliant with local marketing systems.

5. **Regulatory Oversight**  
   The Commission maintains control over the marketing process, ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in hog trade.
