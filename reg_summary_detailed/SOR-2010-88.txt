**Detailed Summary of the Renewable Fuel Used as Ships’ Stores Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended), and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**. This means the Order is a formal administrative measure enacted under the powers granted by federal legislation to promote specific economic or environmental objectives—here, the promotion of renewable fuels in maritime operations.

The Order is referenced in **S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)** and **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, indicating its legal foundation in the structure of Canada’s customs and trade laws.

**2. Definition of "Renewable Fuel"**  
In the context of this Order, **"renewable fuel"** is defined broadly as:  
- Fuel produced from **biomass**, **waste materials**, or **feedstock of biological origin**.  
- This includes fuels that may be **blended with petroleum products**.  
- The key criterion is the origin of the fuel: biological or derived from natural organic sources, regardless of whether it is mixed with fossil-based fuels.

This definition supports Canada’s environmental goals by encouraging the use of sustainable, low-carbon alternatives in transportation and energy sectors.

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
The Order provides for a **remission (i.e., exemption)** of customs duties that would otherwise be payable under the **Customs Tariff** for renewable fuels that meet the following conditions:

- The fuels are **imported into Canada** during a specific time period:  
  **April 1, 2006, to June 17, 2009**.

- The imported renewable fuels are **laden on board a conveyance** (a vessel or transport unit) for use as **ships’ stores**—i.e., supplies used by ships in operation, such as fuel, food, or other essential materials.

---

**4. Conditions for Remission**  
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. **Export or Processing Requirement**:  
   The renewable fuel must either:  
   - Be **released and subsequently exported in the same condition** as when it was imported, or  
   - Be **released in Canada, processed (e.g., refined, mixed, or treated), and then exported**.  
   This ensures that the fuel is not retained or consumed within Canada, preserving the intended use and compliance with the remission criteria.

2. **Conveyance Eligibility**:  
   The vessel or conveyance on which the fuel is loaded must be one listed in **Column I of the Schedule to the Ships’ Stores Regulations**, as it read on **June 17, 2009**, for the purposes of the Customs Tariff.  
   Additionally, any **limits or restrictions** (as noted in the schedule’s footnotes) that apply to petroleum products for that specific conveyance must either be **met or not exceeded**.  
   This ensures that the fuel is used only on eligible vessels and within permissible limits, maintaining regulatory control over maritime fuel use.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**:  
   The **importer must submit a written claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** within **two years** of the Order coming into force.  
   This establishes a clear deadline for claiming the benefit, promoting accountability and timely administrative processing.

4. **Evidence of Entitlement**:  
   The importer must provide the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** with **evidence or information** that demonstrates their eligibility under this Order.  
   This requirement ensures transparency and verification, preventing misuse or fraudulent claims.

5. **No Prior Refund or Drawback Claim**:  
   The importer must **not have previously claimed a refund or drawback** (i.e., a return of duties) under the **Customs Act or Customs Tariff** for the same customs duties related to these renewable fuels.  
   This prevents double benefits and ensures the remission is applied only once.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.  
This is a standard administrative practice, allowing the government to implement the regulation once it is officially published and recognized as valid.

---

**6. Purpose and Policy Rationale**  
The primary objectives of this Order are:

- To **promote the use of renewable fuels** in Canada’s maritime sector, supporting environmental sustainability and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.  
- To **encourage innovation and investment** in alternative energy sources by reducing the financial burden of importing such fuels for ship operations.  
- To align with broader federal policies on **climate change mitigation**, **energy diversification**, and **green transportation**.  
- To support Canada’s international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition toward a low-carbon economy.

---

**7. Key Implications**  
- **Environmental Benefit**: Encourages the use of bio-based fuels, which generally have a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-based fuels.  
- **Economic Impact**: Reduces costs for shipping companies using renewable fuels, potentially increasing competitiveness and adoption.  
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Provides a clear, time-bound, and conditionally structured framework for claiming duty remission.  
- **Compliance Requirements**: Imposes obligations on importers to maintain records, submit claims, and demonstrate compliance with both fuel origin and vessel eligibility criteria.

**Conclusion**  
The *Renewable Fuel Used as Ships’ Stores Remission Order* is a targeted, time-limited policy tool designed to support the integration of renewable fuels into Canada’s maritime industry. By exempting eligible renewable fuels from customs duties during a defined period, the Order incentivizes sustainable shipping practices while maintaining regulatory oversight through strict eligibility conditions. It reflects a strategic effort to advance environmental sustainability in Canada’s transportation sector through targeted fiscal policy.
