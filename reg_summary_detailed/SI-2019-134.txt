**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat  
**Legal Citation:** S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207; R.S., c. P-34  
**Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*  

---

**Summary:**

This regulation establishes a formal transfer of administrative control and supervision within the federal public service. Specifically, it moves the responsibility for the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)** from the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** to the **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Subject of the Transfer:**  
   The regulation pertains to the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)** — a federal agency or office established to support and coordinate the activities of Canada’s intergovernmental relations. This includes facilitating communication, planning, and coordination between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments on matters of shared policy and responsibility.

2. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation transfers not only administrative oversight but also the day-to-day management and strategic direction of the CICS. This includes responsibilities such as policy development, operational management, staffing, budgeting, and reporting functions related to intergovernmental affairs.

3. **From:**  
   The **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** — a senior constitutional office traditionally held by the Prime Minister or another senior minister. Historically, this role has included oversight of certain federal administrative bodies and policy coordination functions. In this case, the CICS was previously under the administrative purview of this office.

4. **To:**  
   The **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs** — a senior ministerial position responsible for managing relations between federal, provincial, and territorial governments. This transfer aligns the CICS more directly with the minister responsible for intergovernmental affairs, enhancing policy coherence and operational efficiency in federal-provincial coordination.

5. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (P.S.R.T.D.A.). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) the authority to reorganize public service structures, including the transfer of control over specific public administration units.

6. **Purpose and Implications:**  
   - **Improved Accountability:** By placing the CICS under the Deputy Prime Minister, the federal government strengthens accountability and ensures that intergovernmental coordination is directly tied to a minister with clear policy and political responsibility.  
   - **Enhanced Policy Integration:** The transfer ensures that intergovernmental policy development is more closely aligned with the priorities of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
   - **Administrative Efficiency:** It streamlines decision-making and reporting lines, reducing bureaucratic layers and improving responsiveness in intergovernmental negotiations.  
   - **Constitutional and Procedural Compliance:** The regulation follows established constitutional procedures by requiring formal approval through the Governor General in Council on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, ensuring legitimacy and transparency.

7. **Effective Date and Context:**  
   The regulation was enacted as part of **Statutory Citation 2003, c. 22** (the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*), which was introduced to modernize and restructure the federal public service in response to evolving governance needs. This specific provision reflects a broader effort to realign public service units with current government priorities, particularly in intergovernmental relations.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within Canada’s federal public service. It formally shifts the leadership and operational control of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat from a constitutional office (President of the Queen’s Privy Council) to a policy-focused ministerial role (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs). This change enhances the effectiveness, accountability, and strategic alignment of Canada’s intergovernmental coordination mechanisms, ensuring that federal-provincial-territorial relations are managed by those directly responsible for such policy areas.
