**Detailed Summary of the Locomotive Voice and Video Recorder (LVVR) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Locomotive Voice and Video Recorder Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under specific provisions of the **Railway Safety Act (RSA)**:

- **Section 17.95a** – Establishes the need for recording systems to support safety investigations.
- **Subsection 37(1)b** – Authorizes the regulation of safety equipment and operational procedures.
- **Section 40.1c** – Provides authority to regulate the installation and operation of safety recording systems.

These regulations were first introduced in:
- **S.C. 2018, c. 10, s. 62**
- **S.C. 2015, c. 31, s. 31**
- **S.C. 2012, c. 7, s. 31**

### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to a railway company that meets **at least one** of the following criteria:

#### **Criterion 1: Revenue and Track Operations**
- Gross revenues of **$250 million or more** in each of the two preceding calendar years for rail services in Canada.
- Operates **controlling locomotives on 5 miles or more** of track in Canada.

#### **Criterion 2: Passenger Service**
- Operates a **passenger train service** within a municipality or between adjacent municipalities.

#### **Criterion 3: Size and Operations**
- Has **15 or more operating employees**
- Operates controlling locomotives on **20 miles or more** of track in Canada
- Operates at least one controlling locomotive at **speeds over 25 mph**
- If transporting freight, generates **more than 10% of its gross ton-miles** on Canadian track

> *Note: This ensures that only companies with significant operations and potential safety risks are required to implement LVVR systems.*

### **4. Mandatory LVVR System Requirements**

A company must ensure that **every controlling locomotive** it operates is equipped with an LVVR system — **except** in the following cases:

#### **Exemptions (No LVVR Required)**
- **Steam locomotives**
- **Heritage locomotives** used **exclusively for tourist services**:
  - Traveling no more than a **150-mile round trip**
  - At speeds of **no more than 25 mph**
- **Yard service locomotives** used exclusively in:
  - Switching, marshalling, humping, trimming, or industrial switching
- **Locomotives used for testing or evaluation**
- **Locomotives intended for decommissioning within 18 months** of the regulations coming into force

---

### **5. Interior Signage Requirements**

Each controlling locomotive with an LVVR system must have **clear, bilingual (English and French) signage** visible from the farthest point in the vehicle. The signage must:

- Notify personnel that they are subject to **audio and video recording**
- Include the following statements:
  - **English**: *"It is prohibited by law for any person to do anything, including altering the locomotive voice and video recorder system, with the intent to prevent information from being recorded, collected or preserved."*
  - **French**: *"Il est interdit par la loi à quiconque de prendre une quelconque mesure, notamment d’altérer le système d’enregistrement audio et vidéo de locomotive, dans l’intention d’empêcher l’enregistrement, la collecte ou la conservation de renseignements."*

> This ensures transparency and awareness of recording obligations.
