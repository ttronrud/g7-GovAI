**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order of the Governor General in Council, under the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Key Provision:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments prepared by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** under **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act**.

**Specific Content:**  
- The Order confirms that the assessments conducted by COSEWIC for the wildlife species listed in the **annexed schedule** have been received and formally recognized by the federal government.  
- These assessments were carried out in accordance with the procedural requirements of subsection 23(1) of SARA, which mandates that COSEWIC evaluate the status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern) of wildlife species at risk in Canada.  
- The assessments are foundational to the scientific basis for designating species as at risk and for guiding conservation actions under the Act.

**Purpose and Significance:**  
1. **Formal Recognition of Scientific Evaluation:**  
   This Order serves as an official acknowledgment that COSEWIC has completed and submitted its scientific evaluations for the species listed in the schedule. This step is critical because COSEWIC’s assessments are the primary scientific input used by the government to determine whether a species should be listed as at risk.

2. **Trigger for Designation or Review:**  
   Upon receipt, the Minister of the Environment may proceed to designate species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under SARA, based on the COSEWIC assessments. This Order is a procedural step that enables the government to move forward with formal listing decisions.

3. **Compliance with SARA Requirements:**  
   The regulation ensures that the government adheres to the statutory requirement under subsection 23(1) that assessments by COSEWIC be considered before any species designation is made. It reflects the Act’s emphasis on science-based decision-making.

4. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   By formally acknowledging the assessments, the government demonstrates transparency in its conservation process and reinforces public trust in the scientific and regulatory framework for protecting wildlife.

**Legal Context:**  
- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) was enacted in 2002 to protect wildlife species at risk in Canada.  
- COSEWIC is an independent, scientific committee responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species.  
- Subsection 23(1) of SARA requires the Minister to consider COSEWIC’s assessments when making designations under the Act.  
- This Order is a procedural instrument that does not itself create new legal protections but acts as a formal recognition of the scientific basis for potential future designations.

**Annexed Schedule:**  
The regulation includes a schedule listing the specific wildlife species that have been assessed by COSEWIC. These species may include mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, or plants that are at risk of extinction or decline in Canada.

**Implications:**  
- Species listed in the schedule may be subject to future legal protections under SARA, including habitat protection, recovery planning, and restrictions on activities that threaten their survival.  
- The Order sets the stage for the next steps in the conservation process, such as the development of recovery strategies and the implementation of management measures.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and administrative instrument that formalizes the government’s recognition of COSEWIC’s scientific assessments for specific wildlife species. It is a key step in the implementation of the *Species at Risk Act*, ensuring that conservation decisions are grounded in up-to-date, peer-reviewed science. While it does not itself impose new regulations, it enables the Minister to proceed with species designations and the development of conservation measures under SARA.
