**Detailed Summary of the Department of External Affairs Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993**

---

### **Overview**

The *Department of External Affairs Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993* is a regulatory instrument issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada and the Public Service Commission) to govern the temporary employment of individuals in specific groups within the Department of External Affairs (now part of Global Affairs Canada) for short-term, non-permanent assignments.

These regulations were enacted to address a specific administrative and operational need during a defined period — from **April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993** — and are limited in scope, duration, and application.

### **Key Background and Rationale**

1. **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**
   - The Public Service Commission (PSC) determined that it would **not be practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to temporary appointments of less than three months in duration.
   - Specifically, the PSC concluded that applying the standard employment protections and requirements under the PSEA to short-term, intermittent roles (with total durations under six months over any 12-month period) would create administrative burdens and inefficiencies.
   - These roles are typically filled for temporary or project-based needs, such as clerical support, secretarial duties, stenographic work, or administrative assistance in technical or policy support functions.

2. **Desirability of Specific Regulations:**
   - Despite the exclusion from the full PSEA, the PSC recognized that such temporary appointments were **operationally necessary** and beneficial to the functioning of the Department of External Affairs.
   - Therefore, it was deemed desirable to create **targeted, simplified regulations** that would allow for the effective and flexible deployment of temporary staff without the complexity of full employment protections.

3. **Legal Authority:**
   - The regulations are authorized under two provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:
     - **Subsection 41(1)**: Allows the PSC to **exclude** certain individuals from the operation of the PSEA for specified purposes and periods.
     - **Subsection 37(1)**: Authorizes the Governor in Council to **make regulations** to govern the temporary employment of persons in specific categories and roles.

### **Scope and Application**

#### **Applicable Department:**
- The **Department of External Affairs** (now known as Global Affairs Canada).

#### **Applicable Employee Groups:**
The regulations apply only to individuals hired for positions in the following categories:
1. **Clerical and Regulatory Group** (Administrative Support Category)
2. **Secretarial, Stenographic, Typing Group** (Administrative Support Category)
3. **Administrative Services Group** (Administrative and Foreign Service Category)
4. **Social Science Support Group** (Technical Category)

> These are primarily support roles involving administrative, clerical, or technical assistance.

#### **Time Frame:**
- The regulations apply **only during the period from April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**.
- This is a **limited, time-bound** application, not a permanent or ongoing policy.

#### **Eligibility Criteria:**
- Appointments must be for **one or more specified periods of less than three months**, with the **total duration across any consecutive 12-month period not exceeding six months**.
- This means that an individual can be hired for multiple short-term assignments, but the cumulative time spent in such roles within any 12-month window must remain under six months.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulations**

#### 1. **Recruitment and Appointment**
- The **Deputy Head** of the Department or an individual **authorized by the Deputy Head** has the authority to:
  - Recruit, select, and appoint persons to temporary positions in the specified groups.
- This grants significant flexibility to the Department to respond quickly to staffing needs without going through full hiring processes.

#### 2. **Termination of Employment**
- The Deputy Head or authorized representative may terminate the employment of a temporary employee **with at least one day’s notice** under two circumstances:
  - **For cause** (e.g., misconduct, failure to perform duties).
  - **Due to lack of work or discontinuance of a function** (e.g., a project ends or a departmental function is suspended).

> This provision ensures that temporary appointments are not indefinitely extended and can be ended promptly when no longer needed.

---

### **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act**

- The regulations **exclude** individuals hired under these terms from the full scope of the *Public Service Employment Act*.
- This means that:
  - Standard employment rights (e.g., job security, collective bargaining rights, grievance procedures, and certain protections against unfair dismissal) **do not apply**.
  - The temporary nature of the appointments is recognized, and the employment is treated as a **contractual, short-term arrangement** rather than a permanent or fixed-term position.

> This exclusion is intended to streamline hiring and reduce administrative overhead while still maintaining sufficient oversight and accountability.

### **Regulatory Citation and Definitions**

  - **Department**: The Department of External Affairs.

### **Purpose and Intent**

The primary purposes of these regulations are:

1. **Operational Flexibility:** To allow the Department of External Affairs to respond efficiently to short-term staffing needs in support functions.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness:** To avoid the administrative and financial costs associated with permanent or long-term employment for roles that are temporary or project-based.
3. **Administrative Efficiency:** To simplify the hiring process by removing the need to apply full employment standards to short-term assignments.
4. **Transparency and Accountability:** To maintain clear boundaries and procedures for temporary appointments, ensuring that appointments are justified, time-limited, and subject to termination under defined conditions.

---

### **Limitations and Constraints**

- **Time-bound**: Only valid for 1993 (April 1 – December 31).
- **Scope-limited**: Applies only to specific job groups and functions.
- **No job security**: Temporary employees have no entitlements to permanent status, pensions, or benefits under the PSEA.
- **No collective bargaining rights**: These roles are outside the scope of union representation under the Public Service Employment Act.
- **No eligibility for promotion or career progression**: These are non-tenure roles.

---

### **Significance and Historical Context**

- These regulations reflect a **temporary, pragmatic approach** to public service staffing during a period of changing administrative needs.
- They demonstrate how public institutions can adapt employment policies to meet specific operational demands without overburdening the public service framework.
- While the regulations are no longer in force (as they were limited to 1993), they serve as a precedent for future temporary employment policies in the Canadian public service.

### **Conclusion**

The *Department of External Affairs Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993* is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure that allows for the temporary employment of individuals in support roles within the Department of External Affairs. It provides operational flexibility by excluding such appointments from the full protections of the Public Service Employment Act, while maintaining accountability through clear procedures for recruitment and termination. The regulations were designed to meet specific needs during a defined period and illustrate a balanced approach between administrative efficiency and public service integrity.

> **Note:** These regulations are **no longer in effect** as they were enacted for a specific time frame (1993) and are superseded by more modern and comprehensive employment policies in the Canadian public service. However, they remain historically significant as an example of temporary employment flexibility in government operations.
