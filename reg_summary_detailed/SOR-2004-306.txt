**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations (S.C. 2004, c. 10)**  
*Effective Date: December 8, 2004 (came into force on December 15, 2004)*

---

### **Overview**
The *Ontario Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations* (2004) were made under **subsection 18(1) of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA)**. These regulations establish the framework for how information about sex offenders is collected, registered, and managed across Ontario. The regulations define key terms, identify authorized personnel and locations for registration, and specify the geographic scope of registration centres.

---

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Definitions**
The regulations begin by defining critical terms used throughout:

- **"Act"** refers to the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act*, which provides the legal basis for the registration of sex offenders in Ontario.
- **"OPP"** stands for the *Ontario Provincial Police*, the provincial law enforcement agency responsible for policing across Ontario.
- **"Police officer"** is defined as a **chief of police or any other police officer**, but **excludes**:
  - Special constables
  - First Nations Constables
  - Municipal law enforcement officers
  - Auxiliary members of a police force

> This exclusion is important because it clarifies that only certain official officers within the OPP or municipal police forces are considered "police officers" under this regulation, and thus have specific roles in information collection and registration.

---

#### **2. Authorized Persons to Collect and Register Information**
The regulations specify who is authorized to **collect and register** information about sex offenders in Ontario:

- **Police officers** appointed to:
  - The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP)
  - A municipal police force in Ontario

- **First Nations Constables** appointed under **subsection 54(1) of the Police Services Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15)**

- **Employees** of the following organizations whose duties include collecting information for the purposes of the Act:
  - OPP
  - Municipal police forces in Ontario
  - Aboriginal police services
  - Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services

> **Key Implication**:  
> Any individual authorized to **collect** information under Section 2 of the Act is also authorized to **register** that information. This ensures a streamlined process where authorized staff can both gather and submit data without needing separate authorization for registration.

---

#### **3. Designated Registration Centres**
The regulations designate specific **places** listed in the **Schedule** as **registration centres** across Ontario.

- Each registration centre serves a defined geographic area known as the **designated area of service**.
- The designated area is typically the region served by:
  - An OPP detachment, or
  - A municipal police service

> For example:
> - A registration centre in a rural area may serve only the region covered by a specific OPP detachment.
> - A major urban centre like Toronto will have a registration centre serving the entire Toronto Police Service area.

---

#### **4. Special Designations for Specific Registration Centres**
Despite the general rule that the designated area of service follows the OPP detachment or municipal police service, two exceptions are explicitly stated:

- **Item 76 of the Schedule**:
  - Designated area: The area served by the **Manitoulin and Manitowaning OPP detachments**  
    → This ensures that individuals in these regions are properly served by a single, centralized registration point.

- **Item 136 of the Schedule**:
  - Designated area: The area served by the **Toronto Police Service**  
    → Ensures that sex offender registration in Toronto is managed through the Toronto Police Service’s designated centre.

> These special designations reflect regional variations in policing structure and ensure equitable access to registration services.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
The regulations come into force on the **later of two dates**:
1. The day the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (S.C. 2004, c. 10) comes into force.
2. The day these regulations are officially registered in the Ontario Gazette.

> The Act came into force on **December 8, 2004**, and the regulations were registered on **December 15, 2004**, so the regulations officially came into effect on **December 15, 2004**.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**
These regulations serve several key functions:
- **Ensure consistency** in how sex offender information is collected and registered across Ontario.
- **Clarify who can collect and register** information, reducing ambiguity and ensuring accountability.
- **Establish clear geographic boundaries** for registration centres, improving access and efficiency for both offenders and law enforcement.
- **Support public safety** by enabling timely access to information about registered sex offenders, particularly those with high-risk profiles.

---

### **Important Notes**
- The regulations are **binding and enforceable** under the authority of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.
- They operate in conjunction with the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act*, which sets out the legal obligations of sex offenders to register.
- The inclusion of **First Nations Constables** and **Aboriginal police services** acknowledges the importance of culturally appropriate and inclusive policing practices.
- The exclusion of **municipal law enforcement officers** and **auxiliary members** from the definition of "police officer" may limit their ability to register information directly, though employees of these agencies may still be authorized if their duties include such collection.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Ontario Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations* (2004) provide a structured, legally sound system for managing the registration of sex offenders in Ontario. By clearly defining roles, geographic areas, and authorized personnel, the regulations ensure that the registration process is efficient, equitable, and aligned with both public safety goals and legal requirements. They represent a foundational component of Ontario’s broader strategy to protect communities through transparent and accountable sex offender registration practices.
