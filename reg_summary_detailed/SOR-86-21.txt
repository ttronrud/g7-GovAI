### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Revocation of Atlantic Coast Marine Plant and Fishery Regulations and Introduction of New Atlantic Fisheries Management Regulations (Effective January 8, 1986)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under specific provisions of the **Fisheries Act**:

- **Section 8**: Authority to make regulations for the management of fisheries.
- **Section 34***: Power to regulate fishing areas and methods.
- **Section 34.3***: Authority to establish fishing areas and manage access.
- **Section 51***: Power to regulate the allocation and use of fishery resources.
- **Section 69****: Authority to establish rules governing fishing operations and vessel licensing.

The purpose of this regulation is to **revoke a number of outdated and fragmented Atlantic coast fishery regulations** and replace them with a **comprehensive, unified set of rules** for the **management and allocation of fishery resources** along Canada’s Atlantic coast.

---

#### **2. Revocation of Previous Regulations**

The following regulations are **fully revoked** and replaced:

| Regulation | Citation |
|----------|---------|
| Atlantic Coast Marine Plant Regulations | C.R.C., c. 805 |
| Atlantic Crab Fishery Regulations | C.R.C., c. 806 |
| Atlantic Fishery Regulations | C.R.C., c. 807 |
| Atlantic Fishing Registration and Licensing Regulations | C.R.C., c. 808 |

| Lobster Fishery Regulations | C.R.C., c. 817 |

> **Note**: All of these regulations were previously used to manage different aspects of Atlantic fisheries, including gear types, fishing areas, vessel classes, licensing, and harvest limits. However, they were considered **outdated, inconsistent, and administratively burdensome**.

---

#### **3. Purpose of the New Regulations**

The new regulations aim to:

- Provide a **coherent, integrated framework** for managing fishery resources across the Atlantic coast.
- Improve **transparency, predictability, and accountability** in fishery management.
- Promote **sustainable use** of fish stocks by setting clear rules on:
  - Fishing areas
  - Vessel classes and access
  - Gear types and mesh sizes
  - Harvest quotas and catch limits
  - Seasonal closures and close times
- Align with international agreements, particularly the **Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (1978)**.

| **Crab Fishing Area** | Zones defined in Schedule XI |
| **Herring Fishing Area** | Zones defined in Schedule VI |

| **Shrimp Fishing Area** | Zones defined in Schedule XVII |
| **Squid Fishing Area** | Zones defined in Schedule XIX |
| **Scallop Fishing Area** | Zones defined in Schedule XV |
| **Fishing trip** | From departure from port to offloading of catch |
| **Mobile gear** | Otter trawls, purse seines, scallop drags |
| **Fixed gear** | All fishing gear not classified as mobile, angling, drift net, crab trap, lobster trap, or dip net |
| **Mesh size** | Measured differently depending on gear type (e.g., in crab traps, average of 20 meshes using a standardized gauge) |
| **Length** | Defined specifically for different species (e.g., from nose to tail for fish, from eye socket to carapace end for lobster) |
| **Overall length of vessel** | Distance between extreme ends of the hull |
| **Vessel class** | Identified in licence or registration card (A1–A3000, B1–B220, C1–C6000, etc.) |

> **Important**: Common names in Schedule I are interpreted as referring to the species’ scientific name.

> All geographical coordinates are expressed in **NAD 27**; lines connecting points are **rhumb lines** unless otherwise specified.

#### **5. Scope of Application**

The new regulations apply to:

- The **management and control of fishing** for species listed in **Schedule I** (fish and marine plants) in the following areas:
  1. The **Convention Area** (Northwest Atlantic, including Gulf of St. Lawrence and adjacent waters)
  2. Tidal waters of the Provinces of:
     - New Brunswick
     - Newfoundland and Labrador
     - Nova Scotia
     - Prince Edward Island
     - Quebec
  3. **Ungava Bay**
  4. **Hudson Strait** east of 70°00′W

> **Note**: The rules apply to **all species of fish** listed in Schedule I, even if not explicitly mentioned in a provision.

> **Exception**: The regulations do **not apply** to:
> - Fishing by **foreign vessels** (except for recreational fishing in Canadian waters)
> - Fishing for **anadromous or catadromous fish** in Quebec tidal waters (as per Quebec Fishery Regulations)
> - **Manual harvesting** of dulse or detached marine plants
> - **Angling for salmon**
> - Harvesting of **cultivated fish or shellfish** (e.g., farmed Atlantic salmon, clams, mussels, oysters, scallops)

---

#### **6. Exclusions and Exceptions**

- **Recreational fishing** is exempt from **close times** (fishing hours) set in the regulations, provided it is conducted under **subsection 15(1) or (2)** of the Fisheries Act.
- The rules do **not apply** to **fishing for cultivated species** in aquaculture facilities.
- The regulations do **not cover** fishing for **non-listed species** unless explicitly referenced.

---

#### **7. Key Provisions and Sections (Summary)**

The regulation includes a range of management tools, including:

- **Fishing area designations** (via Schedules IV, VI, IX, XI, XIII, XV, XVII, XIX, XXI)
- **Vessel class restrictions** (different vessel classes have different access rights and gear limitations)
- **Gear restrictions** (prohibiting or limiting certain gear types such as drift nets or gill nets in specific zones)
- **Catch limits and quotas** (set per species, area, and vessel class)
- **Seasonal closures** (close times based on species life cycles)
- **Mesh size controls** to protect juvenile fish and prevent overfishing
- **Harvesting of marine plants** (managed under a separate but coordinated framework)

> **Note**: Sections 13 to 14, 17, 17.1, 20–22, 39–45, 46–50, 51.3(1), 51.4, 52, 54, 57, 61, 61.1, 63, 66, 68, 69, 70.1–72, 74, 77, 78 are included in the regulation — indicating a comprehensive framework for licensing, vessel registration, gear use, and enforcement.

#### **8. Historical Context and Repeal Status**

- The **original regulations** were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s to manage Atlantic fisheries.
- Over time, they became fragmented and inconsistent, especially with the rise of international cooperation and new scientific data on fish stocks.
- This 1986 regulation marked a **major reform** in Canadian fisheries policy — moving from fragmented, provincial-level rules to a **centralized, nationally coordinated system**.
- The **new regulations were repealed in 2017** (SOR/2017-58, s.10), reflecting further modernization and the implementation of more flexible, science-based management approaches (e.g., under the *Marine Stewardship Council* and *Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s evolving management frameworks*).

---

#### **9. Significance and Impact**

- **Improved governance**: Unified rules reduce overlap and confusion between jurisdictions.
- **Enhanced sustainability**: Clear gear and size limits help prevent overfishing and protect spawning populations.
- **International alignment**: Integration with the **Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention (NAFC)** ensures Canada’s compliance with multilateral commitments.
- **Foundation for future reforms**: This regulation laid the groundwork for later reforms, including the development of **Fisheries Management Plans**, **individual transferable quotas (ITQs)**
