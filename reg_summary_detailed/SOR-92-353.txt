## **Core Obligations of Insurance Companies**

### 1. **Asset Handling Procedures**

> - Temporarily held by an agent, liquidator, trustee, or issuer for reorganization, amalgamation, or voting purposes.

> This allows flexibility in modern, electronic, or temporary holding arrangements.

---

### 6. **Bearer or Non-Company-Registered Form**
- If a security is otherwise adequately protected against loss, fraud, theft, or destruction, the company may hold it in:
  - **Bearer form** (i.e., payable to whoever holds it), or  
  - **Registered form in a name other than the company’s** (e.g., a nominee).

> This provides flexibility in certain high-risk or high-value scenarios where physical or electronic safeguards are sufficient.

### 7. **Duty to Maintain Insurance Against Loss**
#### a) **Bond for Dishonest or Criminal Acts**

  - Other usual contingencies (e.g., fire, theft, natural disaster).

> These policies are essential to protect the company’s financial stability.

---

### 8. **Cancellation and Termination Provisions**
- Any bond or insurance policy required under sections 10 must:
  - **Not be cancelled or terminated** by the insurer or insured until **at least 30 days** after the Superintendent of Insurance receives a **written notice** from the insurer or insured of their intention to cancel or terminate.

> This provides a **cooling-off period** and ensures due process and regulatory oversight.

---

### 9. **Amount and Determination of Insurance Coverage**
- The amount of the bond or insurance policy must be established by the **board of directors**, based on:
  - The **nature and value** of the company’s assets;
