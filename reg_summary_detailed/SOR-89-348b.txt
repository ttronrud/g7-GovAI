**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Department of Forestry Terms Under Six Months Regulations, 1989**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation establishes a special framework for the temporary employment of individuals in the **Department of Forestry** in Canada during a specific time period — from **July 1, 1989, to June 30, 1991** — in the **Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support categories**, where the employment duration is **less than six months in the aggregate over any consecutive 12-month period**.

It is a **temporary, exception-based set of rules** that allows the Department of Forestry to hire workers on short-term, project-based, or ad hoc assignments without being bound by the full scope of the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)*, which normally governs public service employment.

---

### **Background and Rationale**

1. **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**  
   The Public Service Commission (PSC) determined that applying the full provisions of the PSEA to short-term appointments (less than six months in any 12-month period) in the Department of Forestry would:
   - Be **impractical**, due to the temporary and intermittent nature of such roles.
   - Be **contrary to the best interests of the Public Service**, as it would create administrative burdens, reduce flexibility, and hinder the Department’s ability to respond efficiently to operational needs.

2. **Need for Flexibility:**  
   The PSC concluded that it was **desirable** to allow the Department of Forestry to hire temporary staff for technical, operational, and administrative support functions without the rigid requirements of the PSEA — such as fixed terms, eligibility criteria, or detailed employment conditions — which are better suited to long-term, permanent positions.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The regulation is based on two provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:
   - **Section 41(1):** Allows the Public Service Commission to recommend that the Governor in Council **exclude** certain individuals from the operation of the PSEA.
   - **Section 37(1):** Authorizes the Commission to recommend that the Governor in Council **make regulations** to govern temporary employment in specific circumstances.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### **1. Scope and Applicability**
- **Applicable Period:** July 1, 1989 – June 30, 1991  
- **Applicable Department:** Department of Forestry  
- **Applicable Positions:** Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support categories  
- **Applicable Employment Duration:** One or more periods totaling **less than six months in any consecutive 12-month period**

> This means that a person can be hired for multiple short-term assignments (e.g., 3 months, then 2 months), but the total time served in such roles within any 12-month window must not exceed five months.

#### **2. Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act**
- All persons hired **on or after July 1, 1989**, for such short-term assignments (as defined) are **excluded from the full application of the Public Service Employment Act** during the specified period.
- This means they are **not subject to standard PSEA requirements** such as:
  - Fixed-term contracts
  - Promotion or advancement procedures
  - Collective bargaining rights
  - Formal grievance processes
  - Standardized pay scales or job classifications
- The exclusion is **limited in scope and time** — only applies to short-term, temporary assignments in the specified categories and within the defined timeframe.

#### **3. Recruitment and Appointment**
- The **Deputy Head** of the Department of Forestry (or a person authorized by them) has the authority to:
  - Recruit
  - Select
  - Appoint
  a person for a short-term position in the Technical, Operational, or Administrative Support categories.

> This grants the Department significant discretion in hiring, allowing it to respond quickly to changing needs without going through formal public service hiring procedures.

#### **4. Termination of Employment**
- The Deputy Head or an authorized representative may terminate the employment of a person under these regulations **on one day’s notice** under two circumstances:
  1. **For cause** (e.g., misconduct, failure to perform duties)
  2. **Due to lack of work or discontinuance of a function** in the Department

> This provides flexibility in ending temporary appointments, especially when project needs change or are no longer viable.

### **Regulatory Name and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled:  
  **"Department of Forestry Terms Under Six Months Regulations, 1989"**  
- It may be cited as such in official documents and legal references.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Implications**

- **Flexibility for Operational Needs:** Enables the Department of Forestry to respond rapidly to seasonal, project-based, or emergency staffing needs without bureaucratic delays.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Avoids the administrative and financial costs associated with long-term public service hiring.
- **Temporary Workforce Management:** Allows for the use of skilled contractors or consultants for short-term tasks without creating permanent employment obligations.
- **Limited Scope:** The exclusion is narrowly tailored — only applies to short-term roles in specific support categories during a defined period — minimizing risks to public service standards.

---

### **Limitations and Constraints**

- **Time-bound:** The regulation only applies until **June 30, 1991**. It does not extend beyond that date.
- **Category-specific:** Only applies to **Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support** roles. Does not cover managerial, policy, or senior-level positions.
- **No Protection Against Unfair Dismissal:** Termination is allowed with only one day’s notice, even for non-performance issues, which may raise concerns about job security.
- **No Formal Pay or Conditions:** Employment terms (salary, benefits, working hours) are not standardized and are left to the discretion of the Department.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **targeted exception** to the general principles of public service employment, designed to enhance operational efficiency in the Department of Forestry during a transitional period. By excluding short-term, temporary appointments from the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act, it allows for greater agility in staffing decisions while maintaining accountability through defined hiring and termination procedures.

It reflects a balance between **public service integrity** and **operational necessity**, particularly in a department that may face fluctuating demands due to seasonal activities, environmental projects, or administrative changes.

**Final Note:**  
This regulation is a historical document, effective only from **July 1, 1989, to June 30, 1991**. It has since been superseded by more modern employment frameworks and may no longer be in force. However, it serves as an example of how public service bodies can create temporary regulatory exceptions to meet specific operational needs.
