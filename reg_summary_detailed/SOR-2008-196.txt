**Detailed Summary of the Evaluation of Impaired Operation (Drugs and Alcohol) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Evaluation of Impaired Operation (Drugs and Alcohol) Regulations* were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, pursuant to **section 254.1a of the Criminal Code** (R.S.C., c. C-46). This provision empowers the government to establish detailed procedural standards for the evaluation of individuals suspected of being impaired by drugs or alcohol, particularly in the context of traffic-related offenses.

The regulations were published in *Statutes Canada* on **July 2, 2008**, and came into force on the same date.

### **1. Qualification of Evaluating Officers**

A key requirement of these regulations is that **only certified drug recognition experts (DREs)** may conduct evaluations under this regime. These officers must be:

- **Accredited by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP)**  
  This ensures that evaluators meet internationally recognized standards for training, competence, and professional conduct in identifying signs of impairment due to drugs or alcohol.

This accreditation requirement establishes a high threshold of professional qualification, reducing the risk of inaccurate or biased assessments.

### **2. Standard Field Sobriety Tests (Under Section 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code)**

These are the baseline physical coordination tests used during initial field evaluations of drivers suspected of being impaired. The tests are standardized and designed to assess a person’s ability to perform motor tasks under conditions that may be affected by alcohol or drug impairment.

The three standard field sobriety tests include:

1. **Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN)**  
   - Measures involuntary jerking (nystagmus) of the eyes when the head is turned from side to side.  
   - A key indicator of impairment, especially from alcohol or certain drugs.  
   - The test evaluates the presence, onset, and direction of nystagmus.

2. **Walk-and-Turn Test**  
   - Requires the individual to take a series of steps (e.g., 3 steps forward, 3 steps back, turn, and return) with eyes closed.  
   - Assesses balance, coordination, and ability to follow instructions.  
   - Impairment may be indicated by inability to complete the test, loss of balance, or failure to follow instructions.

3. **One-Leg Stand Test**  
   - Requires the person to stand on one leg for 15–30 seconds with eyes closed.  
   - Evaluates balance and proprioception.  
   - Failure to maintain balance or to remain upright indicates potential impairment.

These tests are used under **paragraph 254(2)(a)** of the Criminal Code and are part of the initial field assessment.

### **3. Comprehensive Evaluation Procedures (Under Subsection 254(3.1))**

Section 254(3.1) of the Criminal Code authorizes a more detailed and systematic evaluation process when a suspect is suspected of being impaired by drugs or alcohol. The regulations outline a full protocol that includes the following structured components:

#### a. **Preliminary Examination**
- Measures the subject’s **pulse rate**.
- Confirms that **pupils are equal in size** (symmetry).
- Verifies that the subject’s **eyes track an object equally** (i.e., no abnormal movement or deviation).

#### b. **Eye Examinations**
These tests evaluate eye movement and neurological function to detect signs of impairment:

1. **Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN)**  
   - As described above; assesses horizontal eye movement and nystagmus.

2. **Vertical Gaze Nystagmus Test (VGN)**  
   - Evaluates eye movement when looking up and down.  
   - Nystagmus in this direction can indicate central nervous system impairment.

3. **Lack-of-Convergence Test**  
   - Tests the ability of the eyes to focus on a single point by moving the eyes inward (convergence).  
   - A lack of convergence may suggest neurological or ocular impairment, especially from drugs.

#### c. **Divided-Attention Tests**
These assess a person’s ability to focus and perform tasks simultaneously or under distraction:

1. **Romberg Balance Test**  
   - Requires the subject to stand with feet together and eyes closed.  
   - Tests balance and proprioception.  
   - Loss of balance may indicate impaired coordination.

2. **Walk-and-Turn Test (as referenced in paragraph 2(b))**  
   - Repeats the standard walk-and-turn test; used again in a more formal evaluation.

3. **One-Leg Stand Test (as referenced in paragraph 2(c))**  
   - Repeats the standard one-leg stand test; used again in a formal assessment.

4. **Finger-to-Nose Test**  
   - Requires the subject to close their eyes and touch the tip of their index finger to the tip of their nose.  
   - The test is repeated with the head tilted back to assess coordination.  
   - This test evaluates fine motor control and coordination of the hands and eyes.  
   - A failure to perform the test accurately may indicate neurological impairment.

#### d. **Physiological Examination**
- Measures **blood pressure**, **body temperature**, and **pulse rate**.  
- These vital signs help assess the subject’s physiological state and may assist in determining whether impairment is due to alcohol, drugs, or other factors.

#### e. **Pupil Examination**
- Conducted under three distinct lighting conditions:
  - **Ambient light** (normal room lighting)
  - **Near total darkness**
  - **Direct light** (e.g., a bright light shone into the eye)
- Evaluates pupil size, reactivity, and symmetry.  
- Abnormal responses (e.g., fixed pupils, slow reaction, unequal size) can indicate drug or alcohol influence.

- **Examination of nasal and oral cavities**  
  - Checks for signs of drug use, such as residue, track marks, or other physical evidence.  
  - May also detect signs of recent drug use (e.g., nasal septum irritation, oral lesions).

#### f. **Muscle Tone and Pulse Check**
- Evaluates **muscle tone** (firmness and responsiveness of muscles) and **pulse rate**.  
- Abnormal muscle tone (e.g., hypotonia or hypertonia) may indicate neurological or drug-related impairment.

#### g. **Visual Examination of Body Parts**
- A visual inspection of the **arms, neck**, and **legs** (if exposed) for signs of **injection sites** (e.g., track marks or bruising).  
- This is a critical step in detecting possible intravenous drug use.

### **Purpose and Significance of the Regulations**

These regulations provide a **structured, standardized, and scientifically grounded framework** for evaluating individuals suspected of being impaired by drugs or alcohol. Their primary objectives include:

- Ensuring **consistency and reliability** in impairment assessments across jurisdictions.
- Providing **clear, objective criteria** for law enforcement officers and evaluators.
- Reducing the risk of **misdiagnosis or bias** in determining whether a person is impaired.
- Supporting the **admissibility of evaluation results** in court by establishing a formal, accredited process.

By defining specific tests, procedures, and qualifications, the regulations enhance the **legal validity and credibility** of impairment evaluations, which are often used as evidence in criminal proceedings related to impaired driving.

### **Conclusion**

The *Evaluation of Impaired Operation (Drugs and Alcohol) Regulations* represent a significant step toward professionalizing and standardizing the assessment of impairment in Canada. By mandating a specific set of tests, defining clear procedures, and requiring certified, accredited evaluators, the regulations enhance both the scientific rigor and legal integrity of impairment evaluations in traffic-related offenses. This ensures that decisions regarding impairment are based on objective, repeatable, and evidence-based criteria, ultimately contributing to fairer and more reliable outcomes in the justice system.
