### **Detailed Summary of the Canada-Ireland Agreement on Social Security (1992 Proclamation)**

This document is a **Proclamation issued by the Government of Canada** on **March 17, 1992**, under the authority of **Order in Council P.C. 1992-302**, formally announcing that the **Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Ireland** entered into force in Canada on **January 1, 1992**. The agreement was signed at Ottawa on **November 29, 1990**, and ratified by both governments, with instruments of ratification exchanged on **November 28, 1991**. The agreement became effective as of the first day of the second month following that exchange — thus, **January 1, 1992**.

The proclamation serves as **official public notice** that the social security agreement is now in force and binding in Canada, and it outlines the key provisions governing how social security benefits are calculated, administered, and shared between Canada and Ireland for individuals who have lived, worked, or contributed in either country.

## **I. Purpose and Background**

The primary objective of the Agreement is to **ensure that individuals who have lived or worked in both Canada and Ireland** are not disadvantaged due to cross-border residency or employment. It establishes **reciprocal rights to social security benefits**, including pensions, disability benefits, widow’s pensions, and death grants, while avoiding double taxation or double counting of contributions.

It is grounded in **Article XXII of the Agreement of Social Security between Canada and Ireland**, which provides the legal framework for the mutual recognition of social security rights.

---

## **IV. Reciprocal Benefit Rights**

### **Core Principle: Equal Eligibility**
Any person who has been subject to the legislation of one country and whose dependants/survivors are covered under that legislation shall be **eligible for benefits under the other country’s system under the same conditions as a citizen of that country**.

This includes:
- Entitlement to pensions, allowances, and death benefits
- Equal treatment in terms of eligibility and benefit amounts

### **Key Exceptions and Special Rules**

| Scenario | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Residency and Benefit Payment** | Benefits are **not reduced, suspended, or cancelled** simply because the recipient resides in the other country. Benefits are **paid in the territory of the other country**. |
| **Benefits for Persons Subject to Both Systems** | If a person has contributed to both Canada and Ireland, benefits may be paid in a **third country** (e.g., if they live abroad). |
| **Employed Persons Working in One Country** | An employed person working in one country is subject **only to the legislation of that country**. |
| **Self-Employed Persons** | A self-employed person who works in the territory of the other country is subject **only to the legislation of their country of residence**. |
| **Temporary Assignments (24-Month Rule)** | An employee assigned to work in the other country by the same employer (with a business location in their home country) is subject **only to the legislation of the home country for up to 24 months**. This period may be extended by mutual agreement. |
| **Seabed/Exploration Installations** | Workers on installations in the **continental shelf** (under international law) are treated as if the installation is located in the country where it is situated. |
| **Seagoing Ship Crews** | Crew members are subject to:
  - **Ireland** if the ship flies the Irish flag

> - They may **elect to be subject to the home country’s legislation** within **six months** of starting duties.
> - This right **does not apply** to non-citizens.

> **Employers must comply** with all requirements under the applicable legislation.

## **V. Periods of Residence and Contributions – Calculations**

### **A. For Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Canada**
- **Residence in Ireland**: A period of residence in Ireland **counts as residence in Canada** for the individual and their spouse/dependants **who are not employed or self-employed in Ireland**.
- **Residence in Canada**: A period of residence in Canada **does NOT count** toward OASA eligibility if the person was subject to Irish legislation due to employment or self-employment.

> **Exception**: If a person is not entitled to a pension due to insufficient reckonable periods, **totalization** applies — combining periods from both countries.

### **B. Totalization of Reckonable Periods**
- To determine eligibility, **all reckonable periods** (contributions or residence) from both countries are combined.
- Periods **do not overlap** unless explicitly allowed.
- **Totalization applies only if**:
  - The individual has less than one year of reckonable periods under one country’s system
  - No benefit exists under that system alone

> If totalization is used, the **total period** is considered for eligibility.

### **C. Special Rules for Benefit Calculation**

#### **1. For Old Age Security (OASA) Benefits**
- A **week ending on or before December 31, 1965** that counts as a reckonable period under OASA is considered a **qualifying contribution week** in Ireland.
- A **year beginning on or after January 1, 1966** that is a reckonable period under CPP is treated as a **contribution year** in Ireland (52 weeks).
- A **week after January 1, 1966** that is a reckonable period under OASA but not under CPP is treated as a **qualifying contribution week** in Ireland.

#### **2. For Death Grants and Orphan’s Allowances**
- A year beginning on or after January 1, 1971, that is a CPP reckonable period → treated as **52 qualifying contribution weeks** in Ireland.
- A week from **October 1, 1970**, not part of a CPP period → treated as a **qualifying contribution week**.
- The period **October 1–December 31, 1970** → treated as **13 qualifying contributions** in Ireland.

> These rules ensure **fair treatment of pre-1971 contributions** that might otherwise be ignored.

#### **3. For CPP Benefits**
- A calendar year with **at least 13 qualifying contributions** under Irish legislation is treated as a **year of CPP contributions**.

## **VI. Benefit Amounts and Calculations**

### **A. For Persons Entitled via Totalization**
- **Earnings-related portion** of the pension is calculated **based solely on CPP pensionable earnings**.
- **Flat-rate portion** is calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Flat-rate} = (\text{Flat-rate under CPP}) \times \left(\frac{\text{CPP contributions completed}}{\text{Minimum qualifying period}}\right)
  $$
  - The fraction **cannot exceed 1
