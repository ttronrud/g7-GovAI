**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Rules of Practice Respecting Reduction in the Number of Years of Imprisonment without Eligibility for Parole**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
These rules are issued under **subsection 745.64(1)a of the Criminal Code of Canada**, which authorizes the Quebec Superior Court (Criminal Division) to establish specific procedural rules governing applications to reduce the number of years of imprisonment during which a convicted person is *ineligible for parole*.

The rules are published under **S.C. 1996, c. 34, s. 2(2)** and came into force **15 days after publication in the Canada Gazette**. They **supersede the prior Rules of Practice** published in the Canada Gazette on March 30, 1985 (Part I, page 2010), **except for applications filed before the new rules came into effect**.

---

### **2. Scope and Purpose**
The rules govern the **procedural framework** for applications under **section 745.6 of the Criminal Code**, which allows a person serving a sentence of imprisonment without eligibility for parole to apply for a reduction in the number of such years. This provision is designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and due process in assessing whether a prisoner should be granted early release eligibility based on rehabilitation, behavior, and other relevant factors.

The primary objective is to provide a **structured, fair, and evidence-based process** for determining whether a reduction in the non-parole period is justified, while protecting the rights of both the applicant and the state.
