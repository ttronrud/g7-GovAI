This indicates that the referenced regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 8 of the Statutory Rules Order SOR/2014-181**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal is specified in **SOR/2014-181**, which is a Statutory Rules Order issued in 2014.
- **Section Cited**: Section 8 of that Order specifically repeals the regulation in question.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously established by this regulation are **no longer applicable**. Legal entities, individuals, or regulatory bodies are no longer bound by its provisions.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because the regulation was:
  - Outdated or obsolete,
  - Overlapping with newer or more comprehensive legislation,
  - Found to be inconsistent with current laws or policy objectives,
  - Superseded by a more effective or relevant regulation.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest a possible formatting or data entry error, as the same repeal notice is listed multiple times. In official legal databases, such redundancy is not typical and may reflect a technical issue in the source.
- Without the original text of the repealed regulation, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., subject matter, scope, requirements) cannot be provided. The current information only confirms its **status** (repealed) and **legal basis** for repeal.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **fully repealed** and **no longer valid** under Canadian law. Its repeal was enacted via **Section 8 of SOR/2014-181**, and its provisions have been removed from the legal framework. Any reference to it in current legal or regulatory contexts is outdated and should be disregarded.

For further details about the original regulation or the rationale behind the repeal, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2014-181 or related legislative amendments.
