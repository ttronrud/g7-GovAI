**Detailed Summary of the Transhipment Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Transhipment Regulations*, commonly cited as the **Transhipment Regulations**, establish the legal framework governing the **transshipment of goods** that originate outside Canada and are destined for countries listed in the **Area Control List (ACL)**. These regulations are administered under the broader framework of the **Export and Import Permits Act** and the associated regulations respecting export and import permits.

These rules apply specifically to goods that are **not in transit in bond** on a through journey originating outside Canada, or that do not fall under specific exceptions outlined in **Group 9 of the Export Control List (ECL)**.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Goods**  
   - Refers to any goods described in any group of the Export Control List (ECL) that:
     - Originate outside Canada,
     - Have their ultimate destination in a country included in the **Area Control List (ACL)**,
     - And are **unloaded or removed from their means of transportation** at any port or location in Canada during transit.

2. **Means of Transportation**  
   - The specific mode of transport carrying the goods, such as:
     - Ship, vessel, railway car, aircraft, truck, vehicle, or other conveyance.

3. **Transhipment**  
   - Defined as the act of **loading, placing on board, or moving** goods into another means of transportation **after** they have been unloaded or removed from the original means of transportation upon entry into Canada.

### **Core Prohibition and Requirements**

#### **1. Requirement for a Transit Authorization Certificate**
- **No person may tranship or cause, assist in, or accept for transhipment** any goods covered by the Export Control List (ECL) that:
  - Originate outside Canada,
  - Are destined for a country in the Area Control List,
  - And are unloaded or removed in Canada,
  - **Unless** one of the following conditions is met:

  - A **Transit Authorization Certificate (TAC)** has been:
    - Presented to and **endorsed by a Canadian Customs Collector**, or  
    - Issued by the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** (or an authorized representative).

> *Note:* This requirement applies even if the goods are in transit through another country and are not being exported directly from Canada.

#### **2. Absence of a Certificate Requires Ministerial Approval**
- In the **absence** of a valid transit authorization certificate, **no transhipment is permitted**.
- Approval must be granted by:
  - The Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, or
  - A person authorized by the Minister to act on their behalf.

### **Issuance of Transit Authorization Certificates**

#### **Eligibility to Apply**
- Only individuals or entities who are **eligible to apply for an export permit** under the **Export and Import Permits Act** may apply for a transit authorization certificate.

#### **Application Process**
- Applications must be submitted on a **standard form** provided by the **Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce (DITC)**.
- The form is available through the **Export and Import Permits Division (EIPD)** in Ottawa.

#### **Submission Requirements**
- The applicant must:
  - Submit the completed form to the EIPD,
  - Provide **additional information** as required by or on behalf of the **Chief of the Export and Import Permits Division**.

> *This ensures that all relevant details about the goods, destination, route, and security implications are thoroughly reviewed.*

#### **Approval and Issuance**
- Upon approval:
  - The completed application form becomes the official **Transit Authorization Certificate (TAC)**.
  - The certificate is **signed by or on behalf of the Minister**.
  - It is **non-negotiable and binding** and may not be altered without formal ministerial authorization.

---

### **Prohibited Use of Transit Authorization Certificates**

- A transit authorization certificate **may not be used** for any purpose other than:
  - The **export and transit movement** of the specific goods for which it was issued.
  - In accordance with the **terms and information** stated in the certificate.

> This prevents misuse, such as using a transit certificate for unauthorized movements, re-exporting goods to non-designated destinations, or falsifying documentation.

---

### **Special Provision for Transit Through a Third Country**

- If goods from Canada are to be exported to a country on the **Area Control List** and must pass through another country (i.e., a third country), a **transit authorization certificate** may be issued by or on behalf of the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce**.

> This provision supports international trade while maintaining control over sensitive goods.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

These regulations serve several key objectives:

1. **National Security and Economic Control**  
   - Prevents the unauthorized movement of sensitive or controlled goods through Canada, especially to countries of concern (on the Area Control List).

2. **Compliance with International Obligations**  
   - Aligns Canada with international export control frameworks, particularly those involving sanctions and dual-use goods.

3. **Prevention of Diversion or Illicit Use**  
   - By requiring formal authorization and clear documentation, the regulations reduce the risk of goods being diverted for illegal, unauthorized, or hostile purposes.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - The requirement for a formal application and ministerial approval ensures that all transhipment activities are traceable, reviewed, and accountable.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Exporter / Shipper** | Must ensure a valid transit authorization certificate is obtained before any transhipment in Canada. |
| **Customs Broker / Agent** | Must verify the presence and validity of the TAC before facilitating transhipment. |
| **Transportation Operators** | Must not unload or remove goods from transport without proper authorization. |
| **Ministry of Industry, Trade and Commerce** | Responsible for reviewing applications and issuing or approving transit authorization certificates. |
| **Canadian Customs** | Must endorse certificates and enforce compliance with the rules. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Transhipment Regulations** create a strict, enforceable system to control the movement of goods that originate outside Canada and are destined for restricted countries. By mandating a **transit authorization certificate** and requiring **ministerial approval or endorsement**, the regulations ensure that such movements are authorized, monitored, and transparent. They are a critical component of Canada’s broader export control regime, designed to protect national security, prevent proliferation of sensitive technologies, and maintain compliance with international obligations.

These rules reflect a balance between enabling legitimate international trade and safeguarding against unauthorized or potentially harmful transshipment activities.
