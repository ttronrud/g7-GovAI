The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2009-104, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2009-104*, specifically **Section 5** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **2009**, as indicated by the year in the SI reference (SI/2009-104).
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 5 of SI 2009-104 explicitly removes or cancels the previously enacted regulation. This means that any legal provisions, requirements, or obligations previously set out in that regulation are no longer applicable.
- **Purpose of the Repeal**: Repeal typically occurs when a regulation is outdated, redundant, inconsistent with newer legislation, or superseded by a more comprehensive or updated legal framework. The specific reason for repeal is not provided in the given text, but such actions are often part of legislative modernization or streamlining.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries (six times) are likely a formatting or technical error in the original source and do not indicate multiple regulations or different provisions. They all refer to the same repeal.
- Without additional context (such as the original regulation’s title or subject matter), it is not possible to determine the specific content or scope of the repealed regulation.
- To understand the full impact, one would need to consult the original regulation and the explanatory notes or schedule of SI 2009-104.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially removed from law** by **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2009-104**. It is no longer in effect and should not be relied upon for legal or compliance purposes. Any prior obligations or rules derived from it are now obsolete.

For further details about the original regulation or the rationale behind its repeal, a review of SI 2009-104 and its accompanying legislative notes or government publications would be required.
