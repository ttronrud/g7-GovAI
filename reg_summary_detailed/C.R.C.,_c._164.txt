**Detailed Summary of the New Brunswick Turkey Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *New Brunswick Turkey Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the *Natural Products Control Act* of New Brunswick (Loi).

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Natural Products Control Act of New Brunswick* (Loi). This is the primary legislative framework that authorizes the Commodity Board’s regulatory functions.

- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to the *New Brunswick Turkey Marketing Board*, a statutory body established under the Act. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing of turkeys in the province.

- **"Turkey"**: Defined broadly as *any variety, grade, or class of turkey that is raised or kept for slaughter within the Province of New Brunswick and sold for slaughter*. This definition ensures that only turkeys produced within the province are subject to the Order’s provisions.

---

**3. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Trade**  
The Commodity Board is granted the authority to regulate the marketing of turkeys in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada). This authority mirrors the powers it already has for local marketing within New Brunswick under **paragraph 6(2)(k) of the Act**.

This means the Board can apply the same regulatory tools—such as setting prices, establishing standards, and managing marketing activities—to turkeys moving outside the province or internationally, provided such actions are consistent with its existing local powers.

---

**4. Power to Issue Orders on Levies and Charges**  
A key provision of the Order is the Board’s power to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of turkeys** within New Brunswick.

These levies are not arbitrary; they are structured based on:

- **Classification of persons** into distinct groups (e.g., small-scale farmers, large producers, processors, etc.).  
- **Different levies or charges** assigned to each group, depending on the nature and scale of their operations.

This classification ensures that the burden of levies is fairly distributed and takes into account the economic capacity and role of different stakeholders in the turkey supply chain.

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through these levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Funding the Commodity Board’s operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, staffing, and monitoring activities).  
- **Establishing reserves** to manage financial stability in the turkey market.  
- **Covering losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of turkeys (e.g., due to market downturns, price collapses, or unsold inventory).  
- **Equalizing or adjusting payments** among turkey producers.  

This mechanism allows the Board to **distribute revenues fairly** among producers during periods of fluctuating market conditions. For example, if prices fall in a given year, the Board may use collected levies to provide financial support or rebates to producers to maintain market stability and ensure equitable outcomes.

---

**6. Period of Application**  
The Board may determine the **duration** (period or periods of time) for which levies or charges apply. This flexibility enables the Board to adapt to changing market dynamics, such as seasonal demand, economic shifts, or international trade conditions.

---

**7. Repealed Provision**  
One section of the Order (previously included) was **repealed by SOR/80-90** (Supplemental Orders Regulation 80-90). This indicates that an earlier version of the regulation or a specific clause was removed, likely to modernize or simplify the Order. The current version reflects an updated and streamlined regulatory framework.

---

**Overall Purpose and Significance**  
The *New Brunswick Turkey Order* establishes a structured, equitable, and market-responsive system for managing turkey marketing beyond the province. By enabling the Commodity Board to impose tiered levies based on producer type, it promotes:

- **Market stability** through financial safeguards and reserve mechanisms.  
- **Fairness** in the distribution of profits and losses among producers.  
- **Efficient management** of interprovincial and export trade.  
- **Sustainable development** of the turkey industry in New Brunswick.

It is a critical tool for protecting producers from market volatility and ensuring that the province’s turkey sector remains competitive and resilient in both domestic and international markets.

---

**In Summary**:  
The New Brunswick Turkey Order empowers the New Brunswick Turkey Marketing Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys by allowing it to impose tiered levies and charges on producers and marketers. These funds are used to support operations, manage losses, create reserves, and ensure equitable financial outcomes among producers—especially during periods of market instability. The regulation reflects a balanced approach to market oversight, combining regulatory authority with producer protection and economic sustainability.
