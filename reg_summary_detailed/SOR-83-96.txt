**Detailed Summary of the *Income Earned in Quebec Income Tax Remission Order, 1982***

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Income Earned in Quebec Income Tax Remission Order, 1982* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act** and the **Income Tax Act**. It establishes a framework for the **remission (forgiveness) of income tax** owed by certain non-residents of Canada—specifically individuals who earned income in Quebec—on the basis that their income attributable to Quebec should not be taxed in full if they did not reside in Canada during the relevant taxation year.

This Order aims to **promote fairness and equity** in the taxation of individuals who, while earning income in Quebec, were not residents of Canada. It modifies how income earned in Quebec is calculated for non-residents, and provides for a tax remission equal to the difference between the actual tax paid and the tax that would have been payable under a revised, more equitable definition of income earned in Quebec.

The Order is particularly significant in recognizing the economic and social contributions of individuals who work or conduct business in Quebec, even when they do not reside in Canada.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

The Order is structured into several key sections and subsections, each addressing different categories of individuals and conditions under which tax remission applies.

---

### **1. Purpose and Citation**

- **Purpose**: To remit income tax for individuals who earned income in Quebec but did not reside in Canada during a taxation year.
- **Citation**: The Order may be cited as the *Income Earned in Quebec Income Tax Remission Order, 1982*.
- **Applicable Acts**: 
  - *Income Tax Act* (Act)
  - *Income Tax Regulations* (Regulations)

---

### **2. Definition of "Remission"**

Remission is granted when:
> The actual income tax paid or payable by an individual exceeds the income tax that would have been payable **if** the individual’s income earned in Quebec had been computed under a modified version of **section 2602 of the Income Tax Regulations**.

This means the tax owed is reduced by the difference between the tax actually paid and the tax that would have been due under a redefined method of calculating income earned in Quebec.

### **3. Revised Section 2602 of the Regulations (Key Change)**

This section defines **income earned in Quebec** for non-residents. The key change is that it replaces the original section with a new interpretation that allocates income more fairly to Quebec based on the nature of the individual’s activities.

#### **Modified Section 2602 – Income Earned in Quebec (Non-Residents)**

For a non-resident individual, income earned in Quebec includes:

1. **Income from employment or office**:
   - That portion of income from employment or office that is included in taxable income under **paragraph 115(1)(a)(i)** of the Act and is **reasonably attributable** to duties performed in Quebec.

2. **Income from business activities in Quebec**:
   - Determined under **Section 4** of the Order (specific rules for business income).

3. **Taxable capital gains from property in Quebec**:
   - From **real property** situated in Quebec (or an option in respect thereof).
   - From **capital property used in a business carried on in Quebec**.

4. **Proportional allocation**:
   - If total income from all provinces exceeds income from Quebec, then the portion of income attributable to Quebec is calculated as a **proportion** of the total income.

5. **Capital Gains Rules**:
   - **Real property**: Any taxable capital gain from the disposal of real property in Quebec is fully attributable to Quebec.
   - **Other capital property** used in a business:
     - The gain is apportioned based on the proportion of income from that business in Quebec vs. total income from that business in Canada.
   - **No permanent establishment in Canada**:
     - If the individual had no permanent establishment in Canada and disposed of capital property used in a previous year, the capital gain is apportioned based on income from that business in Quebec in the **last preceding year** when the individual had income from the business in a province.

> **Note**: This ensures that gains from property or business activity in Quebec are taxed in Quebec, even if the individual is not a resident.

### **4. Special Cases – Who Qualifies for Inclusion of Quebec Income?**

Certain individuals are explicitly included in the calculation of income earned in Quebec, even if they are not residents of Canada. These include:

- Students or teachers attending/teaching at a foreign institution (post-secondary) who moved from Quebec to attend/teach.
- Individuals who moved from Quebec to carry out **research or similar work** under a government grant.

#### **(b) Individuals receiving remuneration from Quebec-related entities**
- Remuneration paid by:
  - The **Province of Quebec**
  - A **corporation, commission, or association** at least 90% owned by the Province of Quebec
  - A **wholly-owned subsidiary** of such entity
- **Condition**: No third party (other than the Province) has rights to shares, capital, or property.

#### **(c) Educational or Public Institutions in Quebec**
- Institutions receiving financial support from the Province of Quebec, including:
  - Universities, colleges, secondary schools (leading to certificates/diplomas required for university entry)
  - Schools operated by the Province or municipalities

> - Excludes remuneration attributable to duties performed outside Canada

### **5. Remission for Individuals Who Resided in Quebec on the Last Day of the Taxation Year**

For individuals who **resided in Quebec on the last day of the taxation year**, remission is granted if:

> The tax paid exceeds the tax that would have been payable **if**:
> - Subsections **2601(1) and (2)** of the Regulations were reinterpreted as follows:
>   - If an individual resided in a province and had **no business income from another province**, their income earned in that province is their total income.
>   - If they had business income from another province, their Quebec income is the **excess** of total income over income earned in other provinces.
> - Paragraph **126(7)(a)** is redefined to allocate business-country tax (e.g., foreign business taxes) to the relevant province.
> - Paragraph **126(7)(d)** adjusts the tax payable to account for the remission under this Order.

> This ensures that individuals who lived in Quebec for part of the year are not taxed disproportionately on income earned in Quebec.

### **7. Penalties and Interest Remission**

- A **proportionate remission** of the penalty or interest is granted **up to the amount by which**:
  - The actual penalty/interest exceeds
  - The penalty/interest that would have been imposed **if the tax remission had not occurred**
