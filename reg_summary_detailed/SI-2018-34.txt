## **3. General Provisions – Application of Civil Rules**

- **Subject to this Part, the Civil Rules apply to criminal appeals** (specifically **Part 14**, which governs standard civil appeals), **except** for the following provisions, which are **excluded** due to differences in the nature of criminal justice:

| Excluded Civil Rules / Parts | Reason for Exclusion |

| Part 5 – Disclosure of Information | Criminal appeals involve sensitive information; disclosure is managed differently |
| Part 10, Div. 2 – Recoverable Costs | Costs in criminal cases are governed separately |
| Part 14, Div. 1, Subdiv. 2 – Appeals as of Right | Criminal appeals generally require permission |
| Part 14, Div. 1, Subdiv. 3 – Appeals with Permission | This Part governs permission procedures |

## **4. Permission to Appeal – When and How**

### **When Permission is Required**
An application for **permission to appeal** is required in the following situations:
- In **summary conviction matters**, where leave to appeal is required under the *Criminal Code*
- Where a **review under section 680** of the *Criminal Code* is required for an interim release order
- Under the **Provincial Offences Procedure Act**, where a certificate of sufficient importance is needed
- Where the appeal is from a **costs order**

### **Procedure for Permission to Appeal**

- Must be submitted **within**:
  - The time limit set by statute for commencing the appeal, **and**
  - **One month after the date of decision**, unless the statute specifies a different deadline

> **Date of Decision** = Later of:
> - Date the decision was made
> - For conviction appeals, the date of sentencing (if sentencing occurs after conviction)

---

## **5. Filing the Notice of Appeal**

### **General Rule**
- **All appeals** (except self-represented appellants in custody) must be started by filing **3 copies** of a **notice of appeal** with the **Registrar**:
  - **Form CRA-A** for self-represented appellants
  - **Form CRA-B** for all other appeals

### **Time Limits for Filing**
- Within:
  - The statutory time for starting an appeal
  - **10 days after permission to appeal is granted**, if granted
  - **One month after the date of decision**, if no permission is required

> **Additional Requirement**: An **additional filed copy** must be served on the respondent **within these time limits** (subject to Rule 16.8 on service).

---

## **6. Special Provisions for Self-Represented Appellants in Custody**

- May start an appeal by filing **3 copies of Form CRA-A** with a **senior officer of the institution** where they are detained.
- The officer must:
  - Endorse the date of receipt
  - Return a copy to the appellant
  - Retain a copy
  - **Immediately forward a copy to the Registrar**

> This ensures access to the appeals process for individuals without legal representation who are incarcerated.

---

## **7. Service of Documents**

- **Service Requirements**:
  - **Attorney General or Prosecutor**: Must be served personally if the appeal is filed as of right.
  - **Convicted Person**: Must serve the notice or application on the **Attorney General**.
  - **Other Documents**: May be served at the party’s address or on their lawyer of record.

> **Exception**: Applications for permission to appeal or notices of appeal filed as of right must be **personally served** when filed by the Attorney General or a convicted person.

---

## **8. Appeals from Conviction and Sentence – Joint vs. Separate**

- If an appeal arises from **both conviction and sentence**, the two components are treated as **separate appeals**.
- **Order of Hearing**:
  1. **Conviction appeal** is adjudicated first
  2. **Sentence appeal** (or appeal on dangerous/offender finding) is adjudicated second

> This ensures that the factual basis of conviction is fully reviewed before addressing sentencing issues.

---

## **9. Filing the Appeal Record – Timelines and Requirements**

The **Appeal Record** is a critical component of the appeal and must be filed promptly.

### **General Deadlines for Filing the Appeal Record**

| Sentence appeal (net sentence ≤ 6 months) | **2 months** after notice of appeal |
| Sentence appeal (net sentence > 6 months) | **3 months** after notice of appeal |
| Sentencing part of dual conviction-sentence appeal | **2 months** after conviction appeal is dismissed, struck, or abandoned |

> **Exception**: If the Appeal Record is not filed within the deadline **and no extension is obtained**:
