**Detailed Summary of the Name Use (Foreign Banks) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Name Use (Foreign Banks) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Bank Act**:

- **Section 978a** and **subsection 983(18)b** of the Bank Act.
- These provisions grant the Governor General the authority to regulate the use of names and identifying marks by foreign banks operating in Canada, particularly to ensure transparency and prevent misleading public perception regarding the regulatory status of such institutions.

The regulations were first introduced in **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 135**, amended in **S.C. 2007, c. 6, s. 129(8)**, and are rooted in the broader framework established in **S.C. 1991, c. 46** (the Bank Act).

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **prevent misleading or deceptive use of the terms "bank," "banker," or "banking"** in connection with the corporate relationships involving **non-bank affiliates of foreign banks** or **entities associated with foreign banks**.

This is done to ensure that Canadian consumers and financial market participants are fully informed about the **regulatory status** of the foreign institutions involved — specifically, that the foreign bank or associated entity is **not regulated in Canada** as a financial institution, bank holding company, or insurance holding company.

### **3. Key Provisions**

#### **(a) Use of "Bank," "Banker," or "Banking" in Descriptions of Corporate Relationships**

**Paragraph 983(4)(g) of the Bank Act** allows the use of the terms "bank," "banker," or "banking" in a description of a corporate relationship between:

- A **non-bank affiliate** of a foreign bank (as defined under subsection 507(1) of the Bank Act), and  
- The **foreign bank that controls** the non-bank affiliate.

**However**, such use is **only permitted if** the description includes a **clear statement** that:
> *"The foreign bank is not regulated in Canada as a financial institution, a bank holding company, or an insurance holding company."*

✅ This ensures transparency — the public is informed that the foreign bank is not subject to Canadian financial regulation.

⚠️ **Exception**:  
This provision **does not apply** if the foreign bank is an **authorized foreign bank**.  
An "authorized foreign bank" is a foreign bank that has received formal authorization from the Canadian government (e.g., through the Bank of Canada) to operate in Canada under specific conditions. These institutions are subject to Canadian regulatory oversight, so the need for a disclaimer is waived.

---

#### **(b) Use of "Bank," "Banker," or "Banking" in Relation to Associated Entities**

**Paragraph 983(4)(h) of the Bank Act** permits the use of "bank," "banker," or "banking" in a description of the corporate relationship between:

- A **non-bank affiliate** of a foreign bank, and  
- An **entity associated with a foreign bank** that controls the affiliate.

**But only if** the description includes a statement that:
> *"The entity associated with the foreign bank is not regulated in Canada as a financial institution, a bank holding company, or an insurance holding company."*

⚠️ **Exception**:  
This provision **does not apply** if the associated entity falls under **any of paragraphs 468(1)(c) to (i)** of the Bank Act.  
These paragraphs define specific entities (e.g., certain subsidiaries, holding companies, or affiliates) that are **subject to Canadian regulation** and thus cannot be used in a misleading way without disclosure.

For example, if the associated entity is a Canadian bank holding company or a regulated insurance holding company, the use of "bank" or "banking" without a disclaimer would be prohibited.

---

#### **(c) Disclosure Requirement under Subsection 983(10)**

**Subsection 983(10)** of the Bank Act requires that:

- A **Canadian entity** (such as a Canadian subsidiary or affiliate) must **disclose** — when using the name or identifying mark of a foreign bank — that:
> *"The foreign bank is not regulated in Canada as a financial institution, a bank holding company, or an insurance holding company."*

This disclosure must be **included in conjunction with** the use of the foreign bank’s name or mark.

⚠️ **Exception**:  
This requirement **does not apply** if the foreign bank is an **authorized foreign bank**.

---

### **4. Effect of the Regulations**

- The regulations ensure **transparency and consumer protection** by preventing misleading branding.
- They help **prevent confusion** about whether a foreign financial institution is subject to Canadian regulatory oversight.
- They apply specifically to **non-bank affiliates** and **associated entities** — not to the foreign bank itself, which may be authorized or unregulated.
- The rules are **conditional** on the inclusion of a clear, conspicuous disclaimer about lack of Canadian regulation.

---

### **5. Effective Date and Repeal**

- The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 129 of the Act to amend the law governing financial institutions and to provide for related and consequential matters (S.C. 2007, c. 6)** comes into force.
- This date was **May 19, 2008**, as noted in the official notice (SI/2008-58).
- The regulations **do not apply retroactively** and only take effect after the specified date.

### **6. Legal and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Consumer Protection** | Canadians are protected from being misled into thinking a foreign entity is regulated in Canada. |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Distinguishes between regulated and unregulated foreign institutions. |
| **Corporate Flexibility** | Allows non-bank affiliates to use "bank" terminology in corporate descriptions, provided the disclaimer is included. |
| **Compliance Burden** | Canadian entities must ensure that any use of a foreign bank’s name or mark includes the required regulatory disclaimer. |
| **Exemptions** | Authorized foreign banks (subject to Canadian regulation) are exempt from these requirements. |

### **7. Conclusion**

The *Name Use (Foreign Banks) Regulations* serve as a **critical tool of transparency** within Canada’s financial regulatory framework. By restricting the use of terms like "bank," "banker," or "banking" in descriptions of corporate relationships involving foreign banks and their non-bank affiliates — **unless a clear statement of non-regulation is included** — the regulations protect the public from misleading information.

They reflect a broader regulatory philosophy that **financial institutions must be clearly identifiable in terms of their regulatory status**, especially when operating in a foreign jurisdiction without Canadian oversight.

These rules are particularly important in an era of global financial integration, where cross-border financial relationships are common and consumer trust depends on accurate information.
