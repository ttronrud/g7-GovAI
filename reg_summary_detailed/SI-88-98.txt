**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation establishes a formal authorization for the Minister of National Health and Welfare to set and prescribe fees for the use of a drug submission evaluation service provided by the Department of National Health and Welfare (DNHW). The key elements of the regulation are as follows:

1. **Purpose of the Regulation**:  
   The primary objective is to ensure that the cost of evaluating drug submissions—such as new drug applications or variations—incurred by the Department of National Health and Welfare is borne directly by the individual or entity utilizing the service. This aligns with the principle of cost accountability and financial responsibility.

2. **Authority to Set Fees**:  
   The Governor in Council (acting on behalf of the federal government) has authorized the Minister of National Health and Welfare to issue a regulatory order to establish specific fees. This authority is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the Governor in Council to authorize the Minister to prescribe fees for services provided by federal departments, where such fees are reasonable and necessary.

3. **Scope of the Service**:  
   The service in question is the **drug submission evaluation service**, which involves assessing the scientific, clinical, safety, and efficacy data submitted by pharmaceutical companies or other stakeholders seeking regulatory approval for drugs in Canada. This includes reviewing applications for new drugs, changes to existing drugs, or other submissions to the Canadian Health Regulatory framework (e.g., under Health Canada).

4. **Fee Responsibility**:  
   The regulation explicitly states that the **cost of this service must be borne by the person who uses the service**. This means that applicants (typically pharmaceutical manufacturers or sponsors) are responsible for paying the prescribed fees, rather than the government or taxpayers.

5. **Process for Fee Prescription**:  
   The Minister of National Health and Welfare will issue a formal **order** that outlines the specific fees, their structure (e.g., per submission, per type of drug, per evaluation stage), and any applicable conditions or exemptions. This order will be issued in accordance with the **annexed terms and conditions**, which likely include:
   - Fee schedules and tiers
   - Definitions of service types (e.g., new drug application, variation, supplement)
   - Payment timelines and methods
   - Exemptions or reduced fees for certain categories (e.g., public health emergencies, low-income sponsors, or research purposes)
   - Compliance and enforcement mechanisms

6. **Legal and Financial Justification**:  
   The regulation is grounded in sound financial administration principles. By requiring users to pay for the evaluation service, the government ensures sustainable funding for regulatory activities, prevents fiscal overreach, and promotes transparency in the cost structure of regulatory services.

7. **Governance and Oversight**:  
   The decision is made jointly by:
   - The **Minister of National Health and Welfare**, who is responsible for the service and its implementation.
   - The **Treasury Board**, which ensures fiscal responsibility and alignment with broader government financial policies.
   - The **Governor in Council**, who formally approves the authorization, reflecting the highest level of governmental oversight.

8. **Implications**:  
   - Increases transparency and predictability in drug approval processes.
   - Encourages cost-conscious behavior among pharmaceutical sponsors.
   - May influence the competitiveness and accessibility of drug development, especially if fees are high or complex.
   - Supports the long-term sustainability of Health Canada’s regulatory infrastructure.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation legally authorizes Health Canada to charge fees for its drug submission evaluation services, ensuring that the financial burden of regulatory review is directly passed to the applicants. It is a key step in modernizing the regulatory framework by promoting accountability, transparency, and fiscal responsibility in the drug approval process. The actual fee structure and conditions will be detailed in the accompanying annex, which will be subject to public consultation and potential review.
