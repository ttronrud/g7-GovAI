The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules of 2017, No. 84 (SOR/2017-84)**, under section 1 of that order.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal became effective on the date specified in SOR/2017-84, which was published in the Canada Gazette. While the exact date is not included in your input, SOR/2017-84 was typically published in the Gazette in late 2017, and the repeal generally took effect upon publication.
- **Reason for Repeal**: The regulation was likely outdated, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or administrative policy. Repeal is often part of a broader effort to streamline or modernize the regulatory framework.
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Government of Canada** through the **Statutory Rules (SOR)** system, which is used to implement and amend federal laws. SOR/2017-84 is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of a parent act (such as the *Canada Labour Code*, *Fisheries Act*, or another relevant legislation—though the specific parent act would need to be identified from the full text of SOR/2017-84).
- **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84**: This section specifically identifies the provisions being repealed. In this case, it lists the regulation (likely a specific rule or directive) that was previously in effect and is now removed from the legal framework.

### Implications:
- Any legal or operational reference to the repealed regulation is now **invalid**.
- Entities (such as employers, regulators, or individuals) who previously relied on this regulation must now refer to the **current, active legislation** that replaced it or to other applicable rules.
- Legal or compliance officers should verify that current regulations are being followed, as the repealed rule no longer applies.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in your query has been **fully repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. It is no longer part of the current legal framework and should not be cited or applied. To understand what replaced it, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2017-84 or the parent statute it was originally part of.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Without the original regulation's title or subject matter (e.g., workplace safety, environmental standards, etc.), a more detailed operational summary cannot be provided. To obtain the full context, the original regulation’s name and purpose must be identified from the full version of SOR/2017-84 or related legislation.

If you can provide the **title or subject** of the original regulation (e.g., "Regulation respecting workplace safety in construction"), I can offer a more detailed and specific summary.
