**Detailed Summary of the *Affiliated Persons (Insurance Companies) Regulations* (S.C. 1991, c. 47)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Affiliated Persons (Insurance Companies) Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **section 170 of the Insurance Companies Act**. These regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and establish the legal criteria for determining when a **natural person is affiliated** with an insurance company. The purpose is to promote transparency, prevent conflicts of interest, ensure financial accountability, and protect policyholders and the integrity of the insurance sector.

These regulations define "affiliated persons" and outline specific circumstances under which a natural person (individual) is considered affiliated with an insurance company or its affiliates. This affiliation triggers regulatory scrutiny and reporting obligations, particularly in relation to transactions, governance, and financial dealings.

### **Key Definitions and Key Concepts**

#### 1. **"Act"**
Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which provides the legal framework for regulating insurance companies in Canada. Section 170 of this Act is the basis for the application of these regulations.

#### 2. **"Indebtedness"**
Defined broadly to include:
- Commercial paper
- Acceptances (e.g., negotiable instruments)
- Lines of credit that have been drawn upon
- Margin loans made to a director or officer of the company

This definition ensures that even non-traditional forms of borrowing are captured in the regulatory framework.

#### 3. **"Not in Good Standing" (in respect of a loan)**
A loan is considered "not in good standing" if **any of the following conditions apply**:
- Any payment of principal or interest is **90 days or more overdue**
- Interest is **not being accrued** on the lender’s books due to doubt about the borrower’s ability to repay (i.e., the loan is deemed doubtful)
- The interest rate has been **reduced** by the lender because the borrower is considered financially weak

This criterion helps identify financially distressed borrowers and flags potential risks in lending relationships.

#### 4. **"Significant Borrower"**
A natural person or entity is considered a *significant borrower* if their total indebtedness (principal amount) exceeds the **greater of**:
- **$200,000**, or  
- **One fiftieth of one per cent (0.2%) of the regulatory capital** of the company

For **entities** (corporations, trusts, etc.), the threshold is the **greatest of**:
- **$500,000**,  
- **One twentieth of one per cent (0.5%) of the regulatory capital**, and  
- **25% of the value of the entity’s assets**

> 🔍 *Note*: The thresholds are designed to capture material financial exposure. For example, a person with a $250,000 loan would not qualify as a significant borrower under the $200,000 threshold, but a $220,000 loan would exceed the threshold only if the regulatory capital is low enough that 0.2% of it exceeds $200,000.

This definition ensures that both individual and corporate borrowers with substantial financial exposure to the company are identified and monitored.

### **Circumstances Under Which a Natural Person is Considered "Affiliated" with a Company**

Under **section 170 of the Insurance Companies Act**, a natural person is considered affiliated with a company if **any of the following apply**:

#### (a) **Officer or Employee**
- The person is an officer (e.g., director, CEO) or employee of the company or of an **affiliate** of the company.

> 📌 *Affiliation arises from employment or executive roles, even if the affiliate is not directly related to the insurance business.*

#### (b) **Significant Interest in Shares**
- The person holds a **significant interest** in a class of shares of the company.
- "Significant interest" is not explicitly defined in these regulations, but it generally implies ownership or control (e.g., more than 1% or a voting interest sufficient to influence decisions).

> ⚠️ This triggers disclosure and oversight requirements to prevent insider influence.

#### (c) **Substantial Investment in an Affiliate**
- The person has a **substantial investment** in an affiliate of the company.
- "Substantial" is not precisely defined, but it implies a meaningful financial stake (e.g., ownership, partnership interest, or significant equity).

> 💡 This prevents situations where individuals benefit financially from transactions involving related entities.

#### (d) **Significant Borrower**
- The person is a **significant borrower** of the company or an affiliate of the company (as defined above).

> 🚩 This is a key mechanism to detect potential conflicts of interest or financial risk arising from large loans.

#### (e) **Officer/Employee of a Significant Borrower**
- The person is an officer or employee of an entity that is a **significant borrower** of the company.

> 🔍 Even if the individual is not directly borrowing, their role in a financially exposed entity creates an affiliation.

#### (f) **Control of Entities with Aggregate Debt That Would Make Them a Significant Borrower**
- The person **controls one or more entities** such that, if those entities were combined into a single entity, the total indebtedness to the company or its affiliates would make them a **significant borrower**.

> ✅ This is a "group affiliation" rule. It recognizes that control over multiple entities can create a de facto significant financial relationship.

#### (g) **Providing Goods or Services**
- The person provides goods or services to the company, or is a partner or employee in a partnership that provides goods/services to the company.
- If the **total annual billings** to the company exceed **10% of the person’s (or partnership’s) total annual billings**, the person is considered affiliated.

> 📊 This applies to both direct service providers and partners. For example, a consultant who bills $1 million annually and receives $100,000 from the insurer would be considered affiliated.

#### (h) **Loan Not in Good Standing or Related Financial Risk**
- The person:
  - Has a loan that is **not in good standing** from the company or an affiliate, **or**
  - Is a **director, officer, or employee** of, or controls an entity that has a loan not in good standing from the company or an affiliate.

> ⚠️ This is a red flag for financial instability and potential default risk.

#### (i) **Spouse or Common-Law Partner of an Affiliated Person**
- The person is the **spouse or common-law partner** of someone who meets any of the conditions in (a) to (h).

> 💞 This extends affiliation to family members, ensuring that personal financial relationships are also scrutinized.

### **Purpose and Regulatory Significance**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Conflict of Interest Prevention**  
   By clearly defining who is affiliated, the regulations ensure that decisions made by affiliated persons (e.g., in pricing, underwriting, or investment) are transparent and not influenced by personal financial interests.

2. **Financial Risk Management**  
   Identifying significant borrowers and those with loans not in good standing helps regulators monitor potential insolvency risks and ensure that insurance companies do not extend credit to individuals or entities in financial distress.

3. **Transparency and Disclosure**  
   Affiliated persons are required to disclose transactions with the company or its affiliates, especially those involving significant financial exposure.

4. **Governance and Accountability**  
   The rules reinforce corporate governance by ensuring that individuals with material interests or roles are properly identified and monitored.

5. **Prevention of Self-Dealing**  
   The provisions discourage self-dealing, such as lending money to oneself or family members, or engaging in business with the company in a way that benefits personally.

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No Clear Definition of "Substantial Investment"**  
  While the term is used, it lacks a precise threshold, which may lead to interpretation issues.

- **Thresholds May Be Outdated**  
  The $200,000 and $500,000 thresholds are static and may not reflect current market conditions or inflation.

- **Subject to Interpretation**  
  The concept of "significant interest in shares" or "substantial investment" may require case-by-case assessment.

- **Focus on Debt, Not Equity**  
  The regulations emphasize debt relationships (loans, lines of credit), but do not fully capture equity-based relationships (e.g., ownership in a joint venture).
