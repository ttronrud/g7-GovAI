## 🔤 **Key Definitions (Core Terminology)**

The regulations define key terms used throughout to ensure clarity and consistency in enforcement and compliance.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Medical Device** | Any device intended for use in humans (excluding devices for animals). |
| **Active Device** | A device that requires an external energy source (e.g., battery, electricity), not from human body or gravity. Excludes devices that merely transmit/withdraw energy without altering it. |
| **Active Diagnostic Device** | An active device used to detect, monitor, or treat a physiological condition (e.g., glucose monitor). |
| **Active Therapeutic Device** | An active device intended to support, modify, replace, or restore biological functions (e.g., pacemakers, insulin pumps). |
| **Invasive Device** | A device that comes into contact with the eye surface or penetrates the body through a body orifice (e.g., stoma) or body surface. |
| **Surgically Invasive Device** | An invasive device intended to enter the body via an artificially created opening (e.g., laparoscopic instruments). |
| **In Vitro Diagnostic Device (IVDD)** | Used to examine specimens taken from the body (e.g., blood tests). |
| **Near-Patient IVDD** | IVDD used outside a lab — at home, pharmacy, or bedside (e.g., rapid glucose test strips). |
| **Test Kit** | A set of reagents or articles used to perform a specific diagnostic test. |
| **System** | A collection of components sold under one name and used together (e.g., dialysis machine and fluid lines). |
| **Medical Device Family** | Devices from the same manufacturer, same design, same use, differing only in shape, size, color. |
| **Medical Device Group** | A collection of devices sold together (e.g., surgical tray). |
| **Medical Device Group Family** | A group of device groups with the same generic use, differing only in product combinations. |
| **Implant** | A device listed in **Schedule 2** (e.g., joint replacements, pacemakers). |
| **Custom-Made Device** | A non-mass-produced device made per a healthcare professional’s written direction for a specific patient or special clinical need. |
| **Decorative Contact Lens** | A contact lens used for cosmetic purposes only (not for vision correction). |
| **Bar Code / Identifier** | A unique code (UPC, EAN, HIBCC) assigned by the manufacturer to identify the device. |
| **Control Number** | A unique alphanumeric code assigned to a batch/lot of a medical device, allowing traceability. |
| **Manufacturer** | Any person responsible for designing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, or modifying a device — including those acting on their behalf. |
| **Healthcare Professional** | A person legally authorized to provide health services in a province. |
| **Dispenser** | A member of a professional body who can manufacture or adapt medical devices based on a healthcare professional’s written direction. |
| **Quality Management System (QMS) Certificate** | A valid certificate issued by a recognized registrar, showing compliance with quality standards (e.g., ISO 9001). |
| **Objective Evidence** | Measurable, verifiable data (e.g., test results, performance data) proving a device meets required standards. |
| **Validation** | Confirmation through testing and objective evidence that a device meets its intended use requirements. |
| **Recall** | A formal action by the manufacturer or the Minister to withdraw a device due to safety, effectiveness, or compliance issues. |
| **Regulatory Agency** | A foreign government body with jurisdiction over medical device regulation and enforcement. |
| **Serious Deterioration in Health** | A life-threatening condition, permanent bodily damage, or unexpected medical intervention required. |
| **Shortage** | When a manufacturer cannot meet Canadian demand. |
| **Significant Change** | Any change that could affect safety or effectiveness — including design, manufacturing, quality control, or intended use. |
| **Surgical or Dental Instrument** | Reusable devices used for cutting, drilling, clamping, etc., without connection to an active device. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Some definitions have been **repealed** (e.g., "dental material", "safety and effectiveness requirements", "quality system certificate") and are no longer in force.

## 📚 **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

1. **Sale and advertising** of medical devices.
2. **Importation** of medical devices for sale or use on individuals (excluding personal use importation).
3. **In vitro diagnostic products** that are drugs or contain drugs — treated as IVDDs.
4. **Exclusions**:
   - **Drugs** defined in the *Cannabis Regulations* containing cannabis (e.g., cannabis-based medicines).
   - **Drugs listed in Schedules E, F, or other controlled drug schedules** (e.g., narcotics, controlled substances).
   - **Medical gas piping systems** assembled on-site and permanently installed in healthcare facilities.

> ✅ **Only specific sections apply to dispensers**:
> - Sections 26 to 31, 37, 70, 75, 80, 86, and 87.

## 🏷️ **Device Classification (Schedule 1)**

- Medical devices are classified into **four classes (I to IV)** based on risk level:
  - **Class I**: Lowest risk (e.g., bandages, thermometers).
  - **Class II**: Moderate risk (e.g., wound dressings, blood pressure cuffs).
  - **Class III**: High risk (e.g., pacemakers, implanted devices).
  - **Class IV**: Highest risk (e.g., heart valves, complex implants).

- **If a device fits multiple classes**, the **higher-risk class applies**.
- This classification determines the regulatory requirements (e.g., pre-market approval, post-market surveillance).

> 🔍 **Note**: This Part does **not apply** to devices subject to **Part 2 or Part 3** of the Act (which may cover drugs or other specialized devices).

## 🛡️ **Safety, Effectiveness, and Quality Requirements**

### 1. **Design and Manufacturing Obligations**
Manufacturers must:
- Identify all inherent risks in the device.
- **Eliminate risks** where possible.
- If risks cannot be eliminated:
  - Reduce them to the lowest feasible level.
  - Provide appropriate protective measures (e.g., alarms, safety interlocks).
  - Include clear information about remaining risks in the device’s documentation.

### 2. **Performance and Effectiveness**
- A medical device (except decorative contact lenses) must:
  - Perform as intended.
  - Be effective for the conditions, purposes, and uses for which it is marketed.
