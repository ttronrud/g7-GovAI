**Detailed Summary of the Office of the Governor General’s Secretary Employment Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** and the **Public Service Commission**, under **section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council to make regulations governing specific public service positions, particularly those in sensitive or unique offices such as the Office of the Governor General’s Secretary.

The regulations are formally published in **S.C. 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13**, and are specifically tailored to the employment of individuals in designated positions within the Office of the Governor General’s Secretary.

---

### **Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to the following **specific positions** (identified by position numbers):

- **Position numbers 00025450 to 00025460**  
  These are the positions within the Office of the Governor General’s Secretary that are governed by these regulations.

**Exclusions from Full Application of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**  
While the general framework of the PSEA applies, certain sections and definitions are **excluded** from application to these positions. Specifically, the following are not applied:

- **Definitions** of "Commission" and "public service" under subsection 2(1) of the PSEA  
- **Sections 17, 54, 55, 68 to 72, 111(1), 112 to 116, 118, 120 to 122, 134, and 135** of the PSEA

> ⚠️ *Note:* This means that while many employment rights and obligations are derived from the PSEA, these specific sections—particularly those related to senior management, collective agreements, disciplinary procedures, and employee protections—are not directly applicable to these positions, as per the regulatory exclusion.

---

### **Application of Specific PSEA Provisions (with Modifications)**

Despite the exclusions, **certain key provisions of the PSEA are applied in a modified or expanded way**:

#### 1. **Sections 17, 55, 72, 134, and 135 of the PSEA apply to the Governor General as if the Governor General were a "deputy head"**
- This means that the Governor General is treated as a deputy head of a public service organization for the purposes of these sections.
- As a result, the **protections and responsibilities** associated with deputy heads (e.g., employment rights, dismissal rules, and administrative oversight) are extended to the Governor General in relation to the Office of the Secretary.

> This is a critical point: although the Governor General is a ceremonial head of state, these regulations treat the office as a public service entity with internal employment rules that mirror those of a deputy head.

#### 2. **Sections 112 to 116, 118, 120 to 122, and 135 of the PSEA apply to persons occupying the designated positions as if they were employees**
- These provisions, which typically govern **employment rights, notice periods, dismissal, and layoff**, are **extended to the individuals in the Secretary’s office**.
- This implies that these employees are granted certain **employee protections** under the PSEA, even though they are in a unique, high-level office.

### **Appointment Process**

- Positions designated in section 1 (i.e., positions 00025450–00025460) may be filled by:
  - **The Governor General**, or
  - A person **authorized by the Governor General** to appoint to those positions.

> This reflects the unique status of the office—appointments are made at the highest level of the Crown, consistent with the ceremonial and constitutional role of the Governor General.

---

### **Dismissal and Layoff Rules**

These are strictly governed to protect the stability and continuity of the office:

- **Dismissal or layoff requires at least one day’s notice**  
  → This is a significant protection for employees in these roles, ensuring they are not terminated without notice.

- **Dismissal is only permitted "for cause"**  
  → This means that termination must be justified by a legitimate, documented reason (e.g., misconduct, performance failure), not arbitrary or subjective decisions.

- **Layoff is only permitted if the services of the employee are no longer required due to:**
  - Lack of work, or  
  - The discontinuance of a function  
  → This prevents layoffs based on budget cuts or political decisions, ensuring that job reductions are tied directly to operational needs.

---

### **Termination of Employment Upon Change of Office of the Governor General**

- A person occupying one of the designated positions **ceases to be employed 30 days after the day the Governor General who held office at the time of their appointment ceases to hold office**.

> This ensures continuity in staffing and prevents abrupt vacancies when a new Governor General is appointed. It also provides a clear timeline for the end of employment, which is important for legal and administrative clarity.

---

### **Rights of Long-Term Employees (Post-Employment Protections)**

Employees who have served for **at least three years** in one of the positions (or in one or more of them consecutively) are entitled to special rights after leaving the position:

1. **Participation in advertised appointment processes**  
   - During a **one-year period after ceasing employment**, such individuals may:
     - Apply for advertised positions in the public service
     - Be considered under the **organizational criterion established under section 34 of the PSEA**, which ensures all employees have equal access to such processes
   - They must meet **any additional criteria** set out in section 34 (e.g., qualifications, experience, or performance)

2. **Right to make a complaint under section 77 of the PSEA**  
   - After leaving the office, these employees may file a formal complaint regarding any alleged violation of employment rights, including unfair treatment, discrimination, or procedural impropriety.

> This provision is a strong safeguard for experienced public servants, reinforcing fairness and accountability even after retirement or transition.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

- These regulations are **not retroactive** and are **not intended to replace or amend any existing laws**.
- The clause "These Regulations come into force on the day on which they are registered" means that they become effective immediately upon official publication and registration in the Canada Gazette.

> This ensures prompt implementation and clarity in the legal timeline.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stability and Continuity** | The rules ensure that key staff in the Governor General’s office are protected from arbitrary dismissal or layoff, preserving institutional knowledge and continuity. |
| **Accountability and Fairness** | The requirement for "cause" in dismissal and the one-year right to reapply or complain promote transparency and equity. |
| **Unique Status of the Office** | The regulations recognize the special constitutional and ceremonial nature of the Governor General’s office while still applying core public service principles. |
| **Balance of Power** | By treating the Governor General as a "deputy head," the regulations provide a legal framework that aligns the office with public service standards without undermining its unique role. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Office of the Governor General’s Secretary Employment Regulations** establish a **balanced and protective employment framework** for key personnel in the office of the Governor General. While these positions are outside the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act, they are granted significant rights and protections—especially regarding notice, dismissal, layoff, and post-employment opportunities.

These regulations reflect a careful balance between:
- The **constitutional and ceremonial nature** of the Governor General’s office,
- The **need for stability and fairness** in public service employment, and
- The **application of core public service principles** to ensure accountability and equity.

They serve as a model for how high-level, non-traditional public service roles can be governed with both flexibility and rigor, ensuring that the integrity of the office is preserved while respecting the rights of its employees.
