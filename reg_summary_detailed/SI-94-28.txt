### **Regulatory Summary: Land Sale Order for Great Slave Lake Area and Yellowknife Lot (Northwest Territories)**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under two provisions of the **Territorial Lands Act**:
- **Paragraph 13(b)**: Grants the authority to include specific land parcels adjacent to a body of water within a land sale.
- **Section 14**: Authorizes the inclusion of land below the Ordinary High Water Mark in a land sale.

This order is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

#### **2. Scope of the Land Sale – Great Slave Lake Area**
The regulation specifies that **certain portions of lands** described in an attached **schedule** (not reproduced here) are to be included in a land sale, under the following conditions:

##### **a. Lands within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Great Slave Lake**
- Any parcel of land described in the schedule that lies **within 30.48 metres (approximately 100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)** of **Great Slave Lake** in the **Northwest Territories** will be **included in the sale**.
- This zone is considered a **buffer or shoreline area** and is subject to special provisions due to its proximity to a large, dynamic lake.
- The inclusion is based on **paragraph 13(b)** of the Territorial Lands Act, which allows for the inclusion of land adjacent to water bodies in land sales, particularly when it affects access, use, or management of the water body.

##### **b. Lands below the Ordinary High Water Mark of Great Slave Lake**
- Any portion of the lands described in the schedule that lies **below the Ordinary High Water Mark** will also be **included in the sale**.
- This is pursuant to **Section 14** of the Territorial Lands Act, which permits the inclusion of land below the OHWM in a land sale.
- This provision ensures that **all land that is not submerged** during normal lake conditions is subject to the sale, even if it is not directly adjacent to the water’s edge.

> ✅ **Key Implication**: The entire area described in the schedule—both the shoreline strip (within 100 feet) and all land below the water level—is now part of the land sale process.

#### **3. Specific Land Mentioned – Lot 11 in Block E, Yellowknife**
In addition to the general provisions, the regulation explicitly identifies a **specific parcel of land** that is included in the sale:

- **Lot 11** in **Block E** of the **City of Yellowknife**, Northwest Territories.
- This lot is defined by reference to a **plan of survey of record number 73520**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.
- A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** at Yellowknife under **reference number 2178**.

> ✅ **Key Implication**: This specific lot is being included in the land sale, and its legal description and survey documentation are publicly accessible and officially recorded.

#### **4. Purpose and Implications**
- The regulation appears to be part of a **larger land disposition or sale initiative**, likely involving government-owned lands.
- The inclusion of both **shoreline areas** and **land below the water level** suggests a comprehensive sale of land near Great Slave Lake, possibly for development, conservation, or revenue generation.
- The inclusion of land within 100 feet of the lake may reflect concerns about **environmental management, access, or flood risk**, or it may be due to **historical land use or legal boundaries**.
- The specific reference to Yellowknife indicates that the sale may be part of a regional development or infrastructure project.
