### 📚 **Legal Background and Context**

- These regulations implement a specific provision of the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)**.

### 📄 **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to establish **clear procedures for verifying the origin of goods** that are eligible for **preferential tariff treatment under CIFTA**.
