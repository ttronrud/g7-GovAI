**Detailed Summary of the First Nations Assessment Inspection Regulations (S.C. 2005, c. 9)**

---

### **Overview**
The *First Nations Assessment Inspection Regulations* were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, under specific provisions of the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act*. These regulations establish the procedures and requirements for conducting property assessments of **assessable property** on First Nations reserves, ensuring that such assessments are carried out in a fair, transparent, and legally compliant manner.

The regulations are designed to align with provincial property assessment laws while respecting the unique governance and cultural context of First Nations communities.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Assessable Property**  
   Refers to:
   - Reserve land,
   - An interest in reserve land (e.g., ownership, leasehold rights), or  
   - A right to occupy, possess, or use reserve land  
   that is subject to assessment under a **property assessment law**.

2. **Assessor**  
   The individual designated by a First Nation to conduct assessments of assessable property. This role is entrusted to a representative chosen by the First Nation, ensuring community involvement and cultural sensitivity.

3. **Property Assessment Law**  
   A law enacted under **subparagraph 5(1)(a)(i)** of the *First Nations Fiscal Management Act*. This law provides the legal framework for how property assessments are conducted, including inspection procedures, valuation standards, and administrative responsibilities.

---

### **Core Provisions and Procedures**

#### **1. Inspection Procedures**
Inspections of assessable property for assessment purposes must follow one of two sets of rules:
- The **procedures prescribed in Sections 3 to 7** of these Regulations, or  
- The **provincial assessment inspection laws** applicable to the province where the assessable property is located.

This allows flexibility, enabling First Nations to either adopt standardized federal procedures or follow existing provincial practices, depending on jurisdictional context.

---

#### **2. Notice of Assessment Inspection**
Before conducting an inspection, the **assessor must deliver a formal notice** to the person named on the assessment roll at the address listed on the roll.

The notice must include:
- A **clear description** of the assessable property (e.g., location, boundaries, type of land),
- The **proposed date and time** of the inspection,
- An invitation for the person on the roll to **contact the assessor** via a provided telephone number to request a different date or time,
- A **description of the alternate assessment procedure** authorized under **Section 6** of the Regulations (which allows for valuation without a physical inspection, typically in cases of unavailability or denial of access).

> *Purpose:* Ensures transparency, provides notice to the property owner or occupant, and gives them the opportunity to object or reschedule.

---

#### **3. Access to Occupants**
If the assessable property is occupied by someone other than the person named on the assessment roll:
- The **person named on the roll** is responsible for making arrangements with the actual occupant to allow access to the assessor.

> *Rationale:* Respects the rights of property occupants and ensures that the person legally registered on the assessment roll remains accountable for the process, even if not physically present.

---

#### **4. Timeframe for Inspections**
Unless otherwise requested by the person named on the assessment roll, inspections must occur between **09:00 and 17:00 local time**.

> *Reason:* Provides a reasonable working window that balances accessibility with practical constraints for both assessors and property occupants.

---

#### **5. Assessment in Absence of Occupant or Access Denial**
If:
- No person aged **18 years or older** is present at the property, **or**
- The occupant **denies access** to the assessor,

Then the assessor may proceed to **assess the value of the property based on the information available to them** (e.g., documents, maps, prior records, or expert estimates).

> *Note:* This provision protects the integrity of the assessment process in situations where direct inspection is not possible, while still requiring the assessor to act reasonably and with available evidence.

---

#### **6. Methods of Delivering the Notice**
A notice may be delivered in one of the following ways:
- **Personally**  
  - For a **residential dwelling**: left with a person aged 18 or older residing there.  
  - For **other types of property**: left with the person apparently in charge at the time of delivery.  
- **By mail, fax, or email**

> *Delivery timelines:*
- **Personal delivery**: Considered delivered at the time of delivery.
- **Mail**: Delivered **five days after postmark**.
- **Fax**: Delivered at the time indicated in the **transmission confirmation**.
- **Email**: Delivered at the time indicated in the **electronic confirmation that the email has been opened**.

> *Purpose:* Ensures legal compliance and provides clear, verifiable records of notice delivery.

---

### **Enforcement and Jurisdiction**
- These regulations apply to all assessable property located on First Nations reserves.
- They are **not independent of provincial laws** — inspections must conform to either the federal procedures in these regulations or the relevant provincial assessment laws, whichever applies.

---

### **Effective Date**
The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

---

### **Key Principles Underlying the Regulations**

1. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   The requirement to provide written notice and allow for rescheduling ensures that property owners and occupants are informed and have a voice in the process.

2. **Respect for Community Governance**  
   By allowing First Nations to designate their own assessors, the regulations empower local communities to manage their fiscal affairs in culturally appropriate ways.

3. **Flexibility and Practicality**  
   The dual pathway (federal or provincial procedures) allows for adaptation to regional differences in land use, infrastructure, and administrative systems.

4. **Fairness and Legal Protection**  
   Provisions for alternate assessment procedures and access denial protect against arbitrary valuations and ensure assessments are based on available facts.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *First Nations Assessment Inspection Regulations* provide a clear, structured, and equitable framework for assessing property on First Nations reserves. They balance federal oversight with community autonomy, ensuring that property assessments are conducted fairly, consistently, and in compliance with both federal and provincial standards. The emphasis on notice, access, and procedural fairness supports the broader goals of fiscal accountability and self-determination within First Nations governance.
