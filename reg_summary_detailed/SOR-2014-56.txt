**Detailed Summary of the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2014)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This Order is issued under the authority of **subsection 117.14(1)a of the Criminal Code** (R.S.C., c. C-46), as recommended by the **Minister of Justice** and approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**.  
The Order is formally registered under **S.C. 1995, c. 39, s. 139**, which authorizes the government to declare amnesty periods for certain offences related to firearms, particularly when individuals have valid licences and are in possession of prohibited firearms.

---

### **2. Scope of the Amnesty Period**
The amnesty period applies specifically to individuals who:
- On the **day before the Order is registered**, were in **possession of a prohibited firearm** and held a **valid licence issued under the Firearms Act**; and  
- **Continued to hold that licence** during the amnesty period while **remaining in possession** of the firearm.

This ensures that individuals who legally owned a prohibited firearm under a valid licence are not subject to criminal prosecution for past possession or use of the firearm during the specified time frame, provided they comply with the conditions of the amnesty.

### **3. Definition of "Prohibited Firearms"**
The Order explicitly defines which firearms are considered "prohibited firearms" and fall within the scope of this amnesty. These include the following models:

### **4. Permitted Activities During the Amnesty Period**
During the amnesty period, individuals may perform any of the following actions **without facing criminal liability**:

#### **(a) Possess the firearm**
- Individuals may continue to legally possess the firearm during the period, as long as they hold a valid licence.

#### **(b) Deliver the firearm to a peace officer, firearms officer, or chief firearms officer**
- The firearm may be surrendered to authorized law enforcement personnel for safekeeping or further disposition.

  - Delivering the firearm to a peace officer, firearms officer, or chief firearms officer (as in (b)); or  
  - Selling or giving it to an authorized business (as in (c)).

#### **(e) Use the firearm for target practice or competitions**
- The firearm may be used in:
  - Target practice  
  - Target shooting competitions  
- Such activities must occur under the **auspices of an approved shooting club or shooting range**, as defined under **section 29 of the Firearms Act**.

> **Transportation Requirements for Target Use**:
- For firearms listed in **paragraphs 1(a), (b), (e), (h), (k), (l), (m), (n), (o)** (i.e., the CZ models and certain SAN Swiss Arms models), transportation must comply with:
  - **Section 10 of the Storage, Display, Transportation and Handling of Firearms by Individuals Regulations**

---

### **5. Duration of the Amnesty Period**
- **Start Date**: The amnesty period begins on the day the Order is officially registered.
- **End Date**: The period ends on **March 14, 2016**.

> This means that any activity related to the prohibited firearms must be completed by March 14, 2016, to be covered under the amnesty. After that date, individuals would be subject to the full legal consequences of possessing a prohibited firearm without a valid licence or under other prohibited circumstances.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government. This ensures immediate applicability and provides clarity for individuals who may have been in possession of these firearms prior to registration.

---

### **7. Purpose and Policy Rationale**
The primary objectives of this amnesty are:
- To **provide legal certainty** for individuals who legally owned prohibited firearms under a valid licence.
- To **facilitate the safe and lawful disposition** of these weapons (e.g., through transfer to authorized entities or surrender to law enforcement).
- To **reduce the risk of criminal liability** for individuals who may have been acting in good faith or under circumstances that were not foreseeable at the time.
- To **support responsible firearm management** by enabling safe handling, storage, and use under regulated conditions.

This reflects a balance between public safety and individual rights, allowing for a transition period where individuals can responsibly manage their firearms without fear of prosecution.

---

### **8. Key Legal and Practical Implications**
- **No criminal liability**: During the amnesty period, individuals are not criminally liable for past possession or use of the firearm.
- **No new offences created**: The amnesty does not create new offences; it simply removes criminal liability for specified acts during a defined time.
- **Compliance required**: Individuals must comply with all applicable regulations (e.g., transportation, storage, and use) to ensure their actions are legally valid under the amnesty.
- **Post-amnesty consequences**: After March 14, 2016, any individual who still possesses a prohibited firearm without a valid licence will be subject to prosecution under the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2014)** is a targeted, legally grounded measure designed to assist individuals who legally owned specific prohibited firearms (CZ and SAN Swiss Arms models) under valid licences. It provides a clear, time-bound window during which these individuals may:
- Possess, transfer, deliver, or use the firearms under strict regulatory conditions.

The Order underscores the Canadian government’s commitment to balancing public safety with individual rights, particularly in cases involving complex or high-risk firearms. It also highlights the importance of regulatory compliance and safe handling practices in the management of prohibited weapons.
