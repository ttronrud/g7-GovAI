**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Mustard Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The Saskatchewan Mustard Order is issued under the authority of **section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6), and is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**. This means that the Order is a regulatory instrument enacted to govern the marketing of mustard in Saskatchewan, specifically in interprovincial and export markets.

The Order is aligned with the broader framework of the **Agri-Food Act, 2004 (S.S. 2004, c. A-15.21)**, which provides the legal foundation for the governance and regulation of agricultural products, including mustard.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act, 2004*, which provides the overarching legislative framework for agricultural marketing and commodity regulation in Saskatchewan.
  
- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the **Saskatchewan Mustard Development Commission**, a body established under the Agri-Food Act. This body is responsible for managing the marketing of mustard in Saskatchewan and is empowered to regulate interprovincial and export trade.

- **Mustard**: Defined broadly to include:
  - Mustard seed or any part of the *Sinapis alba* plant (white mustard).
  - Non-canola quality types of *Brassica juncea* (as specified in regulations under the Seeds Act).
  - Oil, protein, and condiment types of *Sinapis alba*.
  - Seed or plant parts of *Brassica carinata* (a species used for industrial purposes).

This definition ensures that a wide range of mustard-related products—both for food and industrial use—are covered under the Order.

- **Supervisory Board**: Refers to the **Agri-Food Council**, which continues to serve in a supervisory role under the Act. It provides oversight and ensures compliance with regulations related to agricultural marketing.

### **3. Regulatory Powers of the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board**

The Order grants both the **Commodity Board** and the **Supervisory Board** broad powers to regulate the **marketing of mustard** in **interprovincial and export trade**. These powers extend to persons and property located within Saskatchewan.

Specifically, they are authorized to:

#### **(a) Fix, Impose, and Collect Levies or Charges**
- The Boards may establish **levies or charges** on individuals or entities involved in the **production or marketing of mustard** within Saskatchewan.
- These levies or charges can be **differentiated by group**, meaning producers or marketers can be classified into distinct categories (e.g., small farmers, large processors, exporters).
- Each group may be assigned a **different rate** of levy or charge based on factors such as production volume, market activity, or type of mustard.

#### **(b) Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for several purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize market conditions or ensure financial stability during downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of mustard (e.g., due to market fluctuations or poor prices).
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among mustard producers. This ensures that producers who receive lower returns in a given period can be compensated, promoting equity and stability in the industry.

This mechanism helps mitigate the risks associated with volatile commodity markets and supports fair distribution of market gains and losses across producers.

### **4. Scope and Application**

- The Order applies to **all persons and property situated within Saskatchewan** engaged in the **production or marketing** of mustard.
- The regulatory framework applies to both **domestic marketing** and **interprovincial or export trade**, meaning that the rules govern how mustard is sold outside of Saskatchewan or to international markets.
- The Boards are empowered to act **as if they had the same powers** they would have in regulating local (in-province) mustard marketing, thus ensuring consistency and continuity in regulatory approach.

### **5. Effective Date**

The Saskatchewan Mustard Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., when it is officially published and recognized by the government). This ensures immediate implementation upon formal adoption.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The Order serves several critical functions:

- **Market Stability**: By enabling levies and equalization mechanisms, it helps stabilize income for mustard producers, especially during periods of low prices or market downturns.
- **Fairness and Equity**: It ensures that producers are not disproportionately affected by market volatility through income equalization.
- **Revenue Generation**: Levies provide a source of funding for the development and promotion of mustard as a commodity, including research, marketing, and infrastructure.
- **Regulatory Continuity**: It ensures that the regulation of mustard—both locally and in external markets—is consistent and governed by a clear, transparent structure.

### **Conclusion**

The Saskatchewan Mustard Order is a targeted regulatory instrument that empowers the Saskatchewan Mustard Development Commission and the Agri-Food Council to manage the interprovincial and export marketing of mustard. It establishes a structured system for levying charges based on producer groups, using collected funds to support producer stability, cover operational costs, and create financial reserves. By aligning with the Agri-Food Act, 2004, the Order strengthens the economic and regulatory framework for mustard producers in Saskatchewan, promoting long-term sustainability and fairness in the industry.
