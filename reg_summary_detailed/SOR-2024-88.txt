**Detailed Summary of the Marketing Authorization for Vitamin D in Yogurt and Kefir**

---

### **Regulatory Basis**
This Marketing Authorization is issued by the **Minister of Health** under **subsection 30.3(1)a of the Food and Drugs Act (FDA)**, as amended by **S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 416** and referenced in **R.S., c. F-27** (the *Food and Drug Regulations*).  

The authorization is effective upon registration and applies specifically to certain dairy-based yogurt and kefir products that contain vitamin D. It provides a regulatory exemption from specific requirements related to vitamin D labeling and fortification, provided the product meets defined vitamin D content thresholds.

---

### **Key Definitions and Scope**
- **Words and expressions** used in this authorization have the same meaning as defined in the *Food and Drug Regulations*.
- The exemption applies only to **yogurt and kefir made from dairy products**.
- The exemption does **not** apply to **drinkable yogurt** in the same way as traditional (non-drinkable) yogurt — specific thresholds are provided for both types.

---

## **Exemption Provisions**

The following foods are **exempt** from the application of:
- **Paragraphs 4(1)(a) and (d)** of the *Food and Drugs Act*, and  
- **Section D.03.002 of the Food and Drug Regulations**,  
**in respect of the vitamin D content** present in the food — **if** the applicable vitamin D concentration requirements are met.

This means that manufacturers do **not need to**:
- Label vitamin D content as a nutrient of concern,
- Submit additional fortification claims,
- Meet specific nutrient declaration or safety thresholds,  
**as long as the vitamin D levels fall within the specified ranges**.

## **Vitamin D Requirements by Product Type**

### **1. Yogurt (non-drinkable, made from dairy)**
- **Plain yogurt**:  
  Must contain **exactly 5 μg of vitamin D per 100 grams (g)**.
  
- **Fruit or flavoured yogurt**:  
  Must contain **between 3.8 μg and 5 μg of vitamin D per 100 g** (inclusive).

> ✅ *Note: This exemption applies only to yogurt that is not drinkable (i.e., served in cups or containers, not consumed directly from a bottle or glass).*

---

### **2. Drinkable Yogurt (made from dairy)**
- **Plain drinkable yogurt**:  
  Must contain **exactly 5.2 μg of vitamin D per 100 milliliters (mL)**.

- **Fruit or flavoured drinkable yogurt**:  
  Must contain **between 3.9 μg and 5.2 μg of vitamin D per 100 mL** (inclusive).

> ⚠️ *Drinkable yogurt is treated separately due to differences in serving size and consumption patterns (volume-based vs. weight-based).*

---

### **3. Kefir (made from dairy)**
- **Plain kefir**:  
  Must contain **exactly 2.7 μg of vitamin D per 100 mL**.

- **Fruit or flavoured kefir**:  
  Must contain **between 2.3 μg and 2.7 μg of vitamin D per 100 mL** (inclusive).

> 📌 *Kefir is exempt only when made from dairy products; non-dairy kefir (e.g., plant-based) is outside the scope of this authorization.*

---

## **Effective Date**
- This Marketing Authorization **comes into force on the day it is registered**, which is **May 13, 2024**.

---

## **Purpose and Rationale**
The purpose of this authorization is to:
- **Facilitate the natural presence** of vitamin D in commonly consumed dairy-based fermented foods,
- **Reduce regulatory burden** on manufacturers who produce yogurt and kefir with naturally occurring or minimally fortified vitamin D,
- Support **public health goals** related to vitamin D intake, particularly in populations at risk of deficiency,
- Allow for **flexibility in product formulation** while ensuring that vitamin D levels remain within safe and beneficial ranges.

## **Key Implications for Industry and Consumers**

| Stakeholder | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Manufacturers** | Must ensure their yogurt and kefir products meet the exact or range-based vitamin D content requirements. Failure to comply may result in non-compliance with food safety and labeling regulations. |
| **Retailers & Distributors** | Can market these products as compliant with health and nutritional standards, without needing to highlight vitamin D content in labeling. |
| **Consumers** | Benefit from access to vitamin D-rich fermented dairy products without needing to actively seek fortified foods. The exemption ensures transparency and consistency in product nutrition. |
| **Regulatory Authorities** | Can monitor compliance through routine inspections and product sampling, ensuring public health safety. |

---

## **Limitations and Exclusions**
- The exemption **does not apply** to:
  - Non-dairy yogurt or kefir.
  - Products not made from dairy.
  - Products that exceed the specified vitamin D levels.
- The exemption **does not apply** to other nutrients or food safety requirements.
- The exemption is **not a recommendation** for fortification; it is a regulatory tool based on established safety and nutritional science.

---

## **Conclusion**
This Marketing Authorization streamlines the regulatory framework for vitamin D in dairy-based yogurt and kefir by providing clear, science-based thresholds for vitamin D content. It enables manufacturers to produce these products with confidence, while ensuring that consumers receive a consistent, safe, and nutritionally beneficial source of vitamin D. The distinction between plain and flavoured products, as well as between drinkable and non-drinkable forms, reflects the importance of tailoring nutritional standards to product form and consumer use.

This authorization represents a balanced approach to public health, food safety, and industry efficiency, aligning with Canada’s broader goals of promoting healthy eating and reducing nutritional deficiencies.
