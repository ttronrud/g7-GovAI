The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 72]

This indicates that a specific regulation (or set of regulations) was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) in **2014** by **Act No. 2**, **Section 72** of that Act.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** — it no longer exists or has legal force.
- **Date of Repeal**: 2014
- **Governing Legislation**: The repeal was enacted under **Chapter 2 of the Statutes of 2014**, specifically **Section 72**.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: While the original content of the regulation is not provided, the repeated notation implies that multiple provisions or subsections were affected by this repeal. However, without the original text, the specific subject matter (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, tax rules, etc.) cannot be determined.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are no longer in effect. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to current, active legislation for guidance.

### Interpretation:
The repeated entries suggest that either:
1. The original regulation was composed of multiple sections or subsections, all of which were repealed by the same section (s. 72) of the 2014 Act.
2. The notation is a typographical or formatting error, and the actual regulation content is missing.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** described in the input — instead, the text confirms that a previously existing regulation was **officially repealed in 2014 under Section 72 of Act No. 2**. As such, **no further details about its content, purpose, or application can be provided**, since the original text has been removed or is not included.

> ✅ Final Note: This summary is based solely on the provided information. To offer a more detailed analysis (e.g., subject matter, scope, impact), the original regulation text would need to be available.

If you can provide the original regulation or its title, I can offer a more comprehensive and accurate summary.
