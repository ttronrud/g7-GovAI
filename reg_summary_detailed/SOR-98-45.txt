4. **Collection and review of information** from prescribed premises where:

## **4. Prescribed Premises (Locations Where Verification May Occur)**  

### **General Premises (Applicable to All Goods)**  
The following locations are considered **prescribed premises** under section 42.01:

## **5. Key Legal and Procedural Notes**  

- **Exemption from Publication Requirement**:  
  The regulation is **not required to be published** under subsection 164(3) of the *Customs Act* because it is an implementation of a **previously announced policy** (October 27, 1997), as per paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a. This is a procedural exemption for administrative efficiency.  

- **Repealed Provisions**:  
  - **"Verification Visit"** and **"2.2"** (additional provisions) were **repealed** by **SOR/2008-77, s. 3 and s. 4**, respectively.  
  - This means **on-site inspections** (as a standalone method) are no longer permitted under this regulation. Verification is now limited to **document review, record checks, and information collection** from prescribed premises.  

- **Enforcement Authority**:  
  The regulation is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**, under section 42.01c and paragraph 164(1)(i)d of the *Customs Act*.  

- **Legal Citation**:  
  - Primary source: **S.C. 1997, c. 36, s. 160** (the enabling statute)

## **Conclusion**  

This regulation provides a **clear, structured, and targeted framework** for verifying the **origin, classification, and value** of imported goods—especially those claiming **preferential treatment under the Least Developed Country Tariff**. By limiting verification to document-based review and access to specific premises, it balances **effective compliance enforcement** with **administrative efficiency**.
