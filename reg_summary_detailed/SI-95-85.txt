**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Retail Food Program

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision enables the federal government to reorganize the public service by transferring control and supervision of specific programs or functions between departments, typically to align with policy priorities, improve efficiency, or enhance service delivery.

**Subject of Transfer:**  
The **Retail Food Program**, which is a component or division within the Department of Industry.

**Transfer Details:**  
- The **control and supervision** of the Retail Food Program are being transferred from the **Department of Industry** to the **Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food**.  
- This includes all administrative, operational, policy, and oversight responsibilities associated with the program.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
- The transfer reflects a strategic realignment of government responsibilities to better align with the program’s core objectives.  
- The Retail Food Program likely involves policies, funding, standards, or support mechanisms related to the retail sector of food distribution—such as food safety, access, affordability, or supply chain management.  
- By moving it to the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the government signals a focus on strengthening food system governance, ensuring food security, and supporting agricultural and food retail infrastructure.  
- This shift may enhance coordination between agricultural policy and retail food operations, improving consistency in food safety, supply chain resilience, and consumer access.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulation does not specify an effective date, but such transfers typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon formal notification.

**Key Observations:**  
- The transfer does not involve the physical relocation of staff or the dissolution of the program, only a change in administrative oversight.  
- The program’s operational functions remain intact; only the department responsible for its governance and supervision changes.  
- The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food will now be responsible for setting policy, allocating resources, monitoring performance, and ensuring compliance related to the Retail Food Program.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal reorganization within the federal public service to improve the alignment of responsibilities between departments. By transferring the Retail Food Program to the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the government aims to strengthen its ability to support a secure, efficient, and accessible food retail system in alignment with broader agricultural and food security goals.
