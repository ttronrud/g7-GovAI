**Detailed Summary of the *Internet Child Pornography Reporting Regulations* (S.C. 2011, c. 4)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Internet Child Pornography Reporting Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under **Section 12 of the *Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service*** (the "Act"). These regulations establish the operational framework for how Internet service providers (ISPs) are required to report suspected instances of child pornography found on their platforms, and how the designated organization will process, verify, and share such reports with law enforcement.

The regulations came into force on the date the Act was enacted (December 8, 2011), and remain in effect as a key component of Canada’s legal response to online child exploitation.

## **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the primary legislation (An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service).
- **Designated Organization**: The entity responsible for receiving, processing, and forwarding reports of suspected child pornography.  
  → **Defined as the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (CCCP)** under Section 2 of the Act.
- **Internet Address**: Includes both an Internet Protocol (IP) address and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- **Service Provider**: Any individual or entity that offers Internet services to the public (e.g., ISPs, web hosting companies, search engines).

## **Core Provisions and Responsibilities**

### **1. Reporting System for Service Providers**

Under **Section 3**, the designated organization (CCCP) must maintain a **secure online reporting system** with the following features:

- **Unique Identifier Assignment**: Each service provider is assigned a unique identifier to track reports and ensure accountability.

- **Receipt Issuance**: For every report submitted, the system issues a **formal receipt** that includes:
  - Incident number
  - Service provider’s name and unique identifier
  - Date and time of submission

> This ensures transparency, traceability, and auditability of all reports.
