**Detailed Summary of Rule 63 – Summary Conviction Appeal (Supreme Court of Nova Scotia)**  
*Issued under section 482a of the Criminal Code, S.C. 2002, c. 13, s. 17; R.S., c. C-46*  
*Halifax, Nova Scotia, February 27, 2009*

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Rule**
Rule 63 establishes the procedural framework for **appeals from decisions in summary conviction proceedings** in Nova Scotia. It applies to both:
- **Federal summary conviction proceedings** (under Part XXVII of the *Criminal Code*), and  
- **Provincial summary conviction proceedings**, which are governed by the *Summary Proceedings Act (Nova Scotia)*.

This Rule provides specific guidance on how appeals are initiated, conducted, and managed in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, ensuring consistency and fairness in the appellate process.

---

### **2. Definition of "Decision"**
The term **"decision"** includes any determination made in a summary conviction proceeding that is subject to appeal. This encompasses:
- A **conviction** or **finding of guilt**;
- A **dismissal** or **order staying** a proceeding on an information;
- A **sentence**;
- A **verdict of unfit to stand trial** or **not criminally responsible due to mental disorder**;
- Any other order or determination made on summary conviction for which an appeal is available.

This broad definition ensures that all key outcomes of a summary conviction hearing are appealable.

---

### **3. Legal Authority for the Rule**
The Rule is enacted under:
- **Subsection 482(1)** of the *Criminal Code* (power to make rules for appeals);
- **Subsection 482(3)** (power to make rules for appeals in summary conviction cases).

It also incorporates **directions under subsection 815(1)** of the *Criminal Code*, which governs the **manner and time limits** for filing a notice of appeal.

---

### **4. Applicability of Other Rules**
General rules of procedure (e.g., Rule 91 — Criminal Appeal) apply **to the extent they are suitable** and **not inconsistent** with this Rule 63.

#### Key Modifications to Rule 91:
- **Reference to "registrar" is read as a reference to the "prothonotary"** (the court officer responsible for administrative matters in the Supreme Court).
- **No provision in Rule 91 about leave to appeal applies** — appeals are not required to obtain leave, unless otherwise required by law.
- **Any provision in Rule 91 that conflicts with this Rule 63 is inapplicable** — this ensures that Rule 63 supersedes conflicting provisions.

---

### **5. Standard Format for Appeal Documents**
All documents filed under this Rule must include a **standard heading in Form 63.04**, which must contain:
- The **year** in which the appeal is initiated (not the year of the original proceeding);
- The **court number** left blank for assignment by the prothonotary;
- The **charge number** and **person number** obtained from the **Provincial Court of Nova Scotia**.

> *Note: The charge and person numbers are essential identifiers for tracking the appeal and linking it to the original proceeding.*

---

### **6. Time Limit for Filing a Notice of Appeal**
An appeal must be filed within **25 days** of the relevant decision, depending on the nature of the appeal:

| Type of Appeal | Time Limit |
|---------------|------------|
| From a **conviction, finding of guilt, sentence**, or **both** | Not more than 25 days after sentencing |
| From a **decision not involving conviction, guilt, or sentence** (e.g., dismissal, stay) | Not more than 25 days after the decision is made |

> *Note: This is a strict deadline. Extensions may be granted under subsection 815(2) of the *Criminal Code*, which allows for extensions in exceptional circumstances (e.g., illness, force majeure).*

### **7. Filing Location**
The notice of appeal must be filed at the **office of the prothonotary** responsible for scheduling sittings of the **Supreme Court of Nova Scotia** in the **municipality where the original proceeding was heard**.
