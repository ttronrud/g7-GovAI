## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Online News Act Application and Exemption Regulations (S.C. 2023, c. 23)**

### 📌 **Overview**
These regulations implement key provisions of the *Online News Act* (Act) by defining **when a significant bargaining power imbalance exists** between digital news intermediaries (e.g., search engines, social media platforms) and news businesses, and by establishing **strict conditions for granting exemptions** from mandatory compensation requirements. The goal is to ensure that large online platforms fairly compensate Canadian news organizations for the use of their content, especially in light of their dominant market positions.

The regulations are designed to balance **market fairness**, **journalistic independence**, **economic sustainability**, and **transparency** in digital news ecosystems.

## 🔑 Key Provisions and Interpretations

---

### 1. **Definition of Significant Bargaining Power Imbalance (Section 6 of the Act)**

A significant imbalance exists **only if** two conditions are met:

#### ✅ Condition A: Financial Threshold
- The operator’s **total revenue from all sources** in the **previous calendar year** exceeds **$1 billion**.

#### ✅ Condition B: Platform Size Thresholds
The digital news intermediary must be one of the following:
- A **search engine** that, during the previous calendar year, had an **average of at least 20 million unique visitors per month** in Canada.
- A **social media service** that, during the previous calendar year, had an **average of at least 20 million active users per month** in Canada.

> ⚠️ This threshold ensures that only the largest platforms—those with substantial reach and influence—are subject to the compensation regime.

> 🔍 *Note:* The definition applies specifically to **Canadian users and traffic**, emphasizing domestic impact.

---

### 2. **Notification Requirement (Subsection 7(1) of the Act)**

- Any operator **required to notify the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** under subsection 7(1) must do so within **180 days** of the date the *Online News Act* begins to apply to that digital news intermediary.

> 💡 This creates a clear timeline for compliance and accountability, ensuring timely public and regulatory oversight.

---

### 3. **Conditions for Exemption Orders (Paragraph 11(1)(b) of the Act)**

To qualify for an exemption from the mandatory compensation regime, operators must meet **five strict conditions**:

#### 🔹 Condition 1: Open Call Process (Minimum 60 Days)
- The operator must:
  - Publish a **notice for at least 60 days**, and
  - Request the **CRTC to make it publicly available on its website** for the same period,
  - Indicating that **all eligible news businesses** (as defined in section 27) who wish to receive compensation should respond individually or as a group.

#### 🔹 Condition 2: Response Period
- Provide **at least 60 days** for news businesses to respond to the notice.

#### 🔹 Condition 3: Publication of Response List
- As soon as possible after the response window closes:
  - Publish a **list of responding news businesses** (individual or grouped),
  - Clearly identifying any group(s) through which responses were made.

#### 🔹 Condition 4: Submission of Information to the CRTC
- The operator must submit to the CRTC:
  - A list of responding news businesses (individual or grouped),
  - For each business:  
    - Whether they provided an **attestation** under paragraph 5(a) (eligibility under section 27),  
    - Whether they operate a news outlet that meets the definition in section 31(2) or 31(2.1),
    - A list of **news outlets operated by each responding business** that are made available by the platform.

#### 🔹 Condition 5: Disclosure of Non-Monetary Compensation
- Agreements must specify the **dollar value of any non-monetary contributions** (e.g., technical support, editorial access, promotion) provided to news businesses.

> ✅ *This ensures transparency in both monetary and non-monetary benefits.*

---

### 4. **Interpretation of Compensation Criteria (Subparagraphs 11(1)(a)(i) to (viii))**

The CRTC must interpret agreements as providing **fair compensation** only if they meet the following criteria:

#### 🔹 (i) Comparable Compensation
- Agreements must provide **comparable compensation** to news businesses of:
  - Similar size,
  - Similar business models,
  - Similar capabilities,
  - Providing similar types of news content,
  - To comparable markets and communities.

> 📌 *Fairness is based on peer comparison, not arbitrary benchmarks.*

> ❌ Agreements do **not need to pay** for merely facilitating access to content or enabling use under Copyright Act exceptions (e.g., fair dealing).

#### 🔹 (ii) Use of Compensation for Local/Regional/National News
- An agreement is considered to provide appropriate compensation **if it includes a commitment** that:
  - A **majority of the monetary compensation** will be used to support the **production of local, regional, and national news content**.

> 💡 This prioritizes **local journalism** and ensures funds are used for editorial sustainability.

#### 🔹 (iii) Protection of Freedom of Expression and Journalistic Independence
- Agreements must **explicitly prohibit** actions that undermine:
  - Freedom of expression,
  - Journalistic independence.

Specific prohibitions include:
- Retaliatory actions against editorial decisions,
- Restrictions on protecting journalistic independence,
- Interventions in editorial processes.

> ⚖️ This safeguards press freedom and prevents platform control over editorial content.

#### 🔹 (iv) Sustainability of the Canadian News Marketplace
- The CRTC must assess whether the **monetary compensation** contributes to the **sustainability of the Canadian news marketplace**.

> 📊 **Key factor**: The platform’s share of **Canadian Internet advertising revenues** in the calendar year **before** the year for which the exemption is being requested.

> ⚠️ *This is especially critical for the largest platform (the one with the highest advertising share).*

---

### 5. **Special Formula for the Largest Search Engine (Subsection (1))**

For the **search engine with the highest share of Canadian Internet advertising revenues**, the exemption is only valid if:

> **Monetary compensation = (CPI_max / CPI_2023) × Base Amount**

Where:
- **CPI_max** = The highest Consumer Price Index (CPI) for any calendar year from 2023 to the year before the year in question.
- **CPI_2023** = The CPI for 2023.

> 📈 This ensures that compensation **keeps pace with inflation** and provides a **market-based, inflation-adjusted floor** for fair value.

> 📚 Reference: All-items CPI, annual average, not seasonally adjusted, as published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*.

> 🚫 **Note**: This formula applies **only** to the top search engine by advertising revenue.

---

### 6. **Equitable Distribution in Group Agreements**

When an operator enters into an agreement with a **group of news businesses**:

#### ✅ Criteria for Satisfaction of (i) and (v)–(viii):
- The agreement must provide for **equitable distribution** of monetary compensation **after administrative costs** such that:
  - The amount would, **without regard to other agreements**, satisfy the **sustainability formula** (as defined in (iv)).
- Any news business that responded to the notice may **join the group at any time** and receive compensation from the date of joining.

> 💡 This allows flexibility and inclusivity, enabling smaller outlets to join and benefit.

---

### 7. **Equitable Distribution of Compensation (Based on Workforce)**

- Compensation must be distributed **equitably** based on the **number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees** employed by each news business in the previous calendar year, specifically for producing **original online news content**.

> ✅ This ensures that compensation reflects **actual editorial effort and production capacity**.

> ❌ **Cap on allocations**:
- **No more than 30%** of total compensation may go to news businesses that carry on a **programming undertaking** under the *Broadcasting Act* (e.g., broadcasters, TV stations) for news content produced as part of a broadcasting undertaking.
- **No more than 7%** of compensation may go to the **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)**.

> 🔍 This protects independent, non-broadcast news organizations and prevents dominant broadcasters from capturing disproportionate shares.

---

### 8. **Non-Monetary Compensation is Permitted and Recognized**

- Operators **do not need to provide monetary compensation** to merely facilitate access to content or to comply with Copyright Act exceptions (e.g., fair dealing).
- The CRTC **can consider non-monetary contributions** (e.g., traffic, visibility, editorial features) when evaluating whether other criteria (e.g., independence, editorial support) are met.

> ✅ This allows for **diverse forms of support** beyond cash.

---

### 9. **Definition of Key Terms**

#### 🔹 *News Business*
- A business that:
  - Could be designated as **eligible under section 27** of the Act,
