The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2012-294, section 50**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or revoked).
- **Repeal Citation**: It was repealed by **Statutory Instrument 2012-294**, under **Section 50** of that instrument.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 50 of SOR/2012-294 specifically identifies and removes (repeals) certain provisions or rules that were previously in force. The repeated entries suggest that multiple provisions or subsections were affected by this repeal, though the original regulation itself is not listed in the text.
- **Effective Date**: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such repeals are typically effective upon publication in the *Supplement to the Statutes* (SOR), which in this case is SOR/2012-294. The repeal would have taken effect on or after the date of publication, which is generally in 2012.
- **Legal Implication**: Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer legally binding. Any legal, administrative, or operational obligations derived from it are nullified. Entities or individuals previously subject to its provisions must now comply with the current, valid regulations in place after the repeal.

### Conclusion:

The text does **not** contain the actual content or details of the original regulation being repealed. Instead, it only indicates that **a regulation (or set of regulations) has been formally removed from the legal framework** through **SOR/2012-294, section 50**. Therefore, a detailed summary of the *substance* of the repealed regulation cannot be provided due to the absence of its original text.

To obtain a detailed summary of the *original regulation*, one would need to access the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal, which is likely archived in official government publications such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Statutes of Canada* database.

In short:

> The provided information confirms that a regulation was repealed by SOR/2012-294, s. 50, but does not contain the content or purpose of the regulation itself. As a result, a detailed summary of the regulation's provisions, scope, or application cannot be offered based on this input alone. The repeal means the regulation is no longer in force.
