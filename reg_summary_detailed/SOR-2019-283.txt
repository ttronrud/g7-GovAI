### **Detailed Summary of the Information and Management of Time Limits Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 1)**

These regulations, made under **Section 112 of the Impact Assessment Act (IAA)**, establish detailed procedures for the **management of time limits** and the **requirements for project descriptions** in the context of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) in Canada. They were issued on **July 19, 2019**, and came into force on **August 28, 2019**, with a formal registration as **SOR/2019-283**. The regulations are designed to ensure transparency, consistency, and accountability in the federal impact assessment process, particularly regarding timelines, information requirements, and Indigenous and public engagement.

---

## **I. Purpose and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**: The regulations are made by the **Minister of the Environment** under **Section 112 of the Impact Assessment Act**, which empowers the Minister to prescribe rules related to the timing and content of information submissions and assessments.
- **Purpose**: To provide clarity on:
  - When time limits may be suspended;
  - What information must be submitted by proponents;
  - How engagement with Indigenous peoples, other jurisdictions, and the public must be structured;
  - The format and language of submissions.

---

## **II. Suspension of Time Limits**

Under specific circumstances, time limits set by the Act (e.g., for submitting information or responding to requests) may be **suspended**, allowing proponents or the Agency more time to complete required work.

### **Situations Where a Time Limit May Be Suspended**:

1. **Request to Designate a Physical Activity or Project**  
   - A time limit may be suspended **if the proponent submits a written request** to the Agency for an extension.

2. **Changes to a Designated Project’s Plans**  
   - If a proponent proposes a **change in design, construction, or operation** of a designated project, and:
     - The Agency or review panel determines that the change would **alter the potential environmental effects** of the project; and
     - There is **insufficient information available** to conduct a full impact assessment or prepare a report.
   - In such cases, the time limit for completing the assessment may be suspended while the proponent collects necessary data.

3. **Non-Payment of Fees or Charges**  
   - If a proponent fails to pay required fees, charges, levies, or costs (as defined in **Section 76 of the IAA**) within the time limit set out in **Section 80**, the time limit for processing the request may be suspended until payment is made.

> ⚠️ *Note: This suspension mechanism is intended to prevent undue delays due to unforeseen data gaps or financial issues, but it does not waive the obligation to eventually meet the deadline.*

## **III. Requirements for Project Descriptions**

The regulations define the **detailed content** that must be included in the **initial** and **detailed descriptions** of a designated project. These descriptions are critical for initiating and guiding the impact assessment process.
