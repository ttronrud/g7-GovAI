### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Apparel** | Goods listed in **Chapters 61 and 62** of the List of Tariff Provisions that are cut or knit to shape and sewn or assembled in Honduras using fabric or yarn produced or obtained **outside the free trade area** (i.e., not from Canada or Honduras). |
| **Fabric and Made-Up Goods** | Includes:<br>• Textile goods in Chapters 51–55, 58, 60, and 63 that are woven or knitted in Honduras from yarn produced or obtained outside the free trade area, or knitted in Honduras from yarn spun in Honduras or Canada using fibre from outside the free trade area;<br>• Goods under subheading **9404.90** that are finished, cut, and sewn or assembled in Honduras from fabric or yarn produced or obtained outside the free trade area. |
| **Free Trade Area** | The geographic area comprising **Canada and Honduras**. This defines the scope of origin and eligibility for duty remission. |

> *Note: The definitions ensure that only goods processed in Honduras using inputs from outside the free trade area qualify for remission.*

### **4. Scope and Eligibility of Duty Remission**

- **Remission Applies To:**  
  Customs duties paid or payable at the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff rates** on:
  - Apparel
  - Fabric and made-up goods

- **Effective Date:**  
  The remission applies to goods imported **on or after October 1, 2014**.

- **Annual Quantitative Limits:**  
  The remission is **not unlimited**. It is capped by annual quantitative limits set in **Section 5 of Annex 3.1 to Chapter Three of the Canada–Honduras FTA**.  
  These limits are established per product (goods category) and ensure that trade benefits are distributed fairly and do not lead to over-reliance or market distortion.

### **5. Conditions for Granting Remission**

To qualify for the duty remission, the importer or owner of the goods must provide the following documentation **at specific times**:

#### **(a) At the Time of Accounting or Refund Application**
When the goods are:
- Accounted for under **subsection 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Customs Act**, or
- Subject to an application for a refund of customs duty,

The importer must provide:
1. A **permit issued under the Export and Import Permits Act and Import Certificate Regulations** that identifies the **quantity available for remission or refund** under Chapter Three of the Canada–Honduras FTA.
2. A **written declaration in English or French** stating that the **certification** (referenced in subparagraph (c)(i) of the FTA rules) is in the possession of the importer or owner.

> *This ensures transparency and accountability in the use of the duty remission quotas.*

#### **(b) At Time of Release or Later (After Declaration)**
When the goods are released from customs, or at any time after the declaration in (a) is submitted, the importer must provide:
1. A **certification of the exporter**, in English, French, or Spanish, in the form specified in the **Schedule** to the Order.
2. A **copy of the applicable invoice or sales agreement**.
3. If the certification is in **Spanish**, an **English or French translation** must be attached.

> *This certification confirms that the goods meet the origin requirements of the FTA (e.g., production in Honduras using foreign-origin inputs).*

---

### **6. Certification by the Exporter**

The exporter must sign and date a formal certification stating:

> *"I, the exporter of the goods referred to in the attached invoice or sales agreement, certify that those goods comply with the applicable requirements specified in Section 5 of Annex 3.1 to Chapter Three of the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement."*

This certification is critical to verify:
- Compliance with origin rules (e.g., processing in Honduras, use of foreign-origin yarn/fibre).
- Adherence to the FTA’s technical and procedural standards.

---

### **7. Effective Date of the Order**

- The Order comes into force on the day that **Section 43 of the Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014) comes into force.
- **If the Order is registered after that date**, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> *Note: This Order is in force from October 1, 2014 (as noted in SI/2014-74), aligning with the start of the FTA’s implementation period.*

### **8. Key Implications and Objectives**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promotes Local Processing** | Encourages Honduras to process textile and apparel goods using inputs from outside the free trade area, supporting local industry development. |
| **Ensures Origin Compliance** | Requires strict documentation to ensure goods meet FTA origin rules (e.g., value-added processing in Honduras). |
| **Prevents Abuse** | Annual quantity limits prevent overuse of the remission and protect Canadian trade interests. |
| **Facilitates Trade Transparency** | Mandatory documentation (permits, declarations, certifications) enhances auditability and compliance. |
| **Supports FTA Implementation** | Aligns with Chapter Three of the Canada–Honduras FTA, which aims to strengthen bilateral trade in textiles and apparel. |

---

### **9. Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **structured, transparent, and enforceable framework** for granting customs duty remission on specific textile and apparel goods imported from Honduras. It:
- Is grounded in the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement,
- Applies only to goods meeting strict origin and processing requirements,
- Is subject to annual quantity caps to prevent market distortion,
- Requires detailed documentation from both importers and exporters,
- And is designed to promote sustainable and compliant trade between Canada and Honduras.

It reflects a balanced approach to trade policy—offering benefits to producers while maintaining safeguards to ensure fair competition and adherence to international trade rules.

---

**In short:**  
*Canadian importers of certain apparel and textile goods from Honduras can avoid paying MFN duties if the goods are processed in Honduras using foreign-origin materials, and if they meet strict documentation and quantity limits. The remission is conditional, transparent, and tied directly to the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement.*
