The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the same statutory instrument:

> [Repealed, SI/2008-103, s. 5]  
> (repeated six times)

### Summary:

This indicates that a particular provision of a prior regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2008-103, Section 5**.

- **SI/2008-103** refers to a statutory instrument issued in 2008, numbered 103. These instruments are secondary legislation used in some jurisdictions (such as Canada or the United Kingdom) to implement or amend primary legislation.
- **Section 5** of that instrument specifically contains the repeal of a previous regulation.
- The repeated entries suggest that the repeal applies to a provision or set of provisions that were previously in force, and that these provisions are no longer valid or in effect as of the date of the repeal.

### Key Points:
- The regulation referenced in the original text (which is not provided) has been **officially removed from law**.
- The repeal was enacted through **SI 2008-103, s. 5**, which is a formal legal mechanism for updating or modernizing legislation.
- The exact content of the repealed regulation is not included in the provided text, so a detailed summary of the original regulation cannot be offered without further information.

### Conclusion:
The provided information does not contain a detailed summary of a regulation itself, but rather confirms that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by Statutory Instrument 2008-103, Section 5. To provide a detailed summary of the *original* regulation, access to the full text of the repealed provision would be required.
