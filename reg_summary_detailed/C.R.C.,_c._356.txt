**Detailed Summary of the Shipping Safety Control Zones Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Shipping Safety Control Zones Order** and may be cited as such. It establishes specific maritime zones within Canadian Arctic waters where shipping activities are subject to enhanced safety controls due to the region’s extreme environmental conditions, navigational hazards, and remote accessibility.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **Seaward Boundary**
- The **seaward boundary** generally refers to the **outer limit of Canada’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)**, which is 200 nautical miles from the baseline of the territorial sea.
- **Exception**: If the international maritime boundary between Canada and **Greenland** is less than 200 nautical miles from Canada’s territorial sea baseline, then that **international boundary** replaces the EEZ boundary in defining the seaward limit of the zones.

> This provision acknowledges the unique geographic and political realities of the Canadian-Greenland border, ensuring that maritime zones are accurately defined in areas where the EEZ would extend beyond the actual international boundary.

---

### **3. Scope of the Zones**

The Order designates **multiple distinct areas** in the Arctic waters of Canada as **"shipping safety control zones"**. These zones are defined in **Schedule 1** (which lists the zones) and illustrated in **Schedule 2** (which provides maps).

> **Exclusions**: The zones **do not include** rivers, lakes, or other bodies of **fresh water**. This ensures that inland or freshwater systems are not subject to these safety controls, which are intended for open ocean navigation.

---

### **4. Description of the Zones**

The zones are defined using precise geographic coordinates and directional descriptions (e.g., "thence along a line to", "thence along a parallel of latitude"). Each zone is a closed polygon formed by a sequence of lines connecting specific geographic points. The descriptions follow standard surveying conventions and are based on the **Atlas of Canada** published by the Department of Natural Resources.

Below is a **detailed breakdown** of each zone:
