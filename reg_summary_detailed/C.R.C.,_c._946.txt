**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation is a **Proclamation issued by the Government of Canada** on behalf of the Crown, with the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**, and serves to **establish specific reference dates** for the purposes of assessing income tax under the **Income Tax Act** in relation to certain types of property.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Reference Date for Property Mentioned in Paragraph 24(a) of the Income Tax Application Rules, 1971**  
   - The regulation fixes **December 22, 1971** as the relevant date (or "day in relation to") any property described in **paragraph 24(a)** of the *Income Tax Application Rules, 1971*.
   - This date applies specifically to the **purposes of subdivision c of Division B of Part I of the Income Tax Act**.
   - In practical terms, this means that for tax purposes, the ownership, value, or treatment of property falling under paragraph 24(a) will be evaluated as of **December 22, 1971**, when determining tax liabilities or adjustments related to that property.

2. **Reference Date for Property Mentioned in Paragraph 24(b) of the Income Tax Application Rules, 1971**  
   - The regulation fixes **December 31, 1971** as the relevant date for any property described in **paragraph 24(b)** of the same Rules.
   - This date also applies to the **same subdivision (subdivision c)** of Division B of Part I of the Income Tax Act.
   - Therefore, tax calculations or determinations involving property under paragraph 24(b) will be based on the condition or status of that property as of **December 31, 1971**.

### Context and Purpose

- The **Income Tax Application Rules, 1971** are a set of administrative rules that provide detailed guidance on how the Income Tax Act is applied in practice.
- Paragraphs 24(a) and 24(b) likely refer to specific types of property, such as:
  - **24(a)**: Possibly property received through a transfer, gift, or certain capital gains events.
  - **24(b)**: Possibly property acquired through a specific transaction, such as a business sale, asset transfer, or investment.
- The purpose of fixing these dates is to:
  - Provide **clarity and consistency** in the application of tax rules.
  - Establish a **fixed point in time** to assess the status, value, or ownership of certain assets for tax computation.
  - Avoid ambiguity in cases where property ownership or value changes over time, especially in the context of capital gains, deemed receipts, or tax deferral.

### Significance of the Dates

- **December 22, 1971** and **December 31, 1971** are both within the same calendar year, suggesting that this regulation was enacted to address tax issues arising from a particular fiscal or legislative context.
- The use of slightly different dates (December 22 vs. December 31) indicates that the types of property or transactions under 24(a) and 24(b) may have different timing or legal implications.
- These dates are not arbitrary—they are likely tied to specific events such as:
  - The implementation of new tax rules.
  - The closing of a fiscal period.
  - A change in ownership or valuation methodology.

---

### Legal Authority and Validity

- The proclamation is issued by the **Government of Canada**, with the advice of the **Privy Council**, which is the highest advisory body in the Canadian government.
- This gives the regulation **constitutional and statutory authority** under the powers granted to the Crown in matters of taxation.
- As a **proclamation**, it is a form of **regulatory instrument** that implements or interprets provisions of the Income Tax Act without requiring a new law.

---

### Conclusion

This regulation establishes two specific reference dates for tax purposes:
- **December 22, 1971** for property under paragraph 24(a),
- **December 31, 1971** for property under paragraph 24(b),

both within the context of **subdivision c of Division B of Part I of the Income Tax Act**. These dates are critical for determining the tax treatment of specific property transactions, ensuring consistency, and providing a clear legal benchmark for tax authorities and taxpayers.

This type of regulation is typical in tax law to resolve ambiguities, ensure fairness, and provide certainty in the application of tax rules during transitional or legislative periods.

*Note: While this regulation is dated and historical (from 1971), it remains legally binding in its application to tax matters involving the specified property types and reference dates, as long as the underlying rules and tax provisions are still in force.*
