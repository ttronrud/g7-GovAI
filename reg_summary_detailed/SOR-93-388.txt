**Detailed Summary of the Fort Norman Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

The **Fort Norman Airport Zoning Regulations** were formally adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

Prior to adoption, a proposed version of the regulations was published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** (November 14 and 21, 1992), and in **two successive issues of the local newspapers**:
- *News of the North* (January 25 and February 1, 1993)
- *L’Aquilon* (January 29 and February 5, 1993)

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the proposed regulations. The final regulations reflect the outcome of this public consultation process.

### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *Fort Norman Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all land**, including public road allowances, that is **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Fort Norman Airport**, as specifically defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

The regulations establish **strict height restrictions** on structures and natural growth near the airport to ensure **safe aircraft operations**, particularly during takeoff and landing.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Fort Norman Airport, located near Fort Norman in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport's centerline of runway 05–23, located **457 meters from the threshold of runway 23**, at an elevation of **98.3 meters above sea level**. This point serves as the origin for measuring distances and elevations in the zoning plan. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 05 and 23). These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear visual and spatial path during approach. Each has a **1:25 slope** (1 meter rise per 25 meters horizontal distance), rising to an imaginary horizontal line **2,500 meters** from the runway end. The outer ends of this line are **280 meters** from the runway centerline. The horizontal line is **100 meters above the elevation at the runway end**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane located **45 meters above the elevation of the airport reference point** (i.e., 98.3 + 45 = 143.3 meters above sea level). However, where this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe enforcement. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular landing area of the airport, specifically the **runway section associated with runway 05–23**, which is **60 meters wide** (30 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,034 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:5 slope** (1 meter rise per 5 meters horizontal distance), extending from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces** upward and outward until they intersect with the outer surface. These surfaces provide a buffer zone between the runway and the outer surface, ensuring safe clearance for aircraft. |

### **4. Height Restrictions**

No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures),  
- **Or allow any natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) to exceed the elevation limits defined by the following surfaces:

> **The highest point of any structure or object must not exceed**:
> - The **approach surfaces**  
> - The **outer surface**  
> - The **transitional surfaces**

This ensures that aircraft approaching or departing the airport have **unobstructed visibility and flight paths**, minimizing the risk of collision with obstacles.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Management**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes) grows beyond the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a directive requiring the **owner or lessee** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This provision allows for **flexibility in managing natural landscapes** while maintaining safety standards.

---

### **6. Zoning Plan Reference**

All spatial and elevation boundaries are based on **Fort Norman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2969**, dated **January 30, 1992**, which provides the official visual and technical layout of the airport’s zones.

Key features derived from this plan:
- The **airport reference point** is located on the centerline of runway 05–23, 457 meters from the threshold of runway 23.
- The **strip** is 60 meters wide and 1,034 meters long.
- The **approach surfaces** are defined with precise slopes and distances.
- The **transitional surfaces** connect the strip edges to the outer surface with a 1:5 slope.
- The **outer boundary** of regulated land is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the airport reference point.

---

### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- To provide **clear, enforceable spatial boundaries** for land use around the airport.
- To balance **aviation safety** with **local land use and environmental considerations**, particularly through the management of natural growth.
- To establish a **transparent and legally sound process** for zoning, including public notice and opportunity for comment.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Enforce the height restrictions.
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
- The regulations are enforceable under the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Section 5.4**, which authorizes the Governor General to adopt zoning regulations based on recommendations from the Minister.

### **9. Key Technical and Safety Features**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **1:25 Approach Surface Slope** | Provides a steep, gradual slope to allow aircraft to see the runway clearly during approach, especially at long distances. |
| **2,500 m Distance from Runway End** | Ensures sufficient buffer zone for aircraft to maintain visual contact with the runway. |
| **1:5 Transitional Surface Slope** | Smoothly transitions from the runway edges to the outer surface, reducing abrupt changes in terrain. |
| **Outer Surface at 45 m above ARP** | Creates a consistent ceiling for all areas outside the strip, protecting aircraft from obstructions beyond the immediate approach zones. |
| **4,000 m Radius Boundary** | Defines the full area subject to zoning controls, ensuring that even distant land is regulated to maintain safety. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Fort Norman Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive and technically precise set of rules designed to **protect aviation safety** at Fort Norman Airport. By defining clear **height limits**, **geometric boundaries**, and **enforcement mechanisms**, the regulations ensure that both man-made and natural features remain within safe limits during aircraft operations.

The regulations are grounded in a **transparent legislative process**, including public notice and comment, and are aligned with international best practices in airport zoning and flight safety. They serve as a foundational legal instrument for managing land use in the vicinity of one of Canada’s northern airports.
