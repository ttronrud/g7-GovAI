### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the **National Transportation Act, 1987**, constitutes a series of **variations and amendments** to previously established **National Transportation Agency (NTA) orders** governing passenger rail services in Canada. These changes were made by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, and came into effect on **January 15, 1990**, with later adjustments made in **1994** to reflect evolving operational and legal circumstances.

The regulation is structured around several key legal foundations and procedural elements, which are summarized and analyzed below:

---

## **I. Legal Basis and Procedural Framework**

### 1. **Continuity of Prior Orders (Section 272(7) of the National Transportation Act, 1987)**
- Orders originally issued by the **Railway Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission** (prior to the enactment of section 272) are deemed to **continue in force** as if they had been issued directly by the **National Transportation Agency (NTA)** after the coming into effect of section 272.
- This ensures **legal continuity** of existing rail service mandates, even as the regulatory body evolved from the Canadian Transport Commission to the NTA.

### 2. **Power to Vary Orders (Section 64 of the National Transportation Act, 1987)**
- The Governor in Council has the authority to **vary any order of the NTA** on its own motion.
- This power enables the government to adjust rail service provisions in response to:
  - Financial considerations,
  - Operational efficiency,
  - Legal rulings,
  - Changes in infrastructure (e.g., abandonment of rail lines),
  - Public interest or regional demand.

## **II. Key Components of the Regulation**

### **A. Revocation and Substitution of Service Mandates (Effective January 15, 1990)**

#### 1. **Definition of "Passenger-Train Services" (Section 2 of Order R-38000, April 29, 1985)**
- Clarifies which trains qualify as **passenger-train services** under the *Railway Act*, specifically sections 265 to 270.
- Lists the railway companies providing these services:
  - **VIA Rail Canada Inc.**
  - **Canadian National Railway Company (CN)**
  - **Algoma Central Railway**
  - **The White Pass and Yukon Corporation Limited**
  - **Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway Inc.**

> *Purpose:* Establishes clear jurisdictional and operational boundaries for passenger service obligations.

---

#### 2. **Minimum Weekly Frequency Requirements (Section 2 of Order R-41255, November 12, 1987)**
- **Mandates continuity** of certain key services:
  - Montréal–Québec (via Drummondville and Trois-Rivières)
  - Montréal–Ottawa
  - Montréal–Toronto
  - Ottawa–Toronto
  - Toronto–Sarnia
  - Toronto–Windsor
  - Toronto–Niagara Falls

- **Discontinuation of specific routes** effective January 15, 1990:
  - Montréal–Québec via **Trois-Rivières** (a segment of the Drummondville route)
  - Kingston–Toronto
  - Toronto–Stratford
  - Toronto–London (via Stratford)
  - Toronto–London (via Brantford)

> *Impact:* Significantly reduces service frequency on the Toronto–London corridor and eliminates a major route segment (Trois-Rivières), reflecting a strategic shift toward more efficient, high-demand corridors.

---

#### 3. **Amendments to Order R-39638 (August 6, 1986, as amended)**
- **Services to be retained**:
  - Halifax–Montréal
  - Moncton–Montréal
  - Gaspé–Montréal
  - Jonquière–Montréal
  - Montréal–Cochrane
  - Toronto–Sudbury (part of Montreal/Toronto–Vancouver route)
  - Capreol–Winnipeg
  - Sudbury–White River
  - Winnipeg–Churchill

- **Services to be discontinued**:
  - Halifax–Yarmouth
  - Halifax–Saint John
  - Multiple segments of the **Montreal/Toronto–Vancouver** corridor:
    - Montreal–Ottawa
    - Ottawa–North Bay
    - North Bay–Sudbury
    - Sudbury–White River
    - White River–Thunder Bay
    - Thunder Bay–Winnipeg
    - Winnipeg–Regina
    - Regina–Calgary
    - Calgary–Kamloops
    - Kamloops–Vancouver

- **Extension of Moncton–Montréal service**:
  - Extended to **Moncton–Halifax** effective January 15, 1990.

> *Significance:* A major restructuring of eastern and central Canadian rail services. It eliminates long-distance, low-frequency routes in favor of more viable, high-traffic corridors. The Moncton–Halifax extension improves regional connectivity.

---

#### 4. **Abandonment of Matapédia–Gaspé and Sydney–Truro–Halifax (Order R-24328, amended)**
- **Discontinued services**:
  - Matapédia–Gaspé
  - Sydney–Truro–Halifax

> *Rationale:* These routes were deemed non-viable due to low ridership and high operating costs.

---

#### 5. **Discontinuation of Toronto–North Bay–Kapuskasing (Order R-41065, August 28, 1987)**
- Service discontinued effective January 15, 1990.

> *Reason:* Low ridership and poor economic viability.

---

#### 6. **Reduction in Frequency of Winnipeg–Saskatoon (via Melville)**
- Frequency reduced from **weekly to three times per week** in each direction.

> *Effect:* A cost-saving measure to improve financial sustainability without eliminating the service entirely.

---

#### 7. **Victoria–Nanaimo vs. Victoria–Courtenay Service (Order R-36539, April 11, 1984)**
- **Background**:
  - Original order required discontinuation of the **Victoria–Courtenay** passenger service.
  - In **December 1989**, the **Supreme Court of British Columbia** ruled that the **federal government has a perpetual obligation** to maintain passenger and freight rail service on the **Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway line between Victoria and Nanaimo**.
  - The federal government appealed this decision to the **Supreme Court of Canada**.

- **Final Outcome (Effective January 15, 1990)**:
  - The order is **revoked** and **replaced**:
    - **Victoria–Nanaimo** portion of the Victoria–Courtenay service is **continued**.
    - **Nanaimo–Courtenay** portion is **discontinued**.

> *Legal Significance:* This reflects a landmark judicial decision affirming federal responsibility for maintaining essential rail services in certain regions. It establishes a precedent for **perpetual obligations** in federal rail policy.

## **III. 1994 Amendments (Effective December 17, 1994)**

### **Trigger: Abandonment of the Canadian Atlantic Railway (January 1, 1995)**
- The **abandonment** of the Canadian Atlantic Railway necessitated adjustments to VIA Rail’s **eastern transcontinental services**.
- As a result, the government revised earlier orders (R-38000 and R-39638) to reflect new service realities.

### **Key Amendments to Orders R-38000 and R-39638**

#### 1. **Revised Minimum Frequency Table (Schedule I, Group I)**

- **Joint Operation**:
  - **Gaspé–Montreal** and **remaining Halifax–Montreal services** are now operated as a **joint service between Montreal and Matapédia**.
