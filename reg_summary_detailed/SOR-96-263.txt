### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, under **Section 21** of the *Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act (WAPR Act)*.

- It implements the **protection of endangered wild animals and plants** and regulates **international and interprovincial trade** in these species.
- The regulation comes into force when **Act No. 52 of 1992** (the WAPR Act) comes into force.
- **Note**: This regulation was **repealed in 2017** (SOR/2017-123, s. 2), and its provisions have been superseded by more modern legislation, including the *Species at Risk Act* and updated CITES implementation rules. However, this summary reflects the content as it existed at the time of enactment.

### **3. Exemptions from Permit Requirements**

#### **A. Import Exemptions (Under Subsection 6(1) and 6(2))**

1. **Appendix II CITES Species (Not in Schedule II)**  
   - An importer is **exempt from requiring a permit** under subsection 10(1) of the Act **if**:
     - They have obtained **a valid permit, certificate, or authorization** from the **competent authority of the exporting country**, which satisfies CITES requirements.

2. **Appendix III CITES Species (Not in Schedule II)**  
   - Importer is **exempt** if they have a **certificate** from the exporting country’s competent authority that meets CITES requirements.

3. **Species Listed in Schedule I and Exporting from a Specified Country**  
   - If the species is listed in a subitem of **Schedule I** and the export country is listed in **column III** of that subitem, exemption applies **if**:
     - The importer holds a **valid permit or certificate** from the exporting country’s competent authority.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These exemptions only apply to species **not listed in Schedule II**.

---

#### **B. Export Exemptions (Under Subsection 6(2))**

- Applies to animals/plants **not listed as fauna or flora in any CITES appendix**.
- Exemption applies if:
  - The export is from a province that:
    - **Does not prohibit** the transportation; or
    - **Only requires authorization** from the province’s competent authority (i.e., permits such transport).

> This ensures that provinces can regulate movement of species within their borders, but does not require a federal permit for compliant exports.

---

#### **C. Provincial Transportation Restrictions (Subsection 6(3))**

- For **transportation into or out of a province**:
  - The regulation defines **what constitutes a regulated or prohibited species** based on provincial laws.
  - **Exemption** applies if all required **provincial permits** have been obtained.

> This allows provincial governments to enforce conservation policies on movement of species within their jurisdiction.

---

### **4. Special Provisions for Elephant and Rhinoceros Products**

- **No exemption** exists for **importing or exporting raw ivory or raw horn**.
- A permit under subsection 10(1) is **mandatory** for any such specimen.
- **Permits may only be issued for**:
  - Use in a **museum or zoo**;
  - **Scientific research**;
  - **Law enforcement activities**.

> This reflects a strong international stance against illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn, even for non-commercial purposes.

---

### **5. Exemptions for Appendix I CITES Species (Highest Conservation Priority)**

Appendix I species are the most endangered and strictly protected.

- **Exemption from paragraph 8(c)** of the Act (which otherwise restricts trade) applies if:
  1. The animal/plant was **taken from its habitat before July 3, 1975** (establishes historical legitimacy);
  2. It was **legally imported into Canada**; or
  3. Its distribution or offering complies with **federal and provincial conservation laws**.

- **Captive-bred animals** (listed as fauna in Appendix I) are exempt from paragraph 8(c) if:
  - They were **bred in captivity** or part of a **captive breeding program**.

- **Artificially propagated plants** (listed as flora in Appendix I) are exempt if:
  - They were **grown under controlled conditions** from seeds, spores, pollen, tissue culture, or other propagules.

> This supports conservation efforts by allowing legitimate, sustainable sources of specimens.

### **6. Personal Use Exemptions (Sections 15 and 17)**

  - **Personal effects** (clothing, accessories, personal baggage);
  - **Household effects** (belongings moved with an individual);

  - Exporting to or importing from the U.S. of:
