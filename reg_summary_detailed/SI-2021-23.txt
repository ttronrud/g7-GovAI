**Detailed Summary of the "Certain Fees in Respect of the Replacement of Identity and Travel Documents (Reclaimed Names) Remission Order"**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, formally titled *Certain Fees in Respect of the Replacement of Identity and Travel Documents (Reclaimed Names) Remission Order*, was issued by His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council on **May 31, 1991**, under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**. It was recommended by the **Treasury Board**, the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**, and the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**.

The purpose of this Order is to **remit (i.e., waive) administrative fees** associated with the replacement of certain identity and travel documents for **Indigenous individuals who have undergone an "imposed name change" in Canada** or are descendants of such individuals. The remission applies to specific applications made between **May 31, 2021, and May 30, 2026**, and ensures that these individuals can reclaim their original (traditional or ancestral) names without being burdened by associated government fees.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Primary Authority**: Subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11)
- This provision allows the government to make fee remission orders when it is in the public interest — particularly when such actions promote equity, reconciliation, and the recognition of Indigenous rights and identities.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Refugee Travel Document**: A travel document issued under:
  - The *United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees* (1951)
  - The *Protocol to that Convention* (1967)

> This definition is included to ensure that refugee status does not exclude eligibility for name remission, even though the primary focus of the Order is on Indigenous name reclamation.

## **Fee Remission Provisions**

The Order waives fees in five distinct but related contexts where an Indigenous person or their descendant is reclaiming a name that was previously imposed. The remission applies **only if all conditions are met**, and **only within the specified timeframe (May 31, 2021 – May 30, 2026)**.

## **Key Principles Underlying the Order**

1. **Recognition of Historical Injustice**  
   The Order directly addresses the legacy of **imposed name changes** in Canada — a practice historically used by colonial authorities to erase Indigenous identities, languages, and cultures. Reclaiming one’s name is a form of **cultural reclamation and healing**.

2. **Equity and Reconciliation**  
   By waiving fees, the government acknowledges that financial barriers can prevent Indigenous people from asserting their true identities. This supports broader goals of **truth and reconciliation** with Indigenous peoples.

3. **Flexibility and Accessibility**  
   The inclusion of **statutory declarations** as an alternative to birth certificates ensures that individuals who lack official documentation (due to historical record-keeping failures or systemic discrimination) are not excluded from the process.

4. **Time-Bound Application Window**  
   The period from **May 31, 2021, to May 30, 2026** is designed to allow sufficient time for Indigenous communities to access services, process applications, and engage with government agencies. After this window, the remission will no longer apply.

5. **Document Validity Requirements**  
   The requirement that the original document be valid for at least six months ensures that individuals are not applying to replace a document that is already expired or invalid, protecting the integrity of identity records.

## **Impact and Significance**

- **Cultural Restoration**: Enables Indigenous individuals to restore their traditional or ancestral names, which are deeply tied to heritage, language, and community identity.
- **Legal Clarity**: Ensures that identity documents accurately reflect the person’s true identity.
- **Access to Services**: Facilitates access to banking, healthcare, education, and travel by aligning official documents with personal identity.
- **Policy Innovation**: Demonstrates a shift from a purely administrative approach to one that recognizes historical trauma and promotes justice.
