**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Certain Taxpayers Remission Order, 2000-3"**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make orders that remit (i.e., forgive or cancel) certain tax liabilities when it is in the public interest.

The specific order, known as the *Certain Taxpayers Remission Order, 2000-3*, was enacted to address a unique and unintended tax consequence arising from the operation of a public service pension scheme in Newfoundland.

**Purpose of the Remission:**

The primary purpose of this order is to **remit (cancel) income tax liabilities** that were improperly assessed against individuals who were members of the **Newfoundland Association of Public Employees (NAPE)**. These individuals paid pension contributions under a flawed system in which they were required to contribute for **non-existent or fictitious employment**.

In other words, these individuals were not actually employed by the public service, yet they were required to pay pension contributions under a pension plan based on a false or non-existent service record. As a result, those contributions were treated as deductible expenses under the *Income Tax Act*, leading to a reduction in taxable income and, consequently, a tax liability that was not justified.

This regulation seeks to correct that error by **remitting** (canceling) the tax that would have been due on the income that was incorrectly reduced due to the deduction of these non-existent contributions.

**Conditions for Relief (Eligibility Criteria):**

To qualify for remission under this order, a taxpayer must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Contributions were made for non-existent service**  
   The individual must have paid pension contributions under section 32 of the *Public Service (Pensions) Act* (R.S.N. 1970, c. 319) — a provision that governs pension contributions for public service employees — but the service for which those contributions were made **did not actually exist**. This means the individual was not employed in a public service position, yet was required to contribute under a pension plan.

2. **Contributions were made prior to 1991**  
   The agreement under which the contributions were made must have been entered into **before January 1, 1991**. This historical cutoff reflects the timing of the policy change or the recognition of the error in the pension scheme.

3. **Contributions were made in accordance with a registered pension plan**  
   The contributions must have been made under a pension plan that was **officially registered** under the relevant pension legislation. This ensures that the contributions were formalized and recognized within the framework of the public pension system, even if the service was non-existent.

4. **Contributions were not previously deducted from income**  
   The taxpayer must demonstrate that the contributions were **not deducted from their taxable income in any prior tax year**. This condition ensures that the tax benefit (i.e., the deduction) was not already claimed and recognized in earlier tax assessments.

5. **Application must be submitted in writing to the Minister of National Revenue before January 1, 2002**  
   The individual must formally apply for relief **in writing** to the Minister of National Revenue **prior to January 1, 2002**. This deadline is critical — applications submitted after this date are not eligible for remission under this order.

**Nature of the Remission:**

The remission applies specifically to **tax amounts payable under the Income Tax Act** that would have been due **if the non-existent contributions had been deductible** under the Act. In essence:

- The tax liability is canceled **only if** the deductions for these non-existent contributions would have reduced taxable income.
- The remission is retroactive to the tax years in which the deductions were claimed (or would have been claimed) based on the erroneous treatment of non-existent service.
- The relief is **not a refund** of tax already paid, but rather a **cancellation of a tax liability** that was improperly imposed due to the invalid deduction.

---

**Legal and Policy Context:**

- The regulation arises from a systemic flaw in the application of the *Public Service (Pensions) Act*, where members of the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees were incorrectly required to contribute for employment that never occurred.
- The government recognized that such deductions were not legitimate under the Income Tax Act and that allowing them to reduce taxable income created an unfair tax advantage for individuals who had no actual service.
- The order reflects a policy decision to correct a historical error and ensure fairness in the tax system by preventing the improper deduction of non-existent pension contributions.

---

**Key Dates and Timelines:**

- **Contributions made**: Prior to 1991  
- **Application deadline**: Before January 1, 2002  
- **Effective date of the order**: Issued in 2000 (as part of the "2000-3" designation), though the eligibility period spans back to pre-1991

---

**Limitations and Scope:**

- This order applies **only to individuals who were members of the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees**.
- It does **not apply** to other public service pension schemes or to individuals who were employed in actual service.
- It is **not a general remission** — it is narrowly tailored to address a specific, identifiable error involving non-existent service and erroneous deductions.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Certain Taxpayers Remission Order, 2000-3* is a targeted and corrective measure designed to ensure fairness in the income tax system by canceling tax liabilities that arose from the improper deduction of pension contributions for non-existent public service. It reflects a recognition of a historical administrative error and provides relief to affected individuals who were not actually employed in public service, but were nonetheless required to pay pension contributions under a flawed pension plan. The order is strictly conditional and requires a written application submitted before a specific deadline, emphasizing its limited and time-bound nature.

This regulation serves as both a corrective and a preventive tool in public administration, reinforcing the principle that tax deductions must be based on legitimate, verifiable service and employment.
