**Detailed Summary of the Timmins Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is formally titled the **Timmins Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. These regulations establish specific zoning and height restrictions around Timmins Airport in the Province of Ontario to ensure aviation safety by controlling the elevation of structures, buildings, and natural features near the airport.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the regulations define several critical terms:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *Timmins Airport*, located within the *City of Timmins*, Province of Ontario.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A designated geographic point used as a baseline for elevation measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 955 feet above sea level** for all purposes under these regulations.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip associated with runways 03–21 and 10–28). This surface ensures that aircraft can safely approach the runway without interference from obstacles. The slope is **1 foot vertically per 50 feet horizontally**. The approach surfaces vary slightly by runway:
  - **Runway 03 (approach)**: Rises to a horizontal line 1,000 feet above the end of the strip, extending 50,000 feet horizontally and ending 8,000 feet from the centerline.
  - **Runways 10, 21, and 28 (approaches)**: Rise to a horizontal line 200 feet above the end of the strip, extending 10,000 feet horizontally and ending 2,000 feet from the centerline.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface that forms a boundary around the entire airport area. It consists of:
  - A **common plane at 150 feet above the ARP (955 feet = 1,105 feet above sea level)**.
  - If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, a **minimum 30-foot buffer above ground** is applied instead.
  - This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any object within the airport's outer boundary.

- **Strip**: The designated landing area (runway and associated taxiways) used for takeoff and landing. Two primary strips are defined:
  - **Runway 03–21**: 1,000 feet wide (500 feet on each side of centerline), 6,500 feet long.
  - **Runway 10–28**: 1,000 feet wide, 5,303 feet long.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the **lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces**, rising at a **1:7 slope (1 foot vertically per 7 feet horizontally)** until it meets either:
  - The outer surface, or
  - The transitional surface of an adjacent strip.

These surfaces serve to prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases, especially in the critical outer zones.

---

### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Timmins Airport**, including public road allowances.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, which provides a detailed legal description (a legal description in surveyor’s terms) of the boundary.
- The regulations **do not apply** to lands that are officially incorporated into the airport infrastructure or used for airport operations.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or build any **building, structure, or object**, or
- Add any **extension or addition** to an existing structure,

on any land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the point of location:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This means that all constructed or existing objects (including towers, trees, antennas, fences, or buildings) must remain **below or at the level** of these defined imaginary surfaces.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**

- If a **natural object** (e.g., tree, bush, hill) growing on regulated land exceeds the height of any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** (Minister) may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

- This provision ensures that even natural features do not pose a hazard to aircraft operations.

> *Note: This section was previously revoked by SOR/81-180, section 1 — however, the current version appears to be a revised or reissued version, possibly reinstated or amended. The inclusion of this clause suggests that it remains in effect as a safety measure.*

---

### **6. Legal and Technical References**

All definitions and boundaries are supported by:
- **Department of Transport Plan No. T2871**, dated **March 1, 1975**.
- This plan visually illustrates:
  - The approach surfaces
  - The outer surface
  - The strips
  - The transitional surfaces

These plans are essential for both compliance and enforcement, providing a visual and spatial reference for landowners, planners, and aviation authorities.

---

### **7. Key Safety Objectives**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- **Maintain clear flight paths** by defining maximum allowable heights around runways and approach zones.
- **Establish a consistent, measurable, and enforceable framework** for land use near the airport.

The use of **imaginary surfaces** (approach, transitional, outer) allows for precise, standardized control over terrain and development, regardless of actual topography.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth.
  - Monitor compliance with the height restrictions.
- Enforcement may involve coordination with local municipalities, landowners, and environmental agencies.

### **9. Summary Table of Key Features**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Airport** | Timmins Airport, City of Timmins, Ontario |
| **Reference Point Elevation** | 955 feet above sea level |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Inclined planes (1:50 slope), varying in length and height depending on runway (03, 10, 21, 28) |
| **Outer Surface** | 150 ft above ARP; capped at 30 ft above ground if below that |
| **Strips** | 03–21: 1,000 ft wide × 6,500 ft long; 10–28: 1,000 ft wide × 5,303 ft long |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | 1:7 slope from strip edges to outer surface or adjacent strip |
| **Applicable Lands** | All lands within the boundary defined in Part II of the Schedule |
| **Prohibited Height Exceedance** | Any structure or object exceeding approach, outer, or transitional surfaces |
| **Natural Growth Rule** | Minister may order removal of overhanging vegetation |
| **Legal Authority** | Based on Department of Transport Plan No. T2871 (March 1, 1975) |

### **Conclusion**

The **Timmins Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive set of spatial and height controls designed to protect aviation safety by limiting the vertical extent of all structures and natural features near the airport. By defining precise imaginary surfaces—approach, outer, and transitional—the regulations create a clear, enforceable boundary that prevents hazards to aircraft during critical flight phases. These rules are legally binding, based on detailed survey descriptions and official plans, and administered by the Minister of Transport. They reflect a standard approach used in many Canadian airports to balance development with public safety.

> ⚠️ **Note on Revocation**: The reference to SOR/81-180, section 1 (which revoked the provision on natural growth) indicates that the current version may be an updated or reissued regulation. In practice, the presence of the natural growth clause suggests either a correction or reinstatement, and its continued inclusion implies it is now active. This should be verified with official current legislation.
