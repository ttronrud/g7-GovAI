**Detailed Summary of the Excise Duties on Vaping Products Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Excise Duties on Vaping Products Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under sections **304a** and **304.3b** of the *Excise Act, 2001* (Act), by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. These regulations establish a comprehensive framework for the imposition of excise duties on vaping products in Canada, with a focus on ensuring fair, transparent, and coordinated taxation across provinces — particularly in the context of a national "coordinated vaping duty system."

The regulations were introduced in **2022** (S.C. 2022, c. 19, s. 101; S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 79; S.C. 2002, c. 22) and are designed to modernize and harmonize excise duty collection on vaping products, which are increasingly recognized as a significant public health and fiscal concern.

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

### **1. "Act" Definition**
- The term **"Act"** refers to the *Excise Act, 2001*, which provides the legal foundation for excise duties and related regulatory mechanisms.

### **2. "Specified Vaping Province"**
For the purposes of certain duties under the Act, the following provinces are designated as **"specified vaping provinces"**:
- Ontario  
- Quebec  
- New Brunswick  
- Manitoba  
- Prince Edward Island  
- Alberta  
- Yukon  
- Northwest Territories  
- Nunavut  

This list defines the geographic scope within which specific excise duties apply to vaping products.

## **Excise Duty Imposition Mechanisms**

### **1. Section 158.58 – Duty on Vaping Products for Consumption in a Specified Vaping Province**
A duty is imposed if:
- The vaping product is **manufactured in Canada** or **imported**, and  
- In the case of **individual imports for personal use**: the individual is a **resident** of a specified vaping province.  
- In all other cases: the product is intended for **consumption, use, or sale to consumers** in a specified vaping province.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that residents of these provinces pay excise duty when vaping products are consumed or sold within their jurisdiction.

---

### **2. Subsection 158.6(2) – Duty on Unstamped Vaping Products in a Specified Vaping Province**
A duty is imposed if:
- The vaping product is **not stamped** (i.e., lacks a required excise marking), and  
- At the time in question, the product is located **within a specified vaping province**.

> **Purpose**: Prevents the unregulated movement or possession of unstamped vaping products in regulated provinces.

---

### **3. Subsection 158.61(2) – Duty on Unaccounted Vaping Products**
A duty is imposed if:
- The product is **not stamped**,  
- The **last known location** of the product before a particular time is in a specified vaping province, and  
- The person in question has **not been convicted** of an offence under section 218.2 of the Act (related to unlawful possession or distribution of vaping products).

> **Purpose**: Addresses lost, misplaced, or unaccounted-for vaping products that may have entered a province without proper documentation or taxation.

---

### **4. Amount of Duty**
- The duty amount under sections 158.58, 158.6(2), and 158.61(2) is **equal to the amount determined in Schedule 8** of the *Excise Act, 2001* — which sets out the base excise duty rates based on product type, nicotine content, and other factors.

> **Note**: This schedule provides a standardized, data-driven method for calculating duties, promoting consistency and transparency.

## **Transition and Implementation: The Coordinated Vaping Duty System**

A key feature of these regulations is the establishment of a **coordinated vaping duty system**, as defined in subsection **304.3(1)** of the Excise Act. This system aims to:
- Prevent tax avoidance through cross-border movement of vaping products,
- Ensure uniformity in excise duty application across provinces,
- Promote fairness and predictability in the tax regime.

### **Exemptions Before October 2024 (for Transition)**

To facilitate a smooth transition to the coordinated system, the following rules **do not apply before October 2024**:

| Exemption Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Manufactured & Stamped Products** | Vaping products manufactured in Canada and stamped **before July 2024** are exempt from certain provisions. |
| **Imported for Stamping by Licensee** | Packaged vaping products imported by a **vaping product licensee** for stamping and stamped before July 2024 are exempt. |
| **Other Imported Products** | Any other imported vaping products that are imported or released (under Customs Act) **before July 2024** are exempt. |

> **Purpose**: Allows time for manufacturers and importers to comply with new stamping and tracking requirements without immediate penalties or enforcement.

---

## **Qualifying Vaping Products (for January 2025 Transition)**

A **"qualifying vaping product"** is defined as a vaping product that:
- Is **not stamped** to show payment of additional provincial excise duty, and  
- Meets **one of the following criteria**:
  1. Manufactured in Canada and **stamped before January 2025**,  
  2. Imported by a **vaping product licensee** for stamping and **stamped before January 2025**, or  
  3. Imported otherwise (not by a licensee) and **imported or released before January 2025**.

> **Purpose**: Defines a transitional category of products that will be treated differently in terms of duty application until full integration into the coordinated system.

## **Joining New Provinces to the Coordinated System (Effective April 2025)**

New Brunswick, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Alberta, and Yukon are being formally integrated into the coordinated vaping duty system. The following rules **do not apply before April 2025** in respect of qualifying vaping products in these provinces:

| Rule | Exemption |
|------|----------|
| **Subsection 158.44(2)** | Does not apply to qualifying products disposed of, sold, offered for sale, purchased, or possessed in any of these provinces. |
| **Paragraph 158.46(d)** | Does not apply to qualifying products entering the duty-paid market in these provinces. |
| **Section 158.58** | Does not apply to:  
- Products imported **before January 2025** by an individual for personal use (if the individual is a resident of the province), or  
- Qualifying products intended for consumption, use, or sale to consumers in those provinces. |
| **Subsection 158.6(2)** | Does not apply if the product is located in one of these provinces **before January 2025**. |
| **Subsection 158.61(2)** | Does not apply if the last known location was in one of these provinces **before January 2025**. |

> **Purpose**: Provides a phased entry into the coordinated system, allowing provinces to adjust their systems, update enforcement, and build capacity without disrupting existing supply chains or consumer access during the transition.

## **Effective Dates and Application Timeline**

| Section | Effective Date |
|--------|----------------|
| **Section 3** (Applies to products stamped or imported after June 2024) | **After June 2024** (immediately upon publication) |
| **Sections 4, 5, and 8** | **July 1, 2024** |
| **Overall Regulations** | Come into force on the day of publication in *Canada Gazette, Part II* (subject to subsections 2 and 3) |

> **Note**: The phased approach ensures that the transition to the coordinated system is gradual, minimizing economic disruption and allowing stakeholders (manufacturers, distributors, retailers, consumers) time to adapt.

---

## **Repeal Note**

- A provision in these regulations was **repealed by SOR/2024-211, s. 2**, indicating ongoing legislative refinement or correction. This suggests the government is reviewing or updating the rules to ensure alignment with evolving public health and fiscal policy goals.

## **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Revenue Generation** | Creates a stable, predictable revenue stream from vaping products, which are now considered a major consumer product. |
| **Public Health Alignment** | Supports public health initiatives by regulating product availability, especially in high-risk populations. |
| **Tax Fairness & Equity** | Prevents tax avoidance by ensuring that all vaping products — whether domestically made or imported — are taxed where they are consumed. |
| **Provincial Coordination** | Establishes a national framework that allows provinces to collaborate on enforcement, data sharing, and policy development. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires products to be stamped, tracked, and accounted for — reducing illicit trade and unregulated sales. |
