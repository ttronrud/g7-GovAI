Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- It is issued under **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which grants the government the authority to make specific adjustments or modifications to land sales or disposals, particularly in relation to land boundaries or inclusion criteria.

**2. Key Provision:**

- Any portion of the lands described in the **schedule attached to this regulation** that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM) of Great Slave Lake** in the **Northwest Territories** shall be **included in the sale** of those lands.

> This provision effectively mandates that all land parcels located within a defined distance (100 feet) of the lake’s normal water level — a critical boundary for flood risk, land use, and legal ownership — are to be treated as part of the sale. This is significant because such areas may be subject to periodic flooding and thus require special consideration in land transactions, planning, or environmental assessments.

**3. Specific Lands Identified:**

- The regulation explicitly refers to **Lots 5, 6, and 7** in **Block 202** of the **City of Yellowknife**, Northwest Territories.
- These lots are defined by reference to a **plan of survey of record number 73513**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.
- A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** at Yellowknife, under reference number **2168**.

> This ensures that the legal description and boundary of the lots are officially recorded and accessible for public and administrative purposes.

**4. Purpose and Implications:**

- The inclusion of land within 100 feet of the Ordinary High Water Mark in the sale:
  - Clarifies ownership boundaries and ensures that no land in a high-risk flood zone is excluded from the transaction.
  - May serve to protect the interests of the Crown or the government in managing land adjacent to natural water bodies.
  - Supports consistency in land administration, especially in regions prone to seasonal flooding like Great Slave Lake.
- The specific identification of Yellowknife lots suggests that this regulation may be part of a larger land disposition, such as a public sale, lease, or transfer of Crown land for development, infrastructure, or resource use.

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance:**

- The regulation is binding under the Territorial Lands Act and will be enforced as part of the official land sale process.
- It reflects a standard practice in northern jurisdictions where water levels and topography significantly influence land use and legal descriptions.
- The reference to the **survey plan of record** and the **Land Titles Office** ensures transparency, legal accuracy, and traceability of land boundaries.

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes that **any land parcels within 100 feet of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Great Slave Lake**, as described in the attached schedule, are to be included in a land sale. It specifically applies to **Lots 5, 6, and 7 in Block 202, Yellowknife**, whose boundaries are defined by a surveyed plan of record. The order is issued under statutory authority and serves to ensure clarity, consistency, and legal integrity in land transactions involving areas near a major water body in the Northwest Territories.

This action supports effective land governance, environmental risk management, and administrative transparency in northern Canada.
