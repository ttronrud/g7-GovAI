### **3. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act*.
- **"Minister"**: Refers to the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** (federal level).
- **"Offshore sales tax"**: Defined as:
  - The tax, interest, penalties, and other amounts payable under **Part II** of the Act.
  - Collected by the **Government of Nova Scotia** on behalf of the **Government of Canada**.
  - As per the **tax administration agreement** referenced in **Section 49** of the Act.

> This definition clarifies that the tax in question is not a direct tax imposed by Nova Scotia, but rather a **shared revenue stream** from offshore oil and gas operations, collected by Nova Scotia and then distributed according to the agreement.

---

### **4. Calculation of Tax Payments**

The regulation establishes a **timely and consistent schedule** for calculating the Nova Scotia share of offshore sales tax:

#### **First Calculation (Initial)**
- Must be completed **on or before the fifth working day after the coming into force** of these regulations.
- This initial calculation must include:
  - All offshore sales tax collected **from June 22, 1984**, up to and including the day of the calculation.

#### **Subsequent Monthly Calculations**
- For every month during which offshore sales tax is collected:
  - A calculation must be made on the **first and fifteenth day** of the month.

> This ensures **regular and transparent monitoring** of revenue collection and allocation.

---

### **5. Adjustments to Calculated Amounts**

- The **Minister** (of Energy, Mines and Resources) has the authority to **make adjustments** to any amount that may be payable or become payable to Nova Scotia under:
  - Subsection 67(2) of the Act
  - Section 3(1) of these Regulations

> This provision allows for **corrections** due to errors, changes in tax assessments, or administrative adjustments, ensuring accuracy in revenue sharing.

---

### **6. Transfer and Payment of Funds**

- Once a calculation is completed (whether initial or monthly):
  - The calculated amount (after any adjustments) must be:
    - **Transferred into the Revenue Fund** on the **first working day after the calculation date**.
    - **Paid to Her Majesty in right of Nova Scotia** on the **same day of transfer**.

> This ensures **prompt and accountable movement** of funds from the provincial revenue system to the federal/national share mechanism.

---

### **7. Handling Overpayments and Underpayments**

A critical component of the regulation is the **mechanism for correcting discrepancies** between the calculated Nova Scotia share and the actual fiscal year share:

#### **Case 1: Overpayment (Calculated amount > Nova Scotia share)**
- If the total of all adjusted monthly payments **exceeds** the Nova Scotia share of offshore sales tax for the fiscal year:
  - The **excess amount must be recovered**.
  - It will be **set off** against a future amount that may be payable or become payable under:
    - Subsection 67(2) of the Act
    - Section 3(1) of these Regulations

> This prevents Nova Scotia from receiving more than its entitled share.

#### **Case 2: Underpayment (Calculated amount < Nova Scotia share)**
- If the total of all adjusted payments is **less than** the Nova Scotia share:
  - The **difference must be transferred and paid** to Her Majesty in right of Nova Scotia.
  - This payment is made **pursuant to subsection 67(1) of the Act**.

> This ensures that Nova Scotia receives its **full entitlement** for the fiscal year.

### **8. Regulatory Citation and Legal Status**

  **Nova Scotia Share of Offshore Sales Tax Payment Regulations**  
  (S.C. 1984, c. 29)
