Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation, which is part of the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GGPRA), specifically focusing on definitions and key provisions related to the **fuel charge system**, **exemptions**, **rebates**, and **specific fuel classifications**.

## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPRA) – Definitions and Fuel Charge System Provisions**

This regulation establishes key definitions and operational rules for the **fuel charge system** under the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GGPRA), particularly concerning the pricing of fossil fuels, the use of renewable alternatives, exemptions for certain activities, and rebate mechanisms for exports or inter-provincial movements.

---

### 📌 1. **Core Definitions**

#### ✅ **Act**
- Refers to the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GGPRA), which sets the framework for carbon pricing in Canada.

---

#### ✅ **Bio-Aviation Fuel**
A renewable fuel used in aviation that must meet the following criteria:
- Derived **entirely from biological matter** (e.g., plants, algae) available on a renewable or recurring basis.
- May contain **up to 1% water** by volume.
- May contain **up to 6% other non-biological substances** (e.g., additives, solvents), provided they are not otherwise specified.
- Must be **suitable for use in aircraft engines** when:
  - Used alone,
  - Blended with aviation gasoline or aviation turbo fuel,
  - Blended with aviation gasoline-like or turbo fuel-like blendstocks to produce those fuels.

> ⚠️ Purpose: Encourages the use of low-carbon aviation fuels to reduce emissions from air travel.

---

#### ✅ **Eligible Greenhouse**
A greenhouse (or structure) used primarily for growing:
- Vegetables, fruits, bedding plants, flowers, ornamental plants,
- Tree seedlings, medicinal plants, or other plants.

> ✅ Must be used for **plant cultivation** and not for industrial or non-agricultural purposes.

---

#### ✅ **Eligible Greenhouse Activity**
The use of **qualifying greenhouse fuel** (natural gas or propane) to:
- Heat an eligible greenhouse, or
- Supplement carbon dioxide levels to enhance plant growth.

> ✅ This activity qualifies for **exemptions or reduced charges** under the fuel charge system.

---

#### ✅ **Eligible Heating Activity**
Use of **light fuel oil exclusively** for:
- Providing heat to homes, buildings, or similar structures.
- **Excludes** use in industrial processes (e.g., drying goods, manufacturing).

> ⚠️ This is a **distinct exemption** from broader fuel charges, protecting residential heating.

---

#### ✅ **Export**
Means **export from Canada** to another country.

> Used in rebate provisions to prevent double-charging for fuels exported outside Canada.

---

#### ✅ **Fuel Charge System**
As defined in subsection 168(1) of the Act — a system that applies a **carbon-based charge** on certain fossil fuels based on their greenhouse gas emissions. The charge varies by fuel type, province, and time.

> Applies to fuels such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, light fuel oil, and natural gas.

---

#### ✅ **Greenhouse Operator**
A person who:
- Operates a business growing plants in eligible greenhouses,
- Has a **reasonable expectation of profit**.

> This is a key eligibility criterion for **exemptions** from fuel charges.

---

#### ✅ **Main Electrical Network**
The national electricity grid governed by the **North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)** standards.

> Used to define **remote communities** — areas not connected to this network.

---

#### ✅ **Qualifying Greenhouse Fuel**
- Marketable natural gas or propane.
> Used exclusively to heat greenhouses or supplement CO₂ for plant growth.

---

#### ✅ **Qualifying Power Plant Fuel**
- Light fuel oil or marketable natural gas.
> Used in **remote power plants** to generate electricity.

---

#### ✅ **Remote Community**
A geographic area that:
- Is **not connected** to the main electrical network,
- Is **not served** by a distribution system.

> These communities are eligible for special fuel pricing or exemptions due to limited infrastructure.

---

#### ✅ **Remote Power Plant**
A power plant that:
- Generates electricity for public distribution,
- Is **not connected** to the main electrical network or distribution system,
- Operates in a **remote community**.

> Subject to specific fuel charge rules and may qualify for lower or exempted rates.

---

#### ✅ **Remote Power Plant Operator**
A person who operates a remote power plant.

---

#### ✅ **Marketable Natural Gas (Modified Definition)**
- Natural gas that meets **pipeline transport and sale standards** for general public distribution.
> Excludes non-marketable gas (e.g., gas not suitable for pipeline transport).

> This definition ensures only commercially viable gas is subject to the charge system.

---

### 📌 2. **Fuel Volume Adjustments (for Reporting Purposes)**

These formulas adjust the **volume of fuel** when it contains renewable or low-carbon components.

---

#### 🔹 **Bio-Aviation Fuel Adjustment**
If a fuel (aviation gasoline or aviation turbo fuel) contains **X% bio-aviation fuel**, the **volume is adjusted** using:

> **Adjusted Volume (litres)** = (Volume at 15°C) × (1 + X%)  
> (Note: The formula implies volume is increased proportionally to the bio-fuel content.)

> Purpose: To reflect the **lower carbon intensity** of bio-fuels and ensure accurate emissions accounting.

---

#### 🔹 **Hydrogen in Natural Gas (Marketable or Non-Marketable)**
If natural gas contains **X% hydrogen**, the **volume is adjusted** to:

> **Adjusted Volume (cubic metres)** = (Volume at 15°C and 101.325 kPa) × (1 + X%)

> Purpose: Hydrogen has a lower carbon footprint; this adjusts volume to reflect reduced emissions.

---

#### 🔹 **Hydrogen + Biomethane Combined (in Natural Gas)**
If natural gas contains a **combined proportion of hydrogen and biomethane (X%)**, the volume is adjusted using the same formula:

> **Adjusted Volume (cubic metres)** = (Volume at 15°C and 101.325 kPa) × (1 + X%)

> Purpose: To account for **combined low-carbon components** in natural gas.

> ✅ This allows for more flexible inclusion of renewable gases in emissions calculations.

---

### 📌 3. **Basic Rate and Interest Calculation**

#### ✅ **Basic Rate (per quarter)**
- Calculated as the **arithmetic mean** of the average equivalent yield (as a percentage per year) of **Government of Canada Treasury Bills** that:
  - Mature approximately 3 months after issuance,
  - Are sold at auction during the **first month of the quarter**.

> Rounded **up to the next whole percentage** if not a whole number.

> Example: If the mean is 2.3%, the basic rate becomes 3%.

---

#### ✅ **Prescribed Interest Rates (for fuel charges)**

| Case | Interest Rate |
|------|----------------|
| Interest paid to Receiver General | Basic rate + 4% |
| Interest paid to individuals (non-corporate) | Basic rate + 2% |
| Interest paid to corporations | Basic rate only |
| All other cases | Basic rate + 4% |

> This structure ensures **fairness and administrative cost recovery** while differentiating treatment between individuals, corporations, and government.
