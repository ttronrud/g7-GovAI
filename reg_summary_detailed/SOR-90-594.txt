## 🔍 Key Definitions and Concepts

The regulations define key terms used throughout the framework to ensure clarity in eligibility, service delivery, and health care classification.

---

### 1. **Core Health Care Service Categories (Types of Health Needs)**

These classifications determine the level of care a veteran or eligible individual may receive:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Type I Health Need** | Personal care and supervision required due to decreased physical or mental faculties, but the individual remains ambulant or independently mobile. <br> → Service provided in a **residential care facility**. |
| **Type II Health Need** | Requires personal care under health professional supervision; the person has a functional disability, has reached recovery limits, and needs minimal diagnostic or therapeutic services. <br> → Service provided in **intermediate care**. |
| **Type III Health Need** | Requires ongoing personal care, diagnostic, nursing, and therapeutic services from health professionals. Applies to chronically ill individuals or those with stable but severe functional disabilities. <br> → Service provided in **chronic care**. |

> These types form the foundation for determining which health care setting (residential, intermediate, or chronic) is appropriate for a client.
