### **Detailed Summary of the Railway Safety Management System Regulations, 2015**

The **Railway Safety Management System Regulations, 2015** (the "Regulations") were made under the authority of the *Railway Safety Act* (R.S., c. 32 (4th Supp.)) by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. These Regulations establish the **minimum requirements** for a railway company to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive **safety management system (SMS)** designed to achieve the **highest level of safety** in its operations.

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of these Regulations is to ensure that all railway companies — whether operating on main tracks or non-main tracks — establish and maintain a robust, proactive, and transparent safety management system that prevents incidents, identifies risks, and continuously improves operational safety.

### **Applicability**
- Applies to **all railway companies** operating in Canada under the *Railway Safety Act*.
- The Regulations are structured into **three main parts**:
  - **Part 1**: General requirements applicable to all railway companies.
  - **Part 2**: Specific requirements for two types of local railway companies:
    - Those operating on **main tracks** (lines where railway equipment movement is authorized).
    - Those operating **exclusively on non-main tracks**.
  - **Part 3**: Consequential amendments, repeals, and enforcement provisions.

> **Note**: For new railway companies beginning operations after the Regulations come into force, certain requirements (Sections 21–23) do not apply until **six months after the start of operations**.

## **3. Core Components of the Safety Management System**

The Regulations require a railway company to develop and implement a safety management system that includes **12 key processes**, each addressing a critical aspect of safety governance.

### **1. Accountability Process**
- A railway company must designate an **accountable executive** — an individual with operational authority and responsibility for the company’s safety performance.
- The accountable executive must:

- The accountable executive must receive **annual reports** from designated persons on:
  - Problems encountered in implementing procedures or plans.
  - Effectiveness of those processes in improving safety.

### **2. Safety Policy**
- A **written safety policy** must be developed and approved by the accountable executive.
- The policy must:
  - Reflect the company’s **commitment to railway safety**.
  - Be reviewed and updated **annually**.
- The policy must be **communicated to all employees** and any changes must also be communicated.
