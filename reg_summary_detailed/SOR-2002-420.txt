**1. Legal Basis and Context:**

- This regulation is issued under **paragraph 4(1)(d)** of the **Employment Equity Act (EEA)**, which empowers the **Treasury Board** to specify certain public sector entities as being "employing one hundred or more employees" for the purposes of the Act.
- The EEA, enacted in 1986, establishes a framework to promote employment equity in Canada by eliminating discrimination and ensuring fair access to employment opportunities for designated groups (such as women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and visible minorities).
- A key requirement under the Act is that **organizations with 100 or more employees** must develop and implement employment equity plans to address underrepresentation in key groups.

**2. Purpose of the Regulation:**

- The primary purpose of this regulation is to **formally recognize the Canadian Forces as a public sector employer** within the scope of the Employment Equity Act.
- Specifically, it confirms that the **Canadian Forces** (which includes the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Navy) are considered a public sector employer **for the purposes of subsection 4(1)** of the EEA.
- This recognition ensures that the Canadian Forces are **subject to the mandatory employment equity obligations** of the Act, including:
  - Conducting a workplace analysis to assess representation of designated groups;
  - Developing and implementing an employment equity plan;
  - Monitoring progress and reporting on outcomes.

**3. Key Provisions:**

- **Definition of "Public Sector"**: The regulation clarifies that the Canadian Forces are part of the public sector as defined in the EEA.
- **Employee Threshold**: The regulation specifies that the Canadian Forces are an organization **employing 100 or more employees**, thus triggering the applicability of the Act.
- **Legal Authority**: The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Treasury Board** and the **Minister of Labour**. This reflects a collaborative process involving key federal departments responsible for employment equity and public sector oversight.

---

**4. Background and Rationale:**

- Prior to this regulation, there was **uncertainty or ambiguity** about whether the Canadian Forces—being a military institution—fell under the jurisdiction of the Employment Equity Act.
- The Canadian Forces, while operating under the authority of the Department of National Defence, are a large employer with a significant workforce (often exceeding 100,000 personnel).
- The consultation process between the **Minister of Labour** and the **Minister of National Defence** ensured that the military’s unique structure, operational needs, and values were taken into account when determining whether the Act should apply.
- The final decision was based on the principle that **public sector employment equity obligations should extend to all federal institutions employing 100 or more people**, regardless of their specific function or branch of government.

---

**5. Implications:**

- **Mandatory Employment Equity Plans**: The Canadian Forces are now required to develop and implement employment equity plans in accordance with the EEA.
- **Workforce Representation Monitoring**: The military must monitor and report on the representation of designated groups (women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, visible minorities) across its workforce.
- **Policy Alignment**: This regulation aligns the Canadian Forces with broader federal employment equity policies and promotes diversity and inclusion within the public service.
- **Accountability and Compliance**: It establishes a formal accountability framework for the military’s human resource practices, subject to review by the Minister of Labour and the Treasury Board.

**6. Date and Citation:**

- The regulation was published in **1995** as **Statutory Instrument 1995, Chapter 44 (S.C. 1995, c. 44)**.
- It is a **secondary legislative instrument** issued under the authority of the Employment Equity Act.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a significant step in extending the scope of employment equity protections to the Canadian Forces. By formally designating the Canadian Forces as a public sector employer with 100 or more employees, it ensures that military personnel and institutions are subject to the same equity obligations as other federal public sector organizations. This supports national goals of diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity in employment, and strengthens the federal government’s commitment to employment equity across all sectors of public service.
