**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Emergency Preparedness Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**

**1. Legal Authority and Source:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), as codified in the *Regulations of the Public Service* (R.S., c. P-34). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the power to transfer control and supervision of specific functions or units within the federal public administration, including those under the Privy Council Office (PCO).

**2. Key Action:**

Effective **November 21, 2024**, the **control and supervision** of the **Emergency Preparedness Secretariat** — a component within the Privy Council Office — is being **transferred** to the **Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (DPS-EP)**.

**3. Scope of the Transfer:**

- The transfer specifically includes **operational, administrative, and supervisory authority** over the Emergency Preparedness Secretariat.
- This means that the DPS-EP will now be responsible for:
  - Strategic planning and policy development related to emergency preparedness.
  - Coordination of national emergency preparedness initiatives.
  - Oversight of emergency response planning, including for natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other crises.
  - The day-to-day management and staffing of the Secretariat.
- The transfer does **not** involve the physical relocation of personnel or assets, but rather a shift in **organizational governance and accountability**.

**4. Rationale and Strategic Objective:**

This transfer reflects a broader government strategy to:
- Improve the **efficiency and effectiveness** of emergency management by consolidating expertise under a single, dedicated department.
- Enhance **inter-agency coordination** and ensure that emergency preparedness functions are aligned with national security, public safety, and crisis response priorities.
- Strengthen the **institutional capacity** of the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to lead and coordinate federal emergency preparedness efforts, including in coordination with provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous communities, and non-governmental partners.

**5. Implications:**

- The **Privy Council Office**, which historically provided high-level policy advice and administrative support to the Government of Canada, will no longer manage emergency preparedness functions directly.
- The **Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** will now assume full responsibility for emergency preparedness, aligning with its mandate to protect Canadians from threats to public safety and security.
- This reorganization may result in improved access to resources, clearer lines of authority, and more direct accountability to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.

**6. Legal and Procedural Background:**

- The transfer is authorized under the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reassignment of public service functions between departments to improve performance and service delivery.
- The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, is the formal body responsible for implementing such transfers, ensuring that they are in the public interest and consistent with constitutional and administrative principles.

**7. Effective Date:**

The transfer takes effect on **November 21, 2024**, meaning all administrative, policy, and operational responsibilities related to the Emergency Preparedness Secretariat will be formally transferred to the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness from that date onward.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant organizational realignment within the Canadian federal government. By transferring the Emergency Preparedness Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the government aims to strengthen national emergency preparedness through centralized, specialized leadership. The move enhances coordination, accountability, and responsiveness in the face of evolving public safety challenges.
