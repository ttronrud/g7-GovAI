The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *SOR/2017-84, section 1* (Statutory Instrument 2017-84)
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect upon the publication of SOR/2017-84, which was issued on **April 18, 2017**.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The specific regulation being referenced is no longer in force. It was previously a provision (likely a rule or directive) under a broader regulatory framework, but it was formally canceled by the government as part of a regulatory review or consolidation effort.

### What Does "Repealed" Mean?
Repeal means that the regulation is **no longer legally valid or enforceable**. Any legal or administrative obligations previously derived from it are nullified. This can occur for several reasons, including:
- Outdated content
- Obsolescence due to changes in law or policy
- Merger or consolidation of regulations
- Inconsistency with current legislation
- Legislative simplification or modernization

### Context of SOR/2017-84
SOR/2017-84 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued under the authority of the Canadian government (typically by a federal department or agency). It typically contains amendments, corrections, or repeals of existing regulations. In this case, **section 1** of that instrument explicitly repeals a prior regulation — likely one related to workplace safety, environmental standards, or another sector — depending on the original context.

### Important Note:
Since the original regulation is not specified (only listed as "repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1"), **a detailed summary of its content cannot be provided** without knowing the original regulation it replaced. For example:
- Was it a workplace safety rule?
- A health or environmental standard?
- A licensing or reporting requirement?

To reconstruct the original intent or content, one would need to consult the **prior regulation that was repealed** — which may have been published in earlier statutory instruments or in a federal act (e.g., the *Occupational Health and Safety Act*, *Environmental Protection Act*, etc.).

### Conclusion:
The provided text indicates that a regulation was **formally canceled** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. However, **no substantive content of the repealed regulation is available** in the provided information. As a result, while we can confirm the **status** (repealed) and the **legal mechanism** (SOR/2017-84, s. 1), we **cannot offer a detailed summary of the original regulation’s provisions, purpose, or scope** without additional context or access to the prior regulation.

🔍 **Recommendation**: To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, consult:
- The full text of the prior regulation (e.g., through the *Canada Gazette*, *Federal Register*, or the *Government of Canada's legislation database*)
- The official summary or explanatory notes accompanying SOR/2017-84
- The relevant enabling statute (e.g., the *Occupational Health and Safety Act*, *Canada Labour Code*, etc.)

In short: **The regulation is repealed and no longer in force. A detailed summary of its content is not available from the provided information.**
