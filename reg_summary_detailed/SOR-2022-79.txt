**Detailed Summary of the Canada Post Corporation Pension Plan Funding Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The Canada Post Corporation Pension Plan Funding Regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This action is grounded in specific provisions of the **Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (the "Act")**:

- **Paragraph 39(1)(h.2)a** of the Act authorizes the Governor General in Council to make regulations concerning the funding of defined benefit pension plans.
- **Paragraph 39(1)(o)** provides authority to regulate the solvency and funding requirements of pension plans under the Act.

These regulations are formally published in **Statutes Canada (S.C. 2010, c. 12, s. 1820(2))** and are referenced in the **Regulations Statutes (R.S., c. 42 (2nd Supp.))**.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **specifically to the Canada Post Corporation’s defined benefit pension plan**. The plan is recognized under the Act by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions**, who has issued a **Certificate of Registration No. 57136**.

This means the regulations govern the **funding, solvency, and reporting obligations** of this particular pension plan, ensuring it meets minimum standards set by the Pension Benefits Standards Act.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations establish the following definitions for clarity and consistency:

- **1985 Regulations**: Refers to the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985* (Règlement de 1985), which form the foundational regulatory framework for pension plan solvency and funding.
- **Act**: Refers to the *Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985* (Loi), the primary legislation governing pension plan standards in Canada.
- **Solvency Special Payment**: A special payment required under **paragraphs 9(4)(c) or (d)** of the 1985 Regulations. These payments are triggered when a pension plan falls below a required solvency ratio and must make up for a shortfall in its funded status.

### **4. Key Provisions and Exceptions**

#### **(a) No Solvency Special Payment Required Post-Regulation Implementation**

Despite the general requirement under **paragraphs 9(4)(c) and (d)** of the 1985 Regulations (which would normally require a solvency special payment when a plan is underfunded), **these regulations explicitly exempt the Canada Post Corporation plan from such a requirement** for any **plan year ending after the coming into force of these regulations**.

👉 This means that **no solvency special payment is required** for plan years starting after the regulations take effect, even if the plan is underfunded. This provides a **temporary relief or exemption** to prevent financial strain on Canada Post during a transitional period.

#### **(b) Prescribed Solvency Ratio Level**

Under **subsections 9.3(1) and (3)** of the 1985 Regulations, a minimum solvency ratio is typically required to ensure plan financial stability. However, these regulations **override** that requirement by prescribing a **solvency ratio level of 1.05** for the purposes of **paragraphs 10.1(2)(c) and (d)** of the Act.

👉 This means that the plan must maintain a **minimum funded ratio of 1.05** (i.e., 105% of the plan’s pension liabilities) to be considered solvent under these regulations. This is a **higher standard** than the default level and reflects a stricter solvency requirement for this specific plan.

> *Note: The 1.05 ratio is a key financial benchmark that ensures the plan is adequately funded relative to its obligations.*

### **5. Additional Reporting Requirements**

These regulations **require additional information** to be reported to the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, beyond what is already mandated under the 1985 Regulations. Specifically, for the purposes of **subparagraphs 28(1)(b)(iv) and (b.1)(ii)** of the Act, the following must be disclosed:

1. **The amount of the plan’s solvency deficiency** as shown in the **most recent actuarial report** filed with the Superintendent.
   - This identifies how far the plan falls short of the required solvency ratio (e.g., if the ratio is 0.95, the deficiency is 5%).

2. **The amount of any payments required** to be made for the plan year covered by the statement.
   - This includes contributions or adjustments made to meet funding obligations.

3. **The amount of any solvency special payments that would have been required** for the plan year **but for the operation of Section 3 of the Act**.
   - Section 3 likely provides an exemption or deferral mechanism from certain obligations (e.g., payment of special solvency payments).
   - This provision ensures transparency about the financial impact of such exemptions.

👉 These reporting requirements enhance **accountability and transparency**, allowing regulators to monitor the plan’s financial health and the effectiveness of the funding measures.

---

### **6. Effective Date and Sunset Clause**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** (i.e., the date of publication in the Canada Gazette).
- **Sunset Clause**: The regulations **cease to have effect on December 31, 2024**.

👉 This means the rules are **temporary** and will be automatically revoked after one year (from the date of registration), unless extended or replaced by new legislation.

> This sunset provision reflects a **temporary, transitional nature** of the regulations—intended to address a specific financial or operational issue in Canada Post’s pension plan without creating a long-term structural change.

---

### **7. Purpose and Implications**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure the financial stability** of the Canada Post Corporation pension plan.
- To **provide a temporary exemption** from solvency special payments, allowing the organization time to adjust its funding strategy.
- To **raise the solvency ratio standard** to 1.05, reinforcing the plan’s long-term sustainability.
- To **improve transparency** through detailed reporting of deficiencies, required payments, and hypothetical solvency payments.

These measures are likely intended to:

- Prevent sudden financial shocks to Canada Post due to mandatory special payments.
- Align the plan with stronger solvency standards in a more stable financial environment.
- Support long-term pension sustainability while allowing for phased adjustments.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Canada Post Corporation Pension Plan Funding Regulations** represent a **targeted, temporary intervention** under the Pension Benefits Standards Act to stabilize and strengthen the funding of a specific defined benefit pension plan. By:

- Exempting the plan from solvency special payments after implementation,
- Setting a higher solvency ratio of 1.05,
- Mandating detailed reporting on deficiencies and hypothetical payments,

the regulations ensure greater financial resilience and transparency. However, their **temporary nature (ending December 31, 2024)** indicates that they are not intended as a permanent solution, but rather as a transitional measure to support the plan’s long-term viability.

These regulations underscore the balance between regulatory oversight and practical financial management in public sector pension plans.
