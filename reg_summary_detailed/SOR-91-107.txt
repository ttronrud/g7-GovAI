**Detailed Summary of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, officially titled the *Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Privileges and Immunities Order*, is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act*. It grants specific legal privileges and immunities to the **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)** and its associated personnel when operating in Canada.

The Order was made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, pursuant to **Section 4** of the Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act. This provision empowers the federal government to establish rules governing the privileges and immunities of international organizations that have formal agreements with Canada.

The Order may be cited as the *Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Privileges and Immunities Order*.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

The regulation establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the *Agreement on Privileges and Immunities between Canada and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development* (commonly referred to as the "Accord"). This is the bilateral treaty that governs the specific privileges and immunities granted to the OECD in Canada.

- **Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* (the "Convention"). This is a multilateral treaty that sets out standard privileges and immunities for international organizations like the UN. The OECD Order draws upon this established framework, adapting it to the OECD’s specific context.

- **Organization**: Refers to the **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**, the international organization established to promote policies that will improve the economic well-being and quality of life for people around the world.

### **Legal and Operational Scope of the Order**

The Order grants different levels of privileges and immunities to various actors associated with the OECD, based on their role and as defined in the Agreement. These privileges are granted **to the extent provided in the relevant sections of the Agreement**, meaning that the extent and applicability of the immunities are not absolute but are limited by the terms of the bilateral accord.

#### 1. **The OECD as a Legal Entity in Canada**

- The OECD shall have in Canada the **legal capacity of a body corporate**. This means the Organization can:
  - Enter into contracts,
  - Own property,
  - Sue and be sued,
  - Hold legal rights and obligations in Canadian law,
  - Function as a distinct legal entity recognized under Canadian law.

- To the extent provided in **Section II of the Agreement**, the OECD shall also enjoy the **privileges and immunities** set out in **Articles II and III of the United Nations Convention**.

  - **Article II of the Convention** typically grants immunity from jurisdiction (i.e., Canadian courts cannot issue warrants or orders to interfere with the Organization’s operations or property) and protection of its property and documents.
  - **Article III** provides immunity from taxation and from the enforcement of civil or criminal liability in respect of acts performed in the course of its official duties.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that the OECD can operate effectively in Canada without undue interference from Canadian authorities, while maintaining accountability through established legal mechanisms.

#### 2. **Representatives of Member States and Governments**

- Representatives of **member states and their governments** (such as ambassadors, envoys, or government officials attending OECD meetings) shall have, to the extent provided in **Section III of the Agreement**, the **privileges and immunities** set out in **Article IV of the Convention**.

  - **Article IV of the Convention** provides immunity from:
    - Jurisdiction (protection from being sued or arrested in Canada),
    - Service of process (warrants or legal documents cannot be served on them),
    - Taxation,
    - Civil and criminal liability arising from official duties.

> **Purpose**: This protects state representatives from being targeted by Canadian legal or financial systems while performing official duties related to OECD activities, ensuring diplomatic neutrality and effective international cooperation.

#### 3. **Officials of the OECD**

- **Officials** of the OECD (such as staff members, administrators, and technical personnel) shall have, to the extent provided in **Section IV of the Agreement**, the **privileges and immunities** set out in **Article V of the Convention**.

  - **Article V** grants immunity from:
    - Civil and criminal jurisdiction (in Canada),
    - Service of process,
    - Taxation,
    - Interference with official duties or communications.

> **Purpose**: This enables OECD staff to perform their duties without fear of legal action or interference in Canada, particularly during official visits, meetings, or investigations.

#### 4. **Experts Performing Missions for the OECD**

- Experts (such as consultants, researchers, or technical advisors) who are engaged on temporary missions for the OECD shall have, to the extent provided in **Section V of the Agreement**, the **privileges and immunities** set out in **Article VI of the Convention**.

  - **Article VI** provides limited immunities:
    - Immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts performed in the course of their mission,
    - Immunity from service of process,
    - Protection from interference with their work,
    - Protection of their personal documents and communications.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that temporary experts can conduct their work without disruption, while still being subject to certain limitations (e.g., immunity is not absolute and may be limited to acts directly related to their mission).

### **Key Legal Principles Underlying the Order**

- **Limitation by Agreement**: The immunities granted are not automatic or universal. They are **conditional and limited** by the specific provisions of the Agreement between Canada and the OECD. This ensures that Canada retains control over the scope and application of these privileges.

- **Alignment with International Standards**: The Order aligns the OECD’s privileges and immunities with those of the United Nations Convention, ensuring consistency with international norms and facilitating cooperation with other international bodies.

- **Balance of Rights and Responsibilities**: While immunities are granted to protect the independence and effectiveness of international organizations, they are not absolute. Canadian laws still apply to individuals and entities in certain circumstances (e.g., personal misconduct, criminal acts unrelated to official duties).

- **Jurisdictional Protection**: The Order ensures that the OECD and its personnel are protected from:
  - Being sued in Canadian courts,
  - Being subject to Canadian taxation,
  - Having their property or documents seized or searched without proper legal process.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Facilitates International Cooperation**: By granting formal legal status and immunities, Canada enables the OECD to operate efficiently in its work on economic policy, data sharing, and global standards.

- **Supports Diplomatic and Policy Engagement**: The privileges allow OECD representatives and officials to engage with Canadian institutions, conduct research, and participate in policy discussions without fear of legal repercussions.

- **Legal Clarity and Predictability**: The Order provides a clear, structured framework for how the OECD and its personnel are treated under Canadian law, reducing ambiguity and legal risks for both Canadian authorities and international actors.

- **Compliance with International Obligations**: Canada fulfills its international obligations under multilateral agreements and the principle of non-interference in the operations of international organizations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Privileges and Immunities Order* establishes a formal, legally binding framework that grants the OECD and its associated personnel specific rights and protections in Canada. These privileges are derived from the bilateral Agreement and aligned with international standards set out in the United Nations Convention. The Order ensures that the OECD can function effectively in Canada while maintaining the balance between international cooperation and Canadian legal sovereignty.

Importantly, the immunities are **not absolute** and are strictly limited to acts performed in the course of official duties, as defined in the Agreement. This reflects a careful balance between enabling international collaboration and preserving Canadian legal authority and accountability.
