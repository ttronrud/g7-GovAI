**Detailed Summary of the Ferry-Boats, Tankers and Cargo Vessels Remission Order, 2010**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The *Ferry-Boats, Tankers and Cargo Vessels Remission Order, 2010* is issued under the authority of **section 115a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to grant remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of customs duties for specific types of vessels.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)  
  - S.C. 1997, c. 36  
  These legislative provisions provide the legal framework for the imposition and modification of customs duties and authorize the government to make remission orders for certain goods, including vessels.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **grant remission of customs duties** for specific **tankers and cargo vessels** that are imported into Canada, under certain conditions. This measure aims to:
- Support the development of Canada’s maritime and freight transport infrastructure.
- Encourage investment in key transportation assets by reducing the financial burden of importing large vessels.
- Promote economic activity in sectors such as energy, logistics, and intermodal freight.

### **3. Definitions**

#### a) **Cargo Vessel**
- Defined as a vessel classified under **tariff item No. 8901.90.91 or 8901.90.99** in the *List of Tariff Provisions* (attached to the Customs Tariff).
- Includes the following types:
  - Freighters  
  - Container vessels  
  - Self-unloaders  
  - Car carriers  
  - Bulk carriers  
- **Excludes**:
  - Barges  
  - Pusher vessels (used to push barges)

> *Note*: This definition ensures that only specific types of commercial freight vessels are eligible, excluding smaller or non-commercial watercraft.

#### b) **Imported into Canada**
- Means the **permanent importation** of a tanker or cargo vessel into Canada for the **first time**.
- Does **not apply** to:
  - Vessels produced in Canada that have been exported and then re-imported.

> *Key point*: The remission applies only to first-time, permanent imports. Re-importation of previously exported Canadian-built vessels is excluded.

### **4. Scope of Remission**

The Order grants **remission of customs duties** for:
- **Tankers** classified under **subheading 8901.20** in the List of Tariff Provisions.
- **Cargo vessels** classified under **tariff items 8901.90.91 or 8901.90.99**.

> This means that when these vessels are first imported into Canada, the importer is exempt from paying the full customs duty that would otherwise be levied under the Customs Tariff.

---

### **5. Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for the remission, the following **three conditions** must be met:

1. **Date of Importation**  
   The tanker or cargo vessel must have been **imported into Canada on or after January 1, 2010**.  
   → This establishes a time-bound eligibility window, ensuring the policy applies to modern vessels and not retroactively to older imports.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   The importer must **submit a claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** within **two years** of the date of importation.  
   → This creates a strict deadline to ensure timely administrative processing and compliance.

3. **Submission of Required Evidence**  
   The importer must **file all evidence requested** by the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** to verify eligibility.  
   → This requirement ensures that the remission is granted only when the vessel meets the defined criteria (e.g., correct classification, first-time import, etc.).

> *Note*: The CBSA is responsible for verifying the authenticity and accuracy of the claim, and the importer bears the responsibility of providing documentation such as:
> - Import declaration forms
> - Vessel classification certificates
> - Proof of first-time import
> - Evidence of compliance with tariff classification

---

### **6. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).  
→ This means it becomes legally effective immediately upon registration, allowing importers to begin claiming remission for vessels imported on or after January 1, 2010.

### **7. Key Implications and Observations**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Targeted Relief** | Applies only to specific vessel types and classifications, avoiding broad or indiscriminate duty relief. |
| **First-Time Import Focus** | Prevents abuse of the remission by allowing only one-time, permanent entry into Canada. |
| **Time Limit (2 Years)** | Encourages prompt action by importers and reduces administrative burden on the government. |
| **Evidence-Based Verification** | Ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with customs regulations. |
| **Exclusion of Barges and Re-Exports** | Maintains the integrity of the tariff system by excluding non-eligible or non-permanent imports. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Ferry-Boats, Tankers and Cargo Vessels Remission Order, 2010* is a targeted, time-limited, and evidence-based regulatory measure designed to support the importation of critical maritime infrastructure into Canada. By exempting eligible tankers and cargo vessels from customs duties upon first permanent importation (on or after January 1, 2010), the Order promotes investment in Canada’s transportation and energy sectors while maintaining compliance with customs and tariff regulations.

Importers must ensure that:
- The vessel qualifies under the defined classification,
- The import date is within the specified timeframe,
- A claim is filed within two years of importation,
- All required documentation is submitted to the CBSA.

This Order reflects a balance between economic incentives and regulatory oversight, serving both industry needs and public fiscal responsibility.
