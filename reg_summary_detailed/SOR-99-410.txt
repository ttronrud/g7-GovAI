**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Award Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 31)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Award Regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**, pursuant to **Section 8 of the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Act**.  

This regulation establishes the specific criteria and conditions under which individuals may be eligible to receive the **Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal (CPSM)**. It provides a clear, formal framework for determining who qualifies for the medal, ensuring consistency and fairness in the recognition of peacekeeping service.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Medal"** refers to the **Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal**, as defined in **Section 3 of the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Act**.  
  This medal is awarded to Canadian citizens who have participated in peacekeeping operations abroad, recognizing their service in maintaining international peace and security.

---

### **3. Eligibility Criteria for Award**
An individual is **qualified to receive the medal** if they have completed a **cumulative total of at least 30 days of peacekeeping service** since **1948**, as defined in **subsection 4(1)** of the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Act.

- The 30-day threshold is **cumulative**, meaning that service from multiple operations or assignments can be added together to meet the requirement.
- The service must have been rendered **in a peacekeeping operation** authorized by the United Nations or other international bodies.
- The service must have occurred **on or after 1948**, reflecting the historical start of Canada’s formal peacekeeping involvement.

---

### **4. Exclusions from Eligibility**
Certain individuals are **excluded from entitlement** to the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal, regardless of their service duration. These exclusions include:

- **Veterans of the Korean War (1950–1953)**  
  Individuals who served in the Korean War are not eligible for the medal under these regulations.

- **Veterans of the Gulf and Kuwait War (1990–1991)**  
  Those who participated in the military operations during the Gulf War (including the liberation of Kuwait) are excluded.

- **Veterans of future wars in which Canada participates**  
  This clause is forward-looking and indicates that individuals who serve in future peacekeeping missions (or wars) will **not** be eligible for the medal under this regulation. This may be interpreted as a policy decision to prevent overlap or duplication of recognition for service in future conflicts, particularly if such service is not considered peacekeeping in the traditional sense.

> **Note**: The exclusion of veterans of the Korean and Gulf Wars suggests that these operations were not considered eligible under the original intent of the medal, possibly due to their nature (e.g., combat roles or limited peacekeeping characteristics). The exclusion of future war participants may reflect a policy to limit the medal to **non-combat, peacekeeping operations**.

---

### **5. Effective Date**
These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures legal enforceability and provides a clear timeline for implementation.

---

### **Key Implications and Interpretations**

- **Focus on Peacekeeping, Not Combat**: The regulations emphasize service in **peacekeeping operations**, distinguishing it from combat or military intervention roles. This aligns with Canada’s international peacekeeping mission and values.
  
- **Historical Context**: The 1948 baseline reflects the beginning of Canada’s formal peacekeeping role, which began with participation in UN peacekeeping efforts after World War II.

- **Exclusion Policy**: The exclusions are significant and may be viewed as a way to:
  - Avoid recognizing service in operations that were not officially classified as peacekeeping.
  - Prevent overlap with other military honors (e.g., the Canadian Armed Forces' service medals).
  - Maintain the medal’s prestige and relevance to non-combat, diplomatic, and stabilization roles.

- **Cumulative Service Requirement**: The 30-day threshold allows for recognition of individuals who may have served in multiple short-term missions, ensuring that long-term or intermittent participation is acknowledged.

---

### **Conclusion**
The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Award Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 31) provide a structured, transparent, and historically grounded framework for awarding the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal. They define eligibility based on cumulative peacekeeping service since 1948, while explicitly excluding veterans of the Korean and Gulf Wars—likely due to operational nature or classification—and future wars, reinforcing the medal’s focus on non-combat, international peacekeeping efforts.

These regulations ensure that the medal remains a meaningful and appropriate recognition of Canada’s contributions to global peace and stability through non-combat, diplomatic, and humanitarian missions.
