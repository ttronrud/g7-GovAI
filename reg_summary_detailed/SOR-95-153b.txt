The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-252, s. 3]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or set of regulations) was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Regulation SOR/2017-252, section 3**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**. This means it is no longer in force and has been formally removed from the legal framework.
  
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2017-252**, which stands for *Supplemental Regulation 2017-252*. This is a regulatory document issued by the Government of Canada (typically under a specific ministry or department).

- **Section Repealed**: Section 3 of SOR/2017-252 specifically contains the provision that repeals the original regulation. This means that the regulation previously governed by that section is now **no longer applicable**.

- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions that were established under the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**. Entities that were previously subject to it must now comply with any current, active regulations that may have replaced it or apply in its place.

- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2017-252, which is typically published in the *Canada Gazette* and is generally effective upon publication. The exact date is not provided in the input, but it would be found in the official text of SOR/2017-252.

- **Context**: While the specific content of the original regulation is not provided in the input, the repealing section (s. 3) likely addressed a rule related to a sector such as environmental protection, workplace safety, licensing, or financial regulation—common areas where such repeals occur. Without the original text, the precise subject matter cannot be determined.
