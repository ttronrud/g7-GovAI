**Detailed Summary of the *Accessible Transportation Planning and Reporting Regulations* (S.C. 2019, c. 10)**  
*Approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, November 3, 2021*  
*Pursuant to Section 63 of the Accessible Canada Act*

---

### **Overview**

The *Accessible Transportation Planning and Reporting Regulations* are a set of detailed rules established by the **Canadian Transportation Agency (Agency)** under **Section 63 of the Accessible Canada Act (Act)**. These regulations implement the federal government’s commitment to ensuring that transportation services in Canada are accessible to all persons, including those with disabilities.

The primary goal of these regulations is to **require regulated transport entities to develop, publish, and maintain accessibility plans and progress reports**, establish clear feedback mechanisms, and ensure that all materials are accessible in multiple formats—especially for people with disabilities.

These regulations apply specifically to **transport entities** that are required to comply with accessibility provisions under the *Canada Transportation Act*, particularly those under **subsection 170(1)**.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Accessible Canada Act* |
| **Agency** | The *Canadian Transportation Agency* |
| **Average number of employees** | Calculated as the sum of the highest number of employees in each month of a calendar year, divided by 12, rounded to the nearest whole number (rounded up if equidistant). |
| **Employee** | A person employed by a regulated entity, including dependent contractors under the *Canada Labour Code*, **excluding**: (a) students in employment programs; (b) students employed only during vacations. |
| **Regulated transport entity** | A transport entity for which a "day fixed" has been established under Section 3 of the Act. |
| **Transport entity** | Any entity or individual belonging to one of the classes defined under subsection 2(1) of the Act. |
| **WCAG** | The *Web Content Accessibility Guidelines*, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), as amended over time. Compliance is required at **Level AA**. |

> **Important Note**: If a document is available in both official languages (English and French), any amendment is only incorporated when it is available in **both languages**.

## **Classification of Transport Entities**

Entities are categorized into **four classes (Class 1 to Class 4)** based on their **average number of employees** in a given calendar year and their obligations under the Act.

| Class | Criteria | Key Obligations |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Class 1** | Entities in paragraphs 7(1)(a)–(c) of the Act, required to comply with regulations under subsection 170(1) of the Canada Transportation Act. | Most comprehensive obligations. Required to publish accessibility plans and progress reports annually. |
| **Class 2** | Entities in 7(1)(e) or (f) with **100 or more employees**. | Same as Class 1, but with a later publication date for certain documents. |
| **Class 3** | Entities in 7(1)(e) or (f) with **10 to 99 employees**. | Less frequent reporting; progress reports due by June 1. |
| **Class 4** | Entities in 7(1)(e) or (f) with **fewer than 10 employees**. | Minimal obligations; subject to transition rules. |

### **Key Transition Rule (Class Movement)**

- If a transport entity’s average number of employees **decreases** such that it moves from a higher class to a lower one (e.g., from Class 2 to Class 3), it is **deemed to have always belonged** to the lower class.
- This means it **retains the obligations** of the lower class going forward — even if it was previously in a higher class.

> **Exception**: Despite this rule, if a transport entity **published an accessibility plan as a member of a particular class**, it **must fulfill its feedback and progress reporting obligations as if it had remained in that class**.

## **"Day Fixed" – Key Dates for Compliance**

The "day fixed" is a reference point used to determine when accessibility plans and progress reports must be published. It varies by class:

| Class | Day Fixed |
|------|----------|
| **Class 1** | December 31, 2021 |
| **Class 2** | June 1, 2022 |
| **Class 3** | June 1, 2023 |

> **For entities qualifying on or after January 1, 2022**:
>
> - If an entity **qualified as Class 4** in the prior year:  
>   → The "day fixed" is **June 1 of the year after the year it became Class 4**.
> - If an entity **did not qualify as Class 4** in the prior year:  
>   → The "day fixed" is **June 1 of the year after the year it became Class 1, 2, or 3**.

> Example:  
> An entity that was Class 4 in 2021 would have its day fixed on **June 1, 2023** (i.e., one year after 2022).  
> An entity that became Class 3 in 2022 would have its day fixed on **June 1, 2023**.
