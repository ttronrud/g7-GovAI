**Detailed Summary of the Minister of Agriculture Authority to Prescribe Fees Order**

**Title:**  
Minister of Agriculture Authority to Prescribe Fees Order

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *Minister of Agriculture Authority to Prescribe Fees Order*.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to grant the Minister of Agriculture the statutory authority to establish, modify, or revoke fees associated with specific agricultural inspection and testing services provided by Her Majesty’s Government in Canada. The fees are not arbitrary but are intended to cover the administrative, operational, and technical costs of delivering these services.

The regulation applies specifically to two key services:

1. **Inspection of Milk Production in Dairy Cattle and Dairy Goats**  
   This includes the official inspection and evaluation of milk production practices and outputs from dairy cattle and dairy goats. Such inspections may be conducted to ensure compliance with food safety, animal health, and quality standards, and may serve regulatory, export, or quality assurance purposes.

2. **Performance Testing of Beef Cattle, Sheep, and Swine**  
   This involves the evaluation of livestock performance metrics—such as growth rate, feed efficiency, weight gain, or reproductive performance—conducted to assess the health, productivity, and genetic quality of beef cattle, sheep, and swine. These tests are often used for breeding decisions, industry benchmarking, or export certification.

**Key Provisions:**

- **Authority to Prescribe Fees:**  
  The Minister of Agriculture is explicitly authorized to issue orders that establish the fees to be charged for the above-mentioned services. This includes setting:
  - Base fees
  - Tiered or variable fees based on the scale of service or volume of animals inspected/tested
  - Fees for specific types of inspections or tests (e.g., routine vs. special or emergency testing)

- **Applicability:**  
  The fees apply to services provided by Her Majesty’s Government (i.e., federal government agencies under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture) and are not limited to specific provinces or regions, though implementation may vary by jurisdiction.

- **Funding and Accountability:**  
  The fees collected are intended to fund the operational costs of the inspection and testing programs. The Minister may, in consultation with relevant departments and stakeholders, ensure that fee structures are transparent, equitable, and proportionate to the cost of providing the service.

- **Review and Amendment:**  
  The Minister may revise or adjust fees periodically, subject to established procedures, including consultation with stakeholders such as farmers, industry representatives, and regulatory bodies. Any changes must be justified and published to ensure public awareness and accountability.

- **Legal Basis:**  
  This authority is derived from relevant federal statutes (e.g., the *Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Act* or similar enabling legislation), which empower the Minister to regulate fees for government services related to agricultural oversight and animal health.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Supports Regulatory Integrity:**  
  Fees ensure that government inspections and performance testing are financially sustainable, allowing for consistent and reliable monitoring of animal health and food safety.

- **Promotes Fairness and Transparency:**  
  By allowing the Minister to set fees, the regulation provides a mechanism to ensure that fees are not arbitrary and are aligned with actual costs and service delivery.

- **Encourages Industry Participation:**  
  Clear and predictable fee structures help farmers and ranchers plan for costs and participate in government-supported programs such as quality assurance, export readiness, or breeding improvement.

- **Enables International Trade Compliance:**  
  Performance testing and inspection data are often required for export markets. Fees help maintain the quality and consistency of these services, which are critical for meeting international standards.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Minister of Agriculture Authority to Prescribe Fees Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that enables the federal government to maintain a financially viable and effective system for inspecting milk production and testing livestock performance. By granting the Minister the power to prescribe fees, the regulation ensures that essential agricultural oversight services can be delivered efficiently and in accordance with national and international standards. It balances fiscal responsibility with the need to support sustainable, safe, and high-quality agricultural production in Canada.
