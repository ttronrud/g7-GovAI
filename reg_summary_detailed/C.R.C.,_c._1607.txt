The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled and no longer in force).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Instrument) published in 2017.
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was issued under the authority of the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on the jurisdiction—though the specific jurisdiction is not indicated here). SORs are typically used in Canadian provincial legislation, so this likely refers to a provincial regulation.
- **Content of the Repeal**: The repeated references to "SOR/2017-84, s. 1" suggest that **Section 1 of the Statutory Instrument 2017-84** specifically identifies and removes (repeals) the regulation previously in effect. While the original regulation is not provided, the repeal implies that it was a prior rule or bylaw that had governed certain matters—possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures—before being replaced or withdrawn.
- **Reason for Repeal**: Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, regulations are often repealed for reasons such as:
  - Obsolescence (outdated or no longer relevant)
  - Merger into a broader or updated regulation
  - Inconsistency with current laws
  - Replacement by a more effective or comprehensive rule
  - Administrative simplification

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation is not included in the input, **no substantive details** (such as the subject matter, scope, or provisions) of the repealed regulation can be provided.
- The repeated entries are likely a formatting or data duplication error, as the same information is listed eight times—this does not add new information but emphasizes the repealing action.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force** and was **officially repealed by SOR/2017-84, section 1**. Without the original text of the regulation, a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or application cannot be provided. To understand the original regulation’s scope, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory notes in SOR/2017-84.

For accurate and complete information, users are advised to refer to the **official government database** (e.g., Canada’s legislation website or the provincial legislative register) where SOR/2017-84 is published.
