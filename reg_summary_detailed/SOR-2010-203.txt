**Detailed Summary of the "Certain Ships Remission Order, 2010"**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis**  
This regulation is issued under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended), which authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to grant remission (i.e., a partial or full refund) of customs duties that have already been paid on certain goods or vessels. The power is exercised in accordance with the legislative framework established in the *Customs Tariff*, specifically under provisions related to remission of duties for specific categories of imports, particularly those with public interest or strategic importance.

The regulation is formally referenced in:
- **S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)** – This section provides the legal basis for the remission of duties in specific cases, including for certain vessels.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – A foundational statute that supports the authority of the Minister of Finance and the Governor in Council to issue remission orders.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this *Certain Ships Remission Order, 2010* is to **grant a refund of customs duties** that were previously paid on specific vessels. These vessels are considered critical to transportation infrastructure, public service, or regional economic development, and their operation supports essential services such as interprovincial ferry transport and the movement of goods in key industrial regions.

**3. Vessels Eligible for Remission**  

The remission applies to the following vessels and their respective owners:

1. **Algoma Central Corporation**  
   - **Vessels**: *Algonova* and *AlgoCanada*  
   - **Location**: St. Catharines, Ontario  
   - **Type**: Tankers  
   - **Significance**: These tankers are part of a key shipping network involved in the transportation of bulk goods, particularly in the Great Lakes region. They support the movement of oil, chemicals, and other commodities, contributing to regional economic activity and energy infrastructure.

2. **British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.**  
   - **Vessels**:  
     - *Coastal Renaissance*  
     - *Coastal Inspiration*  
     - *Coastal Celebration*  
     - *Northern Expedition*  
   - **Location**: Victoria, British Columbia  
   - **Type**: Passenger and cargo ferries  
   - **Significance**: These vessels provide essential interisland and coastal transportation services in British Columbia, supporting tourism, regional connectivity, and emergency response.

**4. Conditions for Remission**  

To qualify for the remission of customs duties, the importer (i.e., the company owning the vessels) must meet the following **two conditions**:

1. **Submission of Required Evidence**  
   The importer is required to provide **all evidence** that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) considers necessary to verify eligibility for remission. This may include:
   - Documentation of the original customs duty payment
   - Proof of vessel ownership and registration
   - Evidence of the vessel’s intended use (e.g., commercial transport, public service)
   - Any relevant operational or environmental assessments
   - Records showing compliance with applicable regulations

   The CBSA has the authority to assess the completeness and authenticity of this documentation as part of the eligibility review.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (MPSEP) **within two years** of the day on which this Order comes into force.  
   - This deadline is strict and non-extendable.  
   - The claim must be filed directly with the Minister, not with the CBSA or another agency.  
   - The Minister is responsible for processing the claim and determining whether remission is granted based on the evidence provided.

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.  
- Registration is the formal step that makes the Order legally effective and enforceable.  
- The two-year claim period begins from that registration date.

---

**6. Key Implications and Considerations**  

- **Public Interest Justification**: The vessels involved serve critical public functions—transportation of goods and people across Canada’s vast geography. The remission reflects a policy decision to support infrastructure that benefits the public good, even if the original duty payment was made under standard customs procedures.

- **Administrative Burden on Importers**: While the remission is beneficial, it places a responsibility on importers to maintain accurate records and to file claims promptly. This underscores the importance of compliance with customs documentation requirements.

- **Role of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**: Although the Minister of Finance typically oversees customs policy, the claim for remission is directed to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, suggesting a possible alignment with the government’s broader mandate to support emergency and public infrastructure services.

- **Limited Scope**: The remission applies only to the specific vessels listed and is not a general policy for all ships. It is a targeted intervention under section 115a.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Certain Ships Remission Order, 2010* is a targeted, legally grounded measure that provides a refund of customs duties to two key transportation operators—Algoma Central Corporation and British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.—for specific vessels that serve vital public and economic functions. The remission is conditional upon the submission of complete documentation and a timely claim within two years of the Order’s registration. This regulation balances fiscal responsibility with the need to support essential infrastructure and regional connectivity in Canada.
