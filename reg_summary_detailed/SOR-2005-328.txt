### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order in Council P.C. 2005-232 and P.C. 2005-234 (S.C. 1996, c. 10)**

---

#### **1. Background and Context**

This Order in Council was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** and the **Minister of Industry** (in his capacity as minister responsible for the Competition Bureau), under **Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act**.

The primary purpose of the Order is to **address an imminent extraordinary disruption** to the effective operation of Canada’s national transportation system — specifically, the disruption of container movement into and out of two major ports: the **Port of Vancouver** and the **Port of Fraser River**.

This disruption stems from a **dispute between trucking companies (owners/brokers)** and the **Vancouver Container Truckers’ Association**, which has threatened to halt container operations at these ports. The Governor in Council determined that:
- The disruption is **imminent** and not attributable to labor issues.
- Failure to act under Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act would be **contrary to the interests of users and operators** of the transportation system.
- No other existing legislation provides sufficient or appropriate remedies to prevent the damage.

Thus, the Order is a **temporary, emergency measure** to stabilize the national transportation system by enabling a resolution to the dispute through a structured agreement and licensing framework.

---

#### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made **pursuant to Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to take any step it considers essential to stabilize the national transportation system when an extraordinary disruption is imminent.

Section 47 allows for actions that may otherwise be restricted by competition laws (such as the Competition Act), provided they are necessary to prevent systemic disruption.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Arbitration Process** | The formal arbitration process outlined in Section 10 of the Memorandum of Agreement. |
| **Dispute** | The ongoing conflict between trucking companies and the Vancouver Container Truckers’ Association that threatens to disrupt container movement at the ports. |
| **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)** | The agreement signed on **July 29, 2005**, between trucking companies (owners/brokers) and the Vancouver Container Truckers’ Association. |
| **Ports** | Refers to either: (a) the Port of Vancouver and the Port of Fraser River; or (b) the Vancouver Port Authority and the Fraser River Port Authority. |
| **Public Officer** | Includes federal or provincial ministers, or any public servant employed by Canada or British Columbia. |

---

#### **4. Authorization for Parties to the Dispute**

Under subsection (1), the Order grants **specific authorizations** to various parties involved in the dispute, allowing them to act without being bound by the normal constraints of the **Competition Act**.

These authorizations include the right for the following parties to:
- **Adhere to** the Memorandum of Agreement;
- **Renew their adherence** to the MOA;
- **Adhere or renew adherence** to a licence granted by either the Vancouver Port Authority or the Fraser River Port Authority under Section 4 or 5 of the MOA.

> **Note**: This authorization is **limited in scope** — it applies only to the purpose of resolving the dispute and ensuring uninterrupted container movement.

---

#### **5. Exemption from Competition Act Constraints**

A critical feature of this Order is that the activities authorized under subsection (1) are **exempt from the usual anti-competitive provisions of the Competition Act**. This means:
- The parties involved (e.g., truckers, shippers, brokers, port authorities) can enter into or continue agreements under the MOA without fear of being challenged under competition law.
- This exemption is granted **only to ensure the stability of the transportation system** during the crisis.

> Importantly, this exemption does **not** affect **collective labour agreements**. The Order explicitly states that nothing in this regulation is intended to affect any existing or future collective labour agreements.

---

#### **6. Directives to the Port Authorities**

##### **A. Vancouver Port Authority (VPA)**

The VPA is directed to:
1. **Establish or maintain a licensing system** for trucks and road transportation equipment to access the Port of Vancouver for container delivery, pick-up, and movement.
2. **Set conditions for licensing**, including:
   - The applicant must be a **signatory to the July 29, 2005 Memorandum of Agreement** and be in **full compliance** with its terms.
   - The applicant must **accept the arbitration process** as a mechanism for resolving any disputes related to the interpretation or application of the licence.
3. **Prohibit access** to the Port of Vancouver for any truck or equipment that fails to meet these conditions.

> The VPA is also granted **freedom from Competition Act constraints** in carrying out these directives.

##### **B. Fraser River Port Authority (FRPA)**

Similarly, the FRPA is directed to:
1. **Establish or maintain a licensing system** for access to the Port of Fraser River.
2. **Set licensing conditions**, requiring:
   - Signatory status to the July 29, 2005 MOA and full compliance with it.
   - Acceptance of the arbitration process for resolving licensing-related disputes.
3. **Prohibit access** to the port for any equipment that fails to meet these conditions.

> Like the VPA, the FRPA is **exempt from Competition Act restrictions** in implementing these directives.

##### **C. Cross-Port Recognition**

The Order includes a key provision:  
> The **Fraser River Port Authority may recognize a licence issued by the Vancouver Port Authority** as sufficient for access to the Fraser River port.

This promotes **cooperation and consistency** between the two port authorities and helps avoid duplication or fragmentation of access rules.

---

#### **7. Duration and Effectiveness**

- **Effective Date**: The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette).
- **Duration**: It remains in effect for **90 days** from the date of coming into force.

> After 90 days, the Order will expire unless extended or replaced by a new order.

---

#### **8. Legal and Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Emergency Nature** | This is a temporary, emergency measure to prevent systemic collapse of container transport. It is not a long-term solution. |
| **Competition Law Suspension** | The exemption from Competition Act rules is significant and highlights the government’s prioritization of transportation stability over market competition during a crisis. |
| **Dispute Resolution Mechanism** | The arbitration process is central to the resolution strategy — it provides a neutral, binding path to resolve disagreements over licensing or operations. |
| **Labour Agreement Neutrality** | The Order respects existing labour relations by explicitly excluding any impact on collective agreements. |
| **Port Authority Autonomy** | Port authorities are given clear directives but with operational flexibility to implement licensing policies consistent with the MOA. |

---

#### **9. Historical Context and Precedent**

- This Order **replaces** Order in Council P.C. 2005-1356 (made July 29, 2005), which had previously been in force but was set to expire on **October 27, 2005**, as per Section 5 of that earlier Order.
- The new Order (P.C. 2005-232 and 234) was issued to **extend and refine** the emergency measures in response to ongoing disruption and to provide more specific directives to the port authorities.

---

#### **10. Conclusion**

This Order in Council is a **targeted, emergency intervention** designed to:
- Prevent a breakdown in container logistics at two key Canadian ports;
- Restore stability in the national transportation system by enabling a structured resolution of a commercial dispute;
- Allow the port authorities to implement licensing systems that are tied to compliance with a Memorandum of Agreement and a binding arbitration process;
- Provide temporary relief from competition law restrictions to ensure operational continuity.

While the Order is temporary and expires after 90 days, it demonstrates the federal government’s ability to use statutory powers under the **Canada Transportation Act** to manage extraordinary disruptions that threaten national economic and logistical infrastructure.

---

### **Summary in One Sentence**  
This emergency Order authorizes key parties to resolve a container transport dispute by allowing adherence to a Memorandum of Agreement and enabling port authorities to impose licensing conditions tied to compliance with that agreement — all without competition law constraints — for a 90-day period to stabilize the national transportation system.
