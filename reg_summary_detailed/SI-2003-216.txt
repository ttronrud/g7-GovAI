### **Details of the Transferred Functions:**

1. **The Customs Branch**  
   - Full control and supervision of the Customs Branch are transferred to CBSA.  
   - This includes all operational, administrative, and policy-related responsibilities related to customs enforcement, entry and exit controls, and the implementation of customs regulations.

2. **Customs Operations Division of the Investigations Directorate (Compliance Programs Branch)**  
   - This division is responsible for investigating customs violations, smuggling, and compliance issues.  
   - The transfer includes all functions related to customs enforcement, intelligence gathering, and operational investigations within the Compliance Programs Branch.

3. **Customs Appeal Directorate of the Appeals Branch**  
   - This body handles appeals related to customs decisions, including penalties, assessments, and enforcement actions.  
   - The transfer ensures that appeals related to customs matters are now managed under CBSA, aligning administrative oversight with the agency responsible for border enforcement.

4. **Regional Division Responsibilities (Customs Program Administration)**  
   - Within each of CCRA’s regional divisions, only the portion responsible for **the administration of the Customs program** is transferred.  
   - This includes regional-level implementation of customs policies, inspections, and enforcement activities.  
   - **Excluded from transfer:** Any portion of the regional divisions related to **collections** (e.g., tax assessments, revenue recovery, or enforcement of payment obligations).  
     - Collections remain under the jurisdiction of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), as these functions are distinct from customs enforcement.

### **Purpose and Context of the Transfer:**

- The transfer reflects a broader **reorganization of Canada’s border and revenue agencies** to improve efficiency, reduce duplication, and enhance coordination between border enforcement and revenue administration.  
- By consolidating customs enforcement and operational functions under the CBSA, the government aimed to:
  - Strengthen border security and customs compliance.
  - Improve inter-agency coordination between enforcement, investigations, and appeals.
  - Streamline operations and reduce administrative complexity.

- The separation of **collections** from customs administration ensures that revenue recovery remains under the CRA’s mandate, preserving the distinct roles and responsibilities of the two agencies.

### **Significance of the Regulation:**

- This transfer marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Canada’s border and tax administration frameworks.  
- It laid the foundation for the **integration of customs enforcement under CBSA**, which later became a core component of the modern Canadian border regime.  
- The regulation exemplifies how legislative and administrative restructuring can enhance operational effectiveness and accountability in public service delivery.

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation formally transfers key customs-related functions—enforcement, investigations, appeals, and regional administration—from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to the Canada Border Services Agency, effective December 12, 2003. The transfer is strategically focused on operational and enforcement functions, while preserving the CRA’s responsibility for revenue collection. This reorganization strengthens the CBSA’s role as the central agency for border security and customs compliance in Canada.
