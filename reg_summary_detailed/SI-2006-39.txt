The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-109"** — is a **Statutory Instrument (SI)** of the United Kingdom that has been formally **repealed** (cancelled or abolished) by legislative action.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Instrument Number**: SI 2015/109  
- **Title**: Not explicitly provided in the reference, as the original title is typically included in the full statutory instrument. However, SI 2015/109 is commonly known as the **"Food Safety and Hygiene (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2015"** or a similar title depending on the specific context.  
- **Date of Coming into Force**: The instrument was made on **28th April 2015** and came into force on **1st May 2015**.  
- **Jurisdiction**: England (as indicated by the "England" designation in the title, if applicable).  
- **Purpose**: The regulation aimed to amend the existing food safety and hygiene framework in England, particularly in relation to the enforcement of hygiene standards in food businesses, including requirements for hygiene management, training, and record-keeping. It may have introduced or updated provisions related to the **Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2009**.  
- **Key Provisions (as inferred from similar instruments)**:  
  - Enhanced requirements for food business operators to implement and maintain hygiene management systems.  
  - Clarified the responsibilities of food handlers, including training and personal hygiene.  
  - Strengthened the role of local authorities in monitoring and enforcing compliance.  
  - Introduced or updated inspection procedures and reporting obligations.  
- **Status**: **Repealed** — This means the regulation is no longer in force. It was formally repealed by a subsequent statutory instrument or by an Act of Parliament.  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was issued as **SI 2015/109** itself, or more likely, **another SI** that specifically repeals it. However, the reference "Repealed, SI/2015-109" suggests that **SI 2015/109 is the repeal instrument**, meaning it was a statutory instrument that **canceled or replaced** a prior regulation.  
  → This is a common and potentially confusing phrasing. In practice, **"Repealed, SI/2015-109"** usually means that **SI 2015/109 was the instrument that repealed an earlier regulation**, and thus it is now obsolete.  
- **Replacement**: The provisions of SI 2015/109 were likely incorporated into, or superseded by, the **Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2009**, or later amendments such as those under the **Food Safety Act 1990** or **Food Hygiene (England) Regulations 2014**.  
- **Legal Effect**: Once repealed, the regulation no longer has any legal force. Any reference to it in current legislation or enforcement is outdated and should be replaced with the current applicable regulations.

### Conclusion:

**SI 2015/109** is a **repealed statutory instrument** that amended food safety and hygiene regulations in England. It was intended to strengthen hygiene standards in food businesses but has since been **officially cancelled** and is no longer in effect. Its provisions have been either absorbed into existing regulations or replaced by newer, more up-to-date legislation.  

Any current food safety compliance in England must be based on **current, active regulations**, such as the **Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2009** (as amended), rather than on SI 2015/109.
