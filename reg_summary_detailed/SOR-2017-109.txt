## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of the Environment**, under **Section 5a of the Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act (EVAMPA)**.
- The regulations are rooted in the **Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act (EVAMPA)**, which provides a legal framework for imposing administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) for environmental violations.
- **Statutory references**:
  - S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 54
  - S.C. 2009, c. 14, s. 126

> 🔍 *Purpose*: To establish clear, enforceable rules for identifying, classifying, and penalizing environmental violations through a transparent and proportionate administrative penalty system.

### **2. Definitions and Scope of Violations**

#### ✅ **Types of Violations Identified**

| Violation Type | Legal Basis |
|---------------|------------|
| **Type A, B, C, D, or E** | Defined based on specific provisions in Schedules 1–3 and the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act |

---

#### **A. Contravention of Environmental Acts or Regulations (Schedule 1 – Column 1)**
- Any violation of a provision in an Environmental Act or its regulations listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 1** is considered a **"violation"** that may be prosecuted under EVAMPA.
- Examples include violations of pollution control, waste management, or emissions standards under Acts like the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)*, *Municipal Solid Waste Act*, or *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*.

#### **B. Contravention of Orders or Directions (Schedule 2 – Column 1)**
- Any breach of an order or direction issued under a provision in an Environmental Act or its regulations listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 2** constitutes a violation.
- These may include court-issued directives, enforcement orders, or regulatory instructions (e.g., to reduce emissions or stop discharges).

#### **C. Failure to Comply with Permit Conditions (Schedule 3 – Column 1)**
- Non-compliance with a condition of a permit, licence, or authorization issued under an Environmental Act or regulation listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 3** is a violation.
- Examples: failing to install pollution control equipment, not reporting emissions, or exceeding permitted discharge volumes.

#### **D. Contravention of Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GHG Act)**
- Violation of **subsection 174(1)** or **paragraph 178(1)(a)** of the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (e.g., failure to pay carbon tax or report GHG emissions) is designated as a violation under EVAMPA.

### **3. Classification of Violations: Type A–E**

Each violation is classified into one of five categories — **Type A, B, C, D, or E** — based on the **nature and severity** of the violation, as specified in **Columns 2 of Schedules 1–3**.

| Type | Severity Level |
|------|----------------|
| **A** | Most serious (e.g., major pollution events, large-scale non-compliance) |
| **B** | Moderate severity |
| **C** | Less serious but still significant |
| **D** | Minor or recurring violations |
| **E** | Very minor or technical breaches |

> ⚠️ *Classification determines the penalty structure and the factors used to calculate the penalty amount.*

---

### **4. Penalty Calculation Formulae**

Penalties are calculated using **formulae based on four key components**:

---

#### 🔹 **For Type A, B, or C Violations**  
Formula:
\[
\text{Penalty} = B + H + E - G
\]
Where:
- \( B \) = **Baseline penalty amount** (from Schedule 4 or 5)
- \( H \) = **History of non-compliance amount** (if applicable)
- \( E \) = **Environmental harm amount** (if applicable)
- \( G \) = **Economic gain amount** (if applicable)

> 📌 *Note:* If no harm or gain, only baseline and history are considered.

---

#### 🔹 **For Type D or E Violations**  
Formula:
\[
\text{Penalty} = B + H - G
\]
Where:
- \( B \) = Baseline penalty amount
- \( H \) = History of non-compliance amount (if applicable)
- \( G \) = Economic gain amount (if applicable)

> 📌 *Note:* No environmental harm component for D/E violations.

---

### **5. Determining the Penalty Components**

| Component | Source | Determination |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Baseline Penalty (B)** | Column 3 of **Schedule 4 or 5** | Based on **violation type** and **category of violator** (e.g., individual, small business, large corporation) |
| **History of Non-Compliance (H)** | Column 4 of Schedule 4 or 5 | Applies if violator has been subject to enforcement actions in the **5 years prior** to the current violation in any of the following: |
| | | • Division 7 of CEPA (waste management) <br> • Part 9 of CEPA (chemicals) <br> • GHG Pollution Pricing Act <br> • Any other Environmental Act (excluding CEPA and GHG Act) |
| | Enforcement action includes: | Ticket, penalty, conviction, injunction, or use of environmental protection alternative measures |
| **Environmental Harm (E)** | Column 5 of Schedule 4 | If environmental damage occurred (e.g., water contamination, habitat loss), the amount is set based on violator category and violation type |
| **Economic Gain (G)** | Column 6 or 7 of Schedule 4 | If violator gained financially (e.g., avoided costs): |
| | | • **Column 6**: General economic gain (e.g., avoided operational costs) <br> • **Column 7**: Gain from avoiding permit/authorization costs only |
| | **Schedule 5** applies if the violation involves **cross-border hazardous waste movement** | For certain provisions in the *Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste Regulations* |

> 💡 *Note:* For violations under **subsection 2(4)** (specifically, those related to cross-border hazardous waste movement), the penalty is **fixed at $0.25**, regardless of other factors.

---

### **6. Continuation of Violations and Daily Penalties**

If a violation **continues over multiple days**, it results in **separate daily violations** under Section 12 of the EVAMPA.

Penalty increases with time:
| Time Period | Daily Penalty |
|-----------|----------------|
| Day 2 to Day 9 (after initial violation) | $0.25 |
| Day 10 to Day 20 | $0.50 |
| Day 21 and beyond | $1.00 |

> 📌 *Purpose:* To deter prolonged or repeated environmental harm by increasing penalties over time.
