**Detailed Summary of the Fruit Remission Order, 2011**

**1. Legal Authority and Origin**  
The Fruit Remission Order, 2011, is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is authorized under **Section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended by S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j) and S.C. 1997, c. 36). This section provides the legal basis for granting remissions of customs duties in specific circumstances, particularly for certain agricultural products involved in processing.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **grant a partial remission of customs duties** that were paid or are payable under the Customs Tariff. The remission applies specifically to **fruit imports used for processing**, aiming to support domestic processing industries and promote economic activity in the agricultural sector.

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies to the following:

- **Eligible Company**: The company listed in **Column 1** of the attached Schedule.
- **Eligible Product**: The specific fruit product listed in **Column 2**.
- **Year of Import**: The product must have been imported for processing during the fiscal year listed in **Column 3**.
- **Amount of Remission**: The duty remission is limited to the amount specified in **Column 4** of the Schedule.

In essence, the remission is not a full exemption but a **reduction of the customs duty** paid or due, capped at the amount set forth in the schedule.

**4. Conditions for Eligibility**  
To qualify for the remission, the following condition must be met:

- A **formal claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the "Minister") **no later than September 30, 2013**.

This deadline is critical and non-negotiable. Any claim submitted after this date will not be accepted under this Order.

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is officially registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means that the remission provisions become active immediately upon publication and registration, but claims must still be filed by the specified deadline.

**6. Key Implications**  
- The remission is **targeted and limited** to specific companies, products, and fiscal years, indicating a focused policy intervention.
- It supports **domestic processing of fruit**, which may help reduce reliance on foreign processing and strengthen the value chain within Canada.
- The requirement to file a claim with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (rather than the Minister of Finance or the Canada Border Services Agency) suggests a coordination or administrative policy decision, possibly reflecting the role of public safety in emergency preparedness and food security.

**7. Limitations and Notes**  
- The Order is **not retroactive**; it only applies to imports made during the specific year listed in Column 3.
- The remission amount is **fixed and capped**, meaning companies cannot claim more than the amount specified in Column 4.
- The Order is **time-bound**, with a strict deadline of September 30, 2013, for claims—this creates a clear window of opportunity for eligible companies to act.

**Conclusion**  
The Fruit Remission Order, 2011, is a targeted fiscal measure designed to provide financial relief to Canadian companies engaged in the processing of specific fruit products. By reducing customs duties on qualifying imports, the Order supports domestic processing industries, promotes food security, and encourages economic activity. However, its effectiveness is contingent upon timely claims being submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness by September 30, 2013. This regulation reflects a policy approach that balances fiscal responsibility with targeted support for key sectors of the economy.
