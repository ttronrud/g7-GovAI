The reference "[Repealed, SI/2017-4]" indicates that the regulation in question has been formally repealed by a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in 2017, specifically SI 2017/4.

However, without the full name or subject matter of the original regulation being repealed, a detailed summary cannot be provided—because the regulation itself is no longer in force.

In general terms:

**Summary of "[Repealed, SI/2017-4]"**:

- The regulation referenced in SI/2017-4 was previously in force and governed a specific area of law or administrative practice (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, employment, or public health).
- It was formally repealed by Statutory Instrument 2017 No. 4, which was issued under the authority of a relevant Act of Parliament.
- The repeal means that the regulation is no longer applicable, effective, or enforceable in law.
- The purpose of the repeal was likely to:
  - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions;
  - Align with updated legislation;
  - Simplify or modernize the regulatory framework;
  - Avoid regulatory overlap or inconsistency;
  - Reflect changes in policy or legal interpretation.

**Important Notes**:
- Since the regulation is now repealed, it is not active and should not be used for legal, compliance, or operational purposes.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or consolidation of laws.
- To understand the original content of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal, which is typically archived in official government publications such as the UK Statutory Instruments database (for UK legislation) or the relevant national legal database.

**Recommendation**:
To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, you should:
1. Access the full text of the repealed regulation (e.g., via legislation.gov.uk or the official government legal database).
2. Identify the title and subject (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2015").
3. Review the provisions, objectives, and scope of the regulation before repeal.

In conclusion:  
**[Repealed, SI/2017-4]** is a notation indicating that a specific regulation was officially cancelled and is no longer in force. A detailed summary of its content is not possible without knowing the original title and subject matter of the regulation. The repeal reflects a change in the legal framework, and the regulation is now obsolete.
