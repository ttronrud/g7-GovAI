### **Detailed Summary of the Reserve Force Pension Plan Regulations (S.C. 2003, c. 26, s. 23, s. 41(1), s. 36)**

These regulations, made under the authority of the **Canadian Forces Superannuation Act (the "Act")** and the **Financial Administration Act**, establish the **Reserve Force Pension Plan (RFPP)** — a defined contribution pension plan for members of the Canadian Forces Reserve Force. The regulations were introduced to provide a structured, fair, and transparent framework for pension entitlements, contributions, and eligibility for reserve force members, particularly those who served prior to 1999 or had periods of non-service due to leave or exemption.

## **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

- **Authority**:  
  The Treasury Board, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, enacted these regulations under:
  - Paragraph 50(1)(a)a of the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act*,
  - Sections 59.1b and 82c of the same Act,
  - Paragraph 7(2)(b) of the *Financial Administration Act*.

- **Purpose**:  
  To establish a formal pension plan for reserve force members, ensuring they receive pension benefits based on their pensionable earnings, with clear rules for eligibility, contribution rates, and the treatment of past service and leave periods.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* |
| **Fund** | The *Reserve Force Pension Fund*, established under section 84 of the Act |
| **Member** | A member of the reserve force |
| **Pensioner** | A current or former member entitled to an annuity or annual allowance under Division 1 of Part 2 of the Act |
| **Earnings** | Pay at the rate prescribed for rank under the *National Defence Act*, plus earned premiums in lieu of leave |
| **Deemed Earnings** | For members on leave (maternity, parental) or exempted from duty (under QROs), they are deemed to receive earnings equal to the weekly rate of pay as per Instruction 205.461 |
| **Deemed Earnings (pre-1999)** | For periods before April 1, 1999, where records allow verification of rank and duration but not earnings, the member is deemed to have earned **¼ of the standard basic daily rate** of pay for that rank and day |

> This ensures that members who served in the reserve force without full pay records (especially pre-1999) are not excluded from pension eligibility due to missing earnings data.

## **3. Establishment of the Reserve Force Pension Plan**

The Reserve Force Pension Plan is formally established under these regulations. It operates as a **defined contribution plan**, where members contribute a percentage of their pensionable earnings to the Fund.

---

## **4. Earnings Thresholds**

- **Monthly Earnings Threshold**:  
  1/12 of the **Year’s Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE)** under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), rounded to the nearest cent.  
  *(YMPE is the maximum amount of earnings eligible for CPP contributions in a calendar year.)*

- **Annual Earnings Threshold**:  
  The sum of the Monthly Earnings Thresholds over 12 months.

> These thresholds are used to determine eligibility for participation in the plan.

---

## **5. Eligibility to Become a Participant**

A member becomes a participant in the RFPP under **two scenarios**:

### **Scenario A: Entry on March 1, 2007**
- If, during **any two consecutive 12-month periods** beginning on or after **April 1, 1999** and ending **no later than March 1, 2007**, the member’s earnings were **equal to or greater than 10% of the Annual Earnings Threshold**;
- And the member was a member of the Canadian Forces during the first month of the first period and remained a member without interruption exceeding **60 days** until March 1, 2007.

> This is a special provision for members who joined the reserve force after 1999 and met a minimum earnings threshold before 2007.

### **Scenario B: Entry in Any Other Case**
- If, during **two consecutive 12-month periods** (the second ending **after March 1, 2007**), the member’s earnings were **≥10% of the Annual Earnings Threshold**;
- The member must have been a member during the first month of the first period and remain a member without interruption exceeding 60 days throughout both periods.

> This allows members who joined after March 1, 2007, to become participants based on sustained earnings.

### **Pensioner Re-Entry**
- A pensioner or former participant becomes a participant again **on the day they are again entitled to receive earnings as a member**.

---

## **6. Exclusions from Participation**

A member **does not become a participant** if:
- They were considered a **regular force member on March 1, 2007** under paragraph 8.1(1)(a) of the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Regulations*;
- Under Part I of the Act, they are:
  - Receiving an annuity or annual allowance;
  - Entitled to a deferred annuity or annual allowance;
  - A person for whom a **transfer value** has been paid (under section 61).

> This prevents double counting and ensures that those already receiving pension benefits are not re-enrolled.

---

## **7. Cessation of Participation**

A member ceases to be a participant on:
1. The day they **cease to be a member**;
2. The day **before** they are required to contribute to the **Canadian Forces Pension Fund**;
3. The **last day of a 12-month period** during which they were **not entitled to receive earnings**.

> This ensures that participation is only active during periods when the member is actively earning and contributing.

### **Exception: Members with Less Than 2 Years of Service**
- If a member ceases to be a participant and **re-joins within 60 days**, they are **deemed not to have ceased**.
- Alternatively, if the member is entitled to earnings ≥10% of the Annual Earnings Threshold for **two consecutive 12-month periods ending after the month of cessation**, they are deemed to have continued participation.

> This provides continuity for members who return to service after a short break.

---

## **8. Contribution Rates**

Contributions are a **percentage of the member’s pensionable earnings**:

| Year | Contribution Rate |
|------|-------------------|
| 2007 | 4.3% |
| 2008 | 4.6% |
| 2009 | 4.9% |
| 2010 and beyond | 5.2% |

> **Exception**: Members with **35 years of pensionable service** contribute only **1%** of their earnings.

> This incentivizes long-term service and provides a reduced rate for those with substantial service history.

---

## **9. Limits on Contributions**

Contributions are capped under two conditions:

1. **Earnings Cap**:  
   No contribution is made on earnings exceeding **66⅔ × the defined benefit limit** (as defined in subsection 8500(1) of the *Income Tax Regulations*).  
   → This prevents excessive contributions based on inflated earnings.

2. **Age Limit**:  
   No contributions are made on earnings **after the member reaches age 71**.

> This protects older members from being required to contribute after retirement age.

---

## **10. Reservations on Contributions**

- **For leave/exemption periods**:  
  If a member is on leave or exempted from duty, they are deemed to have earned income. Contributions are made on that deemed income, and **a reservation of ½ of the contribution amount** is made for each such period.

- **Reservations start after** the contribution for the previous period is paid.

- **Opt-out option**:  
  A member may **choose not to contribute** during a leave period, **before all contributions are paid**. If so, the **already-paid contributions are refunded**.

> This gives flexibility during personal or family leave.

---

## **11. Recovery of Unpaid Contributions**

If a pensioner begins receiving an annuity or annual allowance and **contributions remain unpaid**, the unpaid amount is **recovered from the monthly benefits** at a rate of **10%** of the monthly benefits.

> This ensures the Fund is not left with unpaid obligations.

---

## **12. What Counts as Pensionable Earnings**

Pensionable earnings include:
- Earnings for which the member is **required to contribute** (as per section 6);
- Earnings for which the member makes an **election to count** as pensionable earnings (subject to specific rules).

**What does NOT count as pensionable earnings**:
- Earnings for which the member has **opted not to contribute**;
- Earnings related to a **return of contributions** (section 38);
- Earnings related to a **transfer value** (section 61);
- Earnings charged to the Fund and credited to the Canadian Forces Pension Fund (section 83).

> This ensures only active, voluntary contributions are counted toward pensionable service.
