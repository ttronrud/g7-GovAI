### 🔹 **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Energy Efficiency Act*. |
| **Adhesive Tag** | A label attached by at least two strips of adhesive on opposite edges. |
| **Flap Tag** | A label attached by one strip of adhesive along the top edge. |
| **Hang Tag** | A label looped around a product so it hangs freely. |
| **Household Product** | Manufactured or sold primarily for use in a dwelling. |
| **Model Number** | A unique identifier distinguishing one model from another. |
| **Unique Motor Identifier (UMI)** | A standardized identifier for motors consisting of: <br> - Manufacturer (abbreviated), <br> - Nominal power (kW or horsepower), <br> - Number of poles, <br> - Construction type (open or enclosed). |
| **Certification Body** | A body accredited by the Standards Council of Canada to certify energy efficiency compliance. |
| **Verification Mark** | A mark issued by a certification body or province indicating that a product meets an applicable energy efficiency standard and that performance data has been verified. |
| **Energy-Using Product** | Any product that consumes energy, even if incorporated into another product. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: References to standards (e.g., ANSI, IEC) are interpreted as current versions, amended from time to time.  
> If a referenced standard is repealed in another jurisdiction, the regulation continues to apply to the version in effect *on the day before repeal*.

### 🔹 **3. Labeling Requirements (Section 4)**

#### 📌 General Rule:
Every energy-using product **shipped between provinces or imported into Canada** must carry a **verification mark** that indicates compliance with an applicable energy efficiency standard.

#### ✅ Who Can Issue the Mark?
- A **certification body** accredited by the Standards Council of Canada; **or**
- A **province** whose energy efficiency standard is **equal to or exceeds** the standard set in these regulations.

#### 📌 Visibility Requirements:
- The verification mark must be **readily visible** on the **surface** of the product.
- **Exceptions** (where the mark may be on the package):
  - General service lamps  
  - General service fluorescent lamps  
  - Battery chargers  
  - External power supplies  
  - Faucet replacement aerators  
  *(Note: These are now **repealed** by SOR/2025-110, s. 2)*

#### 📌 Exception for External Power Supplies:
An external power supply is **exempt from labeling** if:
1. It bears a mark under the **U.S. Department of Energy’s International Efficiency Marking Protocol** (as amended);
2. A certification body has verified its energy performance data; and  
3. It uses the **same model number** as used in the verification.

> 🔍 This exception supports international consistency and reduces redundancy in labeling.

### 🔹 **4. Information Reporting Requirements (Section 5)**

#### 📌 Mandatory Information to Be Provided to the Minister:
A dealer must provide the following **before** shipment or import:

| Information | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Name of the product (as prescribed) | As defined in the regulations |
| Brand name (if any) | Optional |
| Model number or unique motor identifier (for motors) | Required |
| Name of manufacturer | Required |
| Name of certification body or province | Whose mark is on the product |
| Any other prescribed information | As specified in the regulations |
| Statement on whether a **mathematical model** was used to generate performance data | Required if modeling was used |

#### 📌 Method of Submission:
- Must be submitted **electronically, by fax, hand delivery, courier, or mail**.
- Must be submitted **before** the product enters Canada or is shipped between provinces.

#### 📌 Use of Mathematical Modeling:
- A dealer may use a **mathematical model** (via engineering analysis, computer simulation, or statistical modeling) to emulate the results of a standard test.
- This is **permitted** even if the standard requires physical testing — provided the model accurately replicates the real-world test conditions.

> ⚠️ This promotes innovation and flexibility in product development while maintaining regulatory integrity.

### 🔹 **5. Import Requirements (Section 5 – Import Clause)**

When importing an energy-using product into Canada:

#### 📌 Required Information:
- Product name  
- Brand name (if any)  
- Model number or unique motor identifier (for motors)  
- Dealer’s address  
- Statement on purpose of import:
  - For **sale or lease in Canada without modification**  
  - For **sale or lease after modification** to meet energy standards  
  - For **incorporation into another product to be exported from Canada**

#### 📌 Exception: Products Not Considered Energy-Using Products
The following products are **exempt from labeling and reporting** if imported **incorporated into another product**:
- Battery chargers  
- External power supplies  
- Fluorescent lamp ballasts  
- Electric motors  
- Small electric motors  

> ⚠️ These are **not subject to sections 4, 5, or 13–15** of the Act when imported for incorporation into export products.

#### 📌 Submission Requirement:
- Information must be included in the **customs or commercial invoice** required under the *Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations*.
- Must be submitted **before** the product is released under the *Customs Act*.

### 🔹 **6. Exemptions**

#### ✅ Exemption for Modification and Shipment:
A dealer is **exempt from sections 4 and 5** if:
