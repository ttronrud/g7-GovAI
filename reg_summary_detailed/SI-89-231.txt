### **Background and Context**

1. **Statute Revision Commission’s Role**  
   The Statute Revision Commission (SRC) is a statutory body established to review, revise, and streamline Canada’s legislative code. Its mandate includes identifying outdated, redundant, or inconsistent statutes and producing supplements that consolidate and modernize the law.

2. **Completion of the Fourth Supplement**  
   The Commission has completed its work on the **Fourth Supplement** to the *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985*. This supplement contains a set of legal enactments—new laws, amendments, or revisions—to the existing statutory framework. These enactments are intended to improve clarity, consistency, and accessibility of the law.

3. **Official Certification and Deposit**  
   On **September 27, 1989**, a printed copy of the Fourth Supplement was formally:
   - **Attested** by the Governor General (the head of state of Canada),
   - **Countersigned** by the Minister of Justice (the federal minister responsible for legal and legislative affairs),
   - **Certified as correct** by the Chairman of the Statute Revision Commission.

   This certification confirms the accuracy and completeness of the supplement and serves as a formal step toward its legal adoption.

### **Legal Authority**

The proclamation is issued under **subsection 13(2) of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 Act**. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the power to declare when a supplement to the Revised Statutes shall come into force, based on recommendations from the Minister of Justice and the certification of the Statute Revision Commission.

This provision allows for the **de facto enactment** of the contents of a supplement without requiring a new Act of Parliament. In other words, the laws in the supplement are treated as if they were passed by Parliament, giving them full legal force and effect from the declared date.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Streamlining the Legal Code**  
   The Fourth Supplement contributes to the ongoing effort to modernize and simplify Canada’s legal framework. It helps eliminate redundancies, clarify ambiguous provisions, and ensure that laws are up to date with current legal and societal needs.

2. **Efficiency in Lawmaking**  
   By allowing the Governor General to adopt statutory changes through a supplement rather than through a new parliamentary act, the process becomes faster and more efficient, especially for technical or administrative updates.

3. **Legal Certainty**  
   The formal certification process ensures that the public and legal institutions have confidence in the accuracy and legitimacy of the laws being implemented.

4. **Administrative and Judicial Impact**  
   From November 1, 1989, courts, government agencies, and legal practitioners must apply the laws in the supplement as part of the official legal system. Any dispute involving these laws will be governed by their provisions as if they were enacted by Parliament.
