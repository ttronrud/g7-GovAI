### **3. Prescribed Area and Right of Way**

- The **prescribed area** is the strip of land directly associated with the power line where damage prevention is required.
- **Right of Way (ROW)**:
  - The official land registered or recorded as the right of way in the local land registry.
  - If no formal ROW exists, the prescribed area is **30 meters on each side of the centerline** of the power line.

> This ensures that activities near the line are properly identified and protected.

---

### **4. Ground Disturbance Activities and Prohibitions**

Ground disturbance is defined as activities that affect the soil or underground components of the power line.

#### **Permitted Ground Disturbances (with conditions)**:
- **Cultivation** to a depth of **less than 45 cm** below ground surface.
- **Other activities** to a depth of **less than 30 cm** that do **not reduce earth cover** over underground portions of the line.

> These exceptions allow limited agricultural or minor land use while protecting underground infrastructure.

#### **Prohibition When a Locate Request is Made**:
- If a holder receives a locate request from a person planning ground disturbance, and the holder identifies an area **near the power line** (which may extend beyond the prescribed area), then:
  - **Ground disturbance is prohibited in that identified area** during the period specified in subsection 276(1) of the Act.

> This creates a buffer zone around the line based on risk assessment and notification.

---

### **5. Locate Request Requirements**

Any person intending to:
- Construct a facility **across, on, along, or under** a power line, or
- Engage in an activity causing ground disturbance within the prescribed area,

**must submit a locate request at least three working days before the start of the activity.**

#### **Where to Submit**:
- **If a one-call centre exists** in the area: Submit to the one-call centre.
- **If no one-call centre exists**: Submit directly to the **holder** of the power line.

> **Exception – Emergency Situations**:
- In cases of **unexpected dangers** (e.g., natural disasters, fire, imminent structural failure) that threaten life, property, or the environment:
  - The three-day rule does **not apply**.
  - A locate request must be made **as soon as possible** before work begins.

---

### **6. One-Call Centre Role**

A one-call centre:
- Receives locate requests from individuals or companies.
- Notifies all affected utility members (including power line holders) of proposed construction or activities that may impact underground infrastructure.

> This promotes **coordinated planning**, **shared responsibility**, and **public safety**.

---

### **7. Obligations of Contractors and Subcontractors**

Any person planning construction or activity must:
- **Inform all persons working on their behalf**, including **contractors and subcontractors**, of their obligations under these regulations.

> Ensures that **all parties involved** are aware of the risks and required procedures.

---

### **8. Authorization Requirements for Construction**

Construction across, on, along, or under an international or interprovincial power line is authorized **only if** the following conditions are met:

1. **Written authorization** is obtained from the holder.
2. **Written agreement** with the holder on:
   - A detailed **work procedure**.
   - A **construction schedule**.
3. A **locate request** is submitted in accordance with Section 5.
4. The construction **complies with the conditions** set in the authorization.
5. For **overhead crossings**:
   - Must follow **CSA Group Standard C22.3 No. 1 – Overhead Systems**, as amended.
6. For **underground crossings**:
   - Must follow **CSA Group Standard C22.3 No. 7 – Underground Systems**, as amended.

> These standards ensure **safety, durability, and compatibility** with existing infrastructure.

#### **Suspension of Authorization**:
- If the authorization is **suspended**, construction must **cease immediately** until the suspension is lifted.

### **9. Authorization for Ground Disturbance Activities**

Any activity causing ground disturbance within the prescribed area is authorized if:
- Written authorization is obtained from the holder.
- A written agreement on **procedure and schedule** is reached.
- A locate request is submitted per Section 5.
- The activity **complies with the conditions** in the authorization.

> **Suspension Rule**: If the authorization is suspended, the activity must **cease immediately**.

---

### **10. Ongoing Obligations During Activities**

Persons engaging in ground disturbance must:
1. Carry out the activity **in full compliance** with the holder’s authorization conditions.
2. Ensure **no additional earth or material** is placed in the prescribed area that could **reduce the ground-to-conductor clearance** of overhead lines.
3. **Immediately notify the holder** of any contact with an underground portion of the power line.
4. **Notify the holder at least 24 hours before backfilling** any exposed underground portion of the line, **unless otherwise agreed** with the holder.
