### **Detailed Summary of the Regulatory Instrument**

#### **1. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-83 (February 12, 2025)**  
- **Action**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, has formally **repealed** Order in Council P.C. 2025-83, issued on February 12, 2025.  
- **Purpose of the Repeal**:  
  - Order P.C. 2025-83 likely established or amended specific provisions related to a government process, such as administrative procedures, appointments, or policy implementation.  
  - The repeal indicates that this order is no longer in force, either because it was outdated, superseded by new legislation, or rendered unnecessary.  
  - Repealing an Order in Council is a formal administrative action that removes its legal effect and ensures regulatory clarity.  
- **Legal Authority**:  
  - The Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) has the constitutional authority to issue or repeal Orders in Council under the *Constitution Act, 1867*, and other statutes.  
  - This action reflects a common practice in Canadian governance to update or streamline administrative regulations.

#### **2. Designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as Minister under the Referendum Act**  
- **Action**:  
  - **Statutory Instrument SI/2025-13** designates the **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** as a **Minister** for the purposes of the *Referendum Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 30).  
- **Legal Basis**:  
  - The *Referendum Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 30) is a federal statute that governs the conduct, administration, and legal framework of referendums in Canada.  
  - Under section 3 of the *Referendum Act*, the term "Minister" is defined and used in various procedural and administrative contexts (e.g., for appointments, responsibilities, and authority over referendum processes).  
- **Significance of the Designation**:  
  - This designation ensures that the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (typically the Prime Minister or a senior cabinet minister) has the necessary ministerial status to act in official capacity when the Act is invoked.  
  - It provides legal clarity and continuity in the governance of referendums, especially in cases where the Prime Minister or their designated representative must assume ministerial duties (e.g., in organizing or overseeing a referendum process).  
  - This may be particularly relevant in the context of future referendums on constitutional or national issues (e.g., sovereignty, electoral reform, or bilingualism).  
- **Implication**:  
  - The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is now recognized as a Minister under the *Referendum Act*, even if they are not formally appointed as a cabinet minister in the traditional sense.  
  - This may streamline decision-making and ensure that key political leadership is legally empowered to act in referendums without requiring separate ministerial appointments.

#### **3. Reference to S.C. 1992, c. 30 – The Referendum Act**  
- The *Referendum Act* (Statute of Canada, 1992, Chapter 30) is the primary legislation governing referendums in Canada.  
- Key provisions include:  
  - The process for initiating a referendum (e.g., by the Governor in Council or the House of Commons).  
  - The roles and responsibilities of the Minister and other officials.  
  - The requirements for public consultation, advertising, and voting procedures.  
- The 2025 designation reflects an update to administrative interpretation and operational authority within this Act.

### **Overall Purpose and Context**

This regulatory action (SI/2025-13) serves to:

1. **Modernize and clarify administrative authority** under the *Referendum Act* by formally recognizing the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as a Minister for procedural and legal purposes.  
2. **Remove outdated or obsolete regulations** (P.C. 2025-83) that may have conflicted with current governance or policy frameworks.  
3. **Ensure legal continuity and operational readiness** for any future referendums, particularly in a context of evolving political leadership or governance structures.

### **Conclusion**

The regulation constitutes a minor but significant update to Canada’s administrative and constitutional framework concerning referendums. It:

- **Repeals** an older Order in Council (P.C. 2025-83), likely to remove outdated or redundant provisions.  
- **Designates** the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as a Minister under the *Referendum Act*, enhancing the legal standing and operational capacity of the government in managing referendums.  

This action underscores the importance of administrative clarity and the evolving role of political leadership in democratic processes such as referendums.
