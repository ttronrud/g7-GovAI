**Key Exemptions:**

1. **Exemption from Subsection 65.1(1) of the FAA**  
   - **Entities Exempted:**  
     - The **Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)**  
     - The **Communications Security Establishment (CSE)**  
   - **Reason for Exemption:**  
     - These agencies are classified as sensitive national security organizations.  
     - The exemption allows them to be exempt from the requirement to prepare and file financial statements in accordance with the standard financial reporting requirements under subsection 65.1(1) of the FAA.  
     - This is due to the nature of their operations, which involve classified information, operational secrecy, and the need for discretion in financial management.  
   - **Scope:**  
     - The exemption applies to all financial reporting obligations under subsection 65.1(1), including the requirement to file annual financial statements with the Treasury Board.

2. **Exemption from Subsection 131.1(1) of the FAA**  
   - **Entities Exempted:**  
     - The **Blue Water Bridge Authority**  
     - The **Canadian Dairy Commission**  
     - The **National Arts Centre Corporation**  
   - **Time Period of Exemption:**  
     - Applies only to the **first fiscal quarter ending after April 1, 2011**.  
     - This is a temporary, limited-duration exemption.  
   - **Reason for Exemption:**  
     - These Crown corporations are considered to have unique operational, structural, or strategic characteristics that make compliance with the full financial reporting requirements under subsection 131.1(1) impractical or disproportionate at this stage.  
     - The exemption is intended to provide flexibility during transitional periods or to allow these entities to focus on operational development, capital planning, or service delivery without the burden of immediate compliance with full financial disclosure standards.  
   - **Scope:**  
     - The exemption applies only to the requirement to prepare and file financial statements under subsection 131.1(1), which generally applies to Crown corporations requiring financial accountability and transparency.  
     - It does not extend to other reporting obligations, such as audit requirements or budgetary compliance, unless otherwise specified.

**Effective Date:**  
- The regulations come into force on **April 1, 2011**.  
- This date marks the beginning of the first fiscal quarter after which the exemptions apply (for the Crown corporations under subsection 131.1(1)).

**Purpose and Context:**  
This regulation reflects a balance between financial accountability and operational flexibility. While the *Financial Administration Act* mandates financial transparency and accountability for all federal institutions, certain entities—particularly those involved in national security or in early-stage development—require tailored treatment to protect sensitive operations or to allow for strategic growth.

The exemptions are not permanent and are subject to review. The Treasury Board may reassess or revoke them if financial accountability needs to be restored or if operational conditions change.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides targeted, temporary, and legally justified exemptions from financial reporting requirements under the *Financial Administration Act* for specific federal entities. It underscores the government’s recognition that some institutions—particularly those in sensitive or developmental phases—require flexibility in financial governance to fulfill their mandates effectively and securely. The exemptions are narrowly defined, time-limited, and grounded in statutory authority, ensuring that accountability is preserved while allowing operational discretion where appropriate.
