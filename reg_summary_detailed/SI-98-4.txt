Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided:

### **Regulation Summary: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**  
**Title:** Remission of Taxable Income from Relief Payments for Red River Floods (1997)

---

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes a special provision allowing for the **remission (i.e., exemption or forgiveness)** of certain income tax, Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Employment Insurance (EI) obligations that would otherwise be triggered by relief payments made in response to the **1997 Red River Basin flooding** in Manitoba.

The primary objective is to **prevent undue tax and benefit consequences** on individuals who received voluntary, non-employment-based relief payments due to natural disaster damage — specifically, flooding that occurred in or near the Red River Basin in April and May 1997.

---

#### **2. Background Context**
- In April and May 1997, severe flooding affected large areas of Manitoba, particularly around the Red River.
- Many individuals and businesses suffered significant financial losses due to property damage, displacement, and business interruption.
- In response, various relief payments were made to affected individuals to help them recover financially.
- Under the **Income Tax Act**, paragraph 6(1)(a) or (b), any payment made as relief for loss due to a disaster (such as flooding) is generally considered **income from employment** if it is:
  - Voluntary,
  - Reasonable and bona fide,
  - Not based on employment factors (e.g., performance, position, years of service),
  - Not made in exchange for past or future services or to compensate for lost income.

This creates a **taxable income inclusion** issue — meaning the payment would be treated as taxable income, which could lead to higher tax liabilities and potentially disqualify individuals from benefits under CPP or EI.

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Applicable Payments** | Payments made as **relief for loss due to flooding in or near the Red River Basin in April and May 1997**. |
| **Tax and Benefit Treatment** | The amount of such a payment that would otherwise be considered income under paragraph 6(1)(a) or (b) of the Income Tax Act is **exempt from taxation** (remitted). |
| **Conditions for Exemption** | The payment must meet **all of the following criteria**: <br> - It is **voluntary** (not forced or mandated). <br> - It is **reasonable and bona fide** (fair and genuinely intended to assist). <br> - It is **not based on employment factors** (e.g., performance, rank, tenure). <br> - It is **not made in exchange for past or future services** or to **compensate for loss of income**. |
| **Exemption Scope** | Applies to income tax, CPP, and EI obligations arising from the inclusion of the relief payment as income. |
| **Condition for Remission** | The taxpayer must **waive any benefit or right** under the Income Tax Act, Canada Pension Plan, or Employment Insurance Act that would otherwise accrue as a result of the payment. |

> This waiver is a **critical condition** — it ensures that the taxpayer does not gain a benefit (such as CPP contributions or EI benefits) from the same relief payment that is being treated as income.

#### **4. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under:
- **Subsection 23(2)(a)** and **23(2.1)(a)** of the **Financial Administration Act**.
- These provisions authorize the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board) to make special arrangements for the remission of tax or benefit obligations in the public interest.

---

#### **5. Public Interest Justification**
The regulation is justified on the grounds of **public interest**, recognizing that:
- The 1997 floods were a major natural disaster affecting thousands of people.
- Many individuals received relief payments that were not tied to employment but were essential for recovery.
- Treating such payments as taxable income could place an unfair burden on affected individuals, especially those with limited financial resources.
- The waiver of benefits ensures that the system remains fair and that no individual gains an advantage from a payment that is otherwise treated as income.

---

#### **6. Key Implications for Taxpayers**
- **Tax Benefit**: Taxpayers who received qualifying relief payments in 1997 will **not have to include the amount in their income** for tax purposes.
- **No Penalties or Interest**: The regulation specifically addresses the **remission of the amount plus relevant interest and penalties** that would otherwise apply due to the income inclusion.
- **Waiver Requirement**: Taxpayers must **formally waive any entitlements** under the Income Tax Act, CPP, or EI that arise from the payment. This may involve a written agreement or declaration.

---

#### **7. Limitations and Scope**
- Applies **only to payments made in April and May 1997** related to the Red River Basin flooding.
- Applies **only to relief payments** that meet the defined criteria (voluntary, reasonable, not employment-based, etc.).
- Does **not apply to other types of disaster relief** or payments from different disasters.
- Does **not extend to payments made after 1997** or unrelated to the Red River floods.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Administration**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board** are responsible for recommending the regulation.
- The **Governor General in Council** formally issues it, indicating it is a government-wide policy decision.
- Compliance and enforcement would be handled through tax authorities and benefit programs.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation provides a **temporary, targeted relief measure** to address a unique situation arising from a major natural disaster. It allows individuals who received voluntary, non-employment-based relief payments in 1997 due to the Red River floods to avoid having those payments treated as taxable income under the Income Tax Act, while ensuring that they do not gain benefits under CPP or EI as a result of the same payment. The requirement to waive benefits maintains the integrity of the public benefit systems and ensures fairness in the tax and social insurance regimes.

This provision is a notable example of how Canadian tax and social policy can respond flexibly to extraordinary events, balancing the need for fiscal accountability with humanitarian concerns.

**Note:** This regulation is now **historical** and not applicable to current or future disaster relief payments. It remains in force as a specific, one-time measure for the 1997 Red River floods. Modern disaster relief is typically governed by other policies, including the Canada Disaster Financial Assistance Program (CDFAP) and related tax provisions.
