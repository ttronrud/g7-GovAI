## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **ATC** | Automatic Temperature Compensator – an electronic device that adjusts volume measurements to correct for temperature variations. |
| **Metering Assembly** | A device used in trade to measure the volume of liquids (e.g., fuel dispensers, bulk storage systems). |
| **Reference Pressure** | The standard pressure used to correct volume readings: <br> - For liquids with vapor pressure < 101.325 kPa (14.73 psi): 101.325 kPa or 14.73 psi (absolute). <br> - For liquids with vapor pressure ≥ 101.325 kPa: the actual equilibrium vapor pressure at the measured temperature. |
| **VCF** | Volume Correction Factor – a value derived from temperature and density to correct measured volume to a standard reference condition (as defined in section 270 of the Regulations). |
| **Regulations** | Refers to the Weights and Measures Regulations (C.R.C., c. 1605). |

> All other terms are interpreted consistently with the Regulations.

## **Scope of Application**

These specifications apply to:
- All **metering assemblies** incorporating **electronic automatic temperature compensators (ATCs)**.
- Devices that **register volumes corrected to a reference temperature** (i.e., temperature-compensated volume readings).

> **Exception**: For **liquid petroleum products, liquefied petroleum gases, butane, and natural gas liquids**, the ATC may register volumes corrected to **15°C** and the reference pressure — a specific exception to standard temperature correction practices.

## **Design and Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Volume Registration**
- The register must register **net volume** (volume after accounting for temperature and density corrections).
- On **demand during inspection**, it must also register **gross volume** (total volume including container or pipeline volume).
- **Gross volume must be calculated directly from the measuring element’s signal**, not derived mathematically from net volume.

### 2. **Total Price Calculation**
- If the register includes **unit price and total price displays** and continuously records both net and gross volumes:
  - The **total price** must be calculated as:  
    **Total Price = Unit Price × Net Volume Delivered**

### 3. **Adjustment of ATC**
- Any adjustment mechanism for the ATC must be:
  - **Sealable** (to prevent unauthorized changes).
  - Located so that access requires **removal of part of the exterior housing** containing the ATC.

### 4. **Temperature Registration**
- The register must allow **on-demand inspection** of the **temperature of the liquid** being measured.
- The **minimum increment of temperature registration** must not exceed **0.1°C**.

### 5. **Temperature Sensor Requirements**
- Must be of the **interchangeable type**:
  - Replacing one sensor with another should not alter temperature readings by more than **0.3°C** across the ATC’s operating range.
- The sensor (or sensor + thermal well) must be **sealable**:
  - To prevent unauthorized exposure to the liquid.
  - To ensure integrity of the temperature measurement.

### 6. **Safety and Inoperability**
- The register must be **inoperable** if:
  - The electrical circuit for the temperature sensor is **shorted or incomplete**.
  - This prevents erroneous readings due to sensor failure.

### 7. **Multi-Liquid Operation**
- If an ATC is designed to operate with **multiple liquids**, it must have an **interlocking mechanism**:
  - Automatically selects the correct temperature correction factor based on the selected liquid.

### 8. **Density or Thermal Expansion Display**
- The register must clearly indicate, in a **legible and accessible manner**, one or more of the following:
  - The **density or cubical coefficient of thermal expansion per degree Celsius** of the liquid for which it is designed.
  - If multi-liquid use: the **range** of densities or expansion coefficients it supports.
  - The **density or expansion coefficient to which it is calibrated**.
  
  **Acceptable methods** include:
  - Permanent marking on the nameplate or metal tag.
  - Legible display or printing on demand.
  - Codes or legends linked to switch settings or jumper locations.
  - Any other method that ensures clear, immediate access.

> This requirement ensures transparency and traceability for inspectors and users.

---

## **Additional Requirements for Electronic Printers**

- Any **electronic printer** in a metering assembly (e.g., fuel dispensers, aircraft refuellers, bulk meters) equipped with an ATC must:
  - Print a **ticket** showing:
    - Net volume
    - Gross volume
    - The **density used to calculate the VCF**

> This enhances accountability and auditability of transactions.

---

## **Test Thermal Well Requirements**

- The **test thermal well** (used for calibration and testing) must:
  - Have an **inside diameter between 3.3 mm and 4.5 mm**.
  - Be installed **adjacent to the temperature sensor**.
  - Retain **thermal conducting fluid** during testing.
  - Have the **manufacturer’s name/trademark and model number** clearly marked on the end fitting.
  - If the end fitting is too small, the information may be affixed to a **metal tag**.

> Purpose: Ensures accurate and repeatable temperature testing under controlled conditions.

---

## **Performance and Accuracy Requirements**

### 1. **Temperature Range and Correction Accuracy**
- For meters measuring liquids at **ambient temperature**:
  - The ATC must correct measurements within the **applicable error limits** (as per section 270 of the Regulations) over a temperature range of **–30°C to +40°C**.
  - If the ATC’s nameplate indicates a wider range, it must perform within limits over that **wider range**.

- For meters measuring liquids at **non-ambient temperatures**:
  - The ATC must operate within error limits over the **temperature range marked on the nameplate**, which must cover **at least 50°C**.

### 2. **Behavior Outside Operating Range**
- If the liquid temperature is **outside the ATC’s operating range**, the device must:
  - **Automatically stop further deliveries**, or
  - **Continue operating** only if the VCF (volume correction factor) does not exceed the value corresponding to the actual liquid temperature.

> This prevents inaccurate or unsafe volume readings in extreme conditions.

---

## **Dynamic Response Time (Temperature Sensor Response)**

When a liquid at a temperature **±20°C from ambient** is suddenly introduced into the meter at a **mean velocity of ~3 m/s**, the temperature sensor must respond to **at least 90% of the temperature variation** within:
- **15 seconds** for **motor fuel dispensers**.
- **20 seconds** for **all other types of meters**.

> Test liquid: Mineral spirits or a liquid with similar physical properties.

> Purpose: Ensures the sensor can respond quickly to real-world temperature fluctuations in fluid flow.

---

## **Performance During Inspection**

- When inspected in **gross mode**, the meter equipped with an ATC must meet the **performance specifications** applicable to standard **volumetric liquid meters**.

> Ensures that even when not in correction mode, the device performs accurately under inspection conditions.

---

## **ATC Accuracy Under Test Conditions**

- The ATC and its temperature sensor must remain within the **applicable error limits** (as per section 270) when tested under the conditions specified in **sections 29 to 31** of the *Electronic Registers and Ancillary Equipment Incorporated in Metering Assemblies Specifications*.

---

## **Test Volume Requirements**

- The test volume for an ATC must be:
  - Equivalent to a **normal delivery** through the meter.
  - **At no time less than 2,000 times** the **minimum increment of registration** of the meter register (as defined in section 20 of the Electronic Registers Regulations).

> Ensures that performance is verified under realistic, meaningful conditions.

---

## **Sensor Installation Requirements**

- The temperature sensor must be:
  - Located **within 1 meter**
