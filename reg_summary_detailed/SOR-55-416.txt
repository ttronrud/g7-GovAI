### **Detailed Summary of the Defence Services Pension Part V Regulations**

These regulations govern the application and administration of **Part V of the Defence Services Pension Act** (the "Act") and are specifically applicable only to that part. They provide detailed rules on how pensions, gratuities, contributions, and service credits are calculated and managed for members of the Canadian Armed Forces and certain public service personnel who are eligible under Part V. The regulations clarify eligibility, contribution requirements, interest, service counting, and payment mechanisms, particularly in relation to prior service under other pension schemes.

---

## **1. Definitions and Scope**

The regulations begin with a clear definition of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Defence Services Pension Act*.
- **a(f) Ultimate Table**: A mortality table from 1924 (published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland) used to calculate pension benefits based on annuitant mortality rates.
- **Annuity**: A periodic payment (immediate or deferred) or annual allowance under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*.
- **Gratuity**: A one-month pay-and-allowances-per-year payment for service, as defined under various Acts (e.g., Public Service Superannuation Act, Civil Service Superannuation Act, RCMP Act).
- **Minister**: The Minister of National Defence.
- **Parts I to V**: The five parts of the Defence Services Pension Act.
- **Pension**: A benefit granted under Part V for service rendered.
- **Pensioner**: A person who has received a pension under Part V.
- **Public Service**: All branches of the Canadian public service to which the Public Service Superannuation Act applies.

> ⚠️ **Important**: These regulations apply *only* to Part V of the Act and do not govern other parts (e.g., Parts I–IV).

---

## **2. Contribution Rates and Start Dates**

- **Monthly contribution rates** are based on the **rank** of the contributor and are set out in **Section 3** of the Act (as referenced in the regulations).
- Contributions under Part V **commence on the date a person becomes subject to Part V**, meaning when they enter or re-enter the defence services under this scheme.

---

## **3. Refund of Contributions (Non-Eligibility)**

- If a person makes contributions under Part V but is later found **not eligible** as a contributor under that Part, **all contributions must be repaid without interest**.

---

## **4. Interest on Arrears of Contributions**

- Interest on arrears of contributions is calculated under **Sections 48 and 56 of the Act**.
- For interest computation:
  - The **total pay and allowances** received during a fiscal year are **deemed to have been received on October 1** of that year.
- The total arrears may be paid:
  - In **one lump sum**, or
  - In **installments** equivalent in value to the arrears.
- The **interest rate** is **4% per annum**, calculated using the **Canadian Life Table No. 2 (1941)**, for males or females as applicable.

---

## **5. Election to Pay Arrears**

- A contributor or former contributor may **at any time** choose to:
  - Pay arrears in **one sum**, or
  - Pay them in **installments** over a shorter period.
- **Exception**: If the **verified arrears exceed the provisional amount** submitted by the contributor:
  - The contributor may **elect once** to pay the **unpaid portion** of the verified arrears.
    - If originally elected to pay in **one sum**: Can pay either in one sum or in installments.
    - If originally elected to pay in **installments**: Can pay in installments over a **longer period**, **provided**:
      - The election is made **before acknowledging** the verified arrears as correct, **or**
      - The contributor acknowledged the verified amount as correct **before September 1, 1950**.

> ✅ This provides flexibility in managing arrears, especially if initial estimates were inaccurate.

---

## **6. Installment Payments (Section 7)**

- Installments are computed according to **Section 7** of the Act.
- **Limitation**: The amount of any installment **shall not be reduced by more than 5%** below the amount originally elected in the provisional computation.

> 🔍 This protects contributors from being overburdened by reduced payments after initial agreement.

---

## **7. Transfer of Contributions from Other Pension Schemes**

- Contributions made under **other parts of the Act**, the **Civil Service Superannuation Act**, the **Public Service Superannuation Act**, or the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act (excluding Part IV)** are **transferred to the Permanent Services Pension Account**.
- If the transferred contributions:
  - **Equal the full required contribution** for that service, and
  - **No annuity, gratuity, or other benefit** was paid,
  → Then they are considered **the appropriate contribution** for Part V purposes.

- If the transferred amount is **insufficient**, the contributor must pay the **remaining balance**:
  - In **one sum**, or
  - In **installments** as prescribed under Section 7.

> 💡 This ensures continuity of service credit across different pension systems.

---

## **8. Service Counting When Only a Benefit Was Paid**

- If a contributor had service for which only the **total contributions** were paid (i.e., no pension or gratuity), they may **count that service** under Part V **as if Section 11 applied**.
- If a **gratuity** was paid in respect of that service, the contributor may **count the whole or part of the service** under Part V.

### **Calculation of Contributions in Such Cases**:
- **Whole service counted**:
  - Contribution = **Gratuity amount + 4% simple interest** from the date of gratuity payment to the date of election to count.
- **Partial service counted**:
  - Contribution = **Proportional share** of the total gratuity and interest.

> 📌 Contributions can be paid in one sum or in installments (per Section 7).

---

## **9. Service Counting for Temporary or Fixed-Term Officers**

A contributor who had **temporary or fixed-term officer appointments** in the forces may have such service counted under Part V if:

### Case 1: Service before becoming a contributor under Part V
- The **deferred pay** (at 6% of pay and allowances) must be **transferred** to the Permanent Services Pension Account.
- Any **gratuity paid** for that service must be **refunded** by the contributor.

### Case 2: Service with refund of deferred pay or gratuity
- If the contributor was **paid back** the deferred pay or gratuity upon termination:
  - Must **re-contribute** the amount of deferred pay **plus 4% simple interest** from the date of refund to the date of election to count.
  - Must also **refund any gratuity paid**, plus **4% interest** from the date of payment to the date of election.

> ✅ This ensures fair treatment of temporary officers whose service was not initially recognized under Part V.

> 💰 Payment can be made in one sum or in installments (per Section 7).

---

## **10. Pay and Allowances for Service Counting**

When a contributor elects to count service under specific conditions (e.g., active service during war, civil service, RCMP, etc.), the **emoluments (pay and allowances)** used for computing contributions, pension, and gratuity are defined as follows:

| Service Type | Pay and Allowances |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Civil Service** | Same as would have been required under the *Civil Service Superannuation Act* or *Public Service Superannuation Act* |
| **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** | Same as would have been used to calculate pension under the *RCMP Act* |
| **Active Service in War (Naval, Army, Air Force)** | Full rates of pay and allowances (even if not actually paid), including: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Naval | Pay of rank, command money, specialist pay, non-substantive pay, staff pay, marriage/dependents’ allowances, subsistence allowance |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Army | Pay of rank, classified pay, consolidated pay, command pay, trades pay, additional pay, marriage/dependents’ allowances, subsistence allowance |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Air Force | Consolidated pay, classified pay, or pay of rank (excluding General List vs. Non-Flying differences), command and headquarters pay, marriage/dependents’ allowances, subsistence allowance |

> ⚠️ These rates apply **regardless of whether the allowances were actually paid**.

## **11. Contribution Amounts Based on Election Timing**

The amount of contribution required depends on **when the election was made**:

| Scenario | Contribution Amount |
|--------|---------------------|
| Contributor was a contributor immediately before the regulation came into force, served continuously, and elected within one year of the regulation's coming into force | Equal to what would have been required under subsection (1) of Section 48 |
| Former contributor (not covered by paragraph a) elected within one year after becoming a contributor | Same as above |
| Otherwise (not in either case) | Computed on **current rate of pay and allowances** as per Section 3 |

> 📌 This ensures fairness and consistency in contribution calculations based on timing and circumstances
