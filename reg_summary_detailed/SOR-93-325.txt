**Detailed Summary of the Gjoa Haven Airport Zoning Regulations (1993)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Publication Background**

The *Gjoa Haven Airport Zoning Regulations* were enacted under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, following a formal process of public consultation and notice. 

- A **proposed version** of the regulations was published in two successive issues of:
  - *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 6 and 13, 1993**
  - *News of the North* on **March 15 and 22, 1993**
- This publication provided **interested parties** (including the public, local communities, and stakeholders) with a **reasonable opportunity to submit representations or objections** to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on these consultations and recommendations, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the advice of the Minister of Transport, **officially enacted** the final regulations on **March 25, 1993**.

### **2. Title and Scope**

- **Official Title**: *Gjoa Haven Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all land**, including **public road allowances**, located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Gjoa Haven Airport** in the **Northwest Territories**.
- The specific geographic area covered is defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**, which describes the boundary and zones of influence around the airport.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Gjoa Haven Airport, located near Gjoa Haven, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point on the runway centerline, 670.55 meters from the threshold of runway 310T. Its elevation is **36.5 meters above sea level**. This point serves as the origin for measuring all surface elevations. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 130T–310T). These surfaces ensure safe aircraft approach by limiting obstructions that could interfere with visibility and flight paths. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (i.e., 36.5 + 45 = 81.5 meters above sea level)**, except where it would be less than 9 meters above ground level—then it is capped at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area, including the runway, measuring **150 meters in width** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,461.1 meters in length**. It is associated with runway 130T–310T. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until they meet the outer surface. These surfaces ensure smooth transitions between the runway area and the outer zone. |

### **4. Key Prohibitions and Zoning Restrictions**

**No person may:**
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object (existing or new) on land subject to these regulations  
- If the **highest point** of such structure exceeds any of the following:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This restriction ensures that no physical object (e.g., buildings, towers, trees, or mounds) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases by creating visual or physical obstructions.

---

### **5. Detailed Description of Key Surfaces**

#### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway Ends)**

Each approach surface is defined by an **inclined plane** rising at a **1:40 ratio** (1 meter vertically for every 40 meters horizontally):

- **Runway 130T Approach**:
  - Starts at the end of the strip.
  - Rises to a horizontal line **3,000 meters** horizontally from the end.
  - The outer ends of this line are **525 meters** from the runway centerline.
  - The horizontal line is **75 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

- **Runway 310T Approach**:
  - Identical in design to the 130T approach.
  - Same 1:40 slope, 3,000 m horizontal distance, 525 m offset from centerline, and 75 m elevation above the strip end.

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring clear visibility and unobstructed flight paths.

#### **B. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 81.5 meters above sea level).
- **Exception**: Where the outer surface would fall below **9 meters above ground level**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe land-based constraints.

> This surface defines the upper limit for all structures in the outermost zone of the airport.

#### **C. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertically for every 7 meters horizontally).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip** and its **approach surfaces**.
- Continue upward and outward until they intersect with the **outer surface**.
- These surfaces create a smooth, gradual transition from the runway area to the outer zone, helping maintain safe flight visibility and reducing abrupt changes in terrain or obstruction.

#### **D. Outer Boundary of the Zone**

- The land subject to the zoning rules is bounded by a **circle of 4,000 meters in radius**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This circle defines the **geographic scope** of the regulations — any land within this radius is subject to the height restrictions.

### **6. Supporting Documentation**

All spatial definitions and measurements are based on the **Gjoa Haven Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2845**, dated **April 18, 1990**, which provides the official layout and reference for the airport’s zoning and safety zones.

---

### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Flight Safety**: To ensure safe takeoff, landing, and approach operations by preventing obstructions that could compromise visibility or aircraft performance.
2. **Environmental and Land Use Planning**: To establish clear boundaries and height limits for development near the airport.
3. **Public and Stakeholder Engagement**: To provide transparency through public notice and opportunity for comment before final adoption.

---

### **8. Significance**

- These regulations represent a **critical component of aviation safety infrastructure** in remote northern Canada.
- They reflect international best practices in **airport zoning**, particularly in areas with limited infrastructure and high exposure to weather conditions.
- The inclusion of specific slope ratios (1:40 for approach, 1:7 for transition) and elevation thresholds demonstrates a **carefully engineered balance** between safety and land usability.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Gjoa Haven Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use and construction near Gjoa Haven Airport. By defining key surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) and setting strict height limits based on elevation and distance from the runway, the regulations protect aviation safety while providing a clear legal basis for land development decisions in the region.

These rules remain enforceable and are foundational for future planning, environmental assessments, and infrastructure projects in the vicinity of the airport.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- Height limits apply to all structures within a 4,000-meter radius of the ARP.
- No structure may exceed the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces.
- All measurements are based on the 1990 zoning plan and referenced to the ARP at 36.5 m above sea level.
- The regulations were developed through a transparent, public consultation process.
