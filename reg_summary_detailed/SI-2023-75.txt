The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically referencing the process by which Canada officially recognizes scientific assessments of endangered wildlife species. Here is a detailed summary of the regulation:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under the *Species at Risk Act*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is made under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the scientific assessments of wildlife species prepared by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Acknowledgment of Scientific Assessments:**  
   The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, formally acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments conducted by COSEWIC. These assessments are based on the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the status (e.g., threatened, endangered, extinct, etc.) of specific species.

2. **Species Covered:**  
   The assessments relate to species listed in the annexed schedule to the Order. These species are those identified by COSEWIC as being at risk of extinction in the wild, and the assessments are critical for determining their legal status under SARA.

3. **Legal Significance of the Acknowledgment:**  
   The formal acknowledgment by the federal government under this Order serves as a key procedural step in the implementation of SARA. It signals that the government has reviewed and accepted the scientific findings of COSEWIC, which are then used as the basis for making decisions on whether to list a species under SARA, and what conservation measures may be required.

4. **Purpose and Function:**  
   - To ensure transparency and scientific rigor in species protection decisions.  
   - To provide a formal record of when and how the government has received and recognized the expert evaluation of species at risk.  
   - To support the legal and policy framework for species conservation by establishing a clear link between scientific assessment and government action.

5. **Legal Context (SARA, subsection 23(1)):**  
   Subsection 23(1) of SARA requires that the Minister of the Environment, in consultation with COSEWIC, must, upon the making of this Order, acknowledge the receipt of COSEWIC assessments for species listed in the schedule. This step is a prerequisite for any subsequent listing or protection measures under the Act.

6. **Date of Enactment:**  
   This regulation is part of *Statutory Instrument 2002, c. 29*, which was enacted in 2002. This indicates it is one of the early formalizations of the SARA framework following the Act's passage in 2002.

7. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent scientific body that evaluates the status of wildlife species at risk in Canada. Its assessments are not binding but are the foundation upon which federal government decisions are made under SARA.

**Implications:**

- This Order ensures that the government is legally and procedurally aligned with the scientific evaluation of species at risk.  
- It facilitates timely and evidence-based conservation actions, such as the development of recovery strategies or the designation of critical habitats.  
- It enhances public confidence in the conservation process by demonstrating a commitment to science-based decision-making.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural but essential component of Canada’s species at risk protection framework. By formally acknowledging COSEWIC’s scientific assessments, the federal government validates the scientific basis for future conservation actions and ensures compliance with the requirements of the *Species at Risk Act*. It represents a key step in the process of protecting biodiversity in Canada through legally sound, science-driven policy.

*Note:* While this Order does not itself list species or impose new regulations, it is a foundational step that enables the Minister of the Environment to proceed with listing decisions, developing recovery plans, and implementing protection measures under SARA.
