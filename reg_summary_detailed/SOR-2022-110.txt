### **Detailed Summary of the Federal Halocarbon Regulations, 2022**

The **Federal Halocarbon Regulations, 2022** are a comprehensive set of environmental regulations issued under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, specifically to regulate the use, handling, storage, and disposal of **halocarbons** — a class of synthetic chemicals known to deplete the ozone layer and contribute to climate change. These regulations were developed in response to scientific evidence of the environmental harm caused by certain halocarbons and aim to reduce their release into the atmosphere while ensuring safe and responsible management.

## **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulations were made pursuant to:
  - **Section 209c and 286.1d of CEPA 1999**, which authorize the Minister of the Environment to regulate substances that pose a risk to the environment or human health.
  - **Section 5(1) of the Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act (EMAPA)**, which allows for administrative penalties for violations.

- **Procedural Compliance**:
  - A **proposed regulation** was first published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **November 14, 2020**, giving stakeholders time to submit comments or file objections.
  - The Minister of the Environment conducted **consultations** with:
    - Territorial governments (where applicable),
    - Members of the **National Advisory Committee** representing **Aboriginal governments** with jurisdiction over Aboriginal lands.
  - This consultation process ensured inclusive and transparent decision-making.

- **Final Adoption**:  
  The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, formally adopted the **Federal Halocarbon Regulations, 2022**, effective upon publication.

## **2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **halocarbon-containing systems and containers** located in Canada, including:

| System/Container Type | Scope |
|------------------------|-------|
| **Air-conditioning systems** | Any system with compressor, condenser, evaporator, and expansion valve containing or designed to contain a halocarbon. |
| **Refrigeration systems** | Similar to air-conditioning systems; includes commercial and industrial refrigeration. |
| **Solvent systems** | Systems using halocarbons as solvents (e.g., cleaning applications). Excludes lab standards or chemical conversions. |
| **Fire-extinguishing systems** | Portable or fixed systems containing halocarbon fire agents. |
| **Containers** | Any vessel designed for storage or transport of halocarbons. |

> ❌ **Exclusions**:
> - **Foam products** (e.g., foamed plastics) are explicitly excluded from scope.

> 📍 **Geographic Coverage**:
> - Applies to systems located on:
>   - **Federal lands** (e.g., government-owned properties),
>   - **Aboriginal lands** (where Aboriginal governments have jurisdiction),
>   - Owned by **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, federal agencies, Crown corporations, or federal undertakings.

## **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Halocarbon** | Any substance listed in **Schedule 1**, including isomers. These are chemicals containing chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or carbon (e.g., CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs). |
| **Certified Person** | A person who: <br> • Holds a valid certificate from at least one province proving completion of an environmental awareness course on recycling, recovery, and handling; <br> • Is recognized by the Canadian Forces or a province as qualified to service halocarbon systems. |
| **Installation** | Refers to: <br> • Joining components in HVAC or solvent systems; <br> • Adding components to a fire-extinguishing system to make it operational; <br> • Making a new portable fire-extinguisher available. |
| **Large System** | A system with: <br> • One circuit >10 kg of halocarbon; or <br> • Multiple circuits, one of which exceeds 10 kg. |
| **Small System** | A system with all circuits ≤10 kg of halocarbon. |
| **Service** | Any work involving halocarbon components: charging, leak detection, repair, disassembly. |
| **Recycling** | Recovering and cleaning halocarbons for reuse in systems. |
| **Reclamation** | Recovery, reprocessing, and upgrading (e.g., distillation, chemical treatment) to meet industry standards for reuse. |
| **Responsible Person** | The individual or entity responsible for the service and operation of a system or container. |

## **4. Prohibited Activities (Key Environmental Prohibitions)**

### **Prohibited Releases**
A person **must not release** a halocarbon from:
- Air-conditioning, refrigeration, or fire-extinguishing systems,
- Equipment used in recycling, reclamation, or storage.

> **Exceptions**:
> - Calibration of leak-detecting devices (using equipment designed for that purpose and following manufacturer’s procedures).
> - Connecting/disconnecting hoses <1 meter used for charging/recovery.
> - Purge systems emitting <0.1 kg halocarbon per kg of air purged.
> - Fire-extinguishing systems used in actual firefighting (not training) or authorized testing in military vehicles.

### **Prohibited Installations and Uses**

| Activity | Restrictions |
|--------|-------------|
| **Install/activate** systems with halocarbons (Items 1–9 in Schedule 1) | Only allowed if: <br> • Reactivating the same system at the same site; <br> • Installing in a military vehicle; <br> • Installing during new civilian aircraft manufacturing (under Chicago Convention); <br> • Permitted by a permit under subsection 20(2). |
| **Use solvent systems** with halocarbons (Items 1–9) | **Prohibited entirely**. |
| **Use solvent systems** with halocarbons (Items 11–12) | Only allowed with a **permit under subsection 20(2)**. |

### **Prohibited Storage and Transport**
- Halocarbons **must be stored and transported only in containers** specifically designed and manufactured to:
  - Be refilled,
  - Contain the exact type of halocarbon.

> Exception: Use in **laboratory analytical standards or reagents** is permitted.

### **Prohibited Operation of Chillers**
- **Chillers** (defined as air-conditioning/refrigeration systems with compressor, evaporator, and secondary coolant — excluding absorption chillers) **must not operate** if they contain a halocarbon listed in Items 1–9 of Schedule 1.

### **Prohibited Purge Systems**
- Any purge system (including recovery equipment) **must emit less than 0.1 kg of halocarbon per kg of air purged** to the environment.

### **Prohibited Leak Testing**
- **No charging** of systems or containers **for leak testing purposes**.

## **5. Mandatory Charging Requirements**

A person **must not charge** a system with a halocarbon unless:
1. The system has been **previously leak tested**;
2. If a leak is detected, it has been **notified to and repaired by the owner**.

> **Exception**:  
> If immediate danger to human life or the environment exists, section 10 does **not apply** during the period of danger.

> Upon charging under such emergency conditions:
> - The charger must **immediately notify the owner**;
> - The owner must submit a **report within 7 days** (paper or electronic format) to the Minister, including details in **Part 1 of Schedule 2**.

> **Note**: Charging is prohibited for halocarbons in Items 1–9 of Schedule 1.
