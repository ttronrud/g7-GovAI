**2. Core Provision**  
The central objective of this Order is to **extend the right to access personal information** under **subsection 12(1) of the Privacy Act** to a previously excluded group.

**3. Scope of the Extension**  
The extension specifically applies to:  
- **Inmates** who are **not Canadian citizens or permanent residents**, as defined under subsection 2(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA).  

This means that individuals currently serving time in correctional facilities under the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act* (CCRA), even if they are non-citizens and not permanent residents, are now granted the same right as Canadian citizens and permanent residents to access personal information held by government institutions.

**4. Definition of Key Terms**  
- **Inmate**: As defined in **subsection 2(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA)**, this refers to a person who is in custody under the jurisdiction of the correctional system, including those serving sentences in federal or provincial prisons.  
- **Canadian citizen or permanent resident**: As defined in **subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**, these are individuals who hold legal status under Canadian immigration law. The extension explicitly excludes those who do not fall into either of these categories.

**5. Legal and Policy Significance**  
- **Equal Access to Information**: This Order ensures that non-citizen inmates have the same right as Canadian citizens and permanent residents to request access to personal information held by federal institutions. This aligns with the principle of fairness, transparency, and accountability enshrined in the *Privacy Act*.  
- **Human Rights and Due Process**: By extending access rights, the Order supports due process and the right to know, which are fundamental in the administration of justice and correctional systems. Inmates, regardless of immigration status, have a legitimate interest in understanding the personal data held about them—such as medical records, criminal history, or disciplinary actions.  
- **Alignment with Canadian Privacy Principles**: The extension reflects a commitment to privacy rights for all individuals, even those who are not permanent residents, reinforcing the inclusive nature of Canada’s privacy regime.

**6. Practical Implications**  
- Inmates who are not citizens or permanent residents can now:  
  - Submit formal requests to access personal information held by federal departments or agencies (e.g., correctional services, health authorities, or law enforcement).  
  - Receive responses in a timely and transparent manner, as required under the *Privacy Act*.  
- This applies to all personal information that falls within the scope of the *Privacy Act*, such as records related to identity, medical history, legal proceedings, or disciplinary actions.

**7. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The extension does **not** extend access rights to information that is exempt under the *Privacy Act* (e.g., information that would compromise national security or public safety).  
- The Order does **not** alter the conditions under which access requests are processed or the fees, if any, associated with such requests.  
- It only applies to personal information held by government institutions and does not cover private-sector data.

**8. Purpose and Intent**  
The primary intent of this Order is to:  
- Ensure equitable treatment of all individuals within the correctional system.  
- Strengthen accountability and transparency in how personal information is managed.  
- Support the rights of individuals, regardless of immigration status, to understand and control information about themselves.
