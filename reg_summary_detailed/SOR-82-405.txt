**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Special Areas Industrial Renewal Order"**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

This regulation, formally titled the **Special Areas Industrial Renewal Order**, establishes a framework to address economic hardship and social challenges in specific regions of the provinces of **Quebec and Ontario**. The primary objective is to promote **economic expansion and social adjustment** in areas suffering from an **exceptional inadequacy of productive employment opportunities**.

The regulation is grounded in the recognition that these designated areas face structural disadvantages—such as limited industrial development, underemployment, and poor access to economic opportunities—that hinder sustainable growth and community well-being. Therefore, **special measures** are necessary to stimulate economic development and improve living conditions.

### **2. Legal Basis**

The Order is enacted under **sections 6 and 7 of the Department of Regional Economic Expansion Act**. These provisions empower the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion to:

- Consult with provincial governments (Quebec and Ontario),
- Engage stakeholders including residents, voluntary groups, agencies, and local bodies,
- Designate specific geographic areas as "special areas" requiring targeted intervention,
- Approve comprehensive plans for economic and social development.

This ensures a **collaborative, inclusive, and evidence-based** approach to regional renewal.
