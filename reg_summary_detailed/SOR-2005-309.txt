The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2013-20, s. 8]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2013-20, section 8**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
This specific regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on the date specified in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada* (SOR/2013-20), which was published on **April 10, 2013**. Section 8 of that order explicitly repealed the prior regulation that was previously in effect.

**What Was Repealed?**  
While the exact content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the reference to "SOR/2013-20, s. 8" indicates that this section of the 2013 Order repealed a prior regulation, likely related to a specific area of federal administration — such as licensing, environmental standards, workplace safety, or financial regulation — depending on the context of the original regulation.

**Purpose of Repeal**:  
Regulations are often repealed when:
- They are outdated or no longer relevant.
- They conflict with newer legislation.
- They are superseded by more comprehensive or updated rules.
- They create administrative or legal confusion.

In this case, the repeal was part of a broader legislative or regulatory modernization effort, likely to streamline governance, eliminate redundancy, or align with updated policy objectives.

**Key Points**:
- The regulation was **not active** after April 10, 2013.
- Its content is **no longer enforceable or applicable**.
- The repeal is **official and legally binding**, meaning any reference to it in legal or administrative contexts is invalid.
- The repeal was enacted under the authority of the federal government to manage regulatory frameworks.

**Note on Information Gap**:  
Since the original regulation’s full text or subject matter is not provided in your input, a precise summary of *what it regulated* (e.g., specific procedures, standards, or requirements) cannot be offered. To obtain that, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation that was repealed by SOR/2013-20, section 8 — which may be found in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada* or through the Government of Canada’s official legislation database (e.g., [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)).
