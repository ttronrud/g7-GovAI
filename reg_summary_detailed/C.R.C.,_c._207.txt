**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Order* is a regulatory instrument under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario. It establishes the framework for the regulation of greenhouse vegetable marketing, particularly in interprovincial and export trade. The Order defines key terms, outlines the powers of the relevant regulatory bodies, and specifies the authority of the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers' Marketing Board (the "Commodity Board") to impose levies and charges on producers and marketers.

This Order is intended to ensure fair market practices, support producers, manage market fluctuations, and promote stability in the greenhouse vegetable sector—particularly for tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce—grown in controlled environments such as greenhouses or enclosed structures.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario. This foundational legislation provides the legal basis for the establishment and operation of marketing boards and their powers over agricultural commodities.

2. **Board**  
   Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario*, a provincial body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of farm products, including greenhouse vegetables, both within Ontario and in interprovincial/export markets.

3. **Commodity Board**  
   The *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers' Marketing Board*, established under the Act specifically to regulate the marketing of greenhouse vegetables. It operates under the broader framework of the Farm Products Marketing Act and is responsible for managing the economic and market aspects of greenhouse vegetable production and trade.

4. **Greenhouse Vegetables**  
   Defined as tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce produced in Ontario within a greenhouse or any other enclosed structure (e.g., under glass, plastic, or other materials) designed to control temperature and protect plants from environmental conditions.

5. **Plan**  
   Refers to any marketing plan established and periodically amended under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, as well as any regulations made to implement or support that plan. The Plan guides how greenhouse vegetables are marketed, priced, and distributed, and may include provisions on pricing, allocation, and market access.

### **Regulatory Authority and Scope**

#### **Shared Powers of the Board and Commodity Board**
- Both the Board and the Commodity Board are authorized to regulate the **marketing of greenhouse vegetables** in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
  - **Export trade** (sales outside of Ontario)

- With respect to persons and property located **within Ontario**, they may exercise **all or any powers** that they would have under the Act and the Plan when regulating **local marketing** of greenhouse vegetables.

> This means that the regulatory tools and powers used for domestic sales (e.g., pricing, allocation, quality standards) can be applied equally to interprovincial and export markets, ensuring consistency and fairness.

---

### **Specific Powers of the Commodity Board**

#### **Revocation Note**
- The section previously granting the Commodity Board authority to impose levies was **revoked by SOR/80-90** (a statutory order from 1980).  
> This indicates that the current version of the Order operates **without** the prior levy authority, suggesting that the Commodity Board no longer has the power to impose levies or charges under that earlier provision.

#### **Current Authority (Post-Revocation)**
As of the current version of the Order, **the Commodity Board does not have explicit authority to impose levies or charges** on producers or marketers for greenhouse vegetables in interprovincial or export trade.

> However, the original provision (now revoked) described a key function:  
> - To **make orders** fixing, imposing, and collecting **levies or charges** from persons engaged in the production or marketing of greenhouse vegetables.  
> - To **classify** these persons into different groups (e.g., small vs. large producers) and set **different levies or charges** for each group.  
> - To **use the collected funds** for:
>   - Creating **reserves** (funds set aside for future use)
>   - Covering **expenses and losses** from the sale or disposal of greenhouse vegetables
>   - **Equalizing or adjusting** payments among producers based on revenues generated from sales during specific periods

> Despite the revocation of this provision, the **intent and structure** of the original power remain in the Order as a historical reference.

### **Implications and Interpretation**

1. **Current Status of Levies**  
   Since the power to impose levies was revoked by SOR/80-90, the Commodity Board **no longer has the legal authority** to collect levies or charges from greenhouse vegetable producers or marketers for interprovincial or export trade.

2. **Funding and Financial Resilience**  
   The original purpose of levies—such as creating reserves or compensating producers during market downturns—has been **removed from the current regulatory framework**. This may mean that producers now rely on other mechanisms (e.g., government subsidies, insurance, or market-based pricing) to manage financial risks.

3. **Market Stability and Equalization**  
   The ability to equalize income among producers based on sales performance was a key tool for reducing disparities in income, especially during poor market years. With the revocation of levy authority, this mechanism is no longer available.

4. **Continuity of Regulatory Oversight**  
   Despite the removal of levy powers, the Commodity Board retains its role in:
   - Developing and implementing the *Plan* for marketing greenhouse vegetables
   - Coordinating market access and trade policies
   - Acting as a representative body for producers in interprovincial and export markets

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Order* provides a foundational regulatory structure for the marketing of greenhouse vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce) in Ontario. While it originally granted the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers' Marketing Board (Commodity Board) significant powers to impose levies and charges to stabilize markets and support producers, **these powers have been revoked** by SOR/80-90.

As a result:
- The Commodity Board **no longer collects levies or charges** from producers.
- The mechanisms for creating reserves, covering losses, or equalizing producer incomes are **no longer operational** under this Order.
- The Board still retains authority to regulate interprovincial and export marketing, and to operate under the Plan established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*.

This Order reflects a shift in policy toward market-based regulation, possibly in response to changing economic conditions, producer preferences, or legislative review. Its current form emphasizes oversight and coordination over direct financial intervention.

**Note for Practitioners and Policymakers**:  
This Order should be read in conjunction with the *Farm Products Marketing Act* and any current regulations or plans that may have been introduced to replace or supplement the revoked levy provisions. Any future changes to greenhouse vegetable marketing policy would likely require new legislation or amendments to the Act.
