**Detailed Summary of the Caribbean Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Caribbean Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order* and may be cited as such. This Order establishes the legal framework under which the Caribbean Development Bank (the "Organization") and its representatives, officials, and experts enjoy certain privileges and immunities when operating in Canada.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
- **"Convention"**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, a multilateral treaty that grants specific legal protections and immunities to UN bodies, officials, and representatives.  
- **"Organization"**: Refers to the *Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)*, a regional financial institution established to promote economic development in the Caribbean region.

---

**3. Legal Capacity of the Organization in Canada**  
The Caribbean Development Bank is granted the **legal capacity of a body corporate** in Canada. This means that the Organization can:
- Enter into contracts,
- Own property,
- Sue and be sued,
- Hold legal rights and obligations in the same way as a private corporation.

This status is essential for enabling the CDB to operate independently and effectively in Canada, including in financial, administrative, and legal transactions.

Additionally, the Organization shall have, **to such extent as it may require**, the **privileges and immunities** specified in **Articles II and III of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**. These include:
- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., being sued in civil or criminal proceedings),
- **Immunity from search and seizure**,
- **Exemption from taxation** (such as income, property, or corporate taxes),
- **Freedom from interference with its operations** by Canadian authorities,
- **Exemption from certain customs duties** and other regulatory burdens.

These privileges are granted only to the extent necessary for the Organization to carry out its functions effectively and without undue interference.

**4. Privileges and Immunities for State Representatives**  
Representatives of **member states** of the Caribbean Development Bank who are performing official duties in Canada shall, to the extent required for the performance of their functions, have the **privileges and immunities set out in Article IV of the Convention**. These include:
- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., being served with legal documents),
- **Immunity from arrest or detention**,
- **Exemption from certain taxes and duties**,
- **Freedom from interference** in their official duties.

This ensures that diplomatic and governmental representatives of member states can conduct their official work in Canada without fear of legal action or obstruction.

**5. Privileges and Immunities for Organization Officials**  
All **officials** of the Caribbean Development Bank who are stationed or operating in Canada shall, to the extent required for their duties, have the **privileges and immunities set out in Article V of the Convention**. These include:
- **Immunity from civil and criminal liability** in relation to acts performed in the course of their official duties,
- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., being sued or having property seized),
- **Exemption from certain taxes** (e.g., income tax, property tax),
- **Freedom from interference** with their official functions.

This protection ensures that staff members can carry out their responsibilities professionally and without fear of personal liability.

**6. Privileges and Immunities for Experts on Missions**  
Experts (such as technical advisors, consultants, or specialists) who are assigned to perform missions for the Organization in Canada shall, to the extent required for their functions, have the **privileges and immunities set out in Article VI of the Convention**. These include:
- **Immunity from civil and criminal liability** for acts performed in the course of their expert duties,
- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., being sued or having property seized),
- **Exemption from certain taxes and duties**,
- **Freedom from interference** with their work.

This allows experts to provide specialized services without being subject to legal or financial risks that could disrupt their work.

---

**7. Important Limitation: Tax Liability**  
A critical exception to the above privileges is that:
> *Nothing in this Order exempts a person who is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada from liability for any taxes or duties imposed by any law in Canada.*

This means:
- Canadian citizens or permanent residents, regardless of their role (e.g., as a CDB official, expert, or representative), **remain subject to Canadian tax laws**.
- They **cannot claim immunity from income, capital gains, property, or other taxes** simply because they are acting in an official capacity.
- This provision ensures that Canada retains its sovereign right to tax its own residents and citizens, even when they are performing duties on behalf of the Organization.

This limitation balances international protections with national fiscal responsibilities.

---

**8. Scope and Purpose**  
The Order is designed to:
- Enable the Caribbean Development Bank to operate efficiently and independently in Canada,
- Facilitate international cooperation by protecting the legal and operational integrity of the Organization and its personnel,
- Provide a clear legal basis for the privileges and immunities of officials, representatives, and experts under the framework of the UN Convention.

It applies specifically to activities and functions carried out **in Canada** and is limited to the extent necessary for the performance of official duties.

---

**9. Interpretation and Application**  
- The privileges and immunities are **not absolute** and are granted only to the extent required for the performance of specific functions.
- The Order does **not** extend to individuals acting outside their official duties or in a personal capacity.
- The provisions are **non-exhaustive**—they do not cover all possible legal issues, and other Canadian laws may still apply.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Caribbean Development Bank Privileges and Immunities Order* provides a legally binding framework that allows the Caribbean Development Bank to function effectively in Canada by granting it corporate status and specific immunities and privileges aligned with the United Nations Convention. These protections extend to the Organization itself, its state representatives, officials, and experts. However, a key safeguard is that **Canadian citizens and permanent residents remain fully liable for Canadian taxes**, ensuring that national fiscal sovereignty is preserved. This Order promotes international cooperation while respecting Canadian legal and fiscal boundaries.
