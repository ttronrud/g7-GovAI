### **3. Prescribed Entities (Non-Canadians)**

Under **paragraph (d) of the definition "non-Canadian" in Section 2 of the Act**, the following entities are considered non-Canadians for regulatory purposes:

1. **Entities formed outside Canada or outside a province**  
   → Any company or organization created under foreign laws.

2. **Entities formed under Canadian or provincial law** but:
   - Are **not listed on a Canadian stock exchange**; and
   - **Lack a designation under Section 262 of the Income Tax Act** (i.e., not publicly traded or exempted from reporting requirements); and
   - Are **controlled by another entity or individual** that falls under one of the following categories of non-Canadians:
     - A foreign national (as defined in the Act)
     - A person who is a non-Canadian under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of the definition in Section 2

> This ensures that even entities formed in Canada may still be treated as foreign-controlled if they are not publicly traded and are under the control of a non-Canadian.

---

### **4. Prescribed Real Property (Exclusion from Definition of "Residential Property")**

> **Repealed by SOR/2023-66, s. 3**

- **Previously defined:**  
  A property located **outside any census agglomeration or census metropolitan area** is considered a "prescribed real property" or immovable.

- **Implication:**  
  This meant that residential properties in rural or remote areas (outside major urban centers) were **exempt** from the prohibition on non-Canadian purchases.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This provision has been **repealed** as of the coming into force of SOR/2023-66, s. 3 — meaning **all residential property in Canada is now subject to the purchase restriction**, regardless of location.

---

### **5. What Constitutes a "Purchase"**

A **purchase** includes:
- Any **acquisition** (with or without conditions) of:
  - A legal or equitable interest
  - A real right
  - In a residential property

> This broad definition covers not just direct buying, but also transfers involving mortgages, leases, or other interests in real estate.

---

### **6. Exclusions from the Purchase Prohibition**

A purchase is **not** considered a violation of the Act if it falls under any of the following exceptions:

1. **Acquisition by an individual** due to:
   - Death
   - Divorce
   - Separation
   - Gift

2. **Rental of a dwelling unit** to a tenant for the tenant’s occupation

3. **Transfer under a trust** created **before** the Act came into force

4. **Transfer resulting from the exercise of a security interest or secured right** by a secured creditor (e.g., a bank enforcing a mortgage)

5. **Acquisition by a non-Canadian for development purposes** (e.g., building a new home or commercial structure)

> These exceptions protect legitimate property transfers and prevent unintended application of the law.

---

### **7. Eligibility for Non-Canadians (Temporary Residents)**

For temporary residents, the Act sets out **specific conditions** under **paragraph 4(2)(a)** to allow a purchase.

To qualify, a temporary resident must satisfy **one of the following**:

### **8. Prescribed Classes of Persons (Exempt from Prohibition)**

Under **paragraph 4(2)(d)** of the Act, the following individuals are **exempt** from the purchase prohibition:

1. **Foreign nationals** holding a passport with a valid:
   - Diplomatic
   - Consular
   - Official
   - Special representative acceptance  
   (Issued by the Chief of Protocol, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development)

2. **Foreign nationals with temporary resident status** who:
   - Received their visa or status **after an exemption under Section 25.2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act**
   - The exemption was deemed **justified based on public policy** (e.g., safe haven for refugees fleeing conflict)

3. **Persons who have made a refugee claim** under subsection 99(3) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*:
   - If the claim was found eligible
   - And referred to the **Refugee Protection Division** under subsection 100(1)

> These exemptions recognize humanitarian, diplomatic, and security-based justifications for allowing non-Canadians to purchase property.

---

### **9. Judicial Remedies and Enforcement (Section 7 of the Act)**

An **order** may be issued by a superior court under subsection 7(1) of the Act **only if**:

1. The **non-Canadian is the current owner** of the residential property at the time of the order  
2. **Notice** has been given to all persons who may be entitled to receive proceeds from the sale  
3. The **superior court is satisfied** that:
   - The impact of the order would **not be disproportionate** to:
     - The nature and gravity of the contravention
     - The circumstances of the violation
     - The resulting conviction

> This ensures that enforcement is proportionate and respects due process.

---

### **10. Distribution of Sale Proceeds (Order Requirements)**

Proceeds from the sale of a property subject to an enforcement order must be distributed in the following **strict order**:

1. **Payment of sale costs**  
   - Includes costs of the sale  
   - Costs incurred by the Minister in bringing the legal application  
   - Any **unpaid fines** imposed under the Act by the non-Canadian

2. **Payment to other entitled parties**  
   - To those (other than the non-Canadian) who are legally entitled to proceeds  
   - Amounts and priorities determined by the superior court

3. **Repayment to the non-Canadian**  
   - Limited to an amount **not greater than the original purchase price**

4. **Payment to the Receiver General for Canada**  
   - Any remaining funds go to the federal government

> This structure prioritizes accountability, fairness, and public revenue.

---

### **11. Constitutional Safeguards**

- **Section 4(3)** of the Act provides that:
  - The prohibition in Section 4(1) **does not apply** if it would be **incompatible with rights recognized and affirmed under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982** (e.g., Aboriginal rights or treaty rights)

> This ensures that the law does not infringe upon constitutional rights, particularly Indigenous rights to land or self-governance
