The provided text consists of repeated references to the repeal of certain sections of a regulatory instrument, specifically:

- **SOR/2013-48, s. 12**  
- **SOR/2009-59, s. 1**

However, **no actual regulation or text** is included in the query—only references to repealed sections. As a result, there is **no detailed summary of a regulation** to provide, because the regulation itself has been repealed and is no longer in force.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of Regulation* in Canada, typically issued under the authority of a federal or provincial government.
- **SOR/2013-48, s. 12** and **SOR/2009-59, s. 1** refer to specific sections of regulatory instruments that were formally repealed.
- The repeated mention of "Repealed, SOR/2013-48, s. 12" and "Repealed, SOR/2009-59, s. 1" indicates that these sections were removed from legal effect by subsequent amendments or legislation.
- The repeal date and instrument (e.g., SOR/2013-48) suggest that the regulation was replaced or superseded by a newer legal framework.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active regulation** to summarize because the referenced sections have been **officially repealed**. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation is not possible—**the regulation no longer exists in force**.

If you are seeking information about:
- What the repealed regulation originally governed (e.g., licensing, safety standards, environmental rules),
- The reason for its repeal,
- What replaced it,

…then additional context (such as the name of the statute or the subject matter—e.g., transportation, health, agriculture) would be required to locate or summarize the original regulation.

Please provide more details (e.g., the subject area or the parent statute), and I would be happy to assist with historical or contextual information about the repealed regulation.
