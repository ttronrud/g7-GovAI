**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Defining "Official Development Assistance" (ODA)**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

This regulation, enacted under the *Official Development Assistance Accountability Act* (ODA Accountability Act), establishes a formal and legally binding definition of **"official development assistance" (ODA)** for the Government of Canada. The primary objective is to ensure transparency, accountability, and consistency in how Canada reports and manages its international development funding.

The regulation is grounded in international standards, specifically the most recent definition of ODA adopted by the **Development Assistance Committee (DAC)** of the **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**. This alignment ensures that Canada’s ODA reporting aligns with global best practices and international benchmarks, facilitating comparability with other developed countries and supporting multilateral development cooperation.

### **2. Legal Basis**

- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister for International Development**.
- It is authorized under **Section 3.1a of the Official Development Assistance Accountability Act**.
- The legislation was originally introduced in **S.C. 2008, c. 17** and further amended by **Section 657 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 2 (S.C. 2018, c. 27)**.

### **3. Definition of "Official Development Assistance"**

For the purposes of the *Official Development Assistance Accountability Act*, **"official development assistance" (ODA)** means:

> International assistance that:
> 
> - **Meets the criteria set out in the OECD DAC’s definition of ODA**, as published on the OECD website and as amended from time to time; **or**
> - **Meets the criteria set out in subsection 4(1.1) of the ODA Accountability Act**.

This dual-definition structure ensures that:
- Canada remains aligned with international standards (OECD DAC), which are widely accepted in the global development community.
- There is a fallback to the domestic legislative definition (subsection 4(1.1)) in case of discrepancies or when the OECD definition is not yet updated or accessible.

### **4. Language Requirements for OECD Definition Updates**

A key provision in the regulation clarifies how updates to the OECD’s ODA definition are incorporated:

> Any amendment to the OECD DAC’s definition of ODA is **only incorporated into Canadian law when it is available in both official languages of Canada** — **English and French**.

This ensures **equal access and legal consistency** for all Canadians, regardless of language, and reflects Canada’s bilingual character and commitment to linguistic equity in public policy.

### **5. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 657 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 2** comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered (officially published) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

This provides a clear and predictable timeline for implementation, allowing government departments and stakeholders to plan accordingly.

> **Note**: These regulations were in force as of **April 1, 2022**, as indicated by the reference to SI/2021-29 (a Statutory Instrument).

### **6. Key Implications and Significance**

- **Accountability and Transparency**: By adopting the OECD DAC definition, Canada enhances the transparency and comparability of its development spending, enabling better public scrutiny and informed decision-making.
- **Global Alignment**: Canada’s ODA reporting now matches international standards, which is essential for participation in global development financing, multilateral agreements, and donor coordination.
- **Legal Clarity**: The regulation provides a clear, legally enforceable definition of what constitutes ODA, reducing ambiguity in financial reporting and budgeting.
- **Bilingual Equity**: The language requirement ensures that all Canadians, especially in Francophone regions, have equal access to and understanding of the official definition of ODA.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

This regulation is a foundational step in strengthening Canada’s international development framework. By formally adopting the OECD DAC’s ODA definition — with safeguards for language access and clear implementation timelines — it ensures that Canada’s development assistance is:

- Measured consistently,
- Accounted for transparently,
- Aligned with international standards, and
- Accessible to all Canadians in both official languages.

This supports Canada’s broader goals of responsible, effective, and equitable international development cooperation.

**Final Note**: This regulation is not merely definitional — it is a critical tool for ensuring that Canada’s development spending is both accountable and globally credible.
