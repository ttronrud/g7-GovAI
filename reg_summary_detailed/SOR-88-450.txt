### **Detailed Summary of the Wiarton Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Wiarton Airport Zoning Regulations** are a formal set of rules established under **section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**, which grants the Minister of Transport the authority to regulate land use around airports to ensure safety and operational efficiency.

- The proposed regulations were **published twice in the Canada Gazette, Part I**, on **December 26, 1987**, and **January 2, 1988**, and also published in two local newspapers — the *Wiarton Echo* (January 27 and February 3, 1988), and the *Owen Sound Sun Times* (January 28 and 29, 1988).
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties (e.g., landowners, community members, aviation stakeholders)** to submit written representations or objections to the Minister.
- Based on the public consultation and recommendations, the **Governor in Council**, acting on the advice of the **Minister of Transport**, officially adopted these regulations.

#### **2. Official Name and Scope**

- **Title**: *Wiarton Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Wiarton Airport**, including public road allowances.
- The specific lands are **detailed in Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulation.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Wiarton Airport, located in the Township of Keppel, County of Grey, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used for elevation and spatial measurements. It is located **247.5 meters southeasterly at right angles** from the centerline of runway 05–23, starting from a point **495.4 meters southwesterly along the centerline** from the northeastern end of runway 05–23. |
| **Elevation of ARP** | **219 meters above sea level**. This serves as the baseline for all elevation-based restrictions. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. These surfaces protect aircraft during landing and takeoff by limiting obstructions that could interfere with visibility or flight paths. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 219 + 45 = 264 m AGL), except where the ground is lower than 9 meters — in such cases, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**. |
| **Strip** | The designated area of the airport used for takeoff and landing, including runways. It includes both the runway and its sides. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of a neighboring strip. |

#### **4. Key Provisions and Restrictions**

##### **(a) Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**

- **No structure or object** (including buildings, towers, trees, or additions to existing structures) may be constructed or erected on any land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> This means that any man-made structure (e.g., a shed, chimney, or tower) must remain below the defined imaginary planes to prevent interference with aircraft operations.

##### **(b) Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes, shrubs) grows above any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister may require the owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.
- This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazards during flight operations due to obstruction or bird attraction.

##### **(c) Prohibition of Bird Attractive Waste**

- No owner or occupier may **use land under these regulations for the disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** or
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This is critical to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which pose a serious threat to aviation safety.

#### **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Zones**

##### **(i) Runway Strips**

| Runway | Width | Length | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| **05–23** | 300 meters (150 m on each side of centerline) | 1,621.36 meters | Primary runway; longer and wider, designed for high-traffic or larger aircraft. |
| **11–29** | 60 meters (30 m on each side) | 1,173.32 meters | Secondary runway; narrower and shorter, likely for smaller aircraft or emergency use. |

> These strips are central to the zoning plan and define the core operational area.

##### **(ii) Approach Surfaces**

Each approach surface is an **inclined plane** rising at a specific gradient, ending in a horizontal line at a fixed distance from the runway end:

| Runway | Gradient | Horizontal Distance | Height of Horizontal Line | Distance from Centerline |
|--------|---------|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **05 (runway approach)** | 1:50 (1 m up per 50 m out) | 15,000 m | 300 m above strip elevation | 2,400 m from centerline |
| **23 (runway approach)** | 1:50 | 15,000 m | 300 m above strip elevation | 2,400 m from centerline |
| **11 (runway approach)** | 1:25 (1 m up per 25 m out) | 1,075 m | 43 m above strip elevation | 137.5 m from centerline |
| **29 (runway approach)** | 1:25 | 1,100 m | 44 m above strip elevation | 140 m from centerline |

> These surfaces are designed to ensure clear visibility for pilots during approach and landing.

##### **(iii) Transitional Surfaces**

- These are **inclined planes** extending from the sides of the strips and their approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface.

| Runway | Gradient | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **05–23** | 1:7 (1 m up per 7 m out) | Rises at right angles to the centerline, extending outward from strip edges to intersect with outer surface |
| **11–29** | 1:5 (1 m up per 5 m out) | Similar structure, steeper than 05–23, reflecting different safety needs |

> These surfaces ensure a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer zone, preventing abrupt changes in terrain or height.

##### **(iv) Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (264 meters AGL)**.
- **Exception**: If the natural ground is less than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level** to avoid unrealistic height restrictions in low-lying areas.

> This defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or vegetation in the broader airport zone.

#### **6. Boundary of the Zoning Area**

The **outer boundary** of the regulated zone is defined by a detailed **survey description** (a legal description using coordinates and directions), drawn from the **Wiarton Airport Zoning Plan No. 42-062 84-87**, dated April 2, 1986.

Key features of the boundary:

- Begins at the **northwesterly corner of Lot 3, Concession 24, Township of Amabel**.
- Proceeds **easterly, northerly, southerly, westerly**, and across several lots and road allowances.
- Passes through **Colpoy’s Bay**, a natural water body, with clear directional references (azimuths) for accuracy.
- Ends at the **southeasterly corner of Lot 1, Concession 19, Township of Amabel**, and loops back to the **northern boundary of Approach Surface 05**.
- Includes intersections with **Approach Surfaces 05 and 23**, which serve as key reference points.

> This boundary ensures that the entire area surrounding the airport — including surrounding farmland, residential areas, and road corridors — is subject to the zoning rules.

#### **7. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **To maintain clear visibility** for pilots by limiting structures and vegetation that could interfere with flight paths.
3. **To reduce the risk of bird strikes** by prohibiting the disposal of food or waste that may attract birds.
4. **To provide a legally enforceable framework** that balances airport operations with land use in surrounding communities.
