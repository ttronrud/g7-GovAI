**Title:** Designation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage as Minister for the Purpose of the Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the *Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act* (FPA Act), specifically pursuant to **Section 2** of that Act, which defines the term "Minister" in the context of the Act.

   The designation is made in accordance with the definition of "Minister" set out in **Section 2** of the FPA Act. This section provides that the Minister of Canadian Heritage shall be the designated Minister unless otherwise specified by law. The Act does not otherwise name a specific minister, so this designation fills that role.

3. **Role and Responsibility:**

   The regulation was issued on **June 28, 1999**, and is cited as **S.C. 1999, c. 23** (Statutes of Canada, 1999, Chapter 23). This means it is part of the official compilation of federal legislation in Canada.

6. **Context of the Act:**

It aims to protect Canadian content and promote national interests in media and advertising.

7. **Privy Council Membership:**  
   The Minister of Canadian Heritage is noted as a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal body of senior officials who advise the Crown and are involved in the governance of the federal government. This status reinforces the minister’s legitimacy and authority in the exercise of the designated role.
