**Detailed Summary of the Regulations Respecting the Parking of Vehicles at Airports (1986–2012)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were issued by the **Minister of Transport** of Canada under **section 3.4(2)** of the *Aeronautics Act*, in accordance with the **Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order** (P.C. 1986-1348), adopted on June 5, 1986. This Order in Council authorized the Minister to establish, amend, or revoke regulations governing parking services at airports operated by the federal government.

The regulations **repeal and replace** the previous *Airport Vehicle Parking Fees Regulations, C.R.C., c. 7*, and introduce a new, more detailed framework for vehicle parking fees at designated federal airports.

### **2. Scope of Application**

#### **Applicable Locations**
The regulations apply to **parking services provided by the Minister of Transport** at **specific airports** that are:
- Operated by the Minister of Transport, and  
- Accessible to the public.

The applicable airports listed in the schedule are:
- **Penticton**
- **Wabush**
- **Port Hardy**
- **Sandspit**
- **Sept-Îles**

#### **Exclusions**

The regulations **do not apply** to:
1. **Members of the Senate** – for parking their vehicles at the airport serving the city, town, or municipality where they reside, **in areas specifically designated** by the Minister of Transport.
2. **Members of the House of Commons** – for parking their vehicles at the airport serving their electoral district, **in areas specifically designated** by the Minister.

> This exclusion reflects a provision designed to provide certain public officials with access to airport parking without being subject to standard user fees.

### **3. Fee Structure and Payment Requirements**

The regulations establish **tiered parking fees** based on the type of parking space and the airport. Fees are set per hour or per time period, with maximum caps to prevent excessive charges.

#### **General Rules for Payment**

- **Metered parking spaces**:  
  The charge must be paid **at the commencement** of use.

- **Non-metered parking spaces**:  
  The charge must be paid either **at the commencement or termination** of use, as indicated by a **public notice** posted at the entrance to the parking lot or structure.

> This ensures transparency and clarity for users regarding when fees are due.

### **4. Detailed Fee Schedule by Airport**

| Airport | Rate (per hour or less) | Max 24-hour Period | Max Weekly | Max Monthly |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Penticton** | $0.45 per hour or less | $2.68 | $13.39 | $35.71 |
| **Port Hardy** | $0.89 per hour or less | $2.68 | $13.39 | $44.64 |
| **Sandspit** | $1.79 maximum per 24-hour period | $8.93 | $22.32 | — |
| **Sept-Îles** | $0.44 per hour or less | $2.65 | $3.54 (seasonal) | — |
| **Wabush** | $0.44 per hour or less | $2.65 | $3.54 (seasonal) | — |

> **Note on Seasonal Adjustment (Sept-Îles & Wabush)**:  
> For parking spaces equipped with **electrical outlets**, a **maximum charge of $3.54 per 24-hour period** applies **only during the winter season**, defined as **November 1 to March 31** each year.  
> This reflects a reduced rate during colder months, likely to encourage usage during low-traffic periods or to offset operational costs.

### **5. Key Observations and Implications**

- **Differential Pricing**:  
  Prices vary significantly by location. For example:
  - **Port Hardy** has the highest hourly rate ($0.89), likely due to higher operational costs or demand.
  - **Sandspit** uses a flat maximum per 24 hours ($1.79), suggesting a simpler fee structure for a smaller or less-used airport.

- **Maximum Caps**:  
  All airports have **daily, weekly, and monthly caps** to prevent users from paying excessive fees even with prolonged parking.

- **Seasonal Adjustments**:  
  The special winter rate at Sept-Îles and Wabush (for outlets) indicates a **cost-based or demand-responsive pricing model**, possibly to manage energy use or reduce winter parking congestion.

- **Public Accessibility**:  
  The rules ensure that parking is accessible to the public while maintaining revenue for airport operations.

- **Exclusion of Political Officials**:  
  The exemption for Senators and Members of Parliament reflects a **policy of public service access** and **non-discrimination** for elected officials, consistent with federal norms.

### **6. Status and Repeal**

- These regulations were **originally enacted** in **1986** (SOR/86-631, published in the Canada Gazette, Part II, p. 2536).
- They were **repealed** on **April 1, 2012**, by **SOR/2012-102, section 2**.

> This means the regulations are **no longer in force** and have been superseded by newer, updated rules. The repeal suggests that:
> - The federal government has modernized its parking fee policies,
> - There may be a shift toward more dynamic pricing or digital payment systems,
> - Or the need for such specific, static fees has been replaced by a more flexible or regionally tailored framework.

### **Conclusion**

The *Regulations respecting the parking of vehicles at airports* (1986) established a clear, structured, and fair system for charging users at federally operated airports. It introduced tiered pricing, seasonal adjustments, and exemptions for public officials, balancing public access with operational sustainability.

While historically significant in setting the precedent for federal airport parking policy, the regulations are now **repealed**, indicating that Canada has transitioned to a more modern, adaptive, and possibly technology-enabled approach to managing parking fees at airports.
