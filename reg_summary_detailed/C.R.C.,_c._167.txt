**Detailed Summary of the Nova Scotia Hog Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Nova Scotia Hog Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal instrument governing the marketing of hogs in Nova Scotia, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal framework under which the Commodity Board operates and exercises its regulatory powers.

- **Commodity Board**: Designates the *Pork Producers Marketing Board of Nova Scotia* (Office de commercialisation). This body is established under the Act and is responsible for regulating hog marketing, including setting prices, levies, and managing market stability.

- **Hog**: Defined as any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) that is produced within the Province of Nova Scotia. This definition ensures that only pigs raised in the province are subject to the regulation.

- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan for hogs established and amended over time under the authority of the Act. The Plan outlines specific rules, procedures, and objectives related to hog marketing, including pricing, distribution, and market access.

---

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted broad regulatory powers to oversee the marketing of hogs in **interprovincial and export trade**. Crucially, the Order allows the Board to exercise **all or any powers** it has over local hog marketing within Nova Scotia — including those derived from the Act and the Plan — **in relation to persons and property located within the province**. This means that the Board can apply local market rules and mechanisms to activities occurring outside the province, ensuring consistency and fairness in hog marketing practices.

**4. Powers to Impose Levies and Charges**  
Specifically, the Board is authorized to:

- **Make orders** to fix **levies or charges** for the marketing of hogs in interprovincial and export markets.
- **Impose and collect** these levies or charges from individuals or entities engaged in the marketing of hogs, as defined in Section 3 of the Act.
- **Classify marketing participants** into different groups (e.g., based on size, type of operation, or market role).
- **Set different levies or charges** for members of each group, allowing for equitable and differentiated financial obligations.

> *Note: Section 3 of the Act defines the categories of persons subject to these levies (e.g., processors, exporters, dealers).*

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through these levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., financial buffers to stabilize market conditions during downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** related to hog marketing activities.
- **Covering losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., due to market fluctuations or poor prices).
- **Equalizing or adjusting** the financial returns among hog producers.  
  This ensures that producers who may have experienced lower returns due to market conditions can receive compensation or support, helping to maintain equity across the industry.

> The Board may determine **the time periods** (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually) over which these equalizations or adjustments will be applied.

---

**6. Repealed Provision**  
A provision previously included in the Order — which was originally intended to grant similar powers — has been **repealed** (removed) by *SOR/80-90*. This indicates that the current authority to impose levies and charges is now fully operational under the revised structure of the Order.

---

**Purpose and Significance**  
This Order ensures that the marketing of hogs in Nova Scotia — especially in interprovincial and international markets — is conducted in a fair, stable, and economically sustainable manner. By enabling the Commodity Board to impose targeted levies and use collected funds for industry support and loss mitigation, the regulation helps:

- Protect producers from market volatility.
- Maintain price stability and fair competition.
- Support long-term industry viability and economic development in the pork sector.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Nova Scotia Hog Order* is a critical regulatory tool that empowers the Pork Producers Marketing Board to manage hog marketing effectively beyond provincial borders. Through the imposition of group-based levies and the strategic use of collected funds, it promotes equity, financial resilience, and market stability for hog producers in Nova Scotia. The Order operates within the framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act*, ensuring legal consistency and accountability.
