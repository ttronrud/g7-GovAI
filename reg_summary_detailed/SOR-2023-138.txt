> ⚠️ These are **maximum penalties** and do not represent fixed fines. The actual penalty is calculated using a **formula-based system** that considers multiple factors.

---

### **4. Penalty Formula**

The final penalty amount is determined using the following formula:

> **Penalty = A + B + C + D + (E × (A + B + C + D))**

Where:
- **A** = Baseline penalty amount (based on violation seriousness)
- **B** = History of non-compliance amount (if applicable)
- **C** = Harm amount (if real or potential harm occurred)
- **D** = Economic gain amount (if the violator gained financially)
- **E** = Mitigating factor amount (a percentage applied to the sum of A+B+C+D)

#### 🔍 Breakdown of Each Element:

---

#### **A. Baseline Penalty Amount**
- Determined by **column 2 of Part 1 (individual)** or **Part 2 (corporation/ship)** of **Schedule 2**.
- Matches the **classification** of the violation (minor, serious, very serious).

---

#### **B. History of Non-Compliance Amount**
- Applies **only if** the violator has a history of non-compliance in the **5 years prior** to the current violation.
- Defined as one of the following:
  1. A notice of violation was issued for the **same or similar provision** of the Act or its regulations.
  2. The violator **paid** the penalty under Section 129.06 of the Act.
  3. The violator was **deemed to have committed** the violation under Section 129.09.
  4. The violator was **found guilty** of an offence under the Act.
- The amount is taken from **column 3** of the relevant Part of Schedule 2, based on:
  - The **seriousness** of the violation
  - The **number of prior incidents**

> 💡 Example: A violator with 3 prior violations may face a higher penalty due to increased B.

---

#### **C. Harm Amount**
- Applies if the violation **results in or may result in harm**.
- Amount is taken from **column 4** of Schedule 2, based on:
  - The **seriousness** of the violation
  - The **category of impact** on:
    - Safety of persons and property
    - Environment

> 📌 Categories of Impact:
| Category | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Weak** | Trivial impact — no injury, no significant damage |
| **Moderate** | Not trivial, but no substantial or widespread harm to property/environment or injury to individuals |
| **High** | Substantial or widespread harm to property/environment or injury to individuals |

> ✅ Harm amount increases with the severity of the impact category.

---

#### **D. Economic Gain Amount**
- Applies if the violator **benefited financially** from the violation.
- Examples include:
  - Gaining revenue, profit, or income
  - Avoiding or delaying costs (e.g., avoiding inspections, fees, or penalties)
- Amount is derived from **column 5** of Schedule 2, based on:
  - The seriousness of the violation

> 💡 The greater the financial benefit, the higher the penalty.

---

#### **E. Mitigating Factor Amount**
- A **reduction** in the penalty if the violator demonstrates cooperation or voluntary action.
- Calculated as:
  > **Mitigating Factor = Percentage × (A + B + C + D)**

- The **percentage** is determined from **column 6** of Schedule 2 and depends on the violator’s behavior:
  - **20% reduction** if the violator **voluntarily discloses** the violation to an enforcement officer.
  - **10% reduction** if the violator:
    - Cooperates with the enforcement officer, or
    - Takes **voluntary measures** to mitigate harm (e.g., remediation, reporting, corrective actions).

> ✅ This encourages transparency and proactive compliance.

---

### **5. Multiple Violations (Ongoing Violations)**
- If a violation is **continued over time** (e.g., failure to comply for several days), each day of continuation constitutes a **separate violation**.
- This is indicated by an **"X"** in **Column 3** of a Part of Schedule 1.
