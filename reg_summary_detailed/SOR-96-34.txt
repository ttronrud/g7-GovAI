### **4. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to the **grant of a drawback** under **subsection 113(1) of the Customs Tariff**, in the following situations:

1. **Imported motor vehicle** that is:
   - Subsequently exported;
   - Sold to a purchaser in Canada **before export**;
   - Is **new** at the time of sale.

2. **Imported goods used in processing** a motor vehicle in Canada, where:
   - The goods are used or consumed in processing the vehicle;
   - The resulting motor vehicle is exported.

3. **Imported goods (not listed in Schedule)** directly consumed or expended in processing a motor vehicle that is exported.

4. **Imported goods**, where the **same quantity** of domestic or imported goods of the same class is used in processing the vehicle (i.e., substitution allowed).

5. **Imported goods (not listed in Schedule)** where the **same quantity** of domestic or imported goods of the same class is directly consumed or expended in processing the vehicle.

> **Note:** The regulation specifically excludes certain goods (listed in a schedule) from this scope — meaning only those not listed may qualify for drawback under the "same class" or "direct consumption" provisions.

### **5. Conditions for Granting a Drawback**

#### **(a) Vehicle Must Be Sold Before Export**
- The motor vehicle must be **sold to a purchaser in Canada** prior to export.
- At the time of sale, the vehicle must be **new**.

#### **(b) Who Can Apply for Drawback?**
- **For imported motor vehicles:**
  - The **importer** of the vehicle; or
  - The **person who sold the vehicle to the purchaser**.
- **For motor vehicles processed in Canada:**
  - The **processor** of the vehicle.

#### **(c) Timing of Export and Application**
An application for drawback must be made within:
- **30 days** after delivery to the purchaser **if the purchaser is a resident of Canada**.
- **12 months** after delivery to the purchaser **if the purchaser is not a resident**.

> This ensures timely claims and prevents indefinite delays.

#### **(d) Use Restrictions on the Vehicle**
The vehicle must:
- Remain **owned by the purchaser**;
- Be **used solely by the purchaser**;
- **Not be used** for any of the following:
  - Carrying passengers or goods for compensation;
  - Transporting goods for sale;
  - Soliciting sales or subscriptions on behalf of a Canadian business.

> This ensures the vehicle is used only for temporary, non-commercial purposes (e.g., testing, demonstration, or display), not for active commercial operations.

#### **(e) Export Requirement**
- The vehicle must be **exported before the application is filed**.
- The vehicle must be **exported within the prescribed timeframes** (30 or 12 months depending on residency).

#### **(f) For Imported Goods Used in Processing**
In cases involving imported goods used in processing:
- The goods must have been used, consumed, or expended in the **same processing plant** as the domestic or imported goods of the same class.
- The motor vehicle must be exported **within two years** of the date the imported goods were first imported.

#### **(g) Waiver Requirement**
- The applicant must provide a **waiver** from all other persons entitled to claim a drawback, refund, or remission of duties.
- This prevents multiple claims on the same goods or inputs.

> This ensures fairness and avoids double recovery of duties.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Prior Use of Equivalent Goods**
- A drawback **shall not be granted** if:
  - The **domestic or imported goods of the same class** were used, consumed, or expended **before** the imported goods subject to the application were used in processing the vehicle.

> This prevents "front-loading" of inputs and ensures that the drawback applies only when inputs are used in sequence and in the correct order.

---

### **7. Determining "Same Class" of Goods**
Domestic and imported goods are considered to be of the **same class** if they are:
- **Interchangeable** in the processing of a motor vehicle; or
- Can be **directly consumed or expended** interchangeably in the processing.

> Example: If a certain type of plastic used in manufacturing a vehicle’s interior can be substituted with a similar domestic plastic, they are considered the same class.

> This allows flexibility in sourcing while ensuring that only comparable inputs qualify for drawback.

---

### **8. Specific Examples of Goods Covered**
The regulation explicitly mentions two categories of goods that may qualify under the "same class" or "direct consumption" provisions:

- **Fuel**
- **Plant equipment**

> These are examples of inputs that may be used in vehicle processing and may qualify for drawback if used in the same plant and within the required timeframes.

> Note: The regulation implies that other goods may also qualify if they meet the "same class" criteria, but specific exclusions or schedules may govern which goods are included or excluded.

### **9. Key Principles and Policy Objectives**
| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Temporary Use** | Vehicles or inputs are used temporarily in Canada (e.g., for assembly, testing, or demonstration), not for permanent commercial use. |
| **Recovery of Duty** | Allows recovery of duties paid on imports when they are used in a temporary, non-permanent way and then exported. |
| **Prevention of Abuse** | Restrictions on use (e.g., no commercial transport), timing (within 12/30 days), and waiver requirements prevent misuse or fraud. |
| **Support for Industry** | Encourages investment in vehicle manufacturing, testing, or processing by reducing the cost of imported inputs. |
| **Fairness & Equity** | Ensures that only those who genuinely use inputs in processing can claim drawback, and prevents double claims. |

---

### **10. Effective Date**
- The regulations come into force on the date that **Section 56 of Chapter 41 of the Statutes of Canada, 1995**, comes into force.

> This section amended the *Customs Act* and the *Customs Tariff*, providing the legal basis for the drawback regime.
