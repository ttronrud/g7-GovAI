The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-252, section 27**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2016-252*, specifically **Section 27** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **June 2016**, as SOR/2016-252 was published in that year.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The original regulation (which is no longer in force) was likely a rule or provision governing a specific area of law—such as workplace safety, environmental standards, licensing, or administrative procedures—though the specific subject matter is not provided in the text.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact reason is not stated in the given text, regulations are often repealed to:

### Key Takeaway:
This entry does **not** describe the content or purpose of the original regulation. Instead, it confirms that the regulation has been **removed from legal effect** and is **no longer applicable**. Any reference to this regulation in current legal or administrative contexts should be treated as invalid or obsolete.

### Recommendation:

In short:  
➡️ **This is a notice of repeal — not a description of a regulation.**  
➡️ The regulation was **officially removed** by SOR/2016-252, s. 27.  
➡️ It is **no longer in force** and should not be referenced in current legal practice.  

If you have more context (e.g., the name of the regulation or the subject area), I can help identify what it may have governed.
