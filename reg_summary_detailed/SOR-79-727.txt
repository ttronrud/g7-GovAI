**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Hog Marketing Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Quebec Hog Marketing Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Sections 2 and 3 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act (Québec)**. This Order grants authority to regulate the marketing of hogs within Quebec, particularly in **interprovincial and export trade**.

The Order may be cited as the *Quebec Hog Marketing Order* and establishes a framework for the oversight, pricing, levies, and equitable distribution of revenues related to hog production and marketing across the province.

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act of Quebec* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal basis for regulating agricultural product marketing, including hogs.
  
- **Board**: The *Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board* (Régie), established under the Act. It has broad regulatory powers over the marketing of agricultural products, including hogs, both within Quebec and in interprovincial/export markets.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Fédération des producteurs de porc du Québec* (Fédération), a producer association established under the Act. It represents hog producers and is responsible for managing the marketing and economic interests of the sector.

- **Hog**: Defined as a hog produced or grown in the Province of Quebec (porc). This ensures that only locally raised hogs are subject to the regulations in this Order.

- **Plan**: Any marketing plan for hogs established and amended over time under the authority of the Act. The Plan serves as a guiding document for pricing, market access, and distribution strategies.

### **Regulatory Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**

#### 1. **Joint Authority to Regulate Marketing**
Both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** are authorized to regulate the **marketing of hogs in interprovincial and export trade**. This includes activities such as selling hogs outside Quebec or exporting them to other provinces or foreign countries.

For these purposes, each body may issue **orders** that apply to **persons and property located within Quebec**. These orders can exercise **all or any powers** that they would otherwise have in regulating hog marketing **within Quebec**—including powers related to pricing, market access, and compliance—thereby extending their local regulatory authority to broader, external markets.

This provision ensures that the same rules and oversight mechanisms used domestically can be applied consistently in interprovincial and export contexts, promoting fairness and stability in the hog market.

### **Specific Powers of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted **special and significant powers** under Section 3 of the Act, specifically concerning **levies and charges** in interprovincial and export trade.

#### 1. **Authority to Impose Levies or Charges**
The Commodity Board may:
- Fix, impose, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of hogs** within Quebec.

#### 2. **Classification of Producers into Groups**
To ensure fairness and proportionality, the Board may:
- Classify hog producers into **different groups** based on factors such as farm size, production volume, or type of operation.
- Set **different levies or charges** for members of each group, depending on their size, activity level, or other relevant criteria.

This classification allows for **tailored financial obligations** that reflect the actual capacity and contribution of each producer to the hog market.

#### 3. **Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., to buffer against market downturns or price volatility).
- **Payment of expenses and losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., losses from poor market conditions or unexpected price drops).
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among hog producers.
  
This means that when hog prices fall, the Commodity Board can use collected funds to **compensate producers** or distribute income more equitably, helping to stabilize the sector during downturns.

#### 4. **Time Periods for Equalization**
The Commodity Board may determine **specific time periods** (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually) during which such equalization or adjustment of revenues will occur. This provides flexibility in managing financial flows and responding to market fluctuations.

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Order**

The primary goals of the *Quebec Hog Marketing Order* are:

1. **Market Stability**: To prevent price volatility in the hog market by establishing structured pricing and financial mechanisms.
2. **Fairness Among Producers**: To ensure that producers, especially smaller or less financially resilient ones, are not disproportionately affected by market fluctuations.
3. **Economic Resilience**: To build financial reserves and support producers during downturns through levies and equalization funds.
4. **Consistent Regulation**: To apply the same regulatory standards both domestically and in interprovincial/export markets, ensuring transparency and consistency.
5. **Producer Representation**: To empower the *Fédération des producteurs de porc du Québec* to act as a collective voice and financial steward for hog producers.

### **Legal Basis and Enforcement**

- The Order is made under **Sections 2 and 3 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which authorize the Board and Commodity Board to regulate marketing and establish financial mechanisms.
- Orders issued by the Board or Commodity Board are binding on persons and property within Quebec.
- Enforcement mechanisms are implied through the Act, allowing for penalties or compliance requirements if producers fail to meet obligations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Quebec Hog Marketing Order* is a comprehensive regulatory tool designed to stabilize and support the hog industry in Quebec. By empowering both the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board and the Fédération des producteurs de porc du Québec to regulate interprovincial and export marketing, and by allowing the Fédération to impose and manage producer levies, the Order promotes:

- Market transparency  
- Financial protection for producers  
- Equitable distribution of market gains and losses  
- Long-term sustainability of the hog sector  

This Order reflects a balanced approach—protecting producers from market volatility while maintaining efficient and fair trade practices in both domestic and international markets.
