**Date of Issuance:**

**Place of Issuance:** Ottawa, Canada

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, enacted in Canada as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, and further amended by **S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60**.

- The **Harbour Seal Lacs des Loups Marins subspecies** (*Phoca vitulina mellonae*) is recognized as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA.
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this subspecies has been developed and is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy includes the identification of the **critical habitat** necessary for the survival and recovery of the species.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **designate and legally define the critical habitat** of the *Harbour Seal Lacs des Loups Marins* subspecies. Critical habitat refers to the specific areas required by a species for survival and recovery, including the physical and biological features necessary for the species to live, reproduce, and thrive.

By formally designating this habitat, the Government of Canada ensures that these areas are protected under SARA and that any actions that may affect them are subject to regulatory review and mitigation.

### **3. Key Provisions and Legal Justifications**

#### a. **No Conflict with Subsection 58(2)b of SARA**
- The Order specifies that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA.
- Subsection 58(2)b generally refers to areas where **wildlife management boards (WMBs)** have authority under land claims agreements to manage wildlife.
- Since the critical habitat is **not located in such a jurisdiction**, the Order does not trigger the need for a special designation or override of land claims authority under that provision.

#### b. **Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards**
- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** has determined that the proposed critical habitat area may fall within a region where a **wildlife management board (WMB)** is authorized by a **land claims agreement** to carry out wildlife management functions.
- As a result, the Minister **consulted** with the relevant WMB **pursuant to subsection 58(8)** of SARA, which requires consultation when an Order may affect areas under the jurisdiction of a WMB.
- This consultation ensures that Indigenous and First Nations communities, whose rights and responsibilities are recognized under land claims agreements, are involved in the decision-making process and that their traditional knowledge and interests are considered.

#### c. **Legal Authority for the Order**
- The Order is made under **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA.
  - **Section 58(4)** authorizes the Minister to designate critical habitat for a listed species.
  - **Section 58(5)** provides that such designation must be based on the recovery strategy and must not conflict with existing laws or agreements.
- The designation is based on the recovery strategy, which has been formally included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access.

---

### **4. Application of Subsection 58(1)**

- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the *Harbour Seal Lacs des Loups Marins* subspecies.
- This means that the designated critical habitat is legally protected under SARA, and any **proposed development, activity, or project** that may adversely affect this habitat must undergo **environmental assessment** and **protection measures** under the Act.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Government of Canada (i.e., upon official publication in the Canada Gazette).
- This ensures that the legal protections are immediately enforceable once the Order is formally recognized.

---

### **6. Significance and Implications**

- **Conservation Protection**: The Order provides formal legal protection to specific areas essential for the survival of the endangered *Harbour Seal Lacs des Loups Marins* subspecies.
- **Recovery Support**: By identifying and protecting critical habitat, the government supports the long-term recovery of the species, which is vital for biodiversity and ecosystem health.
- **Indigenous Engagement**: The requirement to consult with wildlife management boards reflects Canada’s commitment to **Indigenous rights and co-management**, especially in areas affected by land claims agreements.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the Public Registry ensures that the public, scientists, and stakeholders can access and review the rationale behind the critical habitat designation.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a key step in the conservation of the endangered *Harbour Seal Lacs des Loups Marins* subspecies. It legally designates critical habitat based on scientific recovery planning, ensures compliance with SARA’s procedural and legal requirements—including consultation with Indigenous wildlife management boards—and provides enforceable protection to the areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery. The Order strengthens Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the integration of Indigenous governance in environmental protection.
