**Detailed Summary of the Discontinuance and Continuance of Proceedings Order, 1996 (S.C. 1996, c. 10)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Discontinuance and Continuance of Proceedings Order, 1996* (S.C. 1996, c. 10) is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to **subsection 195(3) of the Canada Transportation Act**.

This Order provides a structured framework for determining which types of administrative proceedings related to transportation matters in Canada were to be **discontinued** and which were to be **continued** as of **July 1, 1996**—a key date marking a transitional shift in the regulatory regime.

The Order was enacted to streamline and clarify the administrative process following a significant reorganization or restructuring of transportation oversight, likely in response to legislative amendments or policy changes. It specifically applies to proceedings that had not yet resulted in a decision or order by the **National Transportation Agency (NTA)** before **July 1, 1996**.

### **Key Provisions and Applications**

#### **I. Proceedings to Be Discontinued (Ceased)**

The following classes of proceedings are **discontinued**—meaning they are formally closed and no further action will be taken by the NTA:

1. **Reconsideration under Section 171 of the National Transportation Act, 1987**  
   - Any application for the **abandonment of a branch line** of a railway.  
   - These reconsideration processes are terminated; no further review or decision will be made on such abandonment applications.

2. **Application under Section 232 of the National Transportation Act, 1987**  
   - Any application for a **permit to construct and operate a commodity pipeline** (e.g., oil, gas, or other bulk commodities).  
   - These applications are discontinued; the NTA will no longer process or evaluate such pipeline permits.

3. **Review under Section 256 of the National Transportation Act, 1987**  
   - Any **review of a proposed acquisition in a transportation undertaking** (e.g., mergers or takeovers involving railways, pipelines, or other transport services).  
   - These reviews are terminated; no further scrutiny of such acquisitions will occur under this provision.

> **Purpose of Discontinuance**:  
> These categories were likely deemed redundant, obsolete, or incompatible with new policy directions—possibly due to shifts in transportation governance, environmental concerns, or economic restructuring. The discontinuation reflects a strategic decision to eliminate certain regulatory pathways that were no longer considered necessary or viable.

---

#### **II. Proceedings to Be Continued (Ongoing)**

The following classes of proceedings are **continued** and remain subject to the provisions of the **Canada Transportation Act, 1987**, as in force before July 1, 1996:

1. **Complaint under Section 35**  
   - In respect of a **farm crossing** referenced in **Section 215 of the Railway Act**.  
   - This allows farmers or landowners to complain about railway operations that interfere with agricultural access.

2. **Exemption under Section 70**  
   - Requests for exemptions from certain requirements of the Act (e.g., operational, safety, or environmental standards).

3. **Application under Section 72**  
   - For a **domestic licence** (e.g., for operating a railway or transportation service within Canada).

4. **Suspension or cancellation under Section 75**  
   - Of a **domestic licence** when conditions are not met or violations occur.

5. **Complaint under Section 77**  
   - Regarding a licensee’s failure to comply with **Section 76** (which governs licensing conditions and obligations).

6. **Complaint under Section 80**  
   - Regarding the imposition of an **unreasonable basic fare level or increase** by a transportation licensee (e.g., rail or pipeline operators).

7. **Application under Section 88**  
   - For a **scheduled international licence** (e.g., for operating scheduled passenger or freight services across international borders).

8. **Terms and conditions under Section 91**  
   - Conditions governing the operation of transportation services.

9. **Suspension or cancellation under Section 92**  
   - Of a **scheduled international licence** due to non-compliance or operational issues.

10. **Application under Section 94**  
    - For a **non-scheduled international licence** (e.g., for ad-hoc or special-purpose international transport).

11. **Terms and conditions under Section 96**  
    - Conditions governing non-scheduled international operations.

12. **Suspension or cancellation under Section 97**  
    - Of a **non-scheduled international licence**.

13. **Liability insurance under Section 98**  
    - Requirements for insurance coverage for transportation operators.

14. **Applications under Sections 111 to 132 of the Railway Act**  
    - For the **construction of railway lines, branch lines, or industrial spurs**.

15. **Proceedings under Sections 201 to 204 of the Railway Act**  
    - These cover various aspects of railway operations, including safety, maintenance, and service standards.

16. **Application under Section 326 of the Railway Act**  
    - For **leave to construct or maintain lines, wires, conductors, or structures** for telegraphic, telephonic, or power transmission purposes.

> **Purpose of Continuance**:  
> These proceedings remain active because they are essential to the day-to-day regulation of transportation services, safety, licensing, and consumer protection. They represent core regulatory functions that are still necessary for maintaining fair, safe, and efficient transportation systems.

#### **III. Proceedings to Be Continued Under the Railway Act (as it existed before July 1, 1996)**

Certain provisions of the **Railway Act** are preserved in their pre-July 1, 1996 form, meaning they are not subject to the updated version of the Act that may have been introduced later. These include:

1. **Application or complaint under Section 212**  
   - Regarding **drainage issues** affecting railway operations or land use.

2. **Approval under subsection 213(4)**  
   - Of the **character of works, specifications, or plans** for drainage infrastructure.

3. **Application for a farm crossing under Section 216**  
   - To establish a crossing of a railway over private farmland.

4. **Proceeding under Section 230**  
   - For matters related to **railway safety, track maintenance, or operational standards**.

> **Purpose of This Provision**:  
> This ensures continuity in rural and agricultural land-use matters that were historically governed by the Railway Act, especially those involving infrastructure that affects farm access and land use. It reflects a recognition that certain rural and local-level issues require stable, predictable legal frameworks.

### **Repeal Clause**

The Order explicitly states that **this Order comes into force on July 10, 1996**.  
This date is significant because it allows time for administrative notice, public awareness, and compliance with the changes.

Additionally, the Order includes a **repeal clause**, meaning that any prior rules or orders that conflict with or are superseded by this Order are effectively **repealed** upon its coming into force.

---

### **Policy and Regulatory Implications**

1. **Regulatory Streamlining**:  
   The Order reflects a deliberate effort to **remove outdated or redundant processes** from transportation regulation, thereby reducing administrative burden and improving efficiency.

2. **Focus on Core Functions**:  
   By discontinuing pipeline permits and branch line abandonment reviews, the government signaled a shift in focus toward **safety, consumer protection, and operational compliance** rather than infrastructure expansion or acquisition.

3. **Preservation of Key Regulatory Tools**:  
   The continuation of licensing, complaint mechanisms, and safety-related provisions ensures that essential oversight and accountability mechanisms remain in place.

4. **Transitional Clarity**:  
   The clear delineation between discontinued and continued proceedings provides **legal certainty** for stakeholders (e.g., rail operators, farmers, pipeline companies) who were involved in pending applications or complaints.

5. **Interplay Between Acts**:  
   The Order demonstrates the **interconnected nature** of the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Act. While the Transportation Act governs broader transportation sectors, the Railway Act retains specific authority over rail-related infrastructure and operations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Discontinuance and Continuance of Proceedings Order, 1996* is a significant administrative tool that:

- **Discontinues** three major classes of proceedings (branch line abandonment, pipeline permits, and acquisition reviews) due to policy or structural changes.
- **Continues** a wide range of licensing, safety, and consumer protection proceedings under the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Act.
- **Preserves pre-July 1, 1996 versions** of certain railway-specific provisions to ensure continuity in rural and land-use matters.

This Order serves as a **critical transitional instrument** in Canada’s transportation regulatory evolution, balancing modernization with stability, and ensuring that only essential and relevant processes remain active in the regulatory framework.
