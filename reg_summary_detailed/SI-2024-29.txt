## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

### **1. Legal Framework and Statutory Basis**

The regulation is rooted in **subsection 83.05(1)d and 83.05(8.1)a of the *Criminal Code* (R.S.C., c. C-46)** of Canada, specifically under **Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the Regulations Establishing a List of Entities** made under subsection 83.05(1)d.

- **Section 83.05(1)d** establishes the legal standard for designating entities as "terrorist entities":
  - The Governor in Council (through the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) may designate an entity as a terrorist entity if there are **reasonable grounds to believe** it:
    - Has **knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated** a terrorist activity;
    - Or has **knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with** another such entity.

- **Section 83.05(8.1)a** provides the mechanism for **removing** an entity from the list of terrorist entities when:
  - The Minister determines that **there are no longer reasonable grounds** to believe the entity has engaged in such activities.

This regulation reflects a **review and adjustment process** to ensure that the list of designated terrorist entities remains accurate, relevant, and proportionate to current threats.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

- **Maintain an up-to-date and legally justified list** of terrorist entities recognized under Canadian law.

- **Remove outdated or no longer active entities** from the list, thereby preventing overreach and ensuring legal precision.
