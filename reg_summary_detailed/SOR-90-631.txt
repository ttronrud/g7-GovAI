**Detailed Summary of the *Special Counting of Prior Service Regulations (Health Care Services for the Benefit of the Canadian Forces)***

---

### **Overview**

The *Special Counting of Prior Service Regulations (Health Care Services for the Benefit of the Canadian Forces)* (the "Regulations") are a set of rules issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada** under specific statutory authority. These regulations allow certain individuals to **count specific periods of prior service**—specifically, health care services performed in the Canadian Forces—as **pensionable service** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (the "Act"), even though that service was not performed in a traditional public service role.

This is a special provision designed to recognize and compensate individuals who provided health care services to members of the Canadian Armed Forces under the Queen’s Regulations and Orders (QRO), prior to the establishment of formal pensionable service recognition for such roles.

### **Legal Basis**

The Regulations are made under two key provisions of federal law:

1. **Subsection 42(9) of the Public Service Superannuation Act**  
   This grants the Treasury Board the authority to issue regulations that define how prior service may be counted toward pensionable service under the Act.

2. **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act**  
   This provides the Treasury Board with broader regulatory powers to establish rules for the administration of public service superannuation, including the treatment of prior service.

These legal foundations enable the Treasury Board to create a mechanism for recognizing non-traditional public service roles—specifically, health care duties performed in the Canadian Forces—as qualifying for pension benefits.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these Regulations is to **recognize and count** periods of service that individuals rendered before becoming contributors to the Public Service Superannuation system—specifically, **full-time health care duties performed under Section 210.61 of the Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces**—as **pensionable service**.

This recognition ensures that individuals who served in health care roles (e.g., nurses, doctors, paramedics, or other medical personnel) in the Canadian Forces are not penalized for their prior service when calculating their future pension entitlements under the Public Service Superannuation system.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### 1. **Eligibility for Election**

A person is eligible to make an election to count prior service if:

- They **performed duties related to health care services** under **Section 210.61 of the Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces**;
- The duties were performed **on a full-time basis**;
- The duties were performed **for the benefit of the Crown in right of Canada** (i.e., in a government capacity, not privately or independently);
- The individual **was not yet a contributor under Part I of the Public Service Superannuation Act** at the time of service.

> *Note:* This means the individual must have been serving in a health care role within the Canadian Forces before they became eligible to contribute to the public service pension system (i.e., before enrolling in Part I of the Act).

#### 2. **Time Period for Eligible Service**

The eligible period of service must have occurred **prior to December 31, 1984**.

This cutoff date is significant because it reflects a historical boundary in the development of public service superannuation rules. Prior to this date, such health care service was not formally recognized under the pension system.

#### 3. **Counting as Pensionable Service**

If an eligible individual makes an election under **Section 3 of the Act**, the period of health care service (within the specified time frame) will be counted as **pensionable service**.

Importantly, for the purposes of calculating pension entitlements, this period is treated as if it had been service in a **portion of the public service of Canada** that was **added to Schedule I to the Public Service Superannuation Act** on the **date these Regulations came into force**.

> This means that the prior health care service is treated as if it were part of the formal public service, even though it was performed in a military health care capacity.

#### 4. **Election After Retirement**

A key provision allows for flexibility in timing:

- If a person makes the election **after ceasing to be employed in the Public Service**, but **within one year of the coming into force of these Regulations**, the election will be **deemed to have been made while the person was employed** in the Public Service.

> This ensures that individuals who may have delayed making the election due to retirement or personal circumstances are not excluded from benefits simply because they made the decision after leaving employment.

This provision is designed to prevent undue hardship or loss of pension rights due to administrative delays.

### **Key Implications**

- **Pension Entitlements**: Individuals who qualify under these Regulations will have a larger pensionable service record, which directly increases their future pension benefits under the Public Service Superannuation system.
  
- **Recognition of Military Health Care Service**: The Regulations formally recognize a historically under-recognized form of public service—health care provided to military personnel—as a legitimate and valuable contribution to the Canadian public service.

- **Equity and Fairness**: This rule promotes equity by ensuring that those who served in critical health care roles in the Canadian Forces are not disadvantaged in pension calculations compared to those who served in traditional public service roles.

- **Administrative Clarity**: By specifying the conditions and timeline for eligibility, the Regulations provide clear guidance for both individuals and pension administrators.

### **Citation and Application**

- The Regulations may be cited as:  
  **The Special Counting of Prior Service Regulations (Health Care Services for the Benefit of the Canadian Forces)**

- The term "Act" in the Regulations refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act*.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Special Counting of Prior Service Regulations (Health Care Services for the Benefit of the Canadian Forces)* is a targeted, equitable, and administratively sound policy that:

- Recognizes valuable contributions made by health care professionals in the Canadian Forces;
- Expands the definition of pensionable service to include non-traditional public service roles;
- Ensures fair treatment of individuals who served in military health care before the formalization of pension rules;
- Provides a clear, accessible pathway for individuals to claim recognition of prior service through a formal election process.

These regulations reflect a broader commitment by the Canadian government to acknowledge diverse forms of public service and to ensure that all individuals who serve the Crown—regardless of branch or role—are fairly compensated in retirement.
