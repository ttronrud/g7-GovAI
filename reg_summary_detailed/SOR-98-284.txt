**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Direction to the CRTC (Reservation of Frequencies for Toronto) Order**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulatory directive, issued under the authority of the *Broadcasting Act*, was developed in response to evolving needs in Canadian radio broadcasting, particularly in the Toronto area. The key motivations behind the Order include:

1. **Phasing Out of CBC Frequencies**:  
   It is anticipated that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) will cease using two specific frequencies:
   - **740 kHz** on the AM band in Toronto
   - **93.5 MHz** on the FM band in Peterborough, Ontario

   This discontinuation creates an opportunity to reallocate these frequencies for new or expanded radio services.

2. **Public Demand for Additional FM Stations**:  
   There is strong public demand for more FM radio stations in Canada—especially in major urban centers like Toronto—where listeners seek diverse programming, improved coverage, and greater choice. This demand has generated significant public pressure for the government to act promptly.

3. **Historical Consideration of Joint Use**:  
   During the public hearing that resulted in *Decision CRTC 97-362* (July 29, 1997), the possibility of jointly using the AM frequency 740 kHz and an FM frequency (initially 93.5 MHz) was discussed. At that time, the Commission considered the potential for shared use between stations to optimize spectrum utilization.

4. **Ongoing Feasibility of Joint Use**:  
   The regulation acknowledges that the joint use of **740 kHz (AM)** and **either 93.5 MHz or another suitable FM frequency** remains a viable and open option for future exploration.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is made under:
- **Paragraph 26(1)(b) of the Broadcasting Act**, which allows the Minister of Canadian Heritage to direct the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to reserve frequencies for public broadcasting purposes.
- **Subsection 26(4)** of the Broadcasting Act, which mandates that the Minister consult with the CRTC before issuing such directives.

This ensures that the decision is both legally grounded and subject to proper consultation with the independent regulatory body responsible for broadcasting policy.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

The CRTC is formally directed to:

- **Reserve two frequencies** for use in **Toronto**:
  1. **740 kHz** on the **AM band**
  2. **Either 93.5 MHz or any other appropriate frequency on the FM band**

- These frequencies are to be reserved **specifically for radio services in Toronto** that will:
  - Contribute to achieving the objectives of the **Canadian broadcasting policy**, as outlined in **subparagraph 3(1)(d)(iii)** of the *Broadcasting Act*.

> **Objective of Canadian Broadcasting Policy (3(1)(d)(iii))**:  
> To promote the development of a diverse, accessible, and culturally relevant broadcasting system that reflects the needs and interests of all Canadians, including regional and local communities. This includes ensuring equitable access to radio services, especially in major urban centers.

### **Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- **Ensure that the public interest in radio services is served** by preserving key frequencies for future use in Toronto.
- **Prevent the loss of valuable spectrum** that could otherwise be used for new or community-based radio stations.
- **Support the expansion of local radio programming**, which enhances cultural expression, community engagement, and media diversity.
- Provide **a foundation for future licensing decisions**, allowing the CRTC to consider applications for new radio stations that meet national broadcasting objectives.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Spectrum Management**: This directive represents a strategic step in managing radio spectrum efficiently, balancing the needs of existing broadcasters with public demand for new services.
- **Public Access and Equity**: By reserving frequencies for Toronto-based radio services, the government promotes equitable access to broadcasting, especially in a major cultural and economic hub.
- **Flexibility**: The inclusion of “any other appropriate frequency” on the FM band allows the CRTC to assess technical and geographic factors when selecting the best frequency, ensuring optimal service delivery.
- **Foundation for Future Licensing**: The reservation creates a clear pathway for future applications for new FM stations in Toronto, potentially leading to the launch of community, specialty, or commercial radio services.

### **Conclusion**

This Direction to the CRTC (Reservation of Frequencies for Toronto) Order is a forward-looking regulatory action that responds to public demand, leverages historical planning considerations, and aligns with Canada’s broader broadcasting policy goals. By reserving 740 kHz (AM) and a suitable FM frequency (initially 93.5 MHz) for Toronto-based radio services, it ensures that the city continues to have access to diverse, locally relevant, and high-quality radio programming—supporting both public interest and the long-term sustainability of Canada’s broadcasting ecosystem.
