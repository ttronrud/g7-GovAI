**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Coastrange Sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) Cultus Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
December 14, 2018  
**Issuing Authority:**  
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued under **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29.  
It is also grounded in **subsection 58(1)** of SARA, which establishes that critical habitat for a listed species is subject to protection under the Act.

### **Background and Context:**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The Coastrange Sculpin (*Cottus aleuticus* Cultus population) is a distinct population segment (DPS) of the Coastrange Sculpin, a fish species native to coastal streams in British Columbia and adjacent regions. This population is officially listed as **"Threatened"** in **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild and is legally protected under the Act.

2. **Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   A formal **action plan** for the Coastrange Sculpin was developed to guide recovery efforts. This plan identified specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species — known as *critical habitat*.  
   This identified critical habitat has been formally **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track information on species at risk and their designated critical habitats.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas:**  
   A key condition for issuing this Order is that **no portion of the critical habitat specified in this regulation falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.  
   Subsection 58(2)b of SARA defines areas that are *exempt from critical habitat protection* due to specific circumstances, such as areas where the critical habitat is located in a place that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal government (e.g., areas under provincial or territorial control without federal oversight).  
   The regulation explicitly confirms that **none of the identified critical habitat lies in such an exempted area**, meaning all designated areas are fully subject to federal protection under SARA.

### **Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally designate and legally protect** the specific geographic areas that are essential for the survival and recovery of the Coastrange Sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) Cultus population.

- These areas are defined in the **annexed document** (attached to the Order) and represent the actual physical locations where the sculpin relies on specific environmental conditions (e.g., water temperature, substrate type, flow, and connectivity) for breeding, feeding, and shelter.

- The designation ensures that any activities that could degrade or destroy these areas — such as mining, construction, or pollution — are subject to **federal environmental assessments and regulatory review** under SARA.

---

### **Legal Effect and Enforcement:**

- **Applicability of SARA Section 58(1):**  
  Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies directly to the critical habitat of this species. This means that any person or entity who carries out an activity that results in the **degradation or destruction** of the designated critical habitat is required to obtain a **permit** or comply with conditions under the Act.

- **Prohibited Activities:**  
  Activities that may harm or destroy critical habitat (e.g., dredging, road construction, logging, or discharging pollutants) are generally prohibited without a permit issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, unless the activity is deemed to have a negligible impact or is authorized under specific exemptions.

- **Public Access and Transparency:**  
  The Order is publicly accessible through the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, ensuring transparency and enabling stakeholders (including Indigenous communities, researchers, landowners, and environmental groups) to understand where critical habitat exists and the legal protections in place.

---

### **Effective Date:**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which typically occurs shortly after publication. This ensures that the legal protections are immediately enforceable upon official notification.

---

### **Significance of the Regulation:**

- **Conservation Value:**  
  This regulation provides a legally enforceable framework to protect a vulnerable and ecologically significant fish population.

- **Recovery Support:**  
  By protecting the essential environmental conditions where the sculpin lives and reproduces, the Order supports the long-term recovery of the species.

- **Compliance with International Obligations:**  
  The designation aligns with Canada’s commitments under international biodiversity agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to conserve species at risk and their habitats.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the Coastrange Sculpin (*Cottus aleuticus* Cultus population) under the *Species at Risk Act*, ensuring that the specific areas necessary for the species’ survival are legally protected. It is a key step in the recovery strategy for this threatened species, grounded in scientific assessment and legally sound procedures. The absence of any overlap with exempted areas under subsection 58(2)b confirms the full applicability of federal protection, reinforcing the regulatory strength and enforceability of the Order.

This Order represents a critical component of Canada’s biodiversity conservation framework and reflects a commitment to protecting native species and their ecological needs.
