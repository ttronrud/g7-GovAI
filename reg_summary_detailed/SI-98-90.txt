**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Corrected Certificates Remission Order (under the Canada Business Corporations Regulations)

**Legal Authority:**  
- **Primary Statute:** Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)  
- **Specific Provision:** Subsection 265(1) of the CBCA – authorizes the issuance of corrected certificates to correct errors in corporate certificates (such as share certificates).  
- **Fee Provision:** Subsection 82(1) of the *Canada Business Corporations Regulations* – establishes a fee payable by corporations for the issuance of corrected certificates.  
- **Remission Authority:** Subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act* – grants the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) the power to remit (forgive or waive) fees under certain circumstances, particularly when it would be unreasonable to collect them.  

**Background and Rationale:**  
The regulation is a *remission order* issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry and the Treasury Board. It acknowledges that it would be *unreasonable* to collect fees from corporations that were required to pay for corrected certificates issued between **October 3, 1991, and June 8, 1992**, under subsection 265(1) of the Canada Business Corporations Act.

This determination is based on practical and equitable considerations—likely due to the timing of the corrections, administrative challenges, or the fact that the corrections were made in response to errors that were not the fault of the corporations or that were part of a transitional or administrative process.

**Key Provisions of the Order:**

1. **Scope of Remission:**  
   The remission applies to **any corporation** that had fees (and any accrued interest) payable under **subsection 82(1)** of the *Canada Business Corporations Regulations* in respect of corrected certificates issued between **October 3, 1991, and June 8, 1992**.

2. **What is Remitted?**  
   - The **original fees** due under subsection 82(1)  
   - Any **interest** that may have accrued on those unpaid fees  
   - This includes both the principal amount and interest, if applicable

3. **Conditions for Application:**  
   - The corrected certificates must have been issued under subsection 265(1) of the CBCA  
   - The issuance must have occurred within the specified time period: **October 3, 1991 – June 8, 1992**  
   - The fees and interest must have **not been paid** by the corporation at the time of the order

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The order is effective immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* (as indicated by the citation: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)).

**Purpose and Impact:**  
- To provide **fairness and administrative relief** to corporations that incurred costs or administrative burdens in correcting share certificates during a specific period.  
- To prevent financial hardship or undue burden on businesses that were not at fault for the original errors.  
- To ensure compliance with the principle that fees should not be collected when doing so would be unreasonable or inconsistent with the intent of the legislation.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as a targeted, one-time relief measure to waive fees and interest for corporations that obtained corrected certificates under subsection 265(1) of the CBCA during a defined window. It reflects a policy decision by the federal government to balance regulatory enforcement with equity and practicality, especially in historical or transitional administrative contexts. The remission is not a general fee waiver but is strictly limited to the specified time frame and type of certificate correction.

**Note:**  
This order does not apply to corrected certificates issued outside the specified period or to other types of fees or certificates. It is a specific, time-bound, and narrowly defined relief.
