## 📚 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA), the primary legislation governing insurance companies in Canada. |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value of shares or ownership interests reported on an entity’s *unconsolidated* balance sheet. This is used to assess financial exposure. *(Note: "Book value" was repealed in 2008 under SOR/2008-168, s. 23.)* |
| **Member of a life company’s group** | Defined as per subsection 490(2) of the ICA. This includes subsidiaries and associated entities within the corporate group structure of a life company. |

> These definitions establish the scope and interpretation of key financial and organizational terms used throughout the regulations.

---

## ✅ Permitted IT Activities (Subsection 1)

> A life company may develop, design, hold, manage, manufacture, sell, or otherwise deal with:
- Data transmission systems
- Information sites
- Communication devices
- Information platforms or portals

**Conditions for Permissibility**:
- The IT activities must be **materially related** to the provision of financial products or services by:
  - The life company itself, or
  - A member of the life company’s group (i.e., its affiliated entities)

> 💡 **Example**: A life insurance company developing a mobile app to allow policyholders to manage claims or view policy details is permitted under this rule.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Approval from the Superintendent of Financial Services (SFS) is required under paragraph 441(1)(d.1) of the Act before such activities can proceed.

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Acquisitions (Subsection 2)

A life company **may not** acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in, an entity engaged in any of the IT activities described in subsection 1 **if** the total of the following exceeds **5% of the life company’s regulatory capital**:

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests the life company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the target entity under paragraph 495(2)(f) of the ICA.

2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests currently held by the life company and its subsidiaries in other entities engaging in the same IT activities (that the company controls or has a substantial investment in).

3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the life company and its subsidiaries to such entities (that are engaged in the IT activities and are under control or substantial investment).

> 🔍 **Purpose**: Prevents overexposure to IT-related risks through concentration in a single or small group of entities. The 5% threshold acts as a **risk-based capital limit** to ensure financial stability.

> 📌 *Note*: The calculation is based on **unconsolidated balance sheet values**, not consolidated group financials.

## 🔒 Additional Restrictions on Target Entities (Subsection 3)

A life company **cannot** acquire control of or increase a substantial investment in an entity that:
1. **Accepts deposit liabilities** (e.g., acts like a bank or savings institution) — prohibited due to systemic risk concerns.
2. Engages in any of the following **prohibited business activities**:
   - Activities banned under **sections 466, 469, or 475** of the ICA (e.g., lending, investment in certain assets).
   - **Dealing in securities**, except where permitted under:
     - Paragraph 495(2)(e) of the ICA (limited securities dealing), or
     - Paragraph 440(2)(b) of the ICA (specific exceptions for certain financial services).
   - **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** that a company is not permitted to deal in under subsection 441(3) of the ICA — *except* as permitted under subsection 1.
   - Activities prohibited under **section 489 regulations** if the entity is classified as a **finance entity** or another entity prescribed under paragraph 495(3)(c) of the ICA.
3. **Acquires control of or holds a substantial investment in another entity** unless:
   - The target entity is **controlled by the life company**, and the life company itself is permitted under **Part IX of the ICA** to invest in that entity, **or**
   - The target entity is **not controlled** by the life company, and the life company itself would be permitted to invest in it under:
     - Subsection 493(2)
     - Paragraphs 493(3)(b) or (c)
     - Subsections 493(4) or 495(1) or (2) of the ICA
   - OR the activity falls under a **prescribed activity** under paragraph 495(3)(e) of the ICA.

> 🚨 This creates a **nested layer of approval requirements** — even if the IT activity itself is permitted, the acquisition of an entity must be justified under existing investment rules.

---

## 🚫 Exemption from Certain Provisions (Subsection 4)

> **Subsections 495(6) to (8)** of the ICA (which typically relate to risk-based capital or investment limits) **do not apply** when determining whether a life company can acquire a substantial investment in an entity under:
- Subsection 493(2)
- Paragraphs 493(3)(b) or (c)
- Subsections 493(4), 495(1), or (2)

> ✅ **Effect**: Allows more flexibility in evaluating investment eligibility in IT-related entities, particularly when assessing compliance with investment rules under the ICA.

---

## 🚫 Limitations on Subsection 495(7) (Subsection 5)

> **Subsection 495(7)** of the ICA (which may restrict investments in certain types of entities) **does not apply** when:
- A life company acquires control of or increases a substantial investment in an entity whose business is **limited to activities described in subsection 3(1)** (i.e., only IT-related activities materially related to financial services).

> ✅ **Effect**: Provides a **safe harbor** for life companies investing in pure IT platforms used solely for delivering insurance services — without triggering broader investment restrictions.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This exemption **does not** limit the operation of:
- Subsections 3(2) and (3) of the Act — which may still apply to other aspects of operations or governance.

## 📅 Effective Date

> These Regulations come into force on the day they are **registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

## 🔍 Key Objectives & Policy Rationale

| Objective | Explanation |

## 📝 Practical Implications for Life Insurance Companies

| Scenario | Outcome |
|--------|--------|
| A life company develops a customer portal for policy management | ✅ Permitted under subsection 1 |
| The company acquires a tech startup that offers financial advisory services | ❌ Prohibited — involves securities dealing and deposit-taking; exceeds permitted scope |
| The company invests in a digital claims processing platform | ✅ Permitted if it's materially related to insurance services and within the 5% capital limit |
| The company invests in a fintech firm that also offers loans | ❌ Prohibited — because it engages in lending (section 466/469/475) |
