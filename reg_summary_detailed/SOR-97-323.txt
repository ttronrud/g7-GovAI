**Detailed Summary of the CCFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The *CCFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 13(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules governing the origin of goods for the purpose of determining eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under trade agreements.

These regulations are part of the implementation framework of the **Canada–Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)**, specifically designed to facilitate trade by clarifying the origin rules for a specific category of goods known as *casual goods*.

**Regulatory Citation:**

- **Primary Citation:** S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 75(1)  
- **Relevant Statutory Reference:** R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.) — the *Customs Tariff* (Third Supplement)

---

**Definition of Key Term:**

- **"Casual goods"** are defined as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or similar purpose**.  
  This implies that casual goods are typically **personal, non-commercial, or incidental items** — such as goods brought in by individuals for personal use, not intended for resale or business operations.  
  This distinction is critical because it establishes a separate origin rule from those applied to commercial or industrial goods.

**Origin Determination for Casual Goods Acquired in Chile:**

Casual goods acquired in Chile are deemed to **originate in Chile** and are thus **entitled to the benefits of the Chile Tariff** (i.e., preferential tariff treatment under the CCFTA) if **either** of the following conditions is met:

1. **Marking Compliance with Chilean Laws:**  
   The goods bear a mark that:  
   - Is in accordance with **Chile’s marking laws**, and  
   - Clearly indicates that the goods are the product of **Chile or Canada**.

   This marking requirement ensures transparency and helps customs authorities verify the origin of goods, especially in cases where origin is not immediately apparent.

2. **Absence of Marking with No Evidence of Non-Origin:**  
   If the goods **do not bear any mark**, they are still considered to originate in Chile **provided there is no evidence** to suggest that they are not the product of Chile or Canada.

   This provision provides a degree of flexibility and practicality, recognizing that some goods may not be marked due to packaging, size, or nature, and that absence of a mark alone does not negate Chilean origin — unless contrary evidence exists.

**Effective Date:**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 9 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 1997) comes into force.

- **Note:** The regulations were formally published and came into effect on **July 5, 1997**, as indicated by the reference to **SI/97-86** (Statutory Instrument 97-86).

---

**Purpose and Significance:**

- The rules provide a **simplified and accessible origin determination mechanism** for casual goods, which are often excluded from standard commercial origin rules due to their non-commercial nature.
- By recognizing Chilean origin for casual goods that meet the marking or evidentiary criteria, the regulations promote **fair access to preferential tariffs** under the CCFTA, especially for consumers and individuals traveling or residing in Canada who bring goods from Chile.
- This helps **reduce trade barriers** and supports the broader objectives of the CCFTA — enhancing trade flows, reducing costs, and fostering economic integration between Canada and Chile.

---

**Key Implications:**

- **Tariff Benefits:** Casual goods imported from Chile are eligible for **preferential tariff treatment** (i.e., lower or zero tariffs) under the CCFTA if they meet the origin criteria.
- **Flexibility in Marking:** The rules are not overly rigid — they allow for both marked and unmarked goods, as long as there is no evidence of non-Chilean origin.
- **Enforcement:** Customs authorities in Canada may rely on the marking or lack thereof, combined with available evidence, to determine origin, ensuring compliance with the agreement.

**Conclusion:**

The *CCFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a clear, practical, and equitable framework for determining the origin of non-commercial goods imported from Chile. By recognizing the origin of casual goods based on marking compliance or absence of contrary evidence, the regulations support the objectives of the Canada–Chile Free Trade Agreement while respecting the realities of personal and incidental imports. These rules are a key component in ensuring that the benefits of free trade extend to a broader range of goods, including those brought in for personal use.
