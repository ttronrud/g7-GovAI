**Detailed Summary of the Notice of Relocation Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 16, s. 12 & s. 27(2); R.S., c. 3 (2nd Supp.))**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Divorce Act* (the "Act"), implement and prescribe specific requirements for the **notice of relocation** and **objection to relocation** in family law proceedings involving children of a marriage. The regulations are designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and clarity when a parent or person with parenting responsibilities intends to move, or when another party objects to such a move.

They came into force on **March 1, 2021**, as referenced in the note (SI/2019-82), though they may have been registered later and would then take effect upon registration.

## **Key Provisions and Purpose**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to provide a standardized, structured process for:

1. **Notifying** a person’s intention to relocate (a parent or guardian),
2. **Allowing others with parenting responsibilities** to object to the relocation,
3. **Enabling contact persons** (under a contact order) to notify their intention to change residence,
4. **Ensuring all relevant parties are informed** of key details about the relocation, including timelines, addresses, and proposed arrangements for parenting time or contact.

This helps courts assess the impact of relocation on children and supports the best interests of the child standard.
