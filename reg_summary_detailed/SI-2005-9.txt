**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 14 of the Territorial Lands Act**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council—acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**—to modify or extend land grants by including specific portions of waterbeds or submerged areas within existing land grants. The inclusion is typically done to clarify land boundaries or to reflect the actual physical extent of land rights, especially in regions where water bodies are integral to land ownership or use.

**Subject Matter of the Order:**
The regulation formally **includes a portion of the bed of Great Slave Lake**—specifically, the area lying **below the ordinary high water mark**—within a defined parcel of territorial land. This inclusion is significant because it legally recognizes that the submerged bed of the lake is part of the land grant, even though it is underwater.

**Geographic Location:**
- **Body of Water:** Great Slave Lake  
- **Jurisdiction:** Northwest Territories, Canada  
- The lake is one of the largest inland lakes in North America and lies in the central part of the Northwest Territories.

**Specific Land Grant Involved:**
- **Lot 17, Block 19**  
- This lot is defined by reference to a **plan of survey of record number 83825**, which is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** maintained in Ottawa.  
- A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District in **Yellowknife**, under reference number **3578**. This ensures that the official survey and boundary description are accessible and legally binding.

**Description of the Included Area:**
- The portion of Lot 17, Block 19, that lies **on the bed of Great Slave Lake**, specifically **below the ordinary high water mark**.  
- The "ordinary high water mark" is a legally recognized benchmark used to distinguish between land and water. It refers to the level to which water typically rises under normal conditions, excluding storm surges or exceptional flooding.  
- Therefore, the regulation includes the **submerged bed** of the lake beneath this mark, which is typically considered part of the land's physical extent and may have implications for land use, rights of access, or future development.

**Legal and Practical Implications:**
1. **Clarification of Land Boundaries:** The inclusion ensures that the legal description of the land grant accurately reflects the physical reality of the land, particularly in a region where water bodies are central to land ownership and jurisdiction.
2. **Ownership and Use Rights:** By including the lake bed, the land grant holder may have certain rights related to the use, management, or potential development of the submerged area—such as access, mineral rights, or environmental management—depending on applicable laws.
3. **Legal Record and Enforcement:** The inclusion is formally recorded in the land titles system, which strengthens the legal standing of the grant and provides a clear, documented basis for future transactions, disputes, or government actions.
4. **Environmental and Indigenous Considerations:** While not explicitly stated in this regulation, such land grants in northern Canada may have implications for Indigenous land rights, traditional use, or environmental protection. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development's involvement suggests that the decision may consider relevant Indigenous interests or land-use agreements, though this is not directly stated in the text.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation legally incorporates the **submerged bed of Great Slave Lake**, below the ordinary high water mark, into the boundaries of **Lot 17, Block 19** in the Northwest Territories. It is issued under statutory authority to ensure that land grants accurately reflect physical land features and is grounded in a formal survey record. The order enhances legal certainty, supports land title integrity, and reflects the integration of waterbeds into land ownership frameworks in northern Canada.

**Key Terms:**
- *Ordinary high water mark*: The standard level to which water rises under normal conditions.
- *Territorial Lands Act*: The primary legislation governing land grants and land titles in Canada’s territories.
- *Governor General in Council*: The formal executive authority of the Canadian government, acting on ministerial recommendations.
- *Land Titles Office*: The official body responsible for recording land ownership and boundaries.

This regulation serves as a formal, legally binding amendment to the land grant description, ensuring clarity and consistency in land administration in the Northwest Territories.
