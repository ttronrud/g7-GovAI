## 💰 5. Taxation Rules for Gaming Activities

### A. **Net Tax for a Provincial Gaming Authority**

The total net tax for a reporting period is calculated as:

> **Net Tax = (Net Tax from Gaming Activities) + (Net Tax from Non-Gaming Activities)**

Where:
- **Gaming Net Tax** = Total amounts added (as per sections 2–3) − Total credits (prizes, winnings, additional credits)
- **Non-Gaming Net Tax** = Determined under **Section 8** of the Act

---

### B. **Net Tax Attributable to Gaming Activities**

Calculated using:

> **Gaming Net Tax = (Amounts Added) – (Total Credits)**

Where:
- **Amounts Added** = Total of amounts required under subsections (2) and (3) to be included in net tax
- **Total Credits** = 
  - Credits for prizes/winnings (from subsections 4 and 5)
  - Additional credit for gaming activities (subsection 6)

---

### C. **Adding Amounts to Net Tax (When a Bet is Placed)**

When a person places a bet with a PGA (excluding purchasing an instant win ticket from a distributor), the authority **adds** to its gaming net tax the amount:

> **Added Amount = (Tax Rate Base) × (100% + %A) × (Bet Amount) / (Tax Amount by Person)**

Where:
- **Tax Rate Base** =  
  - If bet placed in a **participating province**: *Rate in subsection 165(1) + provincial tax rate*  
  - Else: *Only rate in subsection 165(1)*  
- **%A** = Percentage determined for A (likely a fixed or variable rate, e.g., 100% for full tax inclusion)  
- **Bet Amount** = Total amount bet, including tax paid by the person  
- **Tax by Person** = Any tax the person pays on the bet under provincial law

> 🔍 This rule ensures that **all bets** are taxed at a rate that reflects both federal and provincial tax obligations.

---

### D. **Adding Amounts for Instant Win Tickets**

When a PGA delivers or agrees to deliver an instant win ticket to a distributor, and the distributor pays the authority during a reporting period, the authority adds:

> **Added Amount = (Tax Rate Base) × (100% + %A) × (Face Value of Ticket) / (Tax by Distributor)**

Where:
- **Face Value** = Price shown on the ticket, inclusive of tax
- **Tax by Distributor** = Any tax paid by the distributor on the ticket

> ⚠️ This ensures that **instant win tickets** are taxed as if they were part of a bet, even though they are sold to distributors.

---

### E. **Credit for Prizes or Winnings (Non-Instant Win)**

When a prize is payable (e.g., from a bet), the authority receives a **credit** equal to:

> **Credit = (Tax Rate Base) × (100% + %A) × (Prize Amount)**

Where:
- **Tax Rate Base** = Same as above (provincial + federal if applicable)
- **Prize Amount** = Actual amount paid as prize

> ✅ This credit offsets the tax added when the bet was placed.

---

### F. **Credit for Instant Win Prizes**

For instant win tickets delivered to distributors, the credit is
