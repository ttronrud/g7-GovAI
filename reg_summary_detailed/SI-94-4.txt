## 📌 **Core Principles of the Agreement**

### 1. **Residency and Eligibility**
- Any person who is **subject to the legislation of any Party**, and their **dependants and survivors**, shall:
  - Be **subject to the obligations** of the legislation of **any other Party** while residing there.
  - Be **eligible for benefits** under that legislation under **the same conditions** as a resident of that jurisdiction.

> This ensures that individuals are not disadvantaged by moving between jurisdictions.

---

### 2. **No Reduction or Suspension of Benefits**
- Benefits under the Agreement shall **not be reduced, modified, suspended, or cancelled** solely because the person resides in another Party.
- Benefits are **paid in the territory of the other Party** where the person resides.

> This protects individuals from benefit erosion due to cross-border residence.

---

### 3. **Benefit Payment for Multiple Party Exposure**
- If a person is subject to the legislation of **more than one Party**, or if dependants/survivors are covered by multiple systems:
  - Benefits shall be paid in a **third State** (i.e., not in the jurisdiction where the person is primarily covered).

> Example: A Canadian resident working in Jersey and Guernsey may receive benefits from one jurisdiction, and dependants’ benefits from another, with payments coordinated in a third country.

---

### 4. **Employment and Work-Based Rules**

| Scenario | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Employed person working in a Party’s territory** | Subject **only** to that Party’s legislation |
| **Self-employed person** | Subject **only** to the legislation of the Party where they **ordinarily reside** (first Party) |
| **Detached employment (e.g., temporary assignment)** | Subject only to the **original Party’s legislation** for up to **36 months**. This may be extended with **prior consent** of both competent authorities |
| **Crew members of ships** | Subject only to the legislation of the Party where they are **ordinarily resident** (not the country of work) |

> This prevents double coverage and ensures consistency in benefit entitlements.

### 5. **Credit Periods and Benefit Calculations**

#### ✅ **For Jersey (Old Age Pension & Widow’s Benefits):**
- 1 year of **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** contributions = **1.00 annual contribution factor**
- 1 week of **Old Age Security Act (OAS)** contributions (not in CPP) = **0.0193 weekly contribution factor**

> These factors are used to calculate pension entitlements under Jersey law.

#### ✅ **For Guernsey (Old Age Pension & Widow’s Benefit):**
- 1 year of **CPP contributions** = **52 weeks of contributions**
- 1 week of **OAS contributions** (not in CPP) = **1 week of contributions**

> This provides a direct conversion of Canadian contributions into Guernsey equivalent weeks.

#### ✅ **For Canada (OAS & CPP):**
- A **creditable period** under another Party’s legislation, or a **period of residence** in that Party after the age at which residence becomes creditable under OAS, counts as **residence in Canada** for OAS purposes.
- For **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**:
  - A **contribution year** with:
    - At least **0.25 annual contribution factor** under **Jersey** law, **or**
    - At least **13 weeks of contributions** under **Guernsey** law
    → Counts as **one CPP contribution year**

> This allows Canadians living in Jersey or Gu
