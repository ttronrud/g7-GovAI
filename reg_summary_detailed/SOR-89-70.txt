## **Detailed Summary of the Members of Panels Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Context**

- **Agreement Reference**:  
  These regulations are established under the **Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Canada and the United States**, signed on **January 2, 1988**, specifically under **Chapter 19**, which governs **dispute settlement mechanisms** between the two countries.

- **Relevant Annexes**:  
  The regulations are based on:

  - **Paragraph 1 of Annex 1904.13** – Supports the process of selecting individuals to serve on panels.

- **Statutory Authority**:  
  The regulations are issued under **paragraph 77.27(c)** of the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**.

- **Regulation Citation**:  
  The regulation is officially cited as the **Members of Panels Regulations**, enacted under **S.C. 1988, c. 65, s. 42**.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Establish a formal, transparent, and impartial **panel roster** of qualified individuals who may be selected to serve on dispute resolution panels under Chapter 19 of the Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement.
- Provide a clear mechanism for selecting panel members from this roster or, in limited circumstances, from outside it.
- Ensure that panel members are selected based on **objective criteria** and **good standing**, promoting fairness, neutrality, and consistency in dispute adjudication.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

- **Panel Roster** (also referred to as *liste de candidats pour les groupes spéciaux*):  
  A list of individuals who have been nominated and approved to serve as potential members of dispute resolution panels under Chapter 19 of the FTA.  
  → This roster is established by **Section 3** of the regulations and is detailed in the **Schedule** attached to the regulation.

---

### **4. Duration of Panel Roster Membership**

- Each candidate listed in the panel roster is:
  - **Selected to serve for a period of three years**, or
  - **Until they cease to be in good behaviour** (i.e., until they are removed due to misconduct, resignation, or other grounds of ineligibility).

> This means that the roster is not permanent; it is renewable every three years, and individuals remain eligible only if they maintain professional integrity and compliance with legal and ethical standards.

---

### **5. Selection Process for Panel Members**

#### **Standard Selection (from the Panel Roster)**

- When a panel is needed under **paragraphs 2 or 3 of Annex 1901.2**, the candidate must be selected from the **panel roster**.
- The selection is conducted by a **Board** composed of:
  - The **Minister of Finance** (as chairperson),
  - The **Minister of International Trade**,
  - **Other ministers of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, designated by the **Prime Minister** from time to time.

> This ensures that the selection process is **ministerially accountable**, **transparent**, and **involves high-level political oversight**.

#### **Exceptional Selection (outside the Roster)**

- In rare cases, the Board may select a candidate **not on the panel roster** to serve on a panel.
- However, such selection must:
  - Be made **in accordance with** the criteria specified in **paragraph 1 of Annex 1901.2** (which typically includes qualifications such as expertise, impartiality, independence, and experience in relevant fields).
  - Be **subject to those same criteria**.

> This provision allows flexibility in emergencies or when no suitable candidate is available on the roster, but ensures that all panel members meet the required standards.

---

### **6. Appointment of Panel Members**

- Once a candidate has been selected under paragraphs 2 or 3 of Annex 1901.2 (to review a definitive decision), the **Minister** is responsible for formally **appointing** the candidate as a member of the panel.

> This step formalizes the selection and provides legal authority for the individual to participate in the dispute review process.

### **8. Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Impartiality & Neutrality** | The selection process is designed to ensure that panel members are independent and free from bias, especially given their role in resolving sensitive trade disputes. |
| **Transparency** | The existence of a public roster and the clear process for selection enhance transparency and public trust. |
| **Accountability** | The Board (chaired by the Minister of Finance) ensures political accountability in the selection process. |
| **Flexibility** | The ability to select individuals outside the roster allows for adaptation to specific dispute needs, though only under strict criteria. |
| **Time-Limited Eligibility** | The three-year term (or good behaviour) prevents indefinite tenure and promotes regular renewal and evaluation of panel members. |

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- Panel members must comply with the **standards of conduct** required under the FTA and Canadian law.
- Any candidate who violates these standards (e.g., conflicts of interest, unethical behaviour) may be removed from the roster or panel.
- The **Minister** has the authority to appoint individuals, but only after the Board has made a selection in accordance with the rules.

---

### **10. Historical and Practical Significance**

- These regulations were enacted in **1988**, during the early years of the Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement (which later evolved into the Canada–U.S. Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA).
- They represent one of the foundational mechanisms for **dispute resolution** in bilateral trade agreements, ensuring that disputes are resolved by **independent, qualified, and accountable experts**.
- The use of a **panel roster system** reflects a modern, institutional approach to dispute settlement, balancing **efficiency** with **fairness**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Members of Panels Regulations** establish a structured, transparent, and accountable system for selecting individuals to serve on dispute resolution panels under the Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement. By creating a formal panel roster of qualified experts, setting clear selection criteria, and defining the roles of key government officials, the regulations ensure that trade disputes are resolved by impartial, knowledgeable, and politically responsible individuals. The three-year term and requirement of "good behaviour" further reinforce the integrity and accountability of the process.

This regulation remains a key component of Canada’s **bilateral dispute settlement framework** with the United States and is consistent with international standards for fair and effective trade dispute resolution.
