**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Period for Entering into an Agreement for the Purpose of Jointly Establishing a Review Panel Regulations"**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under **section 143a of the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA)**, which empowers the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND) to consult with key stakeholders before making regulatory decisions. The consultation process includes:

- The **Territorial Minister** (representing the Northwest Territories government),
- **First Nations** communities,
- The **Tlicho Government** (a First Nation government in the Mackenzie Valley),
- The **Review Board** (an independent body tasked with reviewing proposed projects).

This regulation is a formal step in fulfilling the requirement of **consultation and participation** in resource management decisions, particularly those involving potential environmental and cultural impacts.

The regulation is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to **paragraph 143(1)(g)** of the MVRMA. This paragraph grants the Minister the authority to issue regulations that establish timeframes for joint agreements related to review panels.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish a clear, time-bound period during which parties can enter into an agreement to jointly establish a Review Panel**.

A **Review Panel** is a body formed to independently assess the environmental, social, cultural, and economic implications of a proposed project or activity under the MVRMA. The involvement of First Nations and the Tlicho Government in forming such panels ensures that Indigenous knowledge, values, and interests are meaningfully integrated into decision-making processes.

By setting a specific timeline, the regulation promotes **transparency, accountability, and timely engagement**, ensuring that Indigenous and territorial voices are not delayed or marginalized in the review process.

### **3. Key Provisions and Timeframes**

The regulation defines two distinct 90-day periods during which parties must enter into an agreement to establish a Review Panel, depending on the nature and stage of the proposed project:

#### **(a) For Subsection 138.1(4) of the MVRMA**
- **Trigger**: When a proposal is referred to the **Minister of the Environment** under **paragraph 130(1)(c)** of the MVRMA.
- **Timeframe**: A **90-day period** begins on the day the proposal is referred to the Minister of the Environment.
- **Purpose**: This ensures that Indigenous and territorial stakeholders have sufficient time to respond, negotiate, and agree on the formation of a joint review panel before the environmental or resource assessment process proceeds.

#### **(b) For Subsection 141(4) of the MVRMA**
- **Trigger**: When an **environmental impact review** is ordered under any of the following provisions:
  - Subparagraph **128(1)(b)(i)**,
  - Paragraph **128(1)(c)**,
  - Paragraph **130(1)(a)**,
  - Subparagraph **130(1)(b)(ii)**, or
  - Paragraph **131(1)(b)** of the MVRMA.
- **Timeframe**: A **90-day period** begins on the day the environmental impact review is formally ordered.
- **Purpose**: This provision ensures that review panels are established in a timely manner when environmental assessments are initiated, allowing for early integration of Indigenous perspectives into the assessment process.

> Note: The 90-day period is not a deadline for completing the review, but rather a **window for agreement** on the formation of a joint review panel. Once the panel is established, it may proceed with its review as per the Act.

### **4. Regulatory Enforcement and Effective Date**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- This ensures that the timeframes are immediately applicable once the regulation is formally adopted and made public.

### **5. Significance and Implications**

- **Indigenous Participation**: This regulation strengthens the legal framework for **Indigenous governance and consultation** in resource development decisions. It ensures that First Nations and the Tlicho Government are not passive observers but active participants in the review process.
  
- **Transparency and Timeliness**: By setting a clear 90-day window, the regulation prevents indefinite delays and ensures that review panels are formed in a timely and structured manner.

- **Compliance with Legal Requirements**: The regulation fulfills the requirements of the MVRMA, particularly in relation to **consultation, participation, and environmental review**, and aligns with broader federal and territorial commitments to **Indigenous rights and self-determination**.

- **Support for Environmental and Cultural Stewardship**: The establishment of a joint review panel allows for a more comprehensive and culturally sensitive assessment of projects, incorporating both scientific and traditional knowledge.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a critical component of the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act’s framework for **inclusive, equitable, and transparent resource development**. By establishing a 90-day period for the formation of a joint review panel in response to specific stages of project review, it ensures that Indigenous communities and territorial governments have meaningful opportunities to participate in environmental and resource decisions. It reflects a commitment to **co-governance**, **cultural respect**, and **environmental responsibility** in the Arctic and northern regions of Canada.

**In short**:  
This regulation sets a 90-day deadline for First Nations, the Tlicho Government, and the territorial government to agree on forming a joint review panel when a project proposal is referred to the Minister of the Environment or when an environmental impact review is initiated. It strengthens Indigenous participation and ensures timely, inclusive decision-making in resource management.
