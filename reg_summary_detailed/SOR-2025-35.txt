## 📝 Application Process

- Applications must be submitted in the **form and manner specified by the Minister**.
- An application is **deemed made only upon receipt** by the Minister.
- Applications can be submitted **before or after eligibility**.
- If a beneficiary becomes ineligible in a given month, their benefit **ceases as of that month**, and they must **submit a new application** to resume benefits.

---

## 📅 Approval and Benefit Start Date

- Subject to subsection (2), an application is **deemed approved** on the **earliest day** the applicant becomes eligible and for which a benefit has not already been paid.
- The **earliest possible approval date** is **24 months before** the date the application is submitted.

> This means that even if someone applies in January 2025, their benefit may not start until January 2023 — but only if they meet eligibility criteria.

## 💰 Benefit Calculation Formula

The monthly benefit is calculated using the formula:

> **Monthly Benefit = (Indexing Factor × Base Amount) – (Reduction Based on Income)**

Where:

### 1. **Indexing Factor**
- Calculated as:  
  $$
  \text{Indexing Factor} = \frac{\text{Highest CPI for any year from 2024 to the year before the payment period}}{\text{CPI for 2024}}
  $$
- CPI refers to the **all-items Consumer Price Index for Canada**, annual average, not seasonally adjusted, as published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*.

### 2. **Reduction Based on Income**

Depending on the beneficiary’s situation, the reduction is calculated differently:

#### 🟢 Case 1: No Cohabiting Spouse or Common-Law Partner  
Reduction = greater of 0 or:  
$$
\text{Reduction} = \max\left(0, \left(\text{Adjusted Income} - \text{Working Income}\right)\right)
$$  
Where:
- Adjusted income = income excluding benefits (from *section 122.6 of ITA*)
- Working income = sum of:
  - Paragraphs (a) and (b) of *section 122.7(1)* of ITA
  - Net farming, fishing, professional, commission, or other business income

> The reduction is capped at **$10,000 × Indexing Factor**

#### 🟡 Case 2: Cohabiting Spouse (Not a Beneficiary)  
Reduction = greater of 0 or:  
$$
\text{Reduction} = \max\left(0, \left(\text{Adjusted Income} + \text{Spouse’s Working Income}\right) - \text{Cap}\right)
$$  
Where:
- Cap = **$14,000 × Indexing Factor**

> Adjusted income includes spouse's income if they were cohabiting at year-end.

#### 🔴 Case 3: Cohabiting Spouse (Also a Beneficiary)  
Same formula as Case 2 — both partners' working incomes are combined, capped at **$14,000 × Indexing Factor**

> The formula ensures that the benefit is reduced based on total household income.

> **Final benefit amount is rounded to the nearest cent** (to the higher cent if equidistant).

## 📅 Payment Schedule

- **First Benefit Payment**: Paid in the **month following** the month the application is approved.
- **Monthly Payments**: Paid each month during the **payment period (July 1 – June 30)**.
- **If Monthly Benefit ≤ $20**:  
  - The **entire benefit for the remaining months** is paid as a **lump sum** on the day the first monthly payment would have been due.

> This simplifies payments for low-income beneficiaries.

## ⛔ Suspension and Resumption of Benefits

### Suspension:
- The Minister may suspend payment if they have **reasonable grounds** to believe the applicant does **not meet eligibility criteria** or if an inquiry is needed.
- Suspension takes effect on the **later of**:
  - The last day of the month the request is processed
  - The date indicated in the beneficiary’s written request

### Resumption:
- A beneficiary may **request resumption in writing** within **24 months** of suspension.
- If no request is received, the benefit is **deemed to have ceased**, and a new application is required.
- If the request is made, the Minister must:
  - Resume payments on the **later of**:
    - The month after receiving the request
    - The month indicated in the request
- If the Minister determines the person is eligible, they must resume payments and make a **lump sum payment** equal to the total monthly benefits that
