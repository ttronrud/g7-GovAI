### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

#### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**  
**Issued by:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulatory order is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of private or commercial development) in order to **support the establishment of the Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve**.

This reserve is located within the **Sahtu Settlement Area** of the **Northwest Territories** and is proposed as a protected area that recognizes the cultural, ecological, and spiritual significance of the land to the Nááts’ihch’oh people — a First Nation community with deep ancestral ties to the region.

By withdrawing these lands from disposal, the government ensures that the land remains protected and preserved for conservation, cultural purposes, and the benefit of Indigenous communities.

---

### **Scope of Withdrawal**

- **Geographic Area:**  
  The withdrawal applies to a defined parcel of land in the **Sahtu Settlement Area**, specifically described in a detailed legal description in the schedule.

- **Area Size:**  
  Approximately **7,600 km²** (square kilometers)

- **Nature of Withdrawal:**  
  The withdrawal includes **both surface and subsurface rights** to the land. This means that no mineral rights (such as oil, gas, or minerals) or surface rights (like for agriculture, forestry, or development) can be transferred, leased, or sold during the specified period.

- **Duration:**  
  The withdrawal is effective for a period of **one year**, beginning on the date the Order is officially made.

### **Key Legal Provisions and Exclusions**

Despite the general withdrawal of lands from disposal, **Section 2 of the Territorial Lands Act** — which normally governs the disposal of land — **does not apply** in the following specific circumstances:

1. **Mineral Prospecting Permits (Pre-existing Claims):**  
   - A person who holds a **prospecting permit granted before the date of the Order** may still locate a mineral claim on the land.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims (Pre-existing):**  
   - Claims that were **already located or recorded before the Order came into effect** are not affected.

3. **Leasing of Recorded Claims:**  
   - A person with a **recorded mineral claim** may be granted a **lease** (under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations*) covering the area of the claim, even if the land is otherwise withdrawn.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (Pre-existing Exploration Licences):**  
   - If a **significant discovery licence** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* is issued to a holder of an exploration licence that was issued **before the Order**, and the licence covers an area subject to that exploration licence, the restriction does not apply.

5. **Production Licences (Pre-existing Exploration/Discovery Licences):**  
   - A **production licence** issued to a holder of a pre-existing exploration or significant discovery licence — if it covers land subject to those licences — is exempt from the withdrawal.

6. **Surface Leases for Claim Exercise:**  
   - A **surface lease** may be issued to a holder of a recorded mineral claim or an interest under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*, **if required to allow the holder to exercise rights** under their claim or interest.

7. **Renewal of Interests:**  
   - The renewal of any mineral interest (e.g., exploration or production rights) is not blocked by this Order.

> ✅ **This ensures continuity** for existing mining or exploration activities that were already underway or legally established prior to the Order’s issuance.

### **Repeal Clause**

The regulation includes a **repeal provision** that explicitly removes a previously existing legal description of a parcel of land from the Northwest Territories. This parcel — previously referenced in other legislation — is now **repealed** because it is now fully covered and integrated into the new Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve.

#### **Description of the Repealed Parcel:**

- **Commencement Point:**  
  Intersection of the **Yukon–NWT Boundary** with the **southern boundary of the Sahtu Settlement Area**  
  → Approx. **62°06′38″N, 129°10′07″W**

- **Survey Path (in sequence):**
  1. **Northeasterly** along the Sahtu Settlement Area boundary to **62°37′00″N, 127°23′10″W**  
  2. **Northerly** to **62°42′00″N, 127°25′12″W**  
  3. **Northerly** to **62°53′24″N, 127°36′36″W**  
  4. **Northwesterly** to **ROCK monument** at **63°03′07″N, 127°58′08″W**  
  5. **Northwesterly** to **monument 769045** at **63°04′01″N, 128°04′59″W**  
  6. **Westerly** to **monument 769034** at **63°02′25″N, 128°32′36″W**

  8. **Southwesterly** to **62°57′00″N, 129°01′48″W**  
  9. **Northwesterly** to **62°58′12″N, 129°09′36″W**  
  10. **Westerly** to **62°58′12″N, 129°12′00″W**  
  11. **Northwesterly** to **CHRIS monument** at **63°03′12″N, 129°22′59″W**  
  12. **Westerly** to the intersection of **latitude 63°03′00″N** with the Yukon–NWT Boundary at **129°36′43″W**  
  13. **Generally southerly** back to the **point of commencement**

> All coordinates are based on the **NAD83 (CSRS)** datum and referenced using the **UTM projection plane**.

### **Geospatial and Technical Notes**

- **Datum System:** All coordinates are referenced to the **1983 North American Datum (NAD83)** and the **Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS)**.
- **Projection:** The coordinates are projected using the **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)** system.
- **Straight Lines:** The description assumes that "straight lines" connect the points directly on the **UTM projection surface**, not on the Earth’s curved surface.

### **Significance and Implications**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Cultural Protection** | Supports Indigenous rights and cultural heritage by preserving land for traditional uses and spiritual practices. |
| **Environmental Conservation** | Establishes a protected area to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems in a remote and ecologically sensitive region. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Provides clear boundaries and legal status for the reserve, reducing ambiguity in land use. |
| **Exemptions for Existing Rights** | Maintains continuity for existing mining or exploration activities, ensuring stability for stakeholders. |
| **Temporary Nature** | The one-year withdrawal allows time for planning, consultation, and final designation of the park reserve under broader environmental and Indigenous governance frameworks. |

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a **key step in the establishment of the Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve**. It legally withdraws approximately 7,600 km² of land from disposal, ensuring its protection for conservation and Indigenous use. While it broadly prohibits future land disposals, it includes **specific exemptions** for pre-existing mineral claims and exploration activities to avoid disrupting ongoing legitimate operations.

The repeal of a prior parcel description ensures that the legal framework is updated and aligned with the new reserve’s boundaries, reflecting a commitment to **Indigenous sovereignty, environmental stewardship, and land-based governance**.

---

> **Note:** This Order is part of a broader process involving **Indigenous consultation, environmental assessments, and federal-provincial-territorial coordination**. It should be read in conjunction with the Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve Act and related Indigenous land claims agreements.
