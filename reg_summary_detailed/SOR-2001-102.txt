Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the **Cost of Borrowing (Canadian Insurance Companies) Regulations**, enacted under the *Insurance Companies Act* and effective as of 1997, with amendments in 1999 and 1991.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Cost of Borrowing (Canadian Insurance Companies) Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **Sections 479 to 488a and 703b of the Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**.
- The purpose is to ensure **transparency and fairness** in the disclosure of the **true cost of borrowing** to consumers when they enter into credit agreements with insurance companies or financial institutions.

> ✅ *Key Legal Foundation*: The regulations implement **Section 481** of the ICA, which mandates that the cost of borrowing must be expressed as an **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**, and **Section 480**, which requires clear and timely disclosure of this cost to borrowers.

### **2. Definitions (Key Terms)**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* |
| **APR** | Annual Percentage Rate – the total cost of borrowing expressed as an annual rate on the principal, including interest and certain fees |
| **Borrower** | Includes individuals or entities to whom a loan is offered, or applicants for a credit card |
| **Credit Agreement** | Any agreement involving a loan, line of credit, or credit card |
| **Disbursement Charge** | Fees incurred by the lender to arrange, document, insure, or secure the loan (e.g., legal, appraisal, insurance) – *excludes interest* |
| **Hypothec** | A mortgage or security interest in immovable property |
| **Principal** | The amount borrowed, excluding interest or other costs |
| **Public Index** | A variable interest rate published weekly in a widely circulated newspaper or media (e.g., Bank of Canada’s prime rate, T-bill rate) |

> ⚠️ *Note*: The term "public index" is crucial for variable-rate loans — it serves as the base rate upon which interest is calculated.

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **credit agreements** **except** those that fall under the following exclusions:

- Agreements made **for business purposes** of the borrower  
- Agreements with **non-natural persons** (e.g., corporations, trusts)  
- Loans governed by the **Canada Student Loans Act**  
- Loans under any **federal or provincial student loan legislation** that already require interest or discount disclosure  

> 🚫 *Excluded Cases*: These exceptions ensure that student loan programs, which are regulated separately, are not subject to redundant disclosure requirements.

### **4. Cost of Borrowing: Calculation and Components**

#### **A. For Loans (not credit cards or lines of credit):**
The **total cost of borrowing** must be expressed as an **APR** over the term of the loan, calculated using the following formula:

> **APR = (Total Cost of Borrowing / Principal) × (100 / Term in Years)**  
> Where:
> - Total cost of borrowing = sum of all interest, fees, and charges over the term
> - Principal = outstanding balance at each period (before any payment)
> - Term = loan duration in years (to at least two decimal places)

##### **Key Rules for APR Calculation:**
- **Rounding**: APR may be rounded to the **nearest eighth of a percent** (e.g., 5.125%).
- **Payment Application Order**: Each payment is applied **first to the accumulated cost of borrowing**, then to the principal (prevents negative amortization).
- **Time Periods**:
  - 1 month = 1/12 of a year
  - 1 week = 1/52 of a year
  - 1 day = 1/365 of a year
- **Variable Interest Rates**: Must use the **rate in effect on the date of calculation**.
- **No Installments?** If no payments are made, APR is calculated assuming repayment in **one lump sum** at maturity.
- **New Credit Agreements**: A loan that builds on an existing balance is treated as a **new credit agreement** for APR purposes.

#### **B. For Credit Cards or Lines of Credit:**
- **Fixed interest rate**: APR = the fixed annual interest rate  
- **Variable interest rate**: APR = the annual interest rate **on the date of disclosure**

> ✅ *Simpler rules* apply to credit cards and lines of credit — no need to calculate APR over time; disclosure is based on current or disclosed rate.

#### **C. What Constitutes "Cost of Borrowing"?**
Includes all **non-interest charges** that are part of the loan cost, such as:
- Administrative fees
- Lawyer or notary fees (required by the company)
- Insurance (excluding optional or borrower-beneficiary policies)
- Broker fees (if included in the amount borrowed and paid directly by the company)
- Appraisal, inspection, or surveying fees (for property used as security)

> ❌ **Excluded Charges** (not included in cost of borrowing):
- Insurance on the loan if:
  - Optional
  - Beneficiary is the borrower and covers asset value
- Overdraft fees
- Registry fees (to register security interests)
- Penalty fees for early repayment
- Lawyer/notary fees (unless required by company)
- Title defect insurance (paid by borrower)
- Appraisal/inspection services provided directly to borrower
- Default insurance on high-ratio mortgages
- Tax account maintenance fees (required or optional)
- Fees to discharge a security interest
- Default charges

> 📌 *Important*: Only **mandatory** and **directly related** charges are included in the cost of borrowing.
