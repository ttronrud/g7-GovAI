### **Significance and Context**

This Order was part of a broader **metrication initiative** in Canada during the 1970s, driven by:
- The need to align with international standards (especially in trade with the United States and Europe);
- The benefits of standardization in science, engineering, and commerce;
- The desire to modernize national infrastructure and reduce confusion caused by mixed units (e.g., metric and imperial).

Although Canada officially adopted the metric system as the primary system of measurement in 1970, the Commission was created to **plan and manage the transition** in a systematic, practical, and cost-effective manner.

- Develop a coordinated national strategy;
- Advise government on necessary actions;
- Ensure public understanding and minimal disruption.

It reflects a balanced approach—combining technical expertise, governmental oversight, and public engagement—to facilitate a smooth and beneficial transition to the metric system across all sectors of Canadian society.
