**Detailed Summary of the Accountable Advances Regulations (C.R.C., c. 668)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**
The Treasury Board, under **section 31 of the Financial Administration Act**, has revoked the previous *Accountable Advances Regulations* and replaced them with updated regulations. These new **Accountable Advances Regulations** establish clear, standardized rules governing the issuance, accounting, repayment, and recovery of **accountable advances**—funds provided by a government department to individuals or entities for specific purposes, with the expectation that the recipient will account for and eventually repay the funds.

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To ensure **financial accountability** and **transparency** in the use of public funds.
- To prevent misuse or unauthorized disbursement of funds.
- To provide **clarity and consistency** in how accountable advances are issued, tracked, and repaid.
- To align with broader financial administration principles and public accountability standards.
