**Detailed Summary of the Standard Trust Depositors Remission Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Standard Trust Depositors Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of key federal financial authorities — specifically, the **Minister of National Revenue**, the **President of the Treasury Board and Minister of State (Finance)**, and the **Treasury Board**.

This order is made under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General to issue orders for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of certain taxes and penalties when it is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **relieve Standard Trust Company (and Standard Loan Company) depositors** who were financially impacted by the **loss of access to their insured deposits** due to the **1991 financial crisis** — particularly the **failure of the trust company to meet its obligations**, including tax payments and remittances.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Trust company**: Refers to either *Standard Trust Company* or *Standard Loan Company*.
- The term "deposit insured" means deposits protected under the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act**, which provides insurance coverage for eligible deposits up to a specified limit (at the time of the Order, $60,000).

### **Main Provisions of the Order**

#### **Section 3 – Remission of Income Tax and Penalties**

The Order grants remission (forgiveness) of the following amounts:

1. **Income Tax Remission**  
   - A taxpayer is entitled to have **income tax remitted** (forgiven) in an amount **equal to the interest** that would have been payable on their taxable income from **April 18, 1991**, up to the date the insured deposit was paid out.
   - This interest is calculated under the **Income Tax Act** and represents the tax liability that arose because the taxpayer could not access their deposits, thereby affecting their income.

2. **Penalty Remission**  
   - The taxpayer is also granted remission of **penalties** that accrued from **April 18, 1991**, to the date the insured deposit became available.
   - These penalties apply for **failure to remit required amounts** under:
     - The **Income Tax Act**,
     - **Part I of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**, and
     - **Part III of the Unemployment Insurance Act (UIA)**.

> *Note:* The remission applies only to penalties related to failure to remit these specific amounts due to the taxpayer's inability to access their deposits.

#### **Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **only granted under specific conditions**:

1. **Deposit Limitation**  
   - The remission applies **only to taxpayers whose total deposits with the trust company (before insurance) do not exceed $60,000**.
   - This cap ensures that the relief is targeted at individuals who were most directly affected by the loss of access to their deposits, and not extended to large investors or institutions.

2. **Condition of Future Compliance**  
   - The taxpayer must **remit the required amounts** (under the Income Tax Act, CPP Part I, and UI Part III) **when the insured deposit becomes available**.
   - This condition ensures that while the taxpayer is granted relief from past tax and penalty liabilities, they are still required to fulfill their ongoing obligations to the government when funds are eventually accessible.

### **Scope and Public Interest Justification**

- The Order addresses a **historical financial hardship** experienced by individuals who relied on Standard Trust Company deposits for their income.
- From April 18, 1991, many depositors were unable to access their funds due to the financial instability of the trust company.
- This lack of access **directly impacted their ability to pay income taxes and other statutory contributions**, leading to **unjust tax and penalty liabilities**.
- The government recognizes that these obligations were not the result of taxpayer misconduct but rather of systemic financial failure.
- Therefore, remission is justified as being **in the public interest**, promoting financial stability, fairness, and trust in the financial system.

### **Citation and Legal Authority**

- The Order may be cited as the **Standard Trust Depositors Remission Order**.
- It is issued under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows for the remission of taxes or penalties when it is in the public interest — particularly in cases of hardship or systemic failure.

### **Key Impacts and Implications**

| Aspect | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Taxpayers Affected** | Individuals with deposits ≤ $60,000 at Standard Trust or Standard Loan Company, who were unable to access funds from April 18, 1991. |
| **Relief Provided** | Forgiveness of income tax (equal to accrued interest) and penalties (for CPP and UI failures) from April 18, 1991, to the date of deposit availability. |
| **Obligations Retained** | Taxpayers must still remit required contributions (tax, CPP, UI) when deposits become accessible. |
| **Exclusion** | Does not apply to deposits exceeding $60,000 or to other financial institutions. |
| **Historical Context** | Reflects a targeted policy response to a specific financial crisis of 1991, aimed at restoring public confidence. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Standard Trust Depositors Remission Order* is a targeted, historically grounded measure designed to **correct financial injustice** experienced by individual depositors during a period of institutional failure. By remitting income tax and penalties tied to the inability to access insured deposits, the government acknowledges the hardship faced by those who relied on Standard Trust Company deposits for income. However, it does so with a **conditional requirement** to ensure ongoing compliance with tax and social insurance obligations when funds are eventually available.

This Order serves both a **pragmatic and moral function**: it provides relief without undermining the integrity of the tax and social insurance systems, and it reinforces public trust in financial institutions and government accountability.

**Final Note**: This Order is a one-time, historical intervention and does not establish a general policy for future tax remissions. It remains specific to Standard Trust Company depositors and the timeframe beginning April 18, 1991.
