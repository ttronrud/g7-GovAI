### **3. Key Provisions**

#### **(a) Content of the Prospectus**
- A prospectus must contain **all information required by any applicable legislation** listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- These listed laws typically include provincial securities acts (e.g., Ontario Securities Act, British Columbia Securities Act, etc.) and other relevant financial regulation statutes.
- The content must be **comprehensive and accurate**, covering material facts about the company, the nature of the securities being offered, risks involved, financial condition, management, and use of proceeds.

#### **(b) Procedure for Disclosure**

  - Notification to regulators
  - Public availability of the prospectus
- The procedure ensures consistency and accountability in how information is made available to potential investors.

#### **(c) Form of Disclosure**

- This includes formatting standards (e.g., required sections, headings, disclosures, financial statements, risk factors) to ensure clarity and uniformity across different offerings.

#### **(d) Compliance with Applicable Legislation**
- Any prospectus filed under the authority of a law listed in Column 2 of the Schedule must **fully comply with the requirements of that specific legislation**.

### **5. Coming into Force**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette or official government register).
- This ensures immediate applicability once formally adopted, allowing trust and loan companies to begin complying with the new requirements promptly.

### **6. Key Implications and Practical Effects**

- **Investor Protection**: By mandating clear, complete, and timely disclosure, the regulations enhance investor confidence and reduce the risk of misrepresentation or material omissions.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: The rules ensure that trust and loan companies adhere to consistent disclosure standards across provinces, particularly where provincial securities laws govern offerings.
- **Flexibility through Exemptions**: The exemption clause allows for tailored treatment of small issuers, private placements, or other exempt transactions, without requiring full prospectus filings.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prospectus (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* establish a clear, enforceable, and legally grounded framework for the disclosure of information in securities distributions by trust and loan companies. By aligning with provincial securities legislation and preserving exemptions where appropriate, the regulations balance investor protection with operational flexibility.
