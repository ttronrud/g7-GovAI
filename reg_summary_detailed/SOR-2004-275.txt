**Detailed Summary of the Firearms Marking Regulations (S.C. 2003, c. 8, s. 54)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Firearms Marking Regulations*, made under **section 117b of the Firearms Act** and published in *Statutes of Canada, 2003, c. 8, s. 54*, establish a comprehensive framework for the marking of firearms in Canada. These regulations ensure that firearms are permanently and visibly marked to facilitate traceability, accountability, and regulatory compliance. The regulations were laid before Parliament on June 13, 2003—well in advance of the Order-in-Council (at least 30 sitting days)—as required by **section 118** of the Firearms Act, and are not required to be re-laid under **subsection 119(1)**, even if amended.

The regulations come into force on **December 1, 2025**.

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### **1. Definitions**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Firearms Act*.
- **"Specially imported firearm"**: A firearm imported temporarily by a business holding a firearms licence, classified as a "good" under **tariff item 9993.00.00** in the *List of Tariff Provisions* (Schedule to the Customs Tariff).

#### **2. Marking Requirements**

##### **A. Manufactured Firearms (Section 4 Compliance)**  
Every individual or business that **manufactures a firearm** must ensure that the firearm is **marked at the time of manufacture** with:

- The word **"Canada"** or the letters **"CA"**,  
- **In the case of a manufactured firearm**:  
  - The **name of the manufacturer**, and  
  - The **firearm’s serial number**.

> This marking must be **permanently stamped or engraved** on the **frame or receiver** of the firearm.

##### **B. Imported Firearms**  
Every individual, business, or public service agency that **imports a firearm** must ensure that the firearm is marked **before**:

- The **60th day after its release** under **subsection 2(1) of the Customs Act**, **or**  
- The date of **transfer** (whichever occurs first).

> This marking requirement applies **only to firearms that are not exempted** under subsection (1).

---

#### **3. Exemptions from Marking Requirements**

The marking requirement in subsection (1) **does not apply** to the following:

1. **Firearms imported by an individual** under **section 35 or 35.1 of the Firearms Act** (e.g., personal imports for use or collection).
2. **Specially imported firearms** (temporarily imported for business purposes under tariff item 9993.00.00).
3. **Protected firearms** (designated as such under the Act, often for specific security or law enforcement purposes).
4. **Firearms initially exported from Canada**:
   - If the **original owner retained ownership** while the firearm was outside Canada.
5. **Firearms initially exported from Canada**:
   - If the firearm was retained by a **public service agency** as an **agency firearm** while outside Canada.

> These exemptions recognize practical and legal circumstances where marking would be impractical, inconsistent with international trade, or contrary to the original ownership or use of the firearm.

---

#### **4. Marking Specifications**

All markings must meet the following **technical standards**:

- **Legibility**: The markings must be clearly readable.
- **Depth**: At least **0.076 mm**.
- **Height**: At least **1.58 mm**.
- **Visibility**:  
  - In most cases, the markings must be **visible without disassembling** the firearm.  
  - This requirement is subject to **subsection (3)** (exemptions for specific cases).

> This ensures that the markings are durable, detectable, and useful for law enforcement or traceability purposes.

---

#### **5. Exemptions for Imported Firearms (Subsection 3)**

The **Registrar** may grant an exemption from the requirement that markings be visible without disassembly **if** the following conditions are met:

- Marking the firearm in a place only visible upon disassembly is **consistent with the current manufacturing practices** of the firearm’s manufacturer.
- The firearm **does not have a visible space** suitable for stamping or engraving.
- The firearm is **rare**.
- The firearm has an **unusually high value** for its type, and visible markings would **significantly reduce its market value**.
- The firearm is imported by a **business with a firearms licence** for use in:
  - Motion pictures, television, video, or theatrical productions, or
  - Publishing activities.

> This provision balances regulatory requirements with practical and economic considerations, especially for collectors, film producers, or rare antique firearms.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Alteration of Markings**

- **No person shall knowingly remove, alter, obliterate, or deface** a marking on a firearm.
- This includes any attempt to erase or cover the "Canada" or "CA" marking, or the manufacturer’s name and serial number.
- Violations of this provision may constitute a criminal offense under the *Criminal Code*.

> This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the firearm’s record and prevents tampering for illegal purposes.

---

#### **7. Public Agents and Agency Firearms**

- The marking requirement **does not apply** to a **public agent** acting in the course of their duties or for the purposes of their employment.
- This recognizes that certain law enforcement or government personnel may use firearms in official capacity, and the marking requirement is not intended to interfere with their operational needs.

---

#### **8. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on December 1, 2025**.

> This provides a clear timeline for compliance, allowing stakeholders to prepare and adjust their practices accordingly.

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Traceability and Accountability**: To ensure that every firearm manufactured or imported in Canada can be traced back to its origin (manufacturer or importer), supporting investigations and public safety.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: To enforce a consistent, standardized marking system across all firearms, aligning with international best practices.
3. **Balancing Practicality and Security**: To allow reasonable exemptions for rare, valuable, or specialized firearms (e.g., for film or heritage) without compromising overall regulatory integrity.
4. **Prevention of Illicit Use**: By making markings permanent and visible, the regulations help prevent the use of untraceable or illegally altered firearms in criminal activities.
