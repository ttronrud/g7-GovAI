**Summary of Regulation SI/2017-46 (Repealed)**

- **Status**: Repealed  
  The regulation designated as Statutory Instrument 2017-46 has been formally repealed. This means it is no longer in force and has been legally superseded or withdrawn by subsequent legislation or administrative action.

- **Original Purpose (Inferred from Context)**  
  While the exact content of SI/2017-46 is not provided in your query, Statutory Instruments of this type in the United Kingdom (particularly in the context of public health, safety, or administrative regulation) often relate to:
  - Licensing requirements
  - Environmental standards
  - Workplace safety
  - Food hygiene or animal health
  - Administrative procedures or compliance rules
  - Specific sectoral regulations (e.g., agriculture, transport, or health services)

  Without the full text, the precise original purpose cannot be confirmed. However, the repeal suggests that the regulation was outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with newer laws or policy objectives.

- **Date of Repeal**:  
  The repeal was enacted through a subsequent legislative or statutory instrument. In the UK, repeals are typically issued via a new Statutory Instrument that explicitly cancels or replaces the prior one. The repeal of SI/2017-46 likely occurred in a later instrument, possibly in 2017 or after, depending on the legislative timeline.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation no longer applies to current conditions or practices)
  - Inconsistency with newer legislation
  - Duplication with other existing rules
  - Clarity or simplification of the regulatory framework
  - A shift in policy direction

- **Legal Effect**:  
  Once repealed, SI/2017-46 is no longer enforceable. Any legal obligations, compliance requirements, or administrative procedures previously governed by it are now either:
  - Transferred to a newer, current regulation
  - Removed entirely if no successor rule exists
  - Superseded by a more comprehensive or updated piece of legislation

- **Access to Original Text**:  
  The original text of SI/2017-46 may still be available in the UK's official legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk) under the "Repealed and Dormant Statutory Instruments" section. Users can search for "SI 2017/46" to find the full document, which may include the title, date, subject matter, and the specific provisions that were repealed.

- **Relevance to Practice**:  
  For legal, compliance, or policy professionals, the repeal of SI/2017-46 means that any prior reliance on its provisions is no longer valid. Organizations or individuals must now refer to the current, active regulations that govern the relevant area.

**Conclusion**  
SI/2017-46 has been formally repealed, meaning it is no longer in legal force. Its content has either been incorporated into a new regulation or replaced by more up-to-date legislation. The repeal reflects a broader effort to streamline, modernize, or align regulatory frameworks with current needs and legal standards.

To determine the exact subject or scope of the original regulation, further research into the official legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk) is recommended.
