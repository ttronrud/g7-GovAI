## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Protocol to the Convention on Social Security between Canada and Spain (1995)**

### 🔍 **Overview**
This document is a **supplementary agreement (Protocol)** to the original **Convention on Social Security between Canada and Spain**, signed in Madrid on **November 10, 1986**. The Protocol was negotiated to strengthen cooperation between Canada and Spain in the field of social security, particularly by addressing specific provisions related to **non-contributory benefits**, **workplace coverage for seafarers**, **benefit calculations**, and **the treatment of insured periods** under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Spanish social security legislation.

The Protocol entered into force on **May 1, 1997**, following mutual notification of compliance with statutory requirements by both countries.

## 📚 Key Provisions and Interpretations

---

### 1. **Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Convention"** refers to the original **Convention on Social Security between Canada and Spain (1986)**.
- All other terms are defined in accordance with the original Convention unless otherwise specified in this Protocol.

> *Purpose:* Ensures clarity and consistency in interpreting the rights and obligations of both parties.

### 2. **Extension of Spanish Non-Contributory Benefits to Canadian Citizens**

#### 📌 Provision:
> Spanish non-contributory social security benefits established under **Law 26/90 of December 20, 1990** shall be granted to **Canadian citizens** under the **same conditions and subject to the same requirements** as those set out for Spanish citizens.

#### ✅ Implications:
- Canadian citizens who meet the eligibility criteria for certain **non-contributory benefits** (e.g., disability, old-age, or survivor benefits) under Spanish law may now access these benefits **in the same way** as Spanish nationals.
- This reflects a mutual recognition of social security rights across borders, enhancing protection for Canadians living in or working in Spain, or with family ties there.

#### ⚠️ Exclusion Clause:
> **Article 5 and Article 9, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Convention shall not apply** to these non-contributory benefits.

- This means that certain rules in the original Convention (such as restrictions on benefit entitlement based on contribution history or residency) do **not apply** to these specific non-contributory benefits.
- It simplifies access and removes barriers that might otherwise prevent Canadian citizens from receiving these benefits.

### 3. **Amendment to Article 6, Paragraph 2 – Seafarer Coverage**

#### 📌 Original Provision:
> A seafarer working in both Canada and Spain would be subject to both Canadian and Spanish legislation.

#### 📌 Revised Provision:
> The word **“twenty-four”** is replaced by **“sixty”** in Article 6, paragraph 2.

> **New Rule:**
> A seafarer who would otherwise be subject to both Canadian and Spanish laws:
> - Is subject **only to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** if they **reside and are hired in Canada**.
> - Is subject **only to Spanish legislation** if they **reside and are hired in Spain**.
> - If neither condition applies, the seafarer is subject **only to Spanish legislation** if the ship flies the Spanish flag.

#### ✅ Key Changes:
- **Clearer jurisdictional rules** based on **residence and employment location**.
- Removes ambiguity about dual liability.
- Protects seafarers from being subject to overlapping obligations under both systems.
- Ensures that **flag state** (i.e., country whose flag the vessel flies) determines jurisdiction.

> *Example:* A Canadian citizen working on a Spanish-flagged ship hired in Spain is covered only by Spanish social security law.

### 4. **Amendment to Article 12 – Benefit Calculation for CPP Totalizing Provisions**

#### 📌 Original Rule:
> Totalizing provisions (where contributions from multiple countries combine to meet a minimum period) were used to calculate CPP benefits.

#### 📌 Revised Rule:
> When a person is entitled to a CPP benefit **solely through totalizing provisions**, the benefit is calculated as follows:

1. **Earnings-related portion**:
   - Determined **exclusively** using **pensionable earnings under the CPP**.
   - No cross-border earnings are included.

2. **Flat-rate portion**:
   - Calculated by multiplying:
     - The flat-rate amount determined under CPP
     - By the **fraction** of the person’s **actual CPP contribution period** relative to the **minimum qualifying period** required for entitlement.
   - This fraction **cannot exceed 1 (i.e., 100%)**.

#### ✅ Implications:
- Prevents overpayment or inflated benefits due to double counting.
- Ensures that the **flat-rate portion** is **proportional** to actual contributions.
- Maintains fairness and transparency in benefit calculations for individuals with partial or overlapping coverage.

> *Example:* A person with 15 years of CPP contributions (out of a required 35) would receive a flat-rate benefit reduced to 15/35 = ~42.9% of the full flat-rate amount.

### 5. **Amendment to Article 13, Subparagraph 1(c) – Contribution Base for Spanish Benefits**

#### 📌 Original Rule:
> Spanish institutions used contribution bases from the country where the individual was insured.

#### 📌 Revised Rule:
> When part of the required insured period under Spanish law corresponds to time spent under **Canadian legislation**:
> - The Spanish competent institution shall use the **actual contribution bases paid by the individual in Spain** during the years immediately before the last Spanish contribution was due.
> - The resulting benefit amount will be **adjusted annually** to reflect increases and reassessments in the same benefit category until the contingency (e.g., retirement, disability) occurs.

#### ✅ Implications:
- Allows Spanish authorities to **accurately assess** the value of contributions made in Canada.
- Ensures **benefits are adjusted for inflation** over time (via annual reassessments).
- Provides **greater equity** for individuals who worked in Canada but are claiming benefits in Spain.

> *Example:* A Canadian citizen who worked in Canada and then moved to Spain may have their benefit recalculated using their pre-Canada contribution history, adjusted for inflation each year.

### 6. **Amendment to Article 13, Subparagraph 1(d) and Paragraph 2 – Conditions for Benefit Award**

#### 📌 New Rule:
> If Spanish law requires that a person be **insured at the time of the contingency** (e.g., retirement, disability), this condition is deemed met if:
> - The person is **insured under Canadian legislation**, OR
> - The person is **receiving a benefit under Canadian legislation** (same or different kind).

> This applies **to survivors’ pensions** as well:
> - If the deceased was **validly insured (situación de alta)** or **receiving a benefit under Canadian law**, the condition is satisfied.

> Additionally:
> - If Spanish law requires insured periods completed in a specific time before the contingency, the condition is met if the person completed those periods **before receiving a Canadian benefit**, even if not credited.

> ⚠️ Important: Insured periods are **not credited** in this scenario.

#### ✅ Implications:
- Expands eligibility for Canadians to qualify for **Spanish benefits** even if they were not formally insured in Spain.
- Provides **greater access** to benefits for individuals who were temporarily or partially covered under Canadian law.
- Applies to **survivors’ pensions**, protecting dependents of Canadian citizens who died while covered by Canadian social security.

> *Example:* A Canadian citizen who retired in Spain and had a disability claim may qualify for a benefit even if they were not formally insured in Spain, because they were receiving a Canadian benefit at the time.

### 7. **Review and Recalculation of Existing Benefits**

#### 📌 Provision:
> At the time of the Protocol’s entry into force (May 1, 1997), **benefits previously awarded or requested under the original Convention** may be **reviewed or recalculated** on request by the beneficiary.

> The **new amount** of the benefit will start being paid from the **first day of the month following the month in which the request is made**.

> ❌ **No reduction allowed**:
> - A beneficiary **shall not receive a benefit that is less than** what they were receiving before the recalculation.

#### ✅ Implications:
- Ensures **benefit stability** and **fairness** during transition.
- Gives individuals a **right to a fair adjustment** without financial loss.
- Provides a **clear and safe mechanism** for updating benefits based on updated rules.

> *Example:* A Canadian citizen receiving a disability benefit under the old Convention may request a recalculation under the new Protocol and receive a higher or unchanged amount — but never a lower one.

---

### 8. **Duration and Termination of the Protocol**

#### 📌 Provisions:
> - The Protocol shall remain in force **without limitation** (i.e., it is perpetual).
> - In the event of **denunciation of the original Convention** under **Article 25, paragraph 2**, the Protocol shall also be **denounced on the same date**.
