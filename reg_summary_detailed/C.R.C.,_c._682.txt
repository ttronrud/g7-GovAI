**Detailed Summary of the Civilian Dental Treatment Regulations**

---

**1. Regulation Title and Citation**  
These regulations are officially titled the *Civilian Dental Treatment Regulations* and may be cited as such. They establish the framework under which members of the Canadian Forces Dental Services (CFDS) may provide dental care to civilians under specific conditions.

---

**2. Definition of "Isolated Area"**  
An *isolated area* is defined as:  
- A geographic area where a military unit has been officially designated as an *isolated unit* by the **Minister of National Defence**;  
- This includes not only the physical location of the unit but also any surrounding area that the **commanding officer** of that unit may determine is part of the isolated zone.  

This definition is critical because it identifies the geographic scope within which civilian dental treatment may be provided under the regulations.

---

**3. Authorized Scope of Dental Treatment for Civilians**  
Dental officers from the Canadian Forces Dental Services may provide dental treatment to civilians under the following circumstances:

- **In emergencies**, where the purpose is to relieve pain or repair broken dentures, and **civilian dental facilities are unavailable**;  
- **In isolated areas** where **no civilian dental facilities exist**; or  
- **At the request of a provincial dental licensing body**, if that body determines that supplemental civilian dental services are necessary.

> **Important Exception**: The provision of such treatment is **only permitted if it does not interfere with the dental care of Canadian Forces members**. This ensures that military personnel’s dental needs are prioritized.

---

**4. Ministerial Authority to Prescribe Procedures**  
The **Minister of National Defence** has the authority to:  
- Prescribe the **procedures** to be followed in arranging and delivering dental treatment;  
- Specify the **form** (e.g., application form, consent form) that must be used for documentation and payment purposes.  

This ensures consistency, accountability, and administrative clarity in how treatment is coordinated across different units and locations.

---

**5. Fee Structure for Dental Treatment (Effective After June 30, 1972)**  
Fees charged to civilians for dental treatment provided under these regulations are determined based on the **provincial dental association fee schedule**, with specific adjustments for certain territories and provinces:

| Location of Treatment | Applicable Provincial Fee Schedule |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Any province **except** Yukon Territory or Northwest Territories | Schedule of fees from the **provincial dental association** in that province |
| Yukon Territory         | Schedule of fees from the **Province of British Columbia** |
| Northwest Territories   | Schedule of fees from the **Province of Alberta** |
| Outside Canada          | Schedule of fees from the **Province of Ontario** |

> This structure ensures that fees are aligned with local dental service standards and pricing norms, promoting fairness and consistency.

**6. Fee Determination When Provincial Schedules Are Incomplete or Flexible**  
In cases where the applicable provincial fee schedule:  
- Does **not specify a fee** for a particular treatment;  
- Does **not set a fixed fee**; or  
- **Allows discretionary increases or decreases** in fees (i.e., fees are variable),  

Then the **Minister of National Defence** may intervene. Specifically:  
- The Minister may **determine a fee** based on:  
  - A **recommendation from the commanding officer** of the dental unit providing the treatment;  
  - **Prevailing market rates** for that type of treatment in the location where the service is provided.  

This ensures that treatment remains accessible and fair, even when standard fee schedules are not fully defined.

---

**7. Financial Accountability**  
All fees collected under these regulations must be:  
- **Deposited into the credit of the Receiver General** of Canada.  

This ensures that all revenue generated from civilian dental services provided by the Canadian Forces is properly accounted for and managed at the federal level, in accordance with public finance principles.

---

**Key Principles and Objectives of the Regulations**  

- **Public Health and Emergency Response**: Enables access to essential dental care in remote or emergency situations where civilian services are absent.  
- **Military Responsiveness**: Allows military dental services to serve civilians without compromising the care of military personnel.  
- **Equity and Fairness**: Aligns fees with provincial standards to ensure affordability and consistency.  
- **Accountability and Oversight**: Establishes clear procedures and financial reporting to prevent misuse or overcharging.  
- **Flexibility**: Provides a mechanism for fee setting when standard schedules are inadequate or variable.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Civilian Dental Treatment Regulations* create a structured, equitable, and accountable framework allowing Canadian Forces dental officers to provide emergency or supplemental dental care to civilians in specific, well-defined circumstances. The regulations balance the operational needs of the military with the public interest in accessible dental care, particularly in isolated or underserved areas. They also ensure that fees are fair, transparent, and properly managed through federal oversight.
