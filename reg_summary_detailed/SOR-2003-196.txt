**Detailed Summary of the Natural Health Products Regulations (S.C. 1999, c. 33, s. 347)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Natural Health Products Regulations* (NHPR) were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, under **subsection 30(1)a of the Food and Drugs Act (FDA)**. These regulations establish a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the **manufacture, sale, importation, distribution, labelling, and safety** of natural health products (NHPs) in Canada.

The regulations define what constitutes a natural health product, set out requirements for product licensing, and establish standards for safety, efficacy, labelling, and consumer protection—while explicitly **excluding** certain substances (such as those in Schedule 2) from this regime.

## **Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Food and Drugs Act*, the primary legislation under which these regulations operate. |
| **Natural Health Product (NHP)** | A substance or combination of substances listed in **Schedule 1** (e.g., vitamins, herbs, botanicals), or a homeopathic or traditional medicine, used for diagnosing, treating, preventing diseases, restoring organic functions, or modifying bodily functions in humans. **Excludes** substances in Schedule 2 (e.g., prescription drugs) or any combination containing such substances. |
| **Manufacturer** | A person who fabricates or processes an NHP for sale. Excludes pharmacists who compound products for individual patients. |
| **Distributor** | A person who sells an NHP to another party for resale. |
| **Importer** | A person who brings an NHP into Canada for sale. |
| **Expiry Date** | The earlier of: (1) the end of the stability period as determined under section 52; or (2) the date after which the manufacturer recommends the product should not be used. |
| **Food Allergen** | Includes proteins from: almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios, walnuts; peanuts; sesame seeds; wheat/triticale; eggs; milk; soybeans; crustaceans; molluscs; fish; mustard seeds. |
| **Gluten** | Any gluten protein derived from barley, oats, rye, triticale, or wheat, or from hybridized strains of these. Includes modified forms or fractions. |
| **Added Sulphites** | Food additives listed in Table 2, column 1 of the *Common Names for Ingredients and Components Document*, present in NHPs due to addition during manufacturing. |
| **Food Allergen Source, Gluten Source, and Added Sulphites Statement** | A mandatory label statement indicating presence of allergens, gluten, or added sulphites at ≥10 ppm. |
| **Immediate Container** | The container directly in contact with the NHP (e.g., bottle, capsule). |
| **Inner Label** | Label affixed to the immediate container. |
| **Outer Label** | Label on the outer packaging (not on the immediate container). |
| **Principal Display Panel (PDP)** | As defined in the *Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations*—the area on the label where the product name and key information are prominently displayed. |
| **Probiotic** | A live microorganism (monoculture or mixed-culture) that benefits the human microbiota. |
| **Proper Name** | - For vitamins: name in Schedule 1 item 3.<br>- For plants/algae/bacteria/fungi/non-human animal materials/probiotics: Latin nomenclature (genus and species).<br>- For others: chemical name. |
| **Recommended Conditions of Use** | Includes: use/purpose, dosage form, route of administration, dose, duration, and risk information (cautions, warnings, contra-indications, adverse reactions). |
| **Security Package** | Packaging with a feature (e.g., tamper-evident seal) that reasonably assures the product has not been opened prior to purchase. |
| **Adverse Reaction** | Any noxious and unintended response to an NHP, occurring at any dose, during diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or modification of function. |
| **Serious Adverse Reaction** | An adverse reaction that requires hospitalization, causes congenital malformation, results in persistent disability, is life-threatening, or leads to death. |
| **Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction** | A serious adverse reaction not previously identified in the product’s risk information. |
| **Specifications** | A detailed description of the NHP that includes analytical, physical, and identity tests required for quality control. |

> *Note:* Words and expressions incorporated by reference from the *Food and Drug Regulations* (FDR) take on the meanings assigned here unless otherwise defined.

## **Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- The **sale** of NHPs
- The **manufacture, packaging, labelling, and importation** of NHPs for sale
- The **distribution** of NHPs
- The **storage** of NHPs for any of the above purposes

> **Important Exclusion**: A substance or combination is *not* considered a natural health product if its sale requires a prescription under the FDR (e.g., prescription drugs), unless it falls under section C.01.043 of the FDR—which allows for certain non-prescription sales.

> **Key Principle**: Except where otherwise indicated, **the Food and Drug Regulations do not apply** to natural health products. This means NHPs are regulated under a distinct, less stringent framework than prescription drugs.

       - If not imported: confirms compliance with Part 3 requirements

2. **Timeframe for Review**
