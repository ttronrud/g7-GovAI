## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Military Airworthiness Investigation Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Enactment Basis**:  
  These regulations were promulgated under **subsection 24.5(2)a of the Aeronautics Act**, following a public notice published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **April 14, 2018**.  
  The notice provided a reasonable opportunity for interested parties (e.g., aviation stakeholders, industry, public) to submit written representations to the Minister of National Defence.

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The regulations are made pursuant to:
  - **Subsection 24.2(1)a and (3)a** – Authority to regulate airworthiness and safety investigations.
  - **Subsection 24.5(1)a** – Power to make regulations concerning military-civilian occurrences.

- **Reference to Statutes**:  
  - *S.C. 2014, c. 29, s. 19*  
  - *R.S., c. A-2* (Aeronautics Act)

> This establishes that the regulations are grounded in the broader legislative framework governing aviation safety in Canada, with specific focus on **military-civilian interface** and **airworthiness investigations**.

---

### **9. Preservation of Evidence**

- Every person who has **possession or control of evidence** related to a military-civilian occurrence must **preserve that evidence** until the Authority determines it is no longer required.
