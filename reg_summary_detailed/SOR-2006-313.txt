**Detailed Summary of the Insider Reports (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *Insider Reports (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **section 273a of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (TLC Act)**. This regulatory instrument provides a legal framework for the requirement that certain individuals—referred to as "insiders"—submit insider reports to ensure transparency and prevent insider trading in trust and loan companies.

The regulations are rooted in the broader legislative framework governing financial institutions in Canada, specifically those involved in trust and loan services. The authority to issue these regulations stems from the power granted under **section 273a** of the TLC Act, which enables the government to prescribe rules regarding insider reporting.

### **Legal Basis and Reference**

- **Primary Legislation**: *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (TLC Act)  
- **Applicable Section**: Section 273a of the TLC Act  
- **Citation**: S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 421 (amending the Act); S.C. 1991, c. 45 (original enactment)

These regulations are not standalone; they interpret and implement the insider reporting obligations found in the TLC Act by aligning them with the requirements of other applicable legislation.

### **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

#### 1. **Definition of "Insider" (Section 273(a) of the Act)**
- An "insider" for the purposes of these regulations is defined **in accordance with the definition provided in any applicable legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- This means that the specific criteria for who qualifies as an insider (e.g., officers, directors, major shareholders, or persons with access to material non-public information) are not defined directly in these regulations, but instead **are drawn from other relevant financial or securities laws** (such as the *Canadian Securities Act*, *Security Commission Act*, or provincial securities regulations).
- For example, if a person is considered an insider under the *Ontario Securities Act*, that definition applies here as well.

#### 2. **Form and Content of Insider Reports (Section 273(b))**
- The **form, structure, and content** of an insider report required under the TLC Act must mirror the requirements established under **any applicable legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- This ensures consistency across different regulatory regimes. For instance, if the *National Instrument 52-112 (Insider Trading)* sets out specific reporting formats, then those formats are adopted in these regulations.
- This provision ensures that insider reports are standardized, clear, and comparable across jurisdictions and regulatory bodies.

#### 3. **Procedure for Submission and Publication (Section 273(c))**
- The **process for submitting and publishing** insider reports (including timelines, deadlines, methods of submission, and public disclosure requirements) must follow the procedures established under the relevant legislation in Column 2 of the Schedule.
- This includes:
  - Deadlines for submission
  - Methods of reporting (e.g., electronic filing)
  - Who is responsible for ensuring timely reporting
  - Whether and how reports are made publicly available
- This ensures compliance with established administrative and transparency standards across financial regulatory frameworks.

### **Compliance Obligations**

- Any individual or entity **required to submit an insider report under any of the listed legislation** (in Column 2 of the Schedule) must comply with **the full requirements of that legislation**.
- This includes:
  - Identifying themselves as an insider
  - Disclosing relevant transactions or activities
  - Reporting material non-public information
  - Providing supporting documentation

> **Note**: These requirements apply directly and are not reduced or modified by the regulations themselves.

### **Exemptions**

Two types of exemptions are recognized under these regulations:

#### 1. **Exemption from Insider Status**
- A person who is **exempt from being considered an insider** under any applicable legislation (e.g., under a provision in the *Canadian Securities Act* or a provincial securities regulator's order) is **not considered an insider** for the purposes of **subsection 2(1)** of the TLC Act.
- This means that if a person is legally excluded from the definition of "insider" under another law (e.g., due to lack of access to information or a specific exemption clause), they do not trigger reporting obligations under these regulations.

#### 2. **Exemption from Reporting Requirements**
- A person who is **exempt from any or all insider reporting obligations** under:
  - Any legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule, **or**
  - An order issued by a relevant **provincial securities regulator**
- Is **automatically exempt** from those same reporting obligations under these regulations.

> This provision provides flexibility and recognizes that certain individuals or entities may have legitimate reasons (e.g., small shareholders, non-executive staff, or those operating under special regulatory arrangements) to be exempt from reporting duties.

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- This means that once officially published and registered, the rules become enforceable immediately, without a specified implementation date.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The purpose of these regulations is to:

1. **Ensure consistency** in insider reporting standards across different financial regulatory regimes.
2. **Promote transparency** and accountability within trust and loan companies by requiring insiders to disclose material information.
3. **Prevent insider trading** and market manipulation by establishing clear reporting obligations.
4. **Harmonize reporting practices** with national and provincial securities laws, reducing regulatory fragmentation.

By aligning the insider reporting requirements of the Trust and Loan Companies Act with those of other relevant legislation, the regulations enhance regulatory coherence and reduce compliance burdens for financial institutions.

### **Conclusion**

The *Insider Reports (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* serve as a critical enforcement mechanism under the TLC Act. They establish a clear, legally binding framework for defining insiders, specifying the form and content of reports, and outlining procedures for submission and publication—all aligned with existing securities laws. The inclusion of exemption provisions ensures that legitimate exceptions are respected, while the immediate enforcement upon registration underscores the importance of timely compliance.

These regulations are essential for maintaining investor confidence, ensuring fair markets, and upholding the integrity of financial institutions in Canada.
