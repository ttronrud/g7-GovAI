### 🔹 **3. Scope of Application**
- Applies to **all land and underwater areas** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Comox Airport.
- The outer limits of the regulated area are precisely defined in **Parts II and III of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**:  
  Land that is **formally part of the airport** (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated operational zones) is **not subject** to these regulations.

> ✅ This means the rules apply to surrounding private, public, and undeveloped lands — including road allowances — as long as they fall within the defined boundary.

---

### 🔹 **4. Elevation Restrictions (Core Prohibition)**

#### ❌ **Prohibited Actions**:
No person may:
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**;
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object;

…on any land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of the object exceeds** the elevation of any of the following **imaginary surfaces** at the point of location:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> 🔍 These surfaces are designed to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

#### 🌲 **Exception for Natural Growth**:
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister of National Defence** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This ensures that trees or other natural features do not create hazards to aircraft.

#### 🚫 **Prohibition on Waste Accumulation**:
- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use land for **disposal or accumulation** of:
    - Waste
    - Materials
    - Substances **edible or attractive to birds**

> 🛑 This is critical to prevent bird strikes — a major aviation hazard — by eliminating food sources or waste that attract birds to the airport vicinity.

### 🔹 **5. Geographical Boundary of the Regulated Area**

The regulated zone is defined by a **complex, detailed boundary** involving curves, bearings, distances, and references to runways and land parcels. The boundary is described in **geometric and topographic terms** using:

- Bearings (e.g., 318°30′53″)
- Distances (e.g., 4,000 metres)
- Runway centerlines (e.g., Runway 11–29, Runway 18–36)
- Specific lots and plans (e.g., Lot B, Plan 6884; Lot 1, Plan 410)

#### 📍 Key Reference Points:
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  Located **348.121 metres southwesterly** and at right angles from a point on the runway 11–29 centerline, measured **612.078 metres southeasterly** from the intersection of runway 11–29 and 18–36 centerlines.

> This point serves as the origin for elevation and spatial calculations.

#### 📐 Key Features of the Boundary:
- Begins at the **high water mark of the Strait of Georgia**.
- Follows a series of **curved arcs** (with consistent radius of **4,000 metres**) to maintain safe buffer zones.
- Includes **parallel lines** at 4,000 metres from various runway centerline extensions.
- Traverses through numerous **land parcels and roads** (e.g., Yates Road, Holmes Street, Balmoral Avenue, Richardson Avenue, McLeod Street).
- Ends at the **high water mark of the Strait of Georgia**, completing a closed loop.

> The boundary is designed to:
> - Protect aircraft from ground-level obstructions;
> - Maintain visual and physical clearance during all phases of flight;
> - Account for terrain and coastal features.

### 🔹 **6. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure Aviation Safety**:
   - Prevent structural or natural obstructions from interfering with aircraft approaches, takeoffs, and landings.
   - Maintain safe **horizontal and vertical clearance** around the airport.

2. **Mitigate Bird Hazards**:
   - Eliminate food sources or waste that attract birds to the airport area — a known cause of bird strikes.

3. **Preserve Operational Integrity**:
   - Protect the airport’s airspace and ground operations by enforcing strict zoning and elevation controls.

4. **Provide Legal Clarity**:
   - Define precise boundaries and elevation limits so that landowners, developers, and regulators understand what is permitted or prohibited.

---

### 🔹 **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of National Defence** has the authority to:
  - Issue **directions** requiring removal of excessive natural growth;
  - Enforce compliance through legal means if necessary.

- Violations may result in:
  - Fines
  - Orders to demolish or remove structures
  - Legal action against landowners or developers

> The regulations are enforceable under the **Aeronautics Act**, giving the Minister significant authority to protect aviation safety.

---

### 🔹 **8. Important Notes & Interpretations**

- The **elevation limits** are not fixed in physical form — they are **imaginary planes** used for regulatory purposes.
- The **18.3-metre reference point** is critical for calculating vertical clearance and is used as a baseline for all elevation comparisons.
- The **complex boundary** reflects the airport’s location near the Strait of Georgia, requiring careful consideration of coastal topography and maritime access.
- The regulation applies to **both land and water**, including public road allowances — meaning even roads adjacent to the airport are subject to restrictions.

## ✅ Summary in One Paragraph

The **Comox Airport Zoning Regulations** establish strict limits on construction, vegetation, and waste disposal within a precisely defined boundary surrounding Comox Airport. These rules, enacted under the Aeronautics Act and approved by the Minister of National Defence, prohibit any structure or object from exceeding the elevation of three imaginary surfaces: the **approach surface**, **outer surface**, and **transitional surface**. Natural growth exceeding these limits may be removed by order of the Minister. The regulated area is bounded by a complex, geometrically precise perimeter based on runway centerlines and land parcels, extending from the Strait of Georgia. The primary objective is to ensure aviation safety by preventing obstructions and bird hazards, with enforcement authority vested in the Minister of National Defence.
