**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Black Redhorse (Moxostoma duquesnei) Order*

**Issuing Authority:**  
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)

**Date of Issuance:**  
November 4, 2022

**Legal Basis:**  
The Order is made under **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29, as amended.

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The Black Redhorse (*Moxostoma duquesnei*) is a fish species officially listed as **threatened** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species is at risk of becoming extinct and requires protection and recovery efforts.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation:**  
   A formal recovery strategy for the Black Redhorse was developed and includes the identification of its **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery. This critical habitat has been officially recorded and made publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to information.

3. **Exclusion from Protected Lands (Section 58(2)b):**  
   A key legal safeguard under SARA is that **no portion of critical habitat** can be located within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b**, which includes lands designated as **protected or reserved for the use and benefit of Indigenous bands** (e.g., reserves, traditional territories).  
   The regulation explicitly states that **none of the critical habitat identified in this Order falls within such protected Indigenous lands**. This ensures compliance with the Act’s provisions regarding Indigenous rights and land use.

4. **Consultation with Indigenous Communities:**  
   Under **subsection 58(7)c** of SARA (as amended by S.C. 2019, c. 29, subpar. 375(1)(f)(ii)), the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is required to consult with the **Minister of Indigenous Services** and the **specific Indigenous band** if the proposed critical habitat order may affect lands set apart for the use and benefit of a band.  
   In this case, the Minister has conducted such consultations and confirmed that the proposed critical habitat does **not impact any Indigenous reserve or traditional land**. This consultation process is a critical component of SARA’s commitment to respecting Indigenous rights, interests, and responsibilities.

### **Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The Order formally **designates and defines the critical habitat** of the Black Redhorse (*Moxostoma duquesnei*) as identified in the recovery strategy.
- This designation legally establishes the **spatial boundaries** of the areas where the Black Redhorse must be protected to ensure its survival and recovery.
- The critical habitat is legally recognized as **essential for the species’ survival**, and any future development, land use change, or activity that impacts these areas must be assessed under SARA’s regulatory framework.

---

### **Legal Application and Enforcement**

- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to this critical habitat, meaning that:
  - The designated areas are protected from actions that could destroy or degrade the habitat.
  - Any activity that may affect the habitat must be authorized or justified under SARA’s permit system, including environmental assessments.
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Government of Canada, making it immediately effective upon publication.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Environmental Protection:** The Order strengthens conservation efforts by legally protecting the specific waters and riparian zones essential for the Black Redhorse’s life cycle (e.g., spawning, feeding, migration).
- **Indigenous Engagement:** The absence of overlap with Indigenous reserves and the prior consultation with the Minister of Indigenous Services and the relevant band reflect Canada’s commitment to **cooperative governance** and **Indigenous consultation** under SARA.
- **Compliance with SARA Requirements:** The Order fully satisfies the procedural and substantive requirements of SARA, including:
  - Identification of critical habitat through a recovery strategy;
  - Public availability of the information in the Public Registry;
  - Compliance with land-use restrictions (no overlap with Indigenous reserves);
  - Required consultation with Indigenous governments.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the Black Redhorse (*Moxostoma duquesnei*) under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is a legally binding instrument that protects the species’ essential environment, ensures compliance with Indigenous rights and consultation obligations, and advances Canada’s biodiversity conservation goals. The Order is grounded in scientific recovery planning, legal safeguards, and respectful engagement with Indigenous communities, reflecting a balanced and responsible approach to species protection.
