### **Detailed Summary of the Prohibition of Asbestos and Products Containing Asbestos Regulations (2018)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Background**

These regulations are established under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, and are made by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**. This action follows a formal process outlined in CEPA 1999:

- The Minister of the Environment published a **proposed regulation** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **January 6, 2018**, providing public notice and an opportunity for stakeholders to submit comments or file a notice of objection.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was consulted under subsection 93(3) to provide expert advice.
- The Governor in Council determined, under subsection 93(4), that the proposed regulations **do not conflict with other federal laws** and provide **adequate protection to human health and the environment**.

Thus, the regulations are now formally enacted to **prohibit the use, importation, and manufacture of certain asbestos-containing products**, while allowing limited exceptions for specific, justified uses.

---

#### **2. Scope and Applicability**

The regulations apply to **processed asbestos fibres** and **products containing processed asbestos fibres**, with several key exclusions and exceptions:

##### **Exclusions**
- **Asbestos in transit**: Does not apply to asbestos or products containing asbestos that are in transit **through Canada** from outside Canada to another country.
- **Mining residues**: Does not apply to asbestos mining residues, **except under section 6** (which allows provincial authorization for use in construction/landscaping).
- **Pest control products**: Excluded as defined in the *Pest Control Products Act*.
- **Asbestos integrated into structures or infrastructure**: If the integration occurred **before the regulations came into force**, the asbestos is exempt from the prohibition.
- **Products used before the regulation came into force**: The regulation applies to asbestos **contained in such products**, even if used prior to enforcement (see section 5).

##### **Applicability**
- Applies to **importation, sale, and use** of:
  - Processed asbestos fibres
  - Products containing processed asbestos fibres (unless degraded from integrated asbestos)
  - Consumer products with asbestos in **greater than trace amounts**

> Note: "Processed asbestos fibres" refers to asbestos that has been treated or refined (e.g., in insulation, gaskets, or friction materials), not naturally occurring or unprocessed asbestos.

#### **3. Prohibited Activities**

Under the regulations, the following activities are **strictly prohibited**:

| Activity | Details |
|--------|--------|
| **Import, sell, or use** | Processed asbestos fibres |
| **Import, sell, or use** | Products containing processed asbestos fibres unless the fibres resulted from **degradation of asbestos integrated into a structure or infrastructure** |
| **Manufacture** | Products containing processed asbestos fibres (unless degradation occurred before the regulation came into force) |
| **Manufacture** | Consumer products containing asbestos in **greater than trace amounts** |

> *Exception*: Asbestos mining residues may be used in construction or landscaping **only if authorized by the province** where the work occurs.
