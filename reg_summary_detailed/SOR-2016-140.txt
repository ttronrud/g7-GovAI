**Detailed Summary of the Ferry-Boats Remission Order, 2016**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
The *Ferry-Boats Remission Order, 2016* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **section 115a of the Customs Tariff**. It was promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This means the order is a formal, government-enacted rule that modifies or provides relief from customs duties under Canadian tax and trade law.

The order is referenced in the following legislative provisions:
- **S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)** – This provides the legal basis for granting remission of customs duties in specific cases.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – Likely refers to the underlying *Customs Tariff Act* or related legislation that governs tariff classifications and duty obligations.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of the order is to **grant a remission (i.e., full or partial waiver) of customs duties** that would otherwise be payable on **ferry-boats** classified under **subheading 8901.10** in the *List of Tariff Provisions* (as set out in the schedule to the Customs Tariff).

This remission applies **only to ferry-boats that are permanently imported into Canada for the first time**, with specific eligibility criteria and timeframes.

---

### **3. Scope of the Remission**
- **Applicable Goods**: Ferry-boats classified under **subheading 8901.10** of the Customs Tariff.
- **Exclusion**: The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Ferry-boats **produced in Canada** that have been **exported and then re-imported** into Canada.  
    This exclusion ensures that the benefit is not extended to goods that have already undergone a domestic-to-foreign-to-domestic cycle, which may be subject to different duty treatment.

---

### **4. Conditions for Eligibility**
To qualify for the remission, the following **three conditions** must be met:

#### **Condition 1: Date of First Permanent Importation**
- The ferry-boat must have been **permanently imported into Canada for the first time on or after October 1, 2015**.
- This establishes a clear temporal boundary, ensuring the policy targets new imports introduced after a specific date, likely to support the development of Canada’s ferry infrastructure or maritime transport.

#### **Condition 2: Timely Claim Submission**
- The **importer must file a claim for remission** with the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** within **two years** of the date of importation.
- This two-year window ensures that claims are processed in a timely manner and prevents indefinite delays in duty relief.

#### **Condition 3: Submission of Required Evidence**
- The importer must **file all evidence requested by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** to verify eligibility for remission.
- This requirement ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with administrative standards. The CBSA may request documentation such as:
  - Proof of importation (e.g., customs entry forms),
  - Classification documentation (e.g., tariff classification confirmation),
  - Evidence of the vessel’s use as a ferry-boat,
  - Manufacturer or origin details,
  - Proof of first-time importation.

### **5. Effective Dates of the Order**
- **Sections 1 to 2 (General Provisions)**: Come into force on the **day the order is registered** with the Canada Gazette (i.e., the official publication date).
- **Sections 3 to 6 (Specific Provisions)**: Come into force on **October 1, 2017**.
  
> This staggered implementation allows for administrative preparation and ensures that the policy is fully operational by a defined date, providing clarity for importers and regulatory bodies.

### **6. Amendments**
- The document contains **four instances of "[Amendment]"**, though no specific amendments are detailed in the text provided.
- These may indicate that the order was originally drafted with amendments that were either:
  - Subsequently incorporated,
  - Deferred,
  - Or omitted from the published version.

### **7. Key Implications and Objectives**
- **Supports Maritime Infrastructure Development**: By reducing or eliminating customs duties on ferry-boats, the policy may encourage investment in ferry services, particularly in remote or northern regions where ferry transport is critical.
- **Encourages Innovation and Sustainability**: The remission may promote the use of new or environmentally friendly ferry vessels, aligning with broader transportation and environmental goals.
- **Protects Canadian Interests**: By excluding re-imported Canadian-made vessels, the policy prevents abuse of the remission and protects domestic production and trade balances.
- **Administrative Clarity**: The clear conditions (import date, claim window, evidence requirements) provide a transparent and predictable framework for importers.

### **Conclusion**
The *Ferry-Boats Remission Order, 2016* is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure designed to **reduce customs duties on newly imported ferry-boats** (classified under 8901.10) that meet strict eligibility criteria. It supports the development of ferry transport in Canada while maintaining fiscal discipline and ensuring compliance through clear procedural requirements. The policy is effective only for vessels imported on or after October 1, 2015, and requires timely claims and documentation, with full implementation beginning on October 1, 2017.

This order reflects a balance between promoting economic development in transportation and maintaining the integrity of Canada’s customs and tariff system.
