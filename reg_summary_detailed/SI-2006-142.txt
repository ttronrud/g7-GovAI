### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Regulation**
- The regulation in question is **not currently in force**.
- It was a **provision** (specifically **Section 83**) within **Statutory Instrument 2018/96**, which was issued by a government department or minister (the exact authority would depend on the subject matter of SI 2018/96).
- The section was **repealed** — meaning it was formally removed and no longer applies.

#### 2. **Legal Effect of Repeal**
- Repeal means that the section **no longer has legal effect**.
- Any obligations, rights, or duties previously established by that section are **no longer enforceable**.
- The repeal is effective from the date of the instrument’s coming into force (typically specified in the SI), which for SI 2018/96 would be published in the *Canada Gazette* or the relevant national legal publication (depending on jurisdiction).

#### 3. **Statutory Instrument 2018/96 – Contextual Background**
While the exact content of SI 2018/96 is not provided, such instruments often relate to:
- Regulatory amendments
- Administrative procedures
- Environmental, health, safety, or employment standards
- Tax or financial regulations
- Licensing or compliance requirements

Since the repealing section is **Section 83**, it likely addressed a specific rule or requirement — possibly related to:
- Compliance reporting
- Penalties or sanctions
- Administrative procedures
- A procedural requirement in a regulatory framework

However, without the full text of SI 2018/96, the **precise content of the repealed section cannot be determined**.

#### 4. **Why Was It Repealed?**
Common reasons for repealing a section include:
- Outdated or obsolete policy
- Inconsistency with new legislation
- Better alignment with current regulatory frameworks
- Public interest or efficiency improvements
- Errors or ambiguities in the original provision

#### 5. **Implications of Repeal**
- Legal practitioners, regulators, or organizations relying on the former section must now refer to **current law**.
- Any legal actions or compliance measures based on the repealed section are **invalid or unenforceable**.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader reform or simplification of regulations.

#### 6. **Jurisdictional Note**
- The reference to **SI/2018-96** suggests this is a **statutory instrument** in a **common law jurisdiction**, such as **Canada** or the **United Kingdom**.
- In the UK, "SI" stands for Statutory Instrument, and SI 2018/96 would be a UK government regulation.
- In Canada, similar instruments are known as **regulations** under a federal or provincial statute.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The repeated listing of "[Repealed, SI/2018-96, s. 83]" suggests a possible data entry or formatting error — it may have been copied multiple times by mistake. However, the legal significance remains the same: **Section 83 of SI 2018/96 is repealed**.

The repeal signifies that the rule previously established by that section has been removed, likely due to obsolescence, inconsistency, or policy change. As such, any prior application or compliance based on this section is invalid. The exact subject matter of the repealed section cannot be determined from the provided text, but it would have been part of a regulatory framework governed by SI 2018/96. For accurate interpretation, the full text of SI 2018/96 must be consulted.
