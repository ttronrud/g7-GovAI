### **Detailed Summary of the Solvency Funding Relief Regulations, 2009**

The **Solvency Funding Relief Regulations, 2009** (S.O. 2009, c. 11) are a set of administrative regulations made under the **Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (Pension Benefits Standards Act or "the Act")**. These regulations establish a framework for the **funding of solvency deficiencies** in defined benefit pension plans—specifically those that emerged in or after the 2008 plan year—by allowing plan administrators to fund such deficiencies through **annual "solvency special payments"** over a period of up to 10 years, rather than through immediate or full remediation.

This summary provides a comprehensive, structured breakdown of the regulation's **purpose, definitions, key provisions, application conditions, and procedural requirements**.

---

## **I. Purpose and Background**

- The regulations were introduced to address **solvency deficiencies** in defined benefit pension plans that arose due to **actuarial underfunding**—particularly those identified in 2008 and beyond.
- They were developed in response to the **financial instability** of certain pension plans, where the **liabilities exceeded the value of plan assets**.
- The goal is to **provide a flexible, structured, and legally compliant pathway** for funding these deficiencies without requiring full termination or immediate capital injections, thus protecting plan members’ benefits and maintaining plan viability.

> **Legal Authority**:  
> The regulations are made under the **Pension Benefits Standards Act**, specifically in relation to the definitions of "surplus" in various subsections (e.g., 2(1), 9(1), 10.1(2)(b)(b), 12(3), 28(1)(b)(c), 29(6)(a), and section 39d), which relate to solvency and funding obligations.

## **III. Core Provisions and Funding Mechanisms**

### **1. Funding of Deficiencies via Annual Special Payments**

- If a plan has a **solvency deficiency** (as defined in subsection 9(1) of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations), it may be funded through **annual solvency special payments**.
- These payments are calculated as follows:

> **Annual Payment = (Solvency Deficiency ÷ 5) – Going Concern Special Payments (excluding those under paragraph 14(1)(c))**

- The **"going concern" special payments** are those made to maintain the plan’s ongoing operation (e.g., normal cost, contributions).
- The **divided by 5** reflects a **maximum 5-year funding period**, but the regulations allow **up to 10 years** under certain conditions.

> **Note**: This formula ensures that the plan is not overfunded in the short term while still addressing the deficiency over a reasonable period.

---

### **2. Special Payments and Their Role**

- Special payments are **not** the same as regular contributions.
- They are **specifically designed** to fund the **solvency shortfall** and are required to be made **in annual installments**.
- Payments are **calculated based on actuarial valuations** and must reflect the plan’s actual liabilities and asset values.

> **Key Point**: The regulations **allow for partial funding** of the deficiency through special payments, even if the full deficiency is not immediately resolved.

---

### **3. Treatment of 2008 Solvency Deficiency**

- A **2008 solvency deficiency** is defined as a deficiency identified between November 1, 2008, and October 31, 2009.
- This deficiency may be **funded through special payments** over a period not exceeding **10 years** from the date of emergence.
- The **present value of future special payments** due in the next 10 years is included in the calculation of the deficiency.

> **Exception**: The regulations **do not apply** to solvency deficiencies arising from Air Canada’s election to fund a plan under Part 2 of the **Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations**, except for a 2008 deficiency at the end of that year.

---

### **4. Funding Requirements and Pre-Conditions**

Before a plan can be funded under these regulations, the following **must be met**:

1. **All prior payments owed to the pension fund** must have been made **before the deficiency emerges** (as required by subsection 9(14) of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations).
2. The administrator must **file two documents** with the Superintendent:
   - A **written notification** that the deficiency will be funded under section 5.
   - The **actuarial report** that values the plan as of the date the deficiency emerged.

> These filings are mandatory and serve as formal justification for the funding action.

---

### **5. Solvency Ratio and Reporting Requirements**

- For the **2009 plan year**, the **prescribed solvency ratio** is based on the actuarial report that first identified the deficiency.
- The administrator is required to provide beneficiaries with detailed information, including:
  - The **solvency ratio** at the time of deficiency emergence.
  - The **amount of the deficiency** to be funded.
  - A description of how **benefits would be reduced** if the plan were fully terminated.
  - A warning that **extending the funding period beyond 5 years** may:
    - Reduce the value of plan assets during the funding period.
    - Extend the time during which assets are below liabilities.
  - The **special payments** that would have been made under the standard regulations (section 9 of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations).
  - The **special payments to be made in the 2009 plan year**.
  - A statement that **funding may continue beyond 2009** only if **less than one-third of members and less than one-third of beneficiaries (excluding members)** object.
  - A statement that **Superintendent approval is not required** for funding under these regulations.
  - A deadline for **objections** (not less than 30 days after the information is provided).
  - A statement that **benefits will remain restricted** for **four additional plan years** after 2009 if the deficiency is funded under this Part.
  - A right of access to relevant documents under paragraph 28(1)(c) of the Act.

> If a beneficiary is represented by a **beneficiary representative**, the administrator must provide the information to that representative and treat the representative as acting on behalf of the beneficiaries.

---

### **6. Multi-Employer Plans and Collective Agreements**

- In **multi-employer pension plans**, if the **annual payment required under this Part is less than the total payments required under applicable collective agreements** (excluding normal cost and special payments to liquidate unfunded liabilities), then:
  - The **payment required under this Part shall be the full amount required under collective agreements**.
  - The **accrual rule in subsection (4)** (see below) **does not apply** in such cases.

> This ensures that **collective agreement obligations take priority** in multi-employer settings.

### **7. Accrual of Amounts (Special Provision)**
