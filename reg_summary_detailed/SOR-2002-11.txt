The provided text appears to be a **fragmented or incorrectly structured document** that combines elements of a government regulatory order with a separate land use application. It does not constitute a complete, coherent, or legally valid regulation in the traditional sense. Below is a **detailed, accurate, and structured summary** of what is present in the text, distinguishing between regulatory language and a separate application, and clarifying the legal and factual components.

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Document**

#### **1. Nature of the Document**
The document is a **proposed or draft regulatory order** issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act*, specifically under **paragraph 29(1)(a)**. It purports to authorize certain federal employees to acquire interests in lands within the Northwest Territories (NWT). However, the content is **incomplete and inconsistent**, mixing regulatory language with a separate land application that appears to be unrelated in scope and legal function.

---

#### **2. Regulatory Framework and Authority**
- **Issuing Authority**:  
  Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- **Legal Basis**:  
  The order is made pursuant to **paragraph 29(1)(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which permits the federal government to authorize employees to acquire interests in territorial lands under specific conditions.

> *Note*: Paragraph 29(1)(a) of the Territorial Lands Act typically allows for the granting of land rights or authorizations for federal employees engaged in government functions, particularly in areas involving Indigenous relations, land management, or cultural preservation.

---

#### **3. Purpose of the Order**
The stated purpose is to:
> Authorize certain employees of the Government of Canada to acquire an interest in territorial lands in the Northwest Territories.

This implies a formal, legally binding mechanism allowing federal employees to hold or develop a legal interest (e.g., lease, right of use, or ownership) in land for official or operational purposes.

---

#### **4. Scope and Content of the Authorization**
- The **specific employee** named in a schedule (which is not included in the provided text) is authorized to acquire an interest in land.
- The land is described in the schedule, which is not included here.
- The authorization applies only to the lands described in the schedule and is limited to the employee named.

> *Important Note*: The document does **not** contain the actual schedule or land description. Therefore, the specific location, size, or boundaries of the land are **missing** from this excerpt.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially recorded in the land registry or government records).

---

#### **6. Separate Land Use Application (Not Part of the Regulatory Order)**
This section appears to be a **distinct, unrelated application** submitted by an individual employee, not part of the regulatory order itself.

**Key Details of the Application**:
- **Applicant**:  
  Linda May Molner, Manager of Registration, Revenue and Band Governance, Lands and Trusts Services, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND).
- **Location of Land**:  
  A **non-surveyed parcel** of approximately **0.18 hectares** (about 0.44 acres).
- **Geographic Coordinates**:  
  Near an unnamed lake between **Duckfish Lake** and **Vital Lake**, located at:
  - Latitude: 62°37′19″ N  
  - Longitude: 114°27′38″ W  
  - In the Northwest Territories.
- **Description**:  
  The parcel is outlined in **red on a sketch plan** (file number: **33-1-12**) held in the **Land and Water Management Division** of DIAND in Ottawa.
- **Purpose of Use**:  
  For **traditional and cultural use**.
- **Exclusions and Reservations**:  
  - All **mines, minerals, and hydrocarbons** (solid, liquid, or gaseous) are **saved and excepted** from the lease.  
  - The applicant **reserves the right to work** such resources, meaning the federal employee retains the right to explore or extract minerals, even though the land is leased for cultural purposes.

> ⚠️ **Critical Legal and Procedural Issue**:  
> This application is **not a regulatory order** but a **request for a lease** under the Territorial Lands Act or similar land use legislation. It is likely submitted under a different legal pathway (e.g., a cultural land use permit or a traditional use authorization).  
> Furthermore, the fact that the applicant is a **government employee** (and not an Indigenous person or community) raises questions about the legitimacy and appropriateness of such a lease for traditional use, especially if the land is located near or adjacent to known Indigenous territories.

#### **7. Key Observations and Legal Implications**
| Aspect | Observation |
|-------|------------|
| **Regulatory vs. Application** | The document incorrectly merges a regulatory order with a land use application. The regulatory order is not fully formed or supported by the content. |
| **Land Description** | Missing—no precise boundaries or legal description of the land. |
| **Cultural Use Authorization** | The lease for traditional and cultural use is a common practice under Indigenous land rights frameworks, but such authorizations typically require consultation with Indigenous communities and adherence to treaties or agreements. |
| **Mineral Rights Reservation** | Reserving the right to work minerals, including hydrocarbons, may conflict with Indigenous rights or land use policies, especially if the land is culturally significant. |
| **Procedural Compliance** | The application lacks required documentation (e.g., community consultation, environmental assessment, or formal approval process) that would normally be required for such a lease. |
| **Federal Employee Status** | Authorizing a federal employee to acquire land is unusual and raises questions about accountability, transparency, and potential conflicts of interest. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The document **does not constitute a valid, complete, or legally enforceable regulation**. Instead, it contains:
- A **draft regulatory order** that is incomplete (missing schedule, land description, and employee name).
- A **separate, standalone land use application** submitted by a federal employee for cultural use, with mineral rights reserved.

**Recommendations for Correction or Completion**:
1. The regulatory order must include a full schedule listing the employee and the precise legal description of the land.
2. The application for cultural use must be properly processed under the appropriate Indigenous land rights or cultural use framework, including community consultation and compliance with the *Cultural Heritage Act* or *Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) policies*.
3. The reservation of mineral rights must be justified and reviewed to ensure it does not infringe on Indigenous rights or environmental protections.
4. The document should be clearly separated into two distinct parts: (a) the regulatory authorization and (b) the land use application.

### Final Note:
This document, as presented, is **not a properly drafted or legally complete regulation**. It appears to be a draft or misaligned administrative document that requires significant revision, clarification, and legal review before it can be validly issued or implemented.
