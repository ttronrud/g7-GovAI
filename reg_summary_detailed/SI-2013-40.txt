**Regulation Summary: Transfer of the Travelling Public Program Unit**

**Official Citation:**  
Statutory Instrument: S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207  
Relevant Statute: *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (R.S., c. P-34)

**Key Provision:**  
Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* authorizes the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer certain units or functions from one federal department to another, as part of broader public service restructuring.

**Action Taken:**  
On April 1, 2013, the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, transferred the **Travelling Public Program Unit** from the **Department of Health** to the **Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)**.

**Scope of Transfer:**  
The transfer includes:
- The **control and supervision** of the Travelling Public Program Unit.
- The associated **functions, responsibilities, personnel, and administrative resources** related to that unit.
- The unit's operations and mandate within the federal public administration.

**Background and Purpose of the Transfer:**  
The Travelling Public Program Unit is responsible for managing the federal government's program that provides medical and health services to Canadian citizens and residents who are temporarily stationed abroad or in remote or underserved areas. This includes supporting health professionals and medical personnel who travel internationally or operate in isolated regions.

The transfer to PHAC was intended to:
- Improve coordination between health service delivery and public health initiatives.
- Strengthen the Public Health Agency of Canada’s capacity to manage public health programs, including those related to health service mobility and international health outreach.
- Align the program with PHAC’s broader mandate to protect and promote the health of Canadians, including through health surveillance, emergency response, and health service delivery in challenging environments.

**Effective Date:**  
April 1, 2013.

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the federal government to reorganize public service units and transfer them between departments to enhance efficiency, accountability, and service delivery.

**Significance:**  
This transfer reflects a strategic shift in the federal government’s approach to public health administration. By moving the Travelling Public Program Unit to PHAC, the government consolidated health-related administrative functions under a single, centralized public health authority, reinforcing PHAC’s role as a central hub for health service delivery and public health policy.

**Note on Legal Status:**  
The regulation is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, and it is binding on all federal departments and agencies. It does not alter the legal or operational mandate of the program itself, but rather changes the administrative oversight and governance structure.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally restructured the administrative oversight of the Travelling Public Program Unit by transferring it from the Department of Health to the Public Health Agency of Canada, effective April 1, 2013. The move enhances the integration of health service mobility programs into the broader public health framework, promoting more coordinated and effective health service delivery across Canada.
