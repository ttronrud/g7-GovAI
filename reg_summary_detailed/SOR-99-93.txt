**Detailed Summary of the Tobacco (Access) Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 13)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

The Tobacco (Access) Regulations were enacted under the authority of **Section 42.1 of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (the "Act")**, which allows the Minister of Health to propose regulations that are laid before Parliament. In this case, the proposed regulations were laid before the House of Commons on **June 3, 1998**. 

However, no committee of the House of Commons submitted a report in support or opposition to the proposed regulations within **30 sitting days**. As a result, under **Section 14 of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act**, the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health) proceeded to **enact the regulations without parliamentary concurrence**.

This process reflects a provision allowing for the prompt implementation of regulations when there is no parliamentary delay or objection, ensuring timely enforcement of tobacco access controls.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulations**

#### **1. Valid Documentation for Age Verification (Subsection 8(2) of the Act)**

- **Retailers** who sell tobacco products in a **duty-free shop**, as defined in **subsection 2(1) of the Customs Act**.

> **Purpose**: Recognizes legitimate business operations that do not involve direct consumer sales in public retail settings, such as international trade or duty-free outlets.

#### **4. Exemption from Mandatory Signage (Section 9)**

A retailer is **exempt** from the requirement to post the mandatory sign if:

- The retailer operates in a **province with provincial legislation** that:
  1. **Prohibits the sale of tobacco to persons under 18 years of age or older**, and  
  2. **Requires the posting of similar notices** in retail establishments selling tobacco.

> **Purpose**: Allows for harmonization between federal and provincial laws, respecting existing provincial policies that are more restrictive than the federal minimum.
