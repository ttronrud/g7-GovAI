**Detailed Summary of the Firearms Fees Remission Order (Licences)**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The Firearms Fees Remission Order (Licences) is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** and the **Treasury Board**. This action is authorized under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General to make orders related to fees and charges in the public interest, particularly when such remission serves broader public policy or administrative objectives.

---

**Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **remit (i.e., waive or cancel) certain firearm licensing fees** for eligible individuals who have paid such fees under the *Firearms Fees Regulations* for specific types of firearm licences, provided the fees were paid within a defined timeframe and under specified conditions.

---

**Who Is Eligible for Fee Remission?**

The following individuals are eligible for remission of the firearm licensing fee:

1. **Individuals who received a possession licence for firearms** (excluding those under 18 years of age)  
   - The licence must have been issued **on or after December 1, 1998**.

2. **Individuals who received a renewal of a possession licence**  
   - The fee paid for the renewal of a possession licence is remitted.

3. **Individuals who received a new possession and acquisition licence**  
   - The fee paid for the issuance of a new possession and acquisition licence is remitted.

4. **Individuals who received a possession and acquisition licence**  
   - If the individual previously held only a **possession licence** (not an acquisition licence), and a new possession and acquisition licence is issued, the fee is remitted.

> **Note:** This remission applies only to individuals **18 years of age or older**. It does **not** apply to individuals under 18, whose fees are addressed separately in the order.

**Exclusions (When Remission Does NOT Apply):**

Remission is **not granted** in the following circumstances:

1. **Revocation of a licence**  
   - If the licence (or the previously held licence) was **revoked** for reasons **other than those specified in subsection 72(1.1) of the Firearms Act**, and the revocation has **not been cancelled**, then the fee is not remitted.

2. **Refusal of a licence application**  
   - If the renewal or issuance of the licence was **refused**, and that refusal has **not been overturned** (i.e., reversed or appealed successfully), then the fee is not remitted.

> These exclusions ensure that remission is not applied in cases where the individual’s eligibility or compliance with licensing requirements has been formally challenged or denied.

**Special Provision for Minors (Under 18 Years Old):**

An additional provision in the order states that **remission of the fee** is also granted to individuals who hold or have held a **possession licence for firearms for individuals under 18 years of age** — *specifically for the renewal of such licences*. This provision is distinct from the general eligibility criteria and is explicitly included to support youth firearm access and compliance with youth-specific licensing rules.

---

**Timeframe for Eligibility:**

The remission applies **only to fees paid during a specific period**:

- From **December 1, 1998**, to **the day immediately before the Order comes into force**.

> This means that fees paid before December 1, 1998, or after the Order’s effective date are **not eligible** for remission.

---

**Conditions for Remission:**

The remission is granted **subject to the condition** that the fee was paid within the defined period (December 1, 1998, to the day before the Order comes into force). This ensures that the remission is limited in scope and tied to a specific historical timeframe, likely to address a past policy or administrative issue.

---

**Effective Date:**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette). This is a standard administrative procedure in Canadian regulatory law, ensuring that the order is legally effective once it is formally recognized by the government.

---

**Key Policy Implications:**

- **Public Interest Justification:** The order is framed as being in the public interest, suggesting it may aim to reduce financial barriers to responsible firearm ownership, support compliance with licensing, or address historical inequities in fee structures.
- **Targeted Relief:** It provides relief to a specific cohort of licence holders (those who obtained licences on or after December 1, 1998), indicating a possible effort to correct or adjust for changes in policy, legislation, or administrative practices during that period.
- **Exclusion of Non-Compliant Cases:** The exclusion of revoked or refused licences ensures that the remission does not apply to individuals who failed to meet licensing standards, maintaining accountability and integrity in the licensing system.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Firearms Fees Remission Order (Licences)* is a targeted, time-bound administrative measure that waives certain firearm licensing fees for eligible individuals who obtained or renewed a possession or possession-and-acquisition licence on or after December 1, 1998, and before the Order’s effective date. It applies only to adults (18+), excludes cases involving revoked or refused licences, and includes a special provision for minors under 18. The order reflects a balance between public interest and administrative accountability, aiming to support responsible firearm ownership while maintaining compliance and integrity in the licensing regime.

**Note:** This Order is a temporary, non-repealable administrative instrument and is not a permanent change to the *Firearms Act* or *Firearms Fees Regulations*. It operates as a one-time or periodic relief mechanism under existing legal authority.
