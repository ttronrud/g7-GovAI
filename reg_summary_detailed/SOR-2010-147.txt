**Detailed Summary of the *Statistics Canada Census-Related Term Employment Regulations* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12 and 13)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Statistics Canada Census-Related Term Employment Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under **section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. These regulations were enacted on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** and the **Public Service Commission**, and they provide specific provisions governing the **temporary appointments and deployments** of personnel in Statistics Canada for the purpose of conducting **censuses and national surveys**.

These regulations apply only to certain **temporary (specified-term) positions** in Statistics Canada that are excluded from standard public service employment rules due to their unique, short-term nature tied to census and survey activities. The goal is to ensure flexibility in staffing during peak census periods while still maintaining fairness, transparency, and compliance with public service employment standards.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA). |
| **Acting Appointment** | Temporary performance of duties of another position. If such duties would have constituted a *promotion* had the individual been formally appointed, it is considered an acting appointment. |
| **Deployment** | A transfer of an employee (not excluded by the Order) or an individual from a separate agency to a position, under section 6 of the PSEA. |
| **Internal Appointment Process** | A process used to make appointments where only current employees are considered. |
| **Order** | The *Statistics Canada Census and Survey Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order*, which identifies which positions and individuals are excluded from standard employment rules. |
| **Person** | A person excluded by the Order who is appointed or deployed to a position. |
| **Position** | A position excluded by the Order. |

## **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

- Specific positions in **Statistics Canada** that are excluded from standard employment rules under the PSEA.
- Appointments or deployments to those positions on a **specified-term basis only**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Does **not apply** to persons mentioned in **subsection 5(1) of the Statistics Act**, whose roles are solely for:
    - Administrative or management support;
    - Data processing duties;
    - Conducting the **population census** or **agriculture census**;
    - The **national survey** (as defined under sections 7 and 8 of the Statistics Act), which replaces the long-form population census questionnaire and runs concurrently with it.

> Thus, the regulations do not govern staff engaged in core administrative or data-processing functions directly related to census operations.

---

## **Core Provisions**

### **1. Appointments and Deployments Must Be on a Specified-Term Basis**
- Only **temporary, specified-term appointments or deployments** are allowed.
- No permanent or indeterminate-term appointments are permitted in these positions.

### **2. Internal Appointment Process Restrictions**
- A person **is not eligible** for an internal appointment process **except** for an **acting appointment**.
- This means that regular internal hiring (e.g., for permanent roles) is **prohibited** in these temporary positions.
- The internal appointment process is restricted to temporary, acting roles only.

### **3. Notification and Right to Recourse (Section 77 of PSEA)**
- The Public Service Commission must **notify persons in the area of recourse** (as defined in subsection 77(2) of the PSEA) in writing when:
  - An **acting appointment of four months or more** is made or proposed; **or**
  - An acting appointment **extends a person’s cumulative acting period from less than four months to four months or more**.
- This ensures transparency and provides individuals with a formal right to file a complaint if they believe the appointment is unfair or violates employment equity principles.

> **Exception**: Acting appointments **less than four months** that do **not** extend a person’s cumulative acting period to four months or more are **excluded** from the application of **sections 30 and 77** of the PSEA.

### **4. Official Language Proficiency (Section 30(2)(a) of PSEA)**

#### **General Rule**:
- For **acting appointments under four months**, the requirement for **official language proficiency** (French or English) applies **only if**:
  - The Commission can fill the position with a qualified person or employee **not excluded by the Order**; **or**
  - The **cumulative acting period** of all persons and employees (not excluded) in that position reaches **four months or more**.

> This allows flexibility in temporary staffing without requiring full language proficiency if the position is temporarily filled by someone with adequate qualifications.

#### **Exception for Encumbered Bilingual Positions**:
- If an acting appointment is made to a **bilingual position** (an "encumbered" position) and:
  - The Commission **cannot** fill the position with a qualified person or employee **not excluded by the Order** who meets language requirements;
  - The appointment is **four months or more but no more than twelve months** long,
- Then the requirement for official language proficiency under paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Act **does not apply**.

> This exception recognizes the practical challenges of filling bilingual roles during short-term census work.

#### **Cumulative Period Limitation**:
- Subsection (4) **does not apply** (i.e., the language requirement does not apply) to an acting appointment to the **same position** if the **cumulative acting period** of all persons and employees (not excluded) in that position exceeds **twelve months**.

> This prevents the continuous imposition of language requirements on individuals in long-term temporary roles.

### **5. Deployment Rules**

#### **Who Can Be Deployed**:
- The **Chief Statistician** may deploy:
  - An employee **not excluded by the Order**;
  - An individual employed by a **separate agency** (e.g., government or private contractor), provided deployment has been approved under **subsection 51(2) of the PSEA**.

#### **Scope of Deployment**:
- Deployments may occur:
  - **Within an occupational group**, or
  - **Between occupational groups**, **unless** such cross-group deployments are explicitly excluded by other regulations made under paragraph 26(1)(a) of the PSEA.

#### **Rules for Deployment**:
- Must follow the **same rules** as those established in Treasury Board regulations governing deployment under subsection 2(1) of the PSEA.
- **Must not**:
  - Constitute a **promotion** (as defined in Treasury Board regulations);
  - Change a person’s employment status from **specified term to indeterminate term**.

#### **Exceptions to Consent Requirement**:
A deployment may be made **without the person’s consent** if:
1. Agreement to deployment is a **condition of employment** in the current position; **or**
2. The person has **harassed another employee or person not excluded by the Order** during their employment, and the deployment is to a different position.

> This balances operational needs with ethical and legal obligations.

#### **Effect of Deployment**:
- Upon deployment, the person **ceases to be the incumbent** of the position they previously held.
- A deployment is **not considered an appointment** under the PSEA, so it does not trigger the full range of employment rights or protections typically associated with formal appointments.

## **Probationary Employment and Termination**

- While a person is on **probation**, the Chief Statistician may issue a written notice specifying:
  - **Option 1**: Termination **seven days after receipt** of notice, with the employee ceasing to be an employee at the end of that period.
  - **Option 2**: Termination on a **specific date**, with the employee being paid an amount **equal to what they would have received** if they had been given a seven-day notice (i.e., a "notice of termination" equivalent).

> In both cases:
> - The employee **ceases to be an employee** on the termination date.
> - In Option 2, the employee receives **compensation equivalent to a seven-day notice**, even though the actual notice period is shorter.

> This ensures that probationary employees are not disadvantaged in terms of severance or notice rights.

## **Entry into Force**

These regulations come into force on the day they are **registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

## **Key Objectives and Rationale**

1. **Flexibility for Census Operations**  
   Allows Statistics Canada to respond quickly to staffing needs during census and survey periods without requiring long-term hiring or permanent appointments.

2. **Compliance with Public Service Standards**  
   Maintains fairness and accountability by:
   - Limiting internal hiring to acting appointments;
   - Requiring notice and recourse rights for longer-term acting appointments;
   - Ensuring language requirements are applied fairly and only when necessary.

3. **Protection of Employees**  
   Includes provisions to protect individuals from unfair treatment, harassment, and arbitrary dismissal during temporary assignments.

4. **Operational Efficiency**  
   Enables deployment across occupational groups and agencies, supporting efficient resource allocation during peak data collection periods.

5. **Balancing Flexibility and Equity**  
   Recognizes that temporary work may not require the same level of formal protections as permanent roles—especially in data processing or administrative support roles.
