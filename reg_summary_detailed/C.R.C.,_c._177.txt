**Detailed Summary of the *Ontario Bean Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Ontario Bean Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish a controlled marketing framework for specific types of beans produced in Ontario, governing how these beans are traded between provinces and exported.

---

### **2. Definitions of Key Terms**

- **Beans**: Refers specifically to two types of legumes:
  - *White pea beans* (commonly known as haricots)
  - *Yellow-eye beans*  
  These are the only beans covered under this regulation and must be grown in Ontario.

- **Commodity Board**: The **Ontario Bean Producers’ Marketing Board** (also referred to as the *Office de commercialisation* in French). This body is established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario and is responsible for overseeing the marketing, sale, and distribution of Ontario beans.

- **Dealer**: A person authorized by the Commodity Board to act as its agent. Dealers are responsible for purchasing beans from producers on behalf of the Board. In French, this is called *négociant*.

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the actual cultivation and production of beans in Ontario. In French, this is referred to as *producteur*.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply **only** to:
- The **interprovincial trade** (sales between Ontario and other Canadian provinces),
- **Export trade** (sales of beans outside Canada),
- And to **persons and property located within the Province of Ontario**.

This means that the rules do not extend to domestic retail sales, private transactions, or sales outside Ontario’s jurisdiction.

---

### **4. Key Prohibitions on Sales and Purchases**

To ensure centralized control and fair market access, the following restrictions are in place:

| Restriction | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Producers may only sell to dealers** | No producer may sell beans directly to individuals, businesses, or other entities outside the dealer system. |
| **Only dealers may purchase from producers** | Any person not authorized as a dealer is prohibited from buying beans directly from producers. |
| **Dealers may only buy on behalf of the Commodity Board** | A dealer cannot purchase beans from a producer for personal or private use; all purchases must be made for the Board. |
| **Producers may only transport beans to a dealer’s premises** | Beans cannot be shipped or transported to any location outside the dealer’s premises. This ensures control over handling and distribution. |
| **No processing, packing, or packaging without Board approval** | Beans may not be processed, packed, or packaged by any party unless such activity is authorized by the Commodity Board. This prevents unauthorized handling that could affect quality or market value. |

These provisions ensure that all beans follow a standardized, regulated path from farm to market, maintaining quality and fairness in trade.

### **5. Sales and Distribution Pools by the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is required to establish and manage **three distinct sales pools** to distribute proceeds fairly among producers based on volume, quality, and type of beans sold.

#### Pool 1: Canada Eastern Pea Beans
- Proceeds from sales of **Canada Eastern white pea beans**.
- Distributed based on:
  - Quantity delivered
  - Class, grade, and size of beans

#### Pool 2: Canada Eastern Yellow-Eye Beans (Within Quota)
- Proceeds from sales of **yellow-eye beans** sold **within the quota** allocated to each producer by the Board.
- Quotas are set and distributed by the Commodity Board.
- Distribution follows the same principles: proportional to quantity, class, grade, and size.

#### Pool 3: Canada Eastern Yellow-Eye Beans (Beyond Quota)
- Proceeds from sales of **yellow-eye beans sold beyond their allocated quota**.
- These are considered surplus beans.
- Distribution is still proportional to quantity, class, grade, and size.

> **Note**: All pools are subject to deduction of **necessary and proper disbursements and expenses** related to the sale (e.g., transportation, inspection, administrative costs). After these deductions, the remaining proceeds are distributed fairly to producers.

---

### **6. Payment to Producers**

Each producer who delivers beans to the Commodity Board is entitled to:

1. **Initial Payment on Delivery to a Dealer**  
   - A payment determined by the Commodity Board upon delivery of beans to a dealer.
   - This serves as an advance or incentive for producers to deliver beans.

2. **Additional Payments Over Time**  
   - Further payments are made by the Board as it receives proceeds from the sale of beans.
   - Payments continue until **all proceeds from the relevant pool** are fully distributed to eligible producers.
   - The timing and amounts are at the discretion of the Commodity Board.

This structure ensures producers are compensated fairly over time, with payments tied directly to the actual sales performance of the beans.

---

### **7. Appointment and Oversight of Dealers**

The Commodity Board has broad authority over dealers:

- **Appoints dealers** as needed.
- **Prescribes duties, terms, and conditions** of employment for each dealer.
- **Determines remuneration** (compensation) for dealers.

This ensures that dealers operate under clear guidelines and accountability, maintaining transparency and consistency in the marketing process.

---

### **8. Grading and Inspection Standards**

All beans sold by producers to dealers must be inspected and graded according to:
- **Subsection 15(1) of the Canada Grain Act**
- **Schedule I to the Canada Grain Act**

This ensures uniformity in quality standards across the province and facilitates fair trade both domestically and internationally.

---

### **9. Sampling Requirements**

When a dealer receives a shipment from a producer, either party may request a **sample** of the beans for quality verification. The sample must meet the following criteria:

- **Minimum weight**: Not less than **2 pounds**.
- **Fair sample**: Must be accepted by both the producer and the dealer as a representative sample.
- **Sealed and labeled**: The sample must be placed in a **moisture-proof container** with a label containing:
  - Name and address of the producer
  - Name of the dealer
- **Delivery to inspector (if required)**: If requested by an inspector from the **Canadian Grain Commission**, the sample must be delivered to the inspector at **Chatham, Ontario**.

> **Important**: Any person delivering beans on behalf of a producer is deemed to be the **authorized agent of the producer** for the purpose of sample acceptance.

---

### **10. Dispute Resolution Mechanism**

If a dispute arises between a producer and a dealer regarding:
- Grade
- Pick (quality/condition)
- Moisture content
- Overall condition of the shipment

Then the matter must be referred to an **inspector of the Canadian Grain Commission** in **Chatham, Ontario**.

- The decision of the inspector is **final and binding** on both parties.
- This provides a neutral, standardized, and legally enforceable process to resolve disagreements without costly litigation.
