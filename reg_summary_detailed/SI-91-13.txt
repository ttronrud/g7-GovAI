**Legal Citation:** S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12

**Recommendation Source:** The Treasury Board

**Detailed Summary:**

This regulation grants the authority to **remit (i.e., cancel or forgive) the excise tax** that is paid or otherwise payable by a federal department under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.

Key Elements:

1. **Purpose:**  
   The primary objective is to serve the **public interest**. The Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the federal government) determines that it is in the public interest to remit the tax in question. This may be done to support specific government initiatives, manage fiscal policy, or address economic or operational challenges affecting a department.

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   The power to remit the tax is derived from **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council to make decisions regarding the remission of taxes when it is deemed in the public interest. This provision provides a statutory basis for discretionary tax relief, especially in cases involving government departments.

3. **Scope of Application:**  
   The remission applies specifically to **taxes payable by a department** under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.  
   - Part IX of the Excise Tax Act typically governs excise taxes on certain goods and services, such as fuel, tobacco, or alcohol, and may include taxes levied on specific products used in the operations of federal departments.  
   - In this context, the tax in question is likely one that is indirectly borne by government departments—such as excise taxes on fuel or other commodities used in operations—rather than on consumer goods.

4. **Decision-Making Process:**  
   - The decision to remit the tax is **recommended by the Treasury Board**, which is the federal government’s principal policy and administrative body responsible for managing public spending and fiscal responsibility.  
   - The Governor General in Council (as the formal head of the Canadian government) then **acts on this recommendation**, exercising the statutory power under Section 23.

5. **Nature of the Remittance:**  
   The remittance is **not a general tax reduction**, but a **specific and discretionary action** applied to a particular department’s tax liability. It may be used to:
   - Alleviate financial strain on a department during times of crisis or transition.
   - Support strategic government objectives (e.g., environmental initiatives, infrastructure projects).
   - Facilitate operational flexibility in departments that rely heavily on specific goods (e.g., fuel for transportation or machinery).

6. **Public Interest Test:**  
   The regulation emphasizes that the remission must be justified by a determination that it is **in the public interest**. This ensures that such actions are not arbitrary or politically motivated, but are grounded in legitimate policy or fiscal rationale.

7. **Effect:**  
   Upon remission, the department is **exempt from paying or being liable for the excise tax** that would otherwise be due under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act. This results in a direct financial benefit to the department, which may be reinvested in public services or operations.

**Significance and Implications:**

- This regulation reflects the **flexibility within federal fiscal policy** to respond to unique circumstances affecting government departments.
- It underscores the **role of the Treasury Board** in advising on fiscal decisions that impact departmental budgets.
- It demonstrates how **tax policy can be adjusted** not only for individuals or businesses but also for government operations when public interest is at stake.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation authorizes the federal government, through the Governor General in Council and on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, to **cancel or remit excise taxes payable by a federal department under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, provided that such a remission is in the public interest. It is a discretionary, policy-driven tool used to support departmental operations and broader public goals, grounded in statutory authority and fiscal accountability.
