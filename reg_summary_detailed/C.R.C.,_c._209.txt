### **Minimum Price Requirement**

- **No person may sell or offer to sell** a greenhouse vegetable product, nor **buy** it, at a price **below** the **minimum price** set periodically by the Commodity Board.
- The minimum price is determined based on market conditions and is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect fair value and industry standards.

---

### **Prohibited Practices in Pricing and Transactions**

No person may engage in any of the following transactions involving greenhouse vegetables:

1. **Commission or Consignment Sales**  
   - No sales on commission or consignment (i.e., selling goods on behalf of another without ownership or full payment).

2. **Combined Pricing**  
   - No pricing of greenhouse vegetables in combination with other commodities at a combined price or at a price not reflective of the individual market values of those commodities.

3. **Contingent or Conditional Transactions**  
   - No sale, offer to sell, or purchase may be:
     - Contingent upon or simultaneous with a gift or sale of anything of value (e.g., free items, discounts, promotional offers);
     - Conditional upon a rebate, refund, or any form of financial incentive.

> These provisions aim to prevent manipulation, underpricing, or misleading pricing structures that could distort market fairness.

---

### **Transportation Costs**

- **No shipper may pay for or include** transportation costs in the pricing of the product **except** for the movement of the product **from the producer’s premises to the shipper’s premises**.
- All other transportation (e.g., from shipper to destination, interprovincial delivery, export shipping) is excluded from the transaction price and must not be factored into the payment to the producer.

> This ensures that transportation costs are not passed on to producers in a way that distorts pricing equity.

---

### **Payment Obligations to Producers**

Every shipper must pay the producer **within 21 days** of receiving the product, an amount **not less than** the minimum price set by the Commodity Board, **after deducting only the following authorized costs**:

1. **Service Charge** – Imposed by the Commodity Board for administrative and operational support.
2. **Appointed Shipper Remuneration** – As fixed by the Commodity Board (e.g., fees for services provided by appointed shippers).
3. **Central Packing Charges** – If the product is delivered in bulk and centrally packed by the shipper prior to shipment.
4. **Valid Compensation Claims** – Only if:
   - The claim is substantiated by the claimant;
   - Approved in writing by the Commodity Board.
5. **Outstanding Supplier Debts** – Any amount owed by the producer to the shipper for supplies purchased from them.

> This ensures that producers receive a fair, predictable, and transparent payment structure while allowing for legitimate operational costs.

---

### **Receipt Requirements**

- **No shipper may require a producer to provide a receipt or similar document** before paying the producer as required under Section 8.
- This protects producers from being forced into documentation requirements that could delay or hinder timely payments.
