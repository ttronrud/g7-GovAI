### **Detailed Summary of the Guidelines Respecting Control in Fact for the Purpose of Section 377.2 of the Bank Act**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These **Guidelines Respecting Control in Fact** were issued by the **Minister of Finance** under **subsection 3(5)a of the Bank Act**, as authorized by **Section 1897(2)** of **S.C. 2010, c. 12 (Jobs and Economic Growth Act)**, and are based on the existing framework of the **Bank Act (S.C. 1991, c. 46)**.

- The guidelines were **adopted on December 7, 2012**, and came into force on the date that **subsection 1897(2)** of the Jobs and Economic Growth Act came into force. If registered later, they would take effect upon registration.
- **Reference to SI/2012-99** confirms that these guidelines were officially published and registered on **December 19, 2012**.

#### **2. Purpose of the Guidelines**

The primary purpose of these guidelines is to **determine whether an acquisition** (as defined in Section 373 of the Bank Act) would result in **"control in fact"** over a **federal credit union**, as defined under **paragraph 3(1)(d) of the Bank Act**.

This determination is critical because **Section 377.2** of the Bank Act prohibits the Minister from approving an acquisition that would give a person **control in fact** of a federal credit union — unless such control is consistent with the **policy objectives** of the Act.

Thus, the guidelines provide a **structured, transparent, and objective framework** for assessing whether an acquisition would lead to de facto control, with a focus on preserving the **cooperative and member-driven nature** of federal credit unions.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the guidelines:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Bank Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 46).
- **Applicant**: The entity or individual seeking approval to acquire a stake in a federal credit union under **Section 373** of the Act.
- **Senior Officer**: Defined as per **Section 485.1 of the Bank Act**, meaning a senior executive or officer of a financial institution with significant authority in governance or operations.

---

#### **4. Policy Objectives (Mandatory Considerations)**

When assessing whether an acquisition would result in control in fact, the Minister must consider the following **core policy objectives** outlined in **Section 4 of the Bank Act**:

1. **Preservation of Cooperative Ownership Benefits**  
   - Maintain the **cooperative structure** of federal credit unions, ensuring operations remain focused on member interests rather than investor profit.
   - Ensure **high transparency** and **member/shareholder oversight**.
   - Prevent **distortions in credit allocation** due to undue influence from investors.
   - Enhance the **safety and soundness** of federal credit unions by preserving their independence and stability.

2. **Autonomy in Day-to-Day Management**  
   - Allow federal credit unions to manage their **day-to-day operations** and **strategic planning** based on the **best interests of the institution as a whole**, not individual members, shareholders, or external parties.

3. **Investor Rights and Accountability**  
   - Enable investors to exercise a **reasonable degree of influence** over the credit union.
   - Allow investors to use the **equity accounting method** under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which ensures accurate financial reporting and reflects ownership interests.

> These objectives are central to the Minister’s decision-making process and must be balanced against any potential risks of control.

#### **6. Legal and Practical Implications**
