**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Soya-Bean Order**

---

### **Overview**
The *Ontario Soya-Bean Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, under **Section 2 of the Farm Products Marketing Act (Ontario)**. This Order grants authority to regulate the **interprovincial and export marketing of soya-beans produced in Ontario**.

The Order may be cited as the *Ontario Soya-Bean Order* and establishes a legal framework to ensure fair, orderly, and sustainable marketing of Ontario-produced soya-beans in both domestic and international markets.

---

### **Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms to clarify scope and application:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi), the enabling legislation that provides the legal basis for this Order and other marketing regulations.
  
- **Board**: The *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (Régie), a provincial body responsible for overseeing the marketing of agricultural products, including soya-beans, across Ontario.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Ontario Soya-Bean Growers’ Marketing Board* (Office), a specialized body established under the Act to manage the marketing of soya-beans specifically. It is directly responsible for the regulation of soya-beans in interprovincial and export trade.

- **Plan**: Any marketing plan established and amended over time under the Farm Products Marketing Act and any related regulations. The Plan sets out rules and procedures for the marketing, pricing, and distribution of soya-beans.

- **Producer**: A person engaged in the actual production of soya-beans within the Province of Ontario.

- **Soya-beans**: Refers specifically to soya-beans grown and produced in Ontario.

### **Regulatory Authority**

#### 1. **Marketing Regulation Powers**
Both the **Farm Products Marketing Board (Board)** and the **Ontario Soya-Bean Growers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** are granted **authority to regulate the marketing of soya-beans in interprovincial and export trade**.

This includes the power to:
- Apply the same powers they have over **local marketing** of soya-beans within Ontario (as defined in the Farm Products Marketing Act and the Plan).
- Exercise authority over **persons and property located within Ontario** involved in the interprovincial or export trade of soya-beans.

This ensures consistency between local and broader market operations, allowing the Boards to maintain control over pricing, quality standards, and market access.

#### 2. **Levies and Charges – Authority of the Commodity Board**

A key provision grants the **Commodity Board** specific powers to:
- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from producers and marketers of soya-beans operating in Ontario.
- Classify producers into **different groups** (e.g., based on farm size, region, production volume, or other criteria).
- Set **different levies or charges** for each group, depending on their classification.

These levies are not arbitrary; they are designed to:
- Support the financial stability of the soya-bean industry.
- Fund operational expenses and losses arising from sales or disposal of soya-beans.
- Create **reserves** (financial buffers) to manage market volatility.
- Facilitate **equalization or adjustment** of income among producers.

In other words, if some producers benefit from higher market prices during a good year, the Commodity Board may use the collected levies to redistribute funds to those who experienced lower returns (e.g., due to poor harvests or low market prices), promoting equity in income distribution.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **Stabilize Market Prices**: By establishing a structured marketing system, the Order helps prevent price swings that could harm farmers during downturns.

2. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: It provides a mechanism for equitable access to markets and fair compensation for producers.

3. **Support Producer Sustainability**: Funds collected through levies are used to cover losses, manage risk, and support long-term agricultural viability.

4. **Promote Ontario’s Export Competitiveness**: By regulating export trade, the Order helps ensure Ontario soya-beans meet quality and compliance standards required by international buyers.

5. **Maintain Producers’ Interests**: The Commodity Board acts as a representative body for growers, protecting their interests in the broader market.

---

### **Legal Basis and Enforcement**

- The Order is enacted under **Section 2 of the Farm Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to make regulations for the marketing of agricultural products.
- The regulatory framework is **aligned with the Plan**, which governs how soya-beans are marketed, priced, and distributed.
- The Commodity Board has the authority to issue **specific orders** (e.g., levies, classifications, adjustments) that are legally binding on producers and marketers within Ontario.
