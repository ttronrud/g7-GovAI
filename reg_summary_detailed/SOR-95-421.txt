## **Detailed Summary of the Nordion and Theratronics Employees Pension Protection Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Enactment**
- **Enacted by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board.
- **Authority:** Pursuant to **subsections 9(3)** and **(4)** of the *Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act*.
- **Statutory Citation:**  
  - S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 90  
  - S.C. 1990, c. 4  
- **Regulation Title:** *Nordion and Theratronics Employees Pension Protection Regulations*  
- **Effective Date:** **November 9, 1991** (deemed to have come into force)

> This regulation was created to address pension rights and protections for employees of **Nordion International Inc.** and **Theratronics International Limited** during and after the divestiture of these companies from the federal government.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary objective is to **protect the pension rights of employees** of Nordion and Theratronics who were formerly part of the federal public service, particularly in the context of the government’s decision to divest ownership of these companies.

The regulations ensure that:
- Pension benefits are calculated under the **Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)** and its regulations **only if certain conditions are met**.
- Special rules apply to **spouses and children** of employees who became spouses or stepchildren after the disposal of company shares.
- Employees who exercised pension options based on **erroneous or misleading advice** from public service officials are protected from being penalized.

---

### **3. Application of the Public Service Superannuation Act**

#### **General Rule:**
> Subject to **Sections 3 and 4**, the *Public Service Superannuation Act* and its associated regulations **apply to a person who has made an election under paragraph 9(1)(d)** of the *Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act* **before May 1, 1998**.

This means:
- Employees who elected to have the **provisions of these Regulations apply** (i.e., to protect their pension rights) prior to May 1, 1998, are governed by the PSSA **as modified by these Regulations**.
- This provides a clear **transition mechanism** for employees to opt into a more favorable pension treatment.

---

### **4. Exemption from Key PSSA Provisions**

Certain provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act **do not apply** to specific beneficiaries of Nordion or Theratronics employees — specifically:

#### **(a) Surviving Spouses**
- A **surviving spouse** of an employee of Nordion or Theratronics **is not entitled to benefits** under the PSSA **if**:
  - The marriage or common-law relationship began **on or after the date** when shares in the company were first sold or otherwise disposed of.
- **Exception:** If the employee **re-entered** the Public Service as a contributor under the PSSA, then the spouse **is entitled** to benefits under the Act.

#### **(b) Children**
- A **child** (biological, adopted, or stepchild) of an employee is **not entitled** to benefits under the PSSA **if**:
  - The child was **conceived, adopted, or became a stepchild** on or after the date of the first disposal of company shares.
- **Exception:** If the employee again became a contributor under the PSSA, the child may be entitled to benefits.

> 🔍 **Key Implication:** These exemptions **limit pension entitlements for dependents** who came into existence after the divestiture, effectively protecting the government from long-term pension obligations for new dependents formed post-sale.

---

### **5. Definition of Key Dates and Service Periods**

These regulations redefine key dates and service periods in the PSSA to reflect the unique circumstances of employees at Nordion and Theratronics.

#### **(a) Year of Leaving Public Service**
> In the PSSA, the year in which a person ceases to be employed in the Public Service is **redefined** as:
> - The year in which the person **ceased to be employed by Nordion or Theratronics**, as applicable.

#### **(b) Pensionable Service and Service Periods**
> For employees of Nordion or Theratronics:
- The **number of years of pensionable service** and **service** includes:
  - Any period of service **after** the day following the first disposal of shares, **and before** the day the employee ceases employment.
- This means that service **after the disposal date** is **included** in pension calculations — a significant point because it ensures continuity of service in pension eligibility.

#### **(c) Retirement Year/Month**
> The **retirement year or month** of an employee is defined as:
> - The year or month in which the **shares of Nordion or Theratronics were first sold or otherwise disposed of**.

> This is a **critical shift** from traditional retirement dates based on employment end dates. It ties retirement eligibility directly to the **divestiture date**, not the employee’s last day of work.

---

### **6. Nullification of Pension Options (Section 12 or 13 of PSSA)**

#### **Situation:**
An employee of **Nordion** who:
1. Meets the criteria in **paragraphs 9(1)(a) or (d)** of the Divestiture Authorization Act;
2. Ceased employment by Nordion **and exercised a pension option** (under section 12 or 13 of the PSSA) **on or after ceasing employment but before the publication of these Regulations in the Canada Gazette**;
3. Acted upon **erroneous or misleading advice** from a person employed in the Public Service (whose duty included advising on pension options), which led them to believe that exercising the option would **not disentitle them** from making an election under these Regulations;

➡️ Then, **the option is deemed null and void**.

#### **Consequence:**
- The employee is **entitled to benefits** under these Regulations as if the option had **never been exercised**.
- The pension is determined **as if the employee had made the election under these Regulations** on the day they exercised the option.
- This provides **procedural fairness and protection** against poor advice or errors in public service guidance.

> ⚖️ This provision is a **safeguard against exploitation or misrepresentation** in pension planning, especially in a transitional period following corporate divestiture.

### **7. Key Legal and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Service continuity** | Employees who worked after the disposal date are counted in pensionable service — enhancing pension entitlements. |
| **Retirement date alignment** | Retirement is tied to the disposal date, not the last day of employment — potentially leading to earlier retirement eligibility. |
| **Spouse/child benefits** | New dependents formed after disposal are excluded from benefits — reducing long-term liabilities. |
| **Option nullification** | Employees misled by public service advice can recover benefits under the new rules — promotes equity and transparency. |
| **Election window** | Employees must make an election **before May 1, 1998**, to benefit from these protections. |

### **8. Scope and Limitations**

- Applies **only** to employees of **Nordion International Inc.** and **Theratronics International Limited**.
- Applies **only** to those who made an election under **paragraph 9(1)(d)** of the Divestiture Authorization Act **before May 1, 1998**.
- Does **not apply retroactively** beyond the specified date.

### **9. Historical and Policy Context**
