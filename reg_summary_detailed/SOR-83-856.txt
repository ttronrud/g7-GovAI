**Detailed Summary of the Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1983, No. 1**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**. It is formally promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This means the decision is not made unilaterally by the Governor General but is based on a recommendation from the federal Minister responsible for Indigenous affairs and northern development.

The Order is officially titled:  
**"Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1983, No. 1"**  
and serves as a legal instrument to modify or remove a specific restriction on land ownership in the Northwest Territories.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **waive the reservation to the Crown** with respect to a specified parcel of territorial land.  

Under paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act, the Crown (the federal government) is generally entitled to a reservation of certain lands — meaning those lands remain under Crown ownership and cannot be freely transferred or sold to private individuals or entities. This Order removes that reservation for a specific parcel, thereby allowing the land to be legally granted or transferred without being held in reserve by the Crown.

**3. Scope of the Waiver**  
The waiver applies **only to a specific parcel of unsurveyed land** located in the **Northwest Territories**, specifically:

- **Adjoining the easterly boundary of Lot 925, Group 964**  
- Located in the **City of Yellowknife**  
- As shown on a **plan of survey of record number 57843** in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**  
- A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at Yellowknife**, under reference number **796**  
- The parcel is also clearly marked and outlined in **red** on a **sketch plan of record file 18-1-61**, held in the **Land Management Division of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development at Ottawa**

---

**4. Size and Description of the Land**  
The parcel in question is described as:

- Approximately **0.36 hectares (0.94 acres)**  
- The measurement is approximate ("more or less"), indicating that the exact area may vary slightly due to surveying limitations or natural boundaries.

This parcel is **unsurveyed**, meaning it has not been formally surveyed or officially mapped in the traditional sense, but its boundaries are defined through reference to an existing surveyed lot and a sketch plan. The use of a sketch plan (file 18-1-61) suggests that the land’s location is established through historical or administrative records, even if not fully detailed in formal survey terms.

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- By waiving the Crown reservation, the land is now **free from Crown ownership restrictions** and can be legally transferred, developed, or granted to individuals, corporations, or Indigenous communities, depending on applicable laws.  
- This action reflects a shift in land governance policy — allowing for more flexibility in land use and transfer, particularly in areas where development, infrastructure, or Indigenous land use planning may require access to specific parcels.  
- The Order is a **federal regulatory instrument**, binding under Canadian land law and applicable to land title and registration in the Northwest Territories.

---

**6. Context and Implications**  
This waiver likely occurred during a period of increased land use planning and development in the Northwest Territories, particularly in Yellowknife, which is a major urban and economic center. It may have been part of broader efforts to:

- Facilitate infrastructure development  
- Support private or Indigenous land use initiatives  
- Resolve land tenure issues in areas with historical or administrative ambiguity  

It is also noteworthy that the land is described in relation to a **specific lot and group**, indicating it is part of a larger landholding system used in territorial land administration.

---

**7. Record-Keeping and Enforcement**  
- The Order is officially filed in both the **Canada Lands Surveys Records (Ottawa)** and the **Land Titles Office in Yellowknife**, ensuring transparency and legal traceability.  
- The reference to the sketch plan (file 18-1-61) ensures that the land’s boundaries and location are documented and accessible to land administrators, surveyors, and legal authorities.

**Conclusion**  
The *Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1983, No. 1* is a targeted legal instrument that removes a Crown reservation on a small, unsurveyed parcel of land in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. By doing so, it allows for the potential transfer or development of the land, which is approximately 0.36 hectares. The Order is grounded in statutory authority, supported by official survey and land records, and reflects a practical step in land administration and use planning in Canada’s northern territories. It is a significant but limited action, focused on a single parcel, and serves as a precedent for future land use decisions under the Territorial Lands Act.
