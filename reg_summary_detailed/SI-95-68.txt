**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Mohawk Council of Akwesasne Sewage Treatment Plant Remission Order**

---

**Regulatory Title:**  
*Mohawk Council of Akwesasne Sewage Treatment Plant Remission Order*  
**Reference:** S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
**Citation:** This Order may be cited as the *Mohawk Council of Akwesasne Sewage Treatment Plant Remission Order*.

---

**Background and Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2) of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) to grant remissions of taxes when it is in the public interest. This power is exercised in the context of correcting errors in tax payments, particularly where such errors result in undue financial burden on a public or Indigenous entity.

The decision to issue this remission is based on the determination that it is in the **public interest** to correct a tax payment error involving sales tax on certain goods used in a public infrastructure project.

---

**Nature of the Error:**  
The error pertains to **sales tax** under the *Excise Tax Act*, which was incorrectly levied on **certain system goods** purchased between **September 1, 1990, and December 31, 1990**. These goods were used in the construction of a **sewage treatment plant at St. Régis, Quebec**, on behalf of the **Mohawk Council of Akwesasne**.

The tax was paid in error — meaning it was not legally due — and the amount in question is now being formally remitted.

---

**Amount of Remission:**  
The government grants a **remission of $47,170.02**, which represents the **corrected amount of sales tax** that was improperly paid by the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne.

---

**Conditions for Remission:**  
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to a specific procedural condition:

- The **Mohawk Council of Akwesasne must formally make a claim for remission** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- This claim must be submitted **within two years** of the date the Order is made.

> *Note:* This two-year deadline is a critical administrative requirement. Failure to meet this deadline will result in the loss of the right to claim the remission.

---

**Purpose and Public Interest Justification:**  
The Order is grounded in the principle of **correcting an erroneous tax liability** in a way that supports **public accountability and fairness**, particularly in infrastructure projects involving Indigenous communities. The sewage treatment plant is a public service project that benefits the community of Akwesasne, and the remission ensures that the financial burden of an administrative error does not unfairly impact a community already engaged in critical environmental and health improvements.

The decision reflects a recognition of the importance of **supporting Indigenous-led infrastructure development** through equitable tax treatment and administrative fairness.

---

**Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
- This Order is a **specific, targeted remission** under a general power granted by federal legislation.
- It demonstrates how the federal government can apply its tax authority to correct mistakes in the collection of sales tax on goods used in public works.
- It sets a precedent for future cases involving Indigenous communities and infrastructure projects where tax errors may occur due to classification or administrative misjudgment.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a formal, legally binding mechanism for the **remission of $47,170.02** in incorrectly paid sales tax on system goods used in a sewage treatment plant project in St. Régis, Quebec. It is issued in the public interest, with a clear condition that the claim must be made within two years of the Order’s issuance. The Order underscores the government’s commitment to fairness, accuracy, and support for Indigenous communities in public infrastructure development.
