**Detailed Summary of the Going-Private Transaction (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Going-Private Transaction (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This regulatory action is grounded in specific provisions of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (the "Act").

- **Section 2** of the Act defines the term *"going-private transaction"*.
- **Subsection 531(1)b** of the Act provides the statutory authority for the regulation of such transactions.
- The regulations are therefore a **detailed operationalization** of the definition of a "going-private transaction" as defined in the Act, specifically to clarify when such a transaction constitutes a violation of investor protections.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and restrict certain types of corporate transactions** that could result in the **loss of rights** held by shareholders—particularly those holding *participating securities*—without their consent or adequate compensation.

Specifically, the regulations aim to:

- Prevent transactions that effectively eliminate or terminate the rights of participating security holders.
- Ensure that any such transaction does not unfairly deprive investors of their rights to share in earnings or residual assets.
- Protect investors by requiring either:
  - The **consent of the security holder**, or
  - The **substitution of a similar or equivalent interest** in participating securities (either in the same company or in a successor company that continues the business).

### **3. Definition of a "Going-Private Transaction"**

Under the regulations, a **going-private transaction** is defined as:

> *"An amalgamation or other transaction involving a distributing company, other than an acquisition of shares under section 289 of the Act, that results in the interest of a holder of participating securities of the company being terminated without the consent of the holder and without the substitution of an interest of equivalent value in participating securities of the company or of another company that succeeds to the business of the company, which participating securities have rights and privileges that are equal to or greater than the affected participating securities."*

#### Key Elements of This Definition:

| Element | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Amalgamation or other transaction** | Includes mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, or any corporate reorganization involving a "distributing company." |
| **Exclusion of section 289 acquisitions** | Transactions involving the purchase of shares under **section 289 of the Act** are **excluded** from this definition. This suggests that share purchases by third parties are not considered going-private transactions under this rule. |
| **Termination of interest** | The rights of a holder of participating securities must be **ended or extinguished** as a result of the transaction. |
| **Without consent of the holder** | The transaction must occur **without the express or implied consent** of the security holder. |
| **Without substitution of equivalent interest** | The rights of the holder must **not be replaced** by a new interest of **equivalent value** in: <br> - Participating securities of the same company, or <br> - Participating securities of another company that **succeeds to the business** of the original company. |
| **Participating securities must have rights equal to or greater than the affected securities** | The securities at issue must have rights that are **at least as favorable** as those of the securities being affected. This ensures that the transaction does not disproportionately disadvantage investors with strong rights (e.g., preferential dividends, priority in liquidation). |

### **4. Definition of "Participating Securities"**

The regulations define **participating securities** as:

> *"Securities of a company that give the holder of the securities a right to share in the earnings of the company and, after the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, a right to share in its assets."*

#### Key Features:

- **Earnings participation**: Holders receive a share of profits (e.g., dividends or distributions).
- **Residual asset rights**: In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders have a claim to a portion of the company’s remaining assets.
- This includes **preferred shares**, **common shares**, or any other class of security that entitles the holder to share in profits and assets.

> Note: The term excludes securities with limited or no participation rights (e.g., debt instruments like bonds), which do not qualify as "participating securities."

### **5. Regulatory Effect and Enforceability**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., upon official publication in the *Canada Gazette*).
- They are binding on all trust and loan companies operating under the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.
- The rules apply to **any transaction** that meets the criteria of a going-private transaction, regardless of whether it is initiated by the company or through a third-party deal.

---

### **6. Legal Context and Historical Background**

- The regulations were first introduced in **1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 45)** and amended in **2005 (S.C. 2005, c. 54)**.
- The 2005 amendments (specifically **section 368(2)** and **section 449**) reflect updates to the regulatory framework to better align with modern corporate practices and investor protection standards.
- The 1991 version established the foundational definition, while the 2005 amendments refined the scope and clarified the conditions under which a transaction would be deemed a going-private transaction.

### **7. Investor Protection Implications**

The regulations serve as a **critical safeguard** for shareholders, particularly those holding participating securities with strong rights. By requiring either:

- **Consent of the holder**, or  
- **Substitution of an equivalent interest** in a successor company,

the regulations ensure that investors are not unfairly deprived of their rights in a corporate reorganization.

This prevents scenarios where a company might restructure or merge in a way that:

- Eliminates dividend rights,
- Reduces priority in liquidation,
- Or removes participation in earnings—especially if those rights are superior to those of other shareholders.

---

### **8. Practical Application**

A transaction would be considered a **going-private transaction** and thus subject to these regulations if:

1. A trust or loan company engages in a merger, amalgamation, or other transaction;
2. The transaction results in the **termination of participating securities**;
3. The holder of those securities **does not consent** to the transaction;
4. **No equivalent participation interest** is provided in the new or successor entity;
5. The affected securities had rights **equal to or greater** than those of the securities involved in the transaction.

Example:
- A trust company merges with another company and issues new shares to its shareholders.
- The old common shares (which gave holders a right to share in profits and assets) are terminated.
- The new shares do not offer the same level of earnings participation or asset rights.
- The shareholders did not consent to the change.
→ This would constitute a going-private transaction under the regulations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Going-Private Transaction (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* are a vital component of investor protection within the Canadian financial regulatory framework. By clearly defining when a corporate transaction constitutes a going-private transaction—particularly when it terminates the rights of participating security holders without consent or adequate substitution—the regulations ensure that:

- Shareholders are treated fairly,
- Corporate restructurings do not unfairly disadvantage investors,
- The rights enshrined in participating securities (especially those with superior rights) are preserved.

These regulations reinforce the principle that **investor rights are not automatically forfeited** in corporate reorganizations and must be protected through transparency, consent, or equitable substitution.

**Final Note**: These regulations are part of a broader regulatory environment designed to maintain public confidence in trust and loan companies and to ensure fair and transparent corporate governance.
