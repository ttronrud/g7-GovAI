**Detailed Summary of the *Domestic Bonds of Canada Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Domestic Bonds of Canada Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes the rules governing the issuance, registration, transfer, and management of domestic bonds issued by or on behalf of the Government of Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Bank"**: Refers to the **Bank of Canada**, which acts as the official registrar and custodian of domestic bonds.
- **"Bond"**: Has the same meaning as "security" under the *Financial Administration Act*. This includes government-issued debt instruments such as bonds, notes, or debentures.
- **"Registered owner"**:
  - *As to principal*: A person whose name is entered in the Bank’s register as the person to whom the principal amount of the bond is payable.
  - *As to principal and interest*: A person whose name is entered in the register as the person to whom both principal and interest are payable.
- These definitions establish the legal basis for ownership and entitlement to payments.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These Regulations apply to **all domestic bonds** issued by the Government of Canada, **except where they conflict with the specific terms of the bond itself**. This means that any provision in the bond that contradicts these regulations will prevail.

---

### **4. Role of the Bank of Canada**
The **Bank of Canada** is responsible for:
- Maintaining a **central register of bonds**.
- Registering bonds (issuing or transferring ownership).
- Discharging registration and processing transfers.
- Issuing bonds as needed to fulfill obligations or comply with the terms of existing bonds.

This role is **not limited to administrative functions**—it includes the authority to issue bonds in accordance with the terms of the original issuance or these regulations.

---

### **5. Continuity of Authority**
Any powers, duties, or discretions previously conferred on the **Deputy Minister of Finance** by **Order in Council P.C. 5938 (October 25, 1940)** remain valid and effective when exercised by the **Bank of Canada** as registrar. This ensures legal continuity and prevents a gap in authority during administrative transitions.

All actions taken by the Bank in compliance with these Regulations are **valid and binding** for all purposes, as if they had been carried out by the Deputy Minister.

---

### **6. Authorization of Third Parties**
The Bank may **authorize individuals or entities** (including corporations) to act on its behalf in connection with bond registration or transfers. In the case of a corporation, its **appropriate officers or employees** are deemed authorized to act on behalf of the Bank.

---

### **7. Registration of Ownership**
When a person is to be registered as owner:
- **As to principal**: The Bank enters the bond’s particulars and the name of the person to whom the principal is payable.
- **As to principal and interest**: The Bank enters the bond’s particulars and the **name and post office address** of the person to whom both principal and interest are payable.

If **two or more persons** are registered as owners (as to principal and interest), only **one address** is entered in the register—this is considered the **registered address of all** for all purposes related to the bond.

---

### **8. Conclusiveness of Register Entries**
- An entry in the register of a person as owner of a bond (as to principal or principal and interest) is **conclusive evidence against the Government of Canada** that the person is the rightful owner, **unless otherwise provided** in the Regulations.

> This gives significant legal weight to the register, protecting the registered owner’s rights against the Government.

---

### **9. Payment of Interest**
- Interest on a bond registered as to principal and interest is payable by **cheque** issued by the Bank and negotiable at any branch of a **bank incorporated under the Bank Act** in Canada.

---

### **10. Survivorship and Death of Owners**
- If two or more persons are registered as owners (without the phrase “and survivor”), and one dies, **no survivorship rights** pass to the others. The death of one does not automatically transfer ownership.
- This is a critical limitation on the concept of joint tenancy or survivorship in bond ownership.

---

### **11. Bearer Coupons and Transferability**
- Even if a bond is registered as to principal, the **coupons attached to it remain payable to bearer**.
- These coupons are **transferable by delivery** (i.e., physical handing over), regardless of registration status.

> This creates a dual system: the registered owner has rights to principal and interest, but the coupons retain bearer status, allowing for informal transfers.

---

### **12. Validity Despite Errors or Forgery**
Despite errors or forgery, an issue or registration of a bond is **deemed valid** if:
- It occurs in error but is not authorized by these Regulations; or
- It is based on a forged instrument (e.g., forged signature of transferor or forged power of attorney).

> However, **this does not affect the rights or liabilities of any person** due to the forgery. The validity of the bond is preserved, but the forgery remains a legal issue.

---

### **13. Liability for Unauthorized or Erroneous Issuance**
If a bond is issued or registered in error (without authorization):
- The person who receives it or is registered as owner **is not entitled to any payment** from the Government of Canada.
- They must **return the bond and all attached coupons** at the time of receipt.
- If they fail to return it, they are liable to:
  - Pay the **market value** of the bond to the Bank; and
  - Pay interest on any amounts already paid to them.

> This imposes a strict duty of return and financial liability on recipients of improperly issued bonds.

---

### **14. Maturity Coupons and Redemption**
- If a person fails to return **matured coupons**, they are **deemed to have received payment of the redemption value** of those coupons.
- This protects the Bank from claims for redemption of coupons not returned.

---

### **15. Entry of Owner’s Name in the Bond**
- Upon registration, the Bank must enter the name of the registered owner in the bond itself:
  - As to principal → name of person to whom principal is payable.
  - As to principal and interest → name of person to whom both are payable.

> This ensures that the bond document reflects the official ownership.

---

### **16. Effectiveness of Non-Bank Entries**
- Any entry of a person’s name in the bond made by someone **other than the Bank is not effective** to confer any right or interest in the bond.
- Similarly, **no alteration or erasure** of a name entered by the Bank confers rights on others or removes rights from the original owner.

> This protects the integrity of the register and prevents unauthorized modifications.

---

### **17. Acceptance of Bond Without Registration**
- If a person applies to be registered as owner and the bond is delivered to them **without their name being entered in the bond**, the bond is **deemed validly issued**.
- The person **accepts the bond in satisfaction of their rights** unless they return it to the Bank to have their name entered.
- If not returned, the **entry in the register is cancelled**.

> This provides a practical mechanism for acceptance of bonds before formal registration.

---

### **18. Transfer of Registered Bonds**
- A registered bond may be transferred **on presentation** of:
  - The bond itself; and
  - An **instrument of transfer** in the form prescribed (Form I in the Schedule).

> The transfer is **only effective** when the Bank makes the appropriate entry in the register.

---

### **19. Requirements for Valid Transfer**
An instrument of transfer may be executed by:
- The registered owner or their **personal representative**;
- A **corporation** by its duly authorized officers, with seal (if applicable);
- A person under a **power of attorney** or **partnership agreement**;
- A duly authorized officer of an **unincorporated association** (not a partnership); or
- A person authorized by law to act on behalf of the owner (e.g., trustee in bankruptcy).

> This broadens access to transfer mechanisms while maintaining legal safeguards.

---

### **20. Guarantee Requirements for Transfer**
The Bank is **not required** to give effect to a transfer unless the signature is **guaranteed** by:
- A bank incorporated under the **Bank Act** or **Quebec Savings Banks Act**; or
- A **financial institution approved** by the Bank.

The Bank may:
- Approve institutions for such guarantees;
- Impose **terms and conditions** (e.g., limits on transaction size);
- Revise or revoke approvals at any time.

> This ensures financial integrity and reduces fraud risk.

---

### **21. Documentation Requirements**
Unless a guarantee is provided, the Bank will not accept a transfer unless:
- A **resolution, power of attorney, partnership agreement, probate, or letters of administration** (or a notarial copy) is deposited with the Bank.

> This ensures that the person acting on behalf of the owner has legitimate authority.

---

### **22. Exceptions to Guarantee Requirement**
The Bank may give effect to a transfer **without a signature guarantee** if:
- The person is known to an executive officer of the Bank in Ottawa and is **vouched for** by that officer;
- The person is an officer of an **insurance company**, and their signature is vouched for by the Department of Insurance and acceptable to the Bank;
- The person is a member of **Her Majesty’s armed forces** and is
