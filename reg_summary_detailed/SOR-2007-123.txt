### **Core Provisions and Legal Effects**

#### **1. Legal Capacity of the Organization**
> *During the relevant period, the Organization shall have in Canada the legal capacity of a body corporate and the privileges and immunities set out in Articles II and III of the Convention.*

- The **Organization (the Parties to the Montreal Protocol and its Secretariat)** is recognized in Canada as a **body corporate** during the relevant period.
- This means it can:
  - Enter into legal agreements,
  - Own property,
  - Be sued or sue others,
  - Hold assets,
  - Conduct business operations in Canada.
- It is granted **privileges and immunities** under **Articles II and III of the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities**, which include:
  - Immunity from legal process (e.g., lawsuits),
  - Immunity from taxation,
  - Immunity from search and seizure,
  - Freedom from interference in its operations.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This status is **temporary**, limited to the relevant period (September 10–24, 2007).

#### **2. Privileges and Immunities for State Representatives**
> *Representatives of member states of the Organization shall have in Canada, to the extent required for their functions, the privileges and immunities set out in Article IV of the Convention.*

- Diplomatic or official representatives of **member countries** participating in the meeting and preparatory meetings are granted **immunities and privileges** under **Article IV** of the UN Convention.
- These include:
  - Immunity from arrest or detention (except for serious crimes),
  - Immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction,
  - Protection from search or seizure,
  - Freedom to conduct official business without interference.
- These rights are **limited to the functions required** in connection with the meeting and preparatory meetings.

> ⚠️ The immunity applies only to acts performed in the **official capacity** of their state and in relation to the Montreal Protocol activities.

---

#### **3. Privileges and Immunities for Experts**
> *Experts performing missions for the Organization shall have in Canada, to the extent required for their functions, the privileges and immunities set out in Article VI of the Convention.*

- Technical experts (e.g., scientists, environmental specialists) engaged by the Organization to support the meeting are granted **immunities and privileges** under **Article VI** of the Convention.
- This includes:
  - Immunity from legal proceedings related to their official duties,
  - Protection from interference in their work,
  - Immunity from liability for actions taken in the course of their mission.
- These privileges are **only applicable to the extent necessary** for their participation in the meeting and preparatory meetings.

> ⚠️ The experts must have their identities formally communicated to the Government of Canada by the Organization for these rights to apply.

---

#### **4. Exclusion of Tax Liability**
> *The privileges and immunities referred to in section 2 do not apply to Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada in respect of liability for taxes or duties imposed by any law in Canada.*

- This is a **critical limitation**:  
  - Even though representatives and experts enjoy immunities, **they are not exempt from Canadian tax obligations**.
  - Canadian citizens or permanent residents **cannot claim tax immunity** for income, property, or other taxable events.
  - This ensures Canada maintains fiscal accountability and revenue collection rights.

> 🔍 Example: An expert from the U.S. attending the meeting may not be subject to Canadian tax on income earned during the mission — but a Canadian citizen working for the Organization would still owe taxes.
