### **Regulation Summary: Order Establishing the Text of a Resolution Providing for the Extension of the Application of Sections 83.28, 83.29, and 83.3 of the Criminal Code**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Justice**.
- It is based on **subsection 83.32(2)a of the Criminal Code** of Canada.
- This provision allows for the establishment of a resolution that extends the application of specific sections of the Criminal Code, particularly in cases involving sentencing or judicial procedures.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- To **formally establish and adopt the text of a parliamentary resolution** that extends the application of **three specific sections** of the *Criminal Code*:
  - **Section 83.28**
  - **Section 83.29**
  - **Section 83.3**
- These sections are typically related to **sentencing provisions**, particularly those concerning **sentencing for crimes involving violence, sexual offences, or other serious offences**, and may include provisions related to **mandatory minimum sentences, sentencing guidelines, or judicial discretion**.

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

| Provision | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Establishment of the Resolution Text** | The Order formally establishes the exact wording (text) of the resolution set out in the **Schedule** attached to the Order. This ensures legal certainty and clarity regarding the content of the resolution. |
| **Effective Date of the Order** | The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Statutes of Canada (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette). This is a standard procedural step to ensure legal enforceability. |
| **Extension of Application** | Pursuant to **subsection 83.32(1)** of the Criminal Code, the application of Sections 83.28, 83.29, and 83.3 is **extended for a period of three years** from the **date the resolution is passed by both Houses of Parliament** (the House of Commons and the Senate). |
| **Effective Date of the Resolution** | The resolution itself comes into force on the **day it is passed by both Houses of Parliament** — not when the Order is made. This means that the extension begins only after parliamentary approval and passage. |

#### **4. Timeline and Sequence of Events**
1. **Parliamentary Passage**: The resolution is introduced, debated, and passed by both the House of Commons and the Senate.
2. **Registration of the Order**: The Governor General in Council issues this Order to formally establish the resolution’s text and set its legal effect.
3. **Effective Date of the Resolution**: The resolution becomes effective **on the day it is passed by Parliament**.
4. **Extension Period Begins**: The three-year extension of the application of the three sections begins on that same day.
5. **Extension Duration**: The extension remains in force for **three years** from the effective date of the resolution.

#### **5. Legal Significance**
- This Order serves as a **formal mechanism** under the Criminal Code to extend the operation of specific sentencing provisions without amending the Code itself.
- It reflects a **pragmatic legislative tool** used when temporary or transitional measures are needed to apply sentencing rules in a particular context (e.g., in response to public safety concerns, changes in judicial practice, or policy shifts).
- The use of a resolution (rather than direct amendment) allows for **greater flexibility and parliamentary oversight**, as the resolution must be passed by both Houses of Parliament.

#### **6. Contextual Background (Implied)**
- The extension of these sections may be motivated by:
  - A need to apply stricter sentencing standards during a period of increased crime.
  - A response to judicial or prosecutorial recommendations.
  - A temporary measure to ensure consistency in sentencing outcomes.
- Sections 83.28, 83.29, and 83.3 are likely related to:
  - **Sentencing discretion** (e.g., allowing judges to impose longer sentences for certain offences).
  - **Mandatory minimums** or **enhancements** for aggravating factors.
  - **Judicial review or appeal procedures** in sentencing.

#### **7. Important Notes**
- The Order **does not amend the Criminal Code** directly but instead **authorizes the application** of existing sections under a parliamentary resolution.
- The **three-year extension** is a temporary measure and will expire unless renewed by another resolution or legislative action.
- The resolution must be **passed by both Houses of Parliament** before the extension takes effect — meaning the Order is only effective *after* parliamentary approval.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **procedural and legislative instrument** that enables the temporary extension of specific sentencing provisions in the *Criminal Code* for a period of three years. It is issued under the authority of subsection 83.32(2)a, following parliamentary approval, and ensures that the extension begins on the day the resolution is passed. The Order provides legal clarity, procedural rigor, and a mechanism for flexible, temporary application of sentencing rules in response to evolving policy or public safety needs.
