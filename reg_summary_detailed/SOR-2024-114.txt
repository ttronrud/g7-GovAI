**Detailed Summary of the Criminal Interest Rate Regulations (S.C. 2023, c. 26, s. 611–612)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Criminal Interest Rate Regulations* are a set of rules made under the authority of the *Criminal Code* of Canada (specifically subsections 347.01(2)a and 347.1(2.1)b) and are designed to clarify when the criminal provisions related to usurious interest rates — particularly under **section 347 of the Criminal Code** — do **not apply** to certain types of borrowing arrangements. These regulations also establish specific limits on the total cost of borrowing in the case of **payday loans**, thereby protecting consumers from excessively high interest and fees.

The regulations were approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, after consultation with the Minister of Finance, and came into force on **January 1, 2025** (as noted in the [Note]).

## **Key Provisions and Explanations**

---

### **1. When Section 347 of the Criminal Code Does NOT Apply (Exemptions for Business or Commercial Borrowing)**

Under **section 347.01(1)** of the *Criminal Code*, the criminal offense of usurious interest (i.e., charging interest exceeding a legal limit) generally applies to agreements involving natural persons (individuals) who borrow money for personal purposes.

However, the regulations provide **exemptions** for **business or commercial borrowing** under the following conditions:

> **The borrower is not a natural person** (i.e., it is a business entity such as a corporation, partnership, or non-profit organization).

> **The borrowing is for a business or commercial purpose.**

> **AND either of the following two conditions is met:**

#### **Option A:**
- The amount of credit advanced is **more than $10,000 but less than or equal to $500,000**, and  
- The **annual percentage rate (APR)** of interest — calculated using **generally accepted actuarial practices and principles** — does **not exceed 48%**.

#### **Option B:**
- The amount of credit advanced is **more than $500,000**, regardless of the interest rate.

> ✅ **Result**: In these cases, **section 347 of the Criminal Code does not apply** — meaning no criminal liability arises for charging interest up to 48% (or even higher, in the case of loans over $500,000).

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This exemption recognizes that businesses often require large-scale financing for operations, and interest rates may be higher than those charged to individuals due to risk, liquidity, or market conditions. It prevents the criminalization of legitimate commercial lending practices.

### **2. Exemption for Pawnbroking-Related Borrowing (Specific to Tangible Personal Property)**

A second exemption applies to **pawnbroking arrangements**, which are common in personal finance but often involve high interest or fees.

> **Conditions**:
- The person receiving interest **carries on a business related to pawnbroking**.
- The credit is advanced **in exchange for the pawning of tangible personal property** (e.g., jewelry, electronics, tools), **but not a vehicle**.
- In the event of the borrower’s default, the **only recourse** of the pawnbroker is the **seizure of the pawned property**.
- The amount of credit advanced is **less than $1,000**.
- The **annual percentage rate (APR)** of interest — calculated using generally accepted actuarial practices — **does not exceed 48%**.

> ✅ **Result**: Under these conditions, **section 347 of the Criminal Code does not apply**.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This recognizes that pawnbroking is a legitimate business activity where the risk of default is mitigated by the collateral (the pawned item). The small loan amount and the clear recourse (seizure of property) justify allowing higher interest rates within a reasonable range, without criminalizing the practice.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This exemption **does not apply to vehicles**, which are excluded from the scope of this provision.

### **3. Limit on Total Cost of Borrowing in Payday Loan Agreements**

Under **paragraph 347.1(2)(a.1)** of the *Criminal Code*, the regulations establish a **maximum total cost of borrowing** for payday loans.

> **Limit**: The total cost of borrowing under a payday loan agreement must not exceed **14% of the amount of money advanced** to the borrower.

> 🔍 **What is the "total cost of borrowing"?**  
This includes:
- Interest charged,
- Fees,
- Penalties,
- Other charges related to the loan.

> ❌ **Exclusions**:
- Any fee, fine, penalty, or charge that is:
  - **Specifically authorized under provincial law** and imposed **for default** (e.g., late payment),
  - OR for **dishonoured cheques or instruments**, **if the amount is $20 or less**.

> ✅ **Result**: Fees for default or dishonoured cheques **under $20** are **not counted** in the 14% cap, providing flexibility for legitimate enforcement mechanisms while protecting consumers from hidden or excessive costs.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This ensures that payday loans — which are often used by low-income individuals — do not carry excessive hidden costs that could amount to usury. The 14% cap is significantly lower than the 48% cap for commercial loans, reflecting the vulnerability of payday borrowers.

---

### **4. Application of Provincial Law**

> **Definition**: "Applicable provincial law" refers to the **provincial legislation** referenced in **subsection 347.1(3)** of the *Criminal Code* that governs payday loans in the province where the agreement is entered into.

> ✅ **Result**: The rules on fees and penalties for default are interpreted in light of **provincial laws** — meaning provinces may have their own rules on what constitutes a valid default fee or penalty, and those rules are considered when determining whether a charge is excluded from the 14% cap.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This allows for **provincial flexibility** while maintaining a national framework to protect consumers from exploitative lending practices.

---

### **5. Coming Into Force**

> The regulations come into force on:
> - The **first day** on which **sections 610 to 612** of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2023, No. 1* are all in force, **or**
> - On the **day of registration** if the regulations are registered after that date.

> ✅ **Effective Date**: **January 1, 2025** (as stated in the note).

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This ensures the regulations are implemented in coordination with broader budget and fiscal measures, and provides a clear timeline for compliance.

## **Summary Table**

| Provision | Key Conditions | Interest/Rate Limit | Exemption or Protection |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Commercial Borrowing** | Borrower is not a natural person; for business use | >$10k–$500k: ≤48% APR; >$500k: any rate | Section 347 does not apply |
| **Pawnbroking Loans** | Business in pawnbroking; property pawned (not vehicles); default recourse = seizure; loan < $1,000 | ≤48% APR | Section 347 does not apply |
| **Payday Loans** | Total cost of borrowing ≤14% of loan amount | 14% cap on total cost | Excludes default fees ≤$20 or authorized provincial fees |
| **Provincial Law** | Applies in province where loan is entered into | Governs default fees and penalties | Ensures provincial consistency and fairness |

## **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Consumer Protection**: Especially in the case of payday loans, the 14% cap protects vulnerable borrowers from predatory lending.
2. **Legitimacy of Business Lending**: Recognizes that commercial borrowers (e.g., businesses, corporations) face different financial risks and may require higher interest rates.
3. **Fairness in Pawnbroking**: Allows legitimate pawnbroking businesses to operate with reasonable interest rates, given the nature of collateral and risk.
4. **Clarity and Legal Certainty**: Provides clear, rule-based exemptions to avoid criminal liability in common, non-personal lending scenarios.
5. **Provincial Flexibility**: Respects provincial jurisdiction in regulating fees and penalties under default.

## **Implications and Considerations**

- **For Lenders**: These regulations create clear boundaries on what constitutes a criminal offense. Lenders in business or pawnbroking sectors can now operate with greater confidence, knowing that interest rates up to 48% are not criminalized under certain conditions.
- **For Borrowers**: Payday loan users are protected from excessive total borrowing costs, especially those with limited financial resources.
- **For Enforcement**: Police and prosecutors will no longer be able to charge someone with usury if the loan meets the exemption criteria — but they can still act if the total cost exceeds 14% in a payday loan or if the conditions of exemption are not met.

## **Conclusion**

The *Criminal Interest Rate Regulations* represent a **balanced and nuanced approach** to the criminalization of high
