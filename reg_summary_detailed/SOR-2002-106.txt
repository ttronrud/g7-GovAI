**Detailed Summary of the Notice of Branch Closure (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Notice of Branch Closure (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations*, made under **subsection 444.1(5)a of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (TCLA)**, establish a comprehensive framework governing how financial institutions in Canada must notify the public, customers, and regulators before closing a retail deposit-taking branch or ceasing operations at such a branch. The regulations aim to ensure **transparency, fairness, and community engagement** during branch closures, particularly in rural areas where access to financial services may be limited.

These regulations were originally enacted in **1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 45)** and amended in **2001 (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 548)** to reflect evolving financial service delivery needs and community concerns.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which provides the legal foundation for regulating trust and loan companies in Canada.

2. **Retail Deposit-Taking Branch**  
   A branch or office where a financial institution:
   - Opens retail deposit accounts through a natural person (i.e., individual customers), and  
   - Disburses cash to customers.  
   This excludes branches that only offer non-deposit financial products or services.

3. **Rural Area**  
   Any territory in Canada located outside an urban area.  
   Defined as areas outside of officially designated urban zones in Statistics Canada’s census dictionary, with a minimum population of **10,000 persons** based on the most recent published census.

4. **Urban Area**  
   A geographic area defined in Statistics Canada’s census dictionary as an urban zone with a **minimum population of 10,000**.

> These definitions are critical for determining the timing and scope of required notices based on geographic location and service availability.

## **General Notice Requirements**

A member company (financial institution) must give **advance notice** to relevant parties before closing a retail deposit-taking branch or ceasing operations under **subsection 444.1(1)** of the TCLA.

### **When is Notice Required?**

Notice is required **only if** the closure is not one of the exempted circumstances listed later in the regulation.

---

## **Timing of Notice to the Commissioner**

The notice must be submitted to the **Commissioner of the Trust and Loan Companies** in writing, with specific deadlines depending on the branch’s location:

| Branch Location | Deadline Before Closure |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| In an **urban area**, OR in a **rural area with a retail branch within 10 km** | **4 months** |
| In a **rural area with no retail branch within 10 km** | **6 months** |

> The 10 km radius is used to assess whether nearby financial services are already available, which helps determine whether the closure will significantly impact community access.

## **Content of the Notice to the Commissioner**

The notice must include the following information:

1. **Location of the branch**  
2. **Proposed closure date**  
3. **Alternative service sites** or a **telephone number** to obtain information about alternative services
