**Detailed Summary of the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada Certificate Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations are issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** (the "Act"), specifically:

- **Section 7.92a, paragraph 8(b)b**, and  
- **Subsection 8.1(4)c** of the Aeronautics Act.

The regulations were promulgated by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, and are formally known as the **Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada Certificate Regulations**.

This regulatory instrument establishes standardized forms and procedures for the issuance of **certificates** by the **Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada (TATC)** in relation to monetary penalties assessed for violations of aviation-related regulations.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Provide **uniform, legally binding forms** for certificates issued by the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada in three distinct procedural contexts:
  1. When a monetary penalty is **assessed and not appealed** (final enforcement action);
  2. When a penalty is **assessed during a proceeding** (initial determination);
  3. When a penalty is **revised upon appeal** (appeal decision).

These forms ensure consistency, transparency, and legal validity in how penalties are documented and certified, thereby supporting accountability and judicial review in aviation regulatory enforcement.

### **5. Procedural Flow and Enforcement**

The certificate process reflects a clear enforcement pathway:

1. **Notice of Penalty** is issued to the contravener (by personal service or certified mail).
2. The contravener has a **specific deadline** to either:
   - Pay the penalty, or  
   - File a request for review with the Tribunal.
3. If no appeal is filed within the deadline:
   - The Tribunal issues a **Schedule 1 certificate**, declaring the contravention and the outstanding penalty.
4. If an appeal is filed:
   - The Tribunal conducts a review.
   - A **Schedule 2 certificate** may be issued initially (if the appeal is denied or the decision is upheld).
   - If the appeal is successful, a **Schedule 3 certificate** is issued with the revised penalty.

---

### **6. Repeal Clause**

- The regulations contain a **repeal clause** indicating that any prior versions of these regulations that are inconsistent with this version are **replaced** by this current version.
- This ensures regulatory clarity and prevents conflicting or outdated provisions from being in effect.

---

### **7. Entry into Force**

- These regulations **come into force on the day of registration** with the Canada Gazette.
- This allows for immediate application upon publication, ensuring timely enforcement and legal certainty.

- **Schedule 1 Certificate**: Signed by the **Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson** of the Tribunal.
- **Schedule 2 Certificate**: Signed by a **Tribunal Member** who made the determination.
- **Schedule 3 Certificate**: Signed by **all members** of the Tribunal who participated in the appeal decision.

The address of the Tribunal is also included, ensuring formal and official documentation.

### **9. Legal Significance and Function**

These certificates serve several critical functions:

- **Legal Documentation**: They provide a formal, court-like record of penalty assessments and enforcement actions.
- **Enforceability**: They are binding on the contravener and can be used in enforcement proceedings, including by the Minister of Transport or the Canadian Aviation Authority (CAA).
