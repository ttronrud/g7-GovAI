**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulatory Title:**  
Regulations Prescribing Capital Assets for the Purpose of the Definition of "Strategic Infrastructure" under the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued by *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the *Minister of Industry*, pursuant to **paragraph 5(a)** of the *Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 9, s. 47). This provision grants the Governor General the authority to make regulations that define or prescribe capital assets relevant to the determination of what constitutes "strategic infrastructure" under the Act.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to clarify and specify which capital assets are considered part of "strategic infrastructure" under **paragraph (f)** of the definition in **section 2** of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act. This ensures that eligible projects and assets can be properly identified and funded under the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund (CSIF), which supports the development of critical infrastructure essential to national economic and security objectives.

### Key Provisions:

#### 1. **Prescribed Capital Assets under Paragraph (f)**  
The regulation explicitly prescribes two categories of capital assets as falling under the definition of "strategic infrastructure" in section 2 of the Act:

**A. Advanced Telecommunications and High-Speed Broadband Infrastructure**  
- This includes modern telecommunications networks and systems designed to deliver high-speed internet and digital connectivity.  
- The inclusion of such infrastructure reflects the government’s recognition of digital infrastructure as a strategic asset vital to economic growth, innovation, remote access to services, and national security.  
- Examples may include fiber-optic networks, next-generation wireless systems (e.g., 5G), data centers, and core network components that support national digital services.

**B. All Infrastructure Situated in Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut (the Territories)**  
- This provision applies to *all* infrastructure located in the three Canadian territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut), *unless* it is already covered under another prescribed category in the definition (e.g., under paragraphs (a) to (e)).  
- This ensures that infrastructure in remote and northern regions — which often faces unique challenges in terms of access, cost, and development — is automatically considered strategic infrastructure.  
- This is a significant inclusion because these territories have historically been underserved in terms of connectivity, transportation, energy, and other critical infrastructure.  
- The provision promotes equitable development and supports the federal government’s commitment to regional equity and inclusion.

### Interpretation Notes:

- The regulation does **not** redefine the broader scope of strategic infrastructure, but rather **adds specificity** to paragraph (f) of the definition in section 2.  
- The definition of "strategic infrastructure" in the Act includes various categories (e.g., transportation, energy, water, etc.), and this regulation supplements those by clearly identifying two key types: advanced telecommunications and territorial infrastructure.  
- The term "capital assets" refers to long-term, fixed assets that are not consumed in the process of generating revenue but are instead used to deliver services or support economic activity over time.

### Effective Date:  
The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication, allowing stakeholders (such as project developers, funding agencies, and regional governments) to begin assessing eligibility under the CSIF framework without delay.

### Significance and Implications:

- **Supports Digital Transformation:** By explicitly including high-speed broadband and advanced telecommunications, the regulation aligns Canada’s infrastructure strategy with global trends in digitalization and the growing importance of connectivity in modern economies.
- **Promotes Northern Development:** The inclusion of all infrastructure in the three territories ensures that remote communities receive targeted support, helping to close the infrastructure gap and improve quality of life, access to services, and economic opportunities.
- **Clarity and Consistency:** Provides clear, legally binding criteria for determining what qualifies as strategic infrastructure, reducing ambiguity in project eligibility and funding decisions.
- **Funding Eligibility:** Projects falling within these prescribed categories may qualify for financing or grants under the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund, enabling investment in critical national infrastructure.

**Conclusion:**  
These regulations play a crucial role in shaping the scope of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund by clearly defining which capital assets are considered strategic. By explicitly including advanced telecommunications and all infrastructure in the territories, the regulation supports both national digital connectivity goals and regional equity, ensuring that underdeveloped and remote areas receive the infrastructure investment they need to thrive. The regulations are a practical and forward-looking addition to Canada’s infrastructure policy framework.
