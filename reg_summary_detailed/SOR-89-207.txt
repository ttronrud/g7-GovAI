**Detailed Summary of the Access to Information Act Extension Order, No. 1**

**1. Purpose and Background**  
This regulation, officially titled the *Access to Information Act Extension Order, No. 1*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. It is made under subsection 4(2) of the *Access to Information Act* (ATIA), which empowers the government to extend or modify the scope of access rights granted under the Act.

The primary objective of this Order is to broaden the scope of who is entitled to request access to government records. Specifically, it extends the right to be given access to records under the control of a government institution — as provided in subsection 4(1) of the ATIA — to individuals and entities that are currently present in Canada but do not fall within the traditional categories of Canadian citizens or permanent residents.

**2. Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Extension of Access Rights**:  
  The right to access government records under subsection 4(1) of the ATIA is now extended to:
  
  1. **Individuals who are present in Canada** but are:
     - Not Canadian citizens;
     - Not permanent residents, as defined under the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA).
  
     This includes, but is not limited to, temporary residents, visitors, students, work permit holders, and other non-permanent or non-citizen individuals who are physically present in Canada.

  2. **Corporations that are present in Canada**.  
     This provision applies to all corporate entities (including foreign-owned or incorporated companies) that have a physical presence or operational activity within Canada.

- **Scope of Records Covered**:  
  The extension applies to all records held by government institutions — such as federal, provincial, or municipal agencies — that are subject to the Access to Information Act. This includes documents, data files, correspondence, financial records, and other information maintained by public bodies.

- **No Requirement for Citizenship or Permanent Residency**:  
  The Order explicitly removes the previous requirement that applicants must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents to request access to government records. This ensures that individuals and organizations with temporary or non-resident status can still exercise their right to access information held by government institutions.

**3. Legal Basis**  
The Order is grounded in subsection 4(2) of the *Access to Information Act*, which authorizes the Governor in Council to extend the scope of access rights under subsection 4(1) when it is in the public interest or necessary to ensure transparency and accountability in government operations.

This provision allows for flexibility in interpreting who qualifies as a "person entitled to access" under the Act, particularly in a diverse and globalized society where many individuals and organizations operate temporarily or cross-border in Canada.

**4. Implications and Significance**

- **Enhanced Transparency and Accountability**:  
  By including non-citizens and non-residents, the Order strengthens public access to government information, promoting transparency and enabling individuals and entities to verify the actions, decisions, and policies of public institutions.

- **Support for International Engagement**:  
  Foreign nationals, researchers, journalists, and international organizations operating in Canada can now request access to relevant government records, facilitating informed public discourse and international cooperation.

- **Support for Business and Economic Activity**:  
  Foreign corporations operating in Canada can access records related to permits, regulations, licensing, or compliance, which supports fair and transparent business practices and enhances investor confidence.

- **Alignment with Canadian Values of Inclusivity and Open Government**:  
  The Order reflects Canada’s commitment to open government and the principle that access to information should not be restricted solely by immigration status or residency.

**5. Citation and Enforcement**  
The Order is formally titled:  
**Access to Information Act Extension Order, No. 1**  
It may be cited as such and is enforceable under the provisions of the *Access to Information Act*.

The Order does not create new rights beyond those already established in the Act; rather, it clarifies and expands the existing access rights to include previously excluded groups.

---

**6. Limitations and Exceptions**  
While the Order extends access rights, it does not override any exemptions under the ATIA, such as:
- Privacy of personal information;
- National security;
- Official confidentiality;
- Trade secrets;
- Legal or regulatory restrictions.

Requests for access will still be subject to the relevant exemptions and the requirement that requests be made in accordance with the procedures set out in the Act.

**Conclusion**  
The *Access to Information Act Extension Order, No. 1* is a significant step toward ensuring equitable access to government information. By extending access rights to all individuals and corporations present in Canada — regardless of citizenship or residency status — the Order promotes transparency, supports democratic accountability, and fosters an inclusive environment where all stakeholders, including temporary residents and foreign entities, can participate in the oversight of public institutions. This aligns with Canada’s broader commitment to open government and the rule of law.
