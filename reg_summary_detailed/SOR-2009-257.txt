## 🔍 **Regulatory Summary: Credit Business Practices Regulations (2010)**

### **1. Purpose and Legal Authority**
These regulations establish **minimum standards for fair, transparent, and responsible credit practices** in Canada, specifically targeting financial institutions that offer credit products such as credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. The regulations aim to protect consumers—particularly individuals (natural persons)—from unfair, deceptive, or abusive credit practices.

The authority for these regulations stems from several key federal statutes:

| Statute | Relevant Section(s) | Purpose |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **Bank Act** | Sections 458.3a, 575.1b | Regulates credit card and lending practices by banks and authorized foreign banks |
| **Cooperative Credit Associations Act** | Section 385.252d | Applies to retail associations offering credit |
| **Insurance Companies Act** | Sections 488.1f, 606.1g | Covers credit practices by Canadian and foreign insurance companies |
| **Trust and Loan Companies Act** | Section 443.2i | Applies to trust and loan companies |

> These provisions are foundational to ensuring consumer protection in the credit marketplace.

### **3. Core Consumer Protections and Obligations**

#### ✅ **Statement of Account**
- An institution **must send a statement of account** to the borrower **after the last day of each billing cycle**.
- This ensures borrowers are informed of their balances, charges, and due dates in a timely and transparent manner.

#### ✅ **Minimum Payment Deadline**
- A borrower **cannot be required to make a minimum payment before 21 days after the last day of the billing cycle**.
- This prevents aggressive or premature collection pressures and gives consumers reasonable time to plan payments.

#### ✅ **Grace Period for Due Dates**
- If the due date for a minimum payment falls on a **Saturday or public holiday**, a payment made on the **next business day** is considered **on time**.
- This ensures fairness during non-working days.

#### ✅ **Interest-Free Payment on Full Balance**
- If a borrower pays the **entire outstanding balance in full** by the due date, **no interest is charged** on purchases made during that billing cycle.
- This encourages responsible use of credit and rewards timely repayment.

#### ✅ **Allocation of Overpayments (When Multiple Interest Rates Apply)**
When a credit card has different interest rates on different balances (e.g., cash advances vs. purchases), any overpayment beyond the minimum must be allocated using one of two methods:
1. **Highest rate first**: Allocate the excess payment to the balance with the highest interest rate, then move down in descending order.
2. **Proportional allocation**: Distribute the overpayment in proportion to each balance relative to the total outstanding balance.

> **Rounding Rules**:
> - If a fraction of a dollar is generated (e.g., $12.49), it is:
>   - **Rounded up to the next dollar** if ≥ 50 cents (e.g., $12.50 → $13.00)
>   - **Rounded down** if < 50 cents (e.g., $12.49 → $12.00)
> - Any necessary adjustments to other balances must be made to ensure total repayment accuracy.

#### ✅ **Credit Limit Surpasses (Holds)**
- Institutions **may not charge a fee** for a borrower exceeding their credit limit due to a temporary hold.
- **Exception**: If the borrower would have exceeded the limit anyway during the hold period, the rule does not apply.

#### ✅ **Credit Limit Increases**
- An institution **must obtain the borrower’s express consent** before increasing a credit limit.
- **Oral consent** must be followed by **written confirmation** (paper or electronic) within the first statement issued after consent.

> This prevents surprise increases and ensures informed, voluntary agreement.

#### ✅ **Credit Card Cheques**
- Institutions **must obtain express consent** before issuing credit card cheques.
- Oral consent must be confirmed in writing within the first statement after the consent is given.

> The simple use of the credit card (e.g., making a purchase) **does not count** as express consent.

### **4. Debt Collection Practices (Critical Consumer Protection Provisions)**

#### ✅ **Information to Be Provided to Debtors**
When contacting a debtor to collect a debt, institutions must inform them of:
- The **amount owed** and **type of debt**
- The **identity** or **unique identifier** of the person collecting the debt
- Their **relationship** to the institution

> This promotes transparency and prevents deception.

#### ✅ **Prohibited Communication Methods (Harassment Prohibitions)**
Institutions **may not contact** debtors or their:
- Family members
- Household members
- Relatives
- Neighbors
- Friends or acquaintances
- Employers

**Unless**:
- The person has **guaranteed** to pay the debt and is being contacted in relation to that guarantee; **or**
- The debtor has given **express written or oral consent**

> Even if contact is made, it must not involve **harassment**, including:
> - Threatening, profane, intimidating, or coercive language
> - Undue pressure
> - Publicly disclosing or threatening to disclose the debtor’s failure to pay

#### ✅ **Employer Contact Restrictions**
- Institutions may only contact an employer to confirm:
  - Employment status
  - Nature of employment
  - Business title and address
- **May not contact at workplace** unless:
  - The institution lacks the debtor’s home address or phone number
  - Attempts to contact at home have failed
  - The debtor provides **written authorization**

> This protects privacy and prevents intrusion into personal and professional life.

#### ✅ **Time Restrictions for Contact**
Contact is limited to:
- **Sundays**: Only between **1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.** local time
- **Holidays**: Not permitted at all
- **Other days**: Only between **7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.** local time

> This ensures reasonable privacy and prevents disruptive or intrusive calls.

#### ✅ **Cellular Phone Communication Restrictions**
- Institutions **may not use cellular phones** to contact a debtor or any related person (family, friends, etc.) for debt collection **unless**:
  - The debtor has provided a **cellular number** as a contact
- If used, the **costs of communication** (e.g., call charges) **cannot be passed on to the debtor**.

> This prevents financial exploitation of consumers through hidden or unexpected charges.

#### ✅ **No Further Collection Communication Under Certain Conditions**
Once a debtor makes a written request, institutions **must stop** certain forms of contact:
- **By any means other than written communication** if the debtor requests only written contact via registered mail and provides an address.
- **By any means other than through the debtor’s legal advisor** if the debtor requests contact only through their lawyer and provides the lawyer’s contact details.
- **Without the debtor’s consent** if the debtor notifies the institution by registered mail that:
  - The debt is in dispute
  - They intend to pursue dispute resolution or go to court

> This gives debtors a meaningful right to privacy and legal representation during disputes.

#### ✅ **Prohibition on Misrepresentation**
- Institutions **may not misrepresent** the purpose of a communication.
- They **may not give false or misleading information** during collection efforts.

> This prevents manipulation and fraud in debt recovery.

#### ✅ **Exclusion of Collection Costs from Debt Amount**
- Any **collection costs** (e.g., attorney fees, collection agency fees, court costs) incurred by the institution **are not part of the debt amount** and **cannot be recovered from the debtor**, **except** where specifically authorized under the following regulations:
  - Cost of Borrowing (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations
  - Cost of Borrowing (Retail Associations) Regulations
  - Cost of Borrowing (Canadian Insurance Companies) Regulations
  - Cost of Borrowing (Foreign Insurance Companies) Regulations

> These costs are **excluded** unless explicitly permitted by law—protecting consumers from unexpected or inflated debt burdens.

#### ✅ **No Collection from Unliable Parties**
- Institutions **may not collect or attempt to collect** from anyone who is **not legally liable** for the debt.
