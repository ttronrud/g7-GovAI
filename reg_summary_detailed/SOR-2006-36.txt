**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Transfer of the Crown Corporation Secretariat Regulations (Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Post Corporation)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**, pursuant to **subsection 123(1) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision enables the federal government to transfer certain public service functions or entities from one part of the federal public administration to another, typically to improve efficiency, accountability, or operational effectiveness.

The specific regulation concerns the **transfer of the Crown Corporation Secretariat** — a functional unit within the **Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)** — that oversees administrative and operational support for two Crown corporations:  
- The **Royal Canadian Mint**  
- The **Canada Post Corporation**

This transfer is not a reorganization of ownership or governance but a structural realignment of administrative responsibility within the federal public service.

**2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all persons employed or engaged** in the portion of the federal public administration known as the **Crown Corporation Secretariat** within the **Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)**, specifically in relation to the Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Post Corporation.

This means that all employees, civil servants, and staff working in this administrative unit — including those involved in human resources, financial management, policy development, or administrative support — are subject to the provisions of **subsections 132(1) and (132(2)) of the Public Service Employment Act**.

These subsections govern the **employment conditions, rights, duties, and responsibilities** of public servants in relation to the transfer or reorganization of services. They ensure that:

- Employment rights (such as notice periods, job security, and compensation) are protected during the transition.
- Public service standards and accountability are maintained.
- The transfer does not lead to unfair treatment or disruption of employment terms.

**3. Purpose of the Transfer**

While the regulation does not explicitly state the *reason* for the transfer, such realignments typically aim to:

- Improve administrative efficiency by centralizing support functions.
- Enhance coordination between the CRA and the two Crown corporations.
- Reduce duplication of services by integrating administrative functions under a single, accountable public service unit.
- Ensure that the Crown corporations receive consistent, professional, and accountable support in compliance with public service standards.

By transferring the secretariat function from the CRA’s general structure to a more focused administrative unit, the government seeks to streamline oversight and improve service delivery to these key Crown corporations.

**4. Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on February 6, 2006**. This date marks the start of the application of the new employment and administrative framework for staff within the Crown Corporation Secretariat.

All employment-related obligations, including the application of PSEA subsections 132(1) and (132(2)), become effective from this date.

---

**5. Key Implications**

- **Employment Stability**: Employees in the Crown Corporation Secretariat are protected under existing public service employment laws during and after the transfer.
- **Continuity of Service**: The transfer does not alter the operational or legal status of the Royal Canadian Mint or Canada Post Corporation — only the administrative oversight structure within the federal public service.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: The CRA, as the parent agency, now manages the secretariat function, ensuring that administrative support is provided in accordance with public service standards and fiscal accountability.
- **Compliance with Public Service Principles**: The transfer adheres to the principles of fairness, transparency, and merit-based employment outlined in the Public Service Employment Act.

**Conclusion**

This regulation represents a structural adjustment within the federal public service to better align administrative support with the operational needs of two major Crown corporations — the Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Post Corporation. By transferring the secretariat function to the CRA under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act, the government ensures that these entities receive consistent, professional, and accountable administrative services while maintaining compliance with public service employment standards. The effective date of February 6, 2006, marks the implementation of this change, with all affected employees protected under existing employment rights and obligations.
