## 🔗 **Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

### 1. **Certification of High Contracting Parties to the Warsaw Convention (1929)**  
> *Part I of Schedules I and II*

- The Governor in Council certifies that **each state listed in Part I of Schedules I and II** is a **High Contracting Party** to the **Warsaw Convention**.
- The **territories** to which each state is a party are specified in the schedule **opposite** the state's name.
- The **date when the Convention came into force** for each party is also noted.

> ✅ *Purpose:* Establishes the legal framework for international air carriage between these states and their territories under the original 1929 treaty.

---

### 2. **Certification of Parties to the Hague Protocol (1955)**  
> *Part II of Schedules I and II*

- The proclamation confirms that **each state listed in Part II of Schedules I and II** is a **High Contracting Party** to the **Hague Protocol of 1955**, which amended the Warsaw Convention.
- This protocol introduced important changes, such as:
  - Clarifying liability for damages.
  - Extending the scope of passenger rights.
  - Improving rules on the carriage of baggage and cargo.

> ⚖️ *Legal Significance:* The 1955 Protocol supersedes certain provisions of the original 1929 Convention, so this certification ensures that these states are bound by the updated rules.

> 🔗 **Important Clause (Article XXI and XXIII of the Hague Protocol):**  
> *If a state ratifies the 1955 Protocol but is not already a party to the Warsaw Convention, its ratification shall be deemed equivalent to adherence to the Convention as amended by the Protocol.*  
> → This allows **non-signatories** to the original Convention to still be bound by the updated rules via the 1955 amendment.

---

### 3. **Certification of States That Have Availed Themselves of the Additional Protocol (1929)**  
> *Part III of Schedule I*

- The proclamation identifies **states listed in Part III of Schedule I** that have **opted into the Additional Protocol** to the Warsaw Convention.
- These states have declared that **Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Warsaw Convention shall not apply** to:
  - International carriage by air **performed directly** by the state or any territory or possession under its jurisdiction.

> 🚫 *What this means:*  
> - Article 2(1) of the Warsaw Convention generally applies to **all international air carriage**, including indirect or through flights.  
> - However, **direct flights** (e.g., a flight from Toronto to Paris operated entirely by a Canadian carrier) may be **exempted** from the full scope of Article 2, which deals with liability and compensation for passenger injuries or death.

> 💡 *Example:* A Canadian airline flying directly from Montreal to London may not be subject to the full liability rules of the Warsaw Convention if the country has declared such an exemption.

> 📅 *Note:* The date when the Additional Protocol came into force for each such state is specified in the schedule.
