- **Land Use Regulation**: The exclusion of mineral rights underscores that this is not a commercial or resource development agreement, but a **non-exclusive, recreational lease**.
- **Compliance with Territorial Law**: The Order operates within the framework of the *Territorial Lands Act*, which governs land use, ownership, and transfer in the NWT.
- **Administrative Process**: The application was reviewed and approved through a formal process involving the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, indicating due diligence and oversight.

---

### **Conclusion**
This Order is a targeted, legally grounded authorization under the *Territorial Lands Act* that permits **Mary-Ann Doering**, a federal employee in the Legal Surveys Division, to lease and potentially purchase a specific parcel of land in the Madeline Lake Cottage Subdivision, Northwest Territories, for seasonal recreational purposes. The agreement is strictly limited to recreational use and explicitly excludes all mineral rights and development rights. It reflects a balanced approach to land use, respecting both employee needs and the conservation of natural resources.
