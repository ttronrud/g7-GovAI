## **Section 3: Remission for Non-Commercial Film and Video Tape**

> *Remission is granted for non-commercial film and video tape used abroad by a resident, imported into Canada for personal use only.*

### **Eligible Items:**
- **Non-commercial film** that was:
  - Exposed or processed while the resident was abroad.
  - From which **one set of prints** is produced.
- **Non-commercial video tape** that was:
  - Recorded while the resident was abroad.

### **Conditions for Remission:**
1. **Purpose**: The film or tape must be imported **solely for personal use**, not for any business or occupational purpose.
2. **Ownership and Possession**: Upon return to Canada, the goods must be:
   - In the **actual physical possession** of the resident, or

## **Section 4: Remission for Commercial Canadian Film and Video Tape**

> *Remission is granted for commercial Canadian film or video tape that was exposed or recorded abroad, under strict conditions.*

### **Eligible Items:**
- Commercial Canadian film or video tape that:
  - Was **exposed (but not developed or processed)** abroad.
  - Was **recorded** abroad (for video tape).

### **Conditions for Remission:**

1. **Exposure/Recording Must Be Done Abroad**  
   The film must be exposed or the video tape recorded **outside Canada**.

2. **Only for Testing Quality**  
   The exposure or recording must be **for the purpose of testing the quality** of the film or tape — not for production or commercial output.

3. **Canadian Equipment Requirement**  
   The exposing of film or recording of video tape must be carried out:
   - **Solely by a resident(s)** using **only Canadian equipment**.

   **Exception**: A non-resident may be employed under **specific conditions**:
   - It is **impracticable** to employ a resident.
   - The person is a **technical specialist**.
   - The employment is **casual**.
   - The person is required by **local law** in the foreign country to be employed.

4. **Use of Non-Canadian Equipment (Limited Exceptions)**  
   Equipment other than Canadian equipment may be used **only if**:
   - It is **impracticable** to obtain Canadian equipment.
   - It is a **replacement** for broken Canadian equipment.
   - It is **aircraft, vessel, or vehicle** rented in the foreign country for the purpose of exposure or recording.

5. **Export Verification Required**  
   To qualify for remission, the **export of the film or video tape** must be verified by **one of the following**:
   - A **copy of the Canada Customs Export Report form**, certified by the **chief officer of customs** at the export office, with the notation:
     - “Not subject to drawback” or
     - “Non admissible au drawback”.
   - **Customs accounting documents** authenticated by a customs officer in the **export country**.
   - A **copy of shipping documents** confirming exportation.

> ❗ **Important**: This verification is mandatory to confirm that the goods were actually exported and not retained or re-imported.

6. **No Refund or Drawback Already Claimed**  
   **No remission will be granted** if:
   - A **refund, drawback, or exemption** of tax has already been claimed or granted due to exportation.
   - **Unless** the **tax amount equal to the refund or exemption has already been paid**.

> ⚠️ This prevents double benefits — if a taxpayer already received a tax refund for export, they cannot claim remission unless they have already paid that tax.

---

## **Section 5: Time Limit for Application**

> **No remission will be granted unless an application is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of importation.**

- This creates a **strict deadline** for claiming remission.
- Applications must be made **within two years** of the date the goods are imported into Canada.
- Failure to apply within this timeframe results in **loss of eligibility**.

## **Key Principles and Rationale**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Personal Use Focus** | The primary goal is to allow residents to use film and video tape abroad for personal, non-commercial purposes without facing excise tax upon return. |
| **Commercial Use Restrictions** | Commercial film or video tape must be used strictly for quality testing, not production or distribution. |
| **Canadian Equipment Preference** | Ensures that Canadian content and manufacturing are protected and promoted. |
| **Export Verification** | Prevents fraud and ensures that goods are genuinely exported, not retained for later importation. |
| **Prevention of Abuse** | Prohibits remission when a refund or drawback has already been claimed — maintaining fairness and tax integrity. |
| **Timely Application** | Requires prompt action to ensure transparency and accountability in the tax system. |

## **Practical Implications for Individuals and Businesses**

### ✅ For Canadian Residents:

  - The film/tape is not developed or processed abroad (for film).
  - Only one print (for film) or the original tape is brought back.
  - The goods are in possession or baggage upon return.

### ⚠️ For Commercial Filmmakers or Video Producers:
