**Detailed Summary of the Designated Provisions Regulations — Transportation Information (Canada Transportation Act)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Designated Provisions Regulations — Transportation Information (Canada Transportation Act)* are issued under the authority of the **Minister of Transport** of Canada. This power is derived from **subsection 177(2)(a)** of the *Canada Transportation Act* (CTA).

- **Section 177(2)(a)** of the CTA empowers the Minister to designate specific provisions of regulations as "designated provisions" for the purposes of the Act. These designated provisions are then treated as if they were directly incorporated into the CTA, giving them the same legal force and effect as provisions of the Act itself.
- This mechanism allows the Minister to streamline regulatory implementation by identifying and formally recognizing certain rules as integral to the operation of the transportation system, thereby enhancing clarity, consistency, and enforceability.

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **designate specific provisions** related to **transportation information** as being directly applicable under the Canada Transportation Act. These designated provisions govern the **collection, dissemination, accuracy, and accessibility of transportation-related information** to the public and stakeholders.

By designating these provisions, the Minister ensures that:
- Transportation information (such as schedules, fares, safety data, and service quality) is standardized and reliably available.
- The public and regulated entities have clear access to accurate and timely information.
- The regulatory framework supports transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in the transportation sector.

**3. Scope and Content**

The regulations include a **schedule** (annexed to the regulation) that lists the specific provisions of other regulations (typically from the *Transportation Information Regulations* or similar instruments) that are being designated under subsection 177(2)(a).

While the exact content of the schedule is not provided in your query, based on the context and typical application, the designated provisions likely include:

- Requirements for **public access to transportation schedules and service information**.
- Standards for **accuracy, timeliness, and consistency** of transportation data.
- Rules governing the **format, content, and dissemination** of information (e.g., digital platforms, websites, printed materials).
- Provisions related to **service performance reporting**, such as on-time performance, reliability, and customer service metrics.
- Obligations for **transparency in fare structures**, service changes, and disruptions.
- Requirements for **data sharing** between transportation providers and government agencies.

These provisions are now considered **part of the Canada Transportation Act** for all regulatory and enforcement purposes.

**4. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on **December 15, 2019**.

- This date marks the official implementation of the designated provisions, meaning that transportation operators, service providers, and government bodies must comply with the rules set out in the schedule from that date onward.
- The effective date allows time for stakeholders to adjust operations, update systems, and ensure compliance.

**5. Regulatory Context and Background**

- The regulations are part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to **modernize and standardize transportation information systems** across the country.
- They support the goals of the *Canada Transportation Act*, including promoting **public safety, consumer protection, and efficient transportation services**.
- The 2019 update reflects evolving needs in the transportation sector, such as increased digital engagement, greater public expectations for transparency, and the need for real-time data access.
