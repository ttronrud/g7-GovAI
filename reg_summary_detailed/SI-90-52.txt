## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and Iceland**

### 🔹 **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Framework**

This document is a **Proclamation issued by the Governor General of Canada**, Ramon John Hnatyshyn, on **February 15, 1990**, declaring that the **Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Iceland** came into force on **October 1, 1989**.

The proclamation is grounded in **Section 41 of the Old Age Security Act (OASA)**, which empowers the Governor in Council to declare international social security agreements into force in Canada. Key provisions include:

- **Section 41**: Allows the Governor in Council to declare an agreement entered under Section 40 (which governs international social security agreements) to be in force in Canada.
- **Section 42(1)**: Requires that such an order be laid before Parliament within 15 days of issuance (or within the first 15 days after Parliament resumes sitting if not then in session).
- **Section 42(2)**: Provides a parliamentary revocation mechanism — if a motion signed by at least **50 Members of the House of Commons** or **20 Senators** is filed before the **20th sitting day** after the order is laid, the order may be revoked.
- The order was **laid before Parliament on April 6, 1989**, and **no such motion was filed**, so the order proceeded to come into force.

➡️ **Result**: The agreement officially came into force on **May 18, 1989** — the **thirtieth sitting day** after it was laid before Parliament — as required by Section 42(2).

---

### 🔹 **4. Benefit Rights and Residency Rules**

#### Exceptions:

  - If employed in the territory of one country, they are **only subject to that country’s legislation**.
  - **Self-employed persons** who work in the other country (or both) are subject only to the legislation of their **country of residence** (i.e., where they normally live).

- **Temporary Assignments**:
  - Employees sent by a Canadian employer to work in Iceland for **up to 24 months** are treated as being covered by Canadian legislation.
  - This coverage may be extended beyond 24 months **only with prior consent** from both competent authorities.

- **Seabed/Exploration Installations**:
  - Crew members working on installations in the **continental shelf** of either country (e.g., for oil/gas exploration) are treated as residing in that country’s territory for social security purposes.

> The **continental shelf** is defined as areas beyond territorial seas where a country has rights under international law to seabed and sub-soil resources.

- **Crew Members of Ships**:
  - A crew member is subject only to **Canada’s legislation** if they **ordinarily reside in Canada**.
  - Otherwise, they are subject only to **Iceland’s legislation**.

  - Such individuals may **elect** to be covered by the other country’s legislation **only if they are citizens** of the first country.

> ❌ This right to elect **does not apply** to non-citizens.

> The competent authorities may **agree to modify** these rules for specific categories of persons.

### 🔹 **5. Creditable Periods and Domicile Rules**

#### 📌 For Canada (Old Age Security Act – OASA):

| Scenario | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| A person is covered by CPP or provincial pension during residence in Iceland | That period counts as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (who are not covered by Icelandic employment) |
| A person is covered by Icelandic legislation during residence in Canada | That period **does not** count as residence in Canada for the person or spouse/dependants (unless covered by CPP or provincial plan) |

#### 📌 For Iceland (National Insurance Act):

| Scenario | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| A person is covered by Icelandic legislation during residence in Canada | That period counts as **domicile in Iceland** for the person and spouse/dependants (not covered by Canadian employment) |
| A person is covered by Canadian legislation during residence in Iceland | That period **does not** count as domicile in Iceland for the person or spouse/dependants (unless covered by Icelandic employment) |

> These rules ensure that **residence in one country does not automatically disqualify** someone from claiming benefits in the other, but only if they are covered by employment or other qualifying conditions.

### 🔹 **6. Totalization of Creditable Periods**

If a person is **not entitled** to a benefit based on periods from one country alone:

- Eligibility is determined by **totalizing** creditable periods from **both countries** (provided they do not overlap).
- If totalized periods still fall short, eligibility may be determined by **totalizing periods under a third international agreement** (e.g., with the EU or another country) that allows period totalization.
