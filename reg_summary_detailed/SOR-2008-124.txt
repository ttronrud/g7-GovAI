**Detailed Summary of the Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area Regulations**  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1996, c. 31 – Made under the Oceans Act, subsection 35(3)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The **Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area (MPA) Regulations** were established by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, pursuant to **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. This provision allows the federal government to designate marine protected areas to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **protect and conserve the unique marine environment** around the Bowie Seamount in the Pacific Ocean, particularly its seabed, subsoil, and water column, by restricting activities that could harm living marine organisms or their habitats.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Area"**: Refers specifically to the **Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area** as designated under Section 2 of the regulations. It is a defined geographic zone in the Pacific Ocean.
  
- **Geodetic Reference System**: All geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) are expressed using the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)**, ensuring consistency and accuracy in mapping and spatial referencing.

- **Rhumb Lines**: In the schedule, the boundary lines connecting the designated points are drawn as **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing), which are used in navigation and mapping. These are not great circles but approximate straight paths on a Mercator projection.

---

### **3. Geographic Boundaries of the Area**

The Bowie Seamount MPA is defined by a closed polygon formed by a series of **rhumb lines** connecting eight specific points (labeled 1 to 8 in the schedule), as follows:

| Point | Coordinates |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 53°03′07.6″ N, 135°50′25.9″ W |
| 2 | 53°16′20.9″ N, 134°59′55.4″ W |
| 3 | 53°39′49.2″ N, 135°17′04.9″ W |
| 4 | 53°39′18.0″ N, 135°53′46.5″ W |
| 5 | 53°52′16.7″ N, 136°30′23.1″ W |
| 6 | 53°49′19.6″ N, 136°47′33.1″ W |
| 7 | 53°40′02.5″ N, 136°57′03.5″ W |
| 8 | 53°13′59.2″ N, 136°10′00.0″ W |

The boundary closes back to Point 1, forming a closed marine zone. This area includes:
- The **seabed**
- The **subsoil** (underlying geological layers)
- The **water column above the seabed**

This comprehensive definition ensures protection extends from the surface down to the seafloor and includes all associated marine features.

### **4. Prohibited Activities in the Area**

No person is permitted to:
1. **Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove**:
   - Any living marine organism (e.g., fish, invertebrates, corals, mammals)
   - Any part of its habitat (e.g., coral reefs, seamount structures, sediment layers)

2. **Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove**:
   - Any part of the **seabed** (including geological formations and benthic features)

3. **Carry out any activity** that may result in:
   - Disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal of living marine organisms or their habitats  
   This includes:
   - Depositing, discharging, or dumping any substance (e.g., waste, chemicals, fuel)
   - Causing any substance to be deposited, discharged, or dumped in the area

> These prohibitions are designed to prevent human-induced ecological disruption and preserve the integrity of the marine ecosystem.

### **5. Exceptions to Prohibited Activities (Permitted Activities)**

Despite the general prohibition under Section 3, the following activities are **explicitly allowed** in the Bowie Seamount MPA **if conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations**:

| Permitted Activity | Conditions |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Commercial fishing** | Must comply with the *Fisheries Act* and its regulations |
| **Recreational fishing** | Must comply with the *Fisheries Act* and its regulations |
| **Aboriginal communal fishing** | Conducted under the *Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations* |
| **Vessel travel** | Must comply with the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* and its regulations |
| **Foreign ship travel** | Must comply with the *Coasting Trade Act* and its regulations |
| **Movement of ships, submarines, or aircraft** | For public safety, law enforcement, national security, or exercise of Canadian sovereignty — if operated by: <br> - The Government of Canada (Her Majesty in right of Canada), or <br> - A foreign military force acting in cooperation with or under the command/control of Canadian Forces |
| **Emergency response activities** | Conducted under the direction, command, or control of the **Canadian Coast Guard** |
| **Marine scientific research** | Carried out by a **foreign government** and approved under **paragraph 3(2)(c) of the Coasting Trade Act** — only if: <br> - The foreign government has obtained consent from the Minister of Foreign Affairs <br> - The activity complies with the terms and conditions of that consent |
| **Activities approved under Section 6** | Any activity approved by the Minister under a specific authorization process |

> These exceptions are narrowly defined and require adherence to existing legal frameworks to ensure environmental protection is not compromised.

### **6. Requirements for Scientific, Educational, and Commercial Marine Tourism Activities**

Any individual or organization proposing to conduct the following types of activities **must submit a detailed plan to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans at least 60 days before the activity begins**:

#### **Required Elements of the Plan:**
- Contact information (name, address, phone, fax, email) of a responsible person
- A detailed description including:
  - Purpose of the activity
  - Duration and timing (periods during which it will occur)
  - Location on a map
  - Types of data to be collected and sampling methods
  - Equipment to be used (including data-gathering tools), and **how anchoring or mooring will be conducted** (if applicable)
  - Identity of every vessel involved
  - Any substances to be deposited, discharged, or dumped during the activity

#### **Environmental Assessment Requirement:**
