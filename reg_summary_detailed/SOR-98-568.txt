### **Detailed Summary of the *Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc. Regulations* (S.C. 1998, c. 10)**

---

#### **Background and Legislative Context**

These regulations were enacted under **Section 141 of the Canada Marine Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to extend certain provisions of the *St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Act (SLSAA)* to a corporation incorporated under that Act — specifically, **The Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc. (the "Corporation")**.

The key background points are:

- The Corporation was established as a **subsidiary of the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority (SLSA)** under **Section 26(1) of the SLSAA**, to carry out activities authorized by the Authority.
- **Section 26(3)** of the SLSAA originally extended certain provisions of the Act to such subsidiaries **as if they were the Authority itself**.
- However, **when the SLSAA was repealed**, those provisions ceased to apply to the Corporation.
- To restore regulatory continuity and ensure that the Corporation can function effectively, the Governor in Council, by regulation, **reinstates key provisions of the SLSAA in a modified form** to apply to the Corporation.

Thus, these regulations serve as a **temporary, targeted extension of the SLSAA** to the Corporation, enabling it to operate with legal and financial authority similar to that of the Authority — but without requiring a full re-creation of the Authority’s structure.

#### **Key Provisions and Their Application**

The regulations come into force on **December 1, 1998**, and apply to the Corporation in a **modified form**, as detailed in the Schedule. Each provision is linked to the corresponding section of the SLSAA, with modifications tailored to the nature and function of the bridge corporation.

---

### **1. The Corporation is an Agent of Her Majesty in Right of Canada (Subsection 3(2), SLSAA)**  
> *“Except as provided in section 4, the Corporation is for all purposes an agent of Her Majesty.”*

- This establishes the **legal status** of the Corporation as a **federal agent**.
- It means that the Corporation acts on behalf of the Government of Canada and is subject to the same principles of accountability and public service as other federal agencies.
- **Exception**: Section 4 (on legal proceedings) provides a specific exception — the Corporation may be sued or bring legal action in its own name, even though it is an agent.

---

### **2. Legal Proceedings in Respect of Rights or Obligations (Section 4, SLSAA)**  
> *“Actions, suits or other legal proceedings... may be brought or taken by or against the Corporation in the name of the Corporation in any court that would have jurisdiction if the Corporation were not an agent of Her Majesty.”*

- The Corporation can **initiate or defend legal actions** in its own name in appropriate courts.
- This is a critical practical provision — it allows the Corporation to **manage its own liabilities and rights** without being constrained by the requirement that all actions must be in the name of the Crown.
- The court jurisdiction is determined based on the nature of the claim, consistent with standard rules of civil procedure.

---

### **3. Employment of Officers and Employees (Section 9, SLSAA)**  
> *“The Corporation may employ such officers and employees for such purposes and on such terms and conditions as may be determined by it, and the officers and employees so employed are not officers or servants of Her Majesty.”*

- The Corporation has **autonomy in hiring** and managing its workforce.
- Employees are **not considered public servants** of Her Majesty under the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) or other federal public service laws.
- This allows the Corporation to adopt **commercial or operational management practices** consistent with private-sector standards, while still being part of a federal infrastructure project.

---

### **4. Authority to Fix Fees (Subsection 16(1), SLSAA)**  
> *“The Corporation may, subject to section 6, fix fees to be charged... for use of buildings, services, vehicles, and passengers/goods.”*

- The Corporation has the **power to establish and adjust fees** for:
  - Use of facilities (e.g., bridge decks, maintenance buildings)
  - Services provided (e.g., toll collection, maintenance)
  - Pedestrians and vehicles crossing the bridges
  - Passengers or goods carried in vehicles

- This power is **not absolute** and is subject to **Section 6 of the SLSAA**, which likely imposes conditions on the fairness and transparency of fee setting (e.g., public consultation, cost-based justification).

---

### **5. Flexibility in Fee Structure (Subsection 16(2), SLSAA)**  
> *“Fees may be set for specific parts of the bridges, for the entire structure, or for specific services.”*

- The Corporation can **tailor fees** to different user groups or access points (e.g., separate tolls for cars, buses, or pedestrians).
- This allows for **targeted revenue generation** and better alignment with operational costs and user behavior.

---

### **6. Fee Filing and Public Oversight (Subsection 16(3), SLSAA)**  
> *“A fee fixed or any amendment to it shall be filed with the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) and becomes operative from the day of filing.”*

- All fee changes must be **submitted to and approved by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)**.
- The filing process ensures **transparency and accountability**.
- The CTA is the **gatekeeper** of fee legitimacy — it ensures fees are not arbitrary or discriminatory.

---

### **7. Complaint Mechanism for Unjust Discrimination (Subsection 16(4), SLSAA)**  
> *“Any person interested may file a complaint with the CTA about unjust discrimination in a fee. The CTA shall consider the complaint and make a finding, which it shall report to the Corporation.”*

- Provides a **public grievance mechanism** for users who believe fees are unfairly applied (e.g., higher tolls for certain vehicles or groups).
- The CTA investigates and issues a **formal finding** — this finding is then **reported directly to the Corporation**, creating a feedback loop for policy improvement.

---

### **8. Application of the Canada Transportation Act (Subsection 16(5), SLSAA)**  
> *“Section 40 of the Canada Transportation Act applies, with such modifications as circumstances require, to every report of the CTA under subsection (4), as if the report were a decision made under that Act.”*

- This means that **CTA reports** (such as findings on fee discrimination) are treated as **formal decisions** under the *Canada Transportation Act*.
- This enhances the **legal weight and enforceability** of the CTA’s findings.
- It gives the Corporation a binding obligation to act upon such reports — for example, to revise fees or remove discriminatory practices.

---

### **9. Fairness and Revenue Requirements for Fees (Section 17, SLSAA)**  
> *“Fees must be fair and reasonable and must provide sufficient revenue to defray the cost of operations, including interest, amortization, and operating and maintenance costs.”*

- The fees must:
  - Be **fair and reasonable** (not excessive or exploitative)
  - Generate **adequate revenue** to cover:
    - Interest on borrowed funds
    - Amortization of principal over a **maximum period of 50 years**
    - Operating and maintenance costs (including reserves approved by the Minister)

- This ensures **financial sustainability** and **public accountability** — the Corporation cannot operate at a loss or rely on government subsidies indefinitely.

---

### **10. Public Service Retirement Benefits (Subsection 22(1), SLSAA)**  
> *“If a public servant was employed by the Corporation, and the employment was approved by the Minister, their retirement benefits may be preserved under the Public Service Superannuation Act.”*

- For employees who were previously in the **federal public service**:
  - If they were in a position covered by the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)*, they may be **reappointed to a position of equal or higher class** upon retirement.
  - If they were in a position **not covered** by the PSEA, they may be reappointed to a **similar non-covered position** of equal or higher class.

- This provision **protects the career continuity** of public servants transitioning to the Corporation, recognizing that many of its employees were previously government workers.

---

### **11. Government Employees Compensation Act (Subsection 22(2), SLSAA)**  
> *“The Government Employees Compensation Act applies to officers and servants of the Corporation, and, notwithstanding Section 4, they are deemed to be employees in the service of Her Majesty.”*

- Officers and employees of the Corporation are **covered by the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA)**.
- Even though the Corporation is not a public service entity, its employees are **deemed to be in the service of Her Majesty** for the purposes of workers’ compensation.
- This ensures that employees have access to **workers’ compensation benefits** (e.g., injury claims, disability, death benefits), which is essential for safety and employee protection.

---

### **12. Contracting with Her Majesty (Section 24, SLSAA)**  
> *“Although the Corporation is an agent of Her Majesty, it may enter into contracts with Her Majesty.”*

- Despite being an agent, the Corporation can
