**Detailed Summary of the Information Technology Activities (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **sections 396a and 463b of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (Act)**.  
- **Statutory References**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 314  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 339  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 48  

These regulations establish specific rules governing **information technology (IT) activities** that cooperative credit associations (associations) may engage in, including the development, management, and investment in IT-related entities. The regulations aim to ensure that such activities remain aligned with the financial and operational boundaries set by the Act, particularly in protecting the stability and integrity of cooperative financial institutions.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, which provides the legal framework for cooperatives operating in Canada.
  
- **"Balance sheet value"**:  
  - Means the value reported on an **unconsolidated basis** in an entity’s balance sheet.  
  - This is the value assigned to shares and ownership interests as recorded in financial statements.  
  - *Note*: The term "book value" was previously used but has been **repealed** (removed) by SOR/2008-168, section 13.

- **"Member of an association’s group"**:  
  - Has the same meaning as defined in **subsection 386(2)** of the Act.  
  - This refers to entities that are part of the same corporate or financial group as the association, including subsidiaries and affiliated organizations.

---

### **3. Permitted IT Activities (Section 1)**

An association may **develop, design, hold, manage, manufacture, sell, or otherwise deal with** the following IT-related assets **if they are materially related** to the provision of financial products or services:

- Data transmission systems  
- Information sites (e.g., websites)  
- Communication devices  
- Information platforms or portals  

**Conditions**:
- These activities must serve a **purpose or occur in a circumstance that is materially related** to the association’s or a member of its group’s financial services.
- Approval is required under **paragraph 376(1)(h)** of the Act before engaging in such activities.

> ⚠️ *This means that while IT activities are permitted, they must be directly connected to financial services and must be approved by the regulatory authority.*

---

### **4. Restrictions on Acquiring Control or Substantial Investments (Section 2)**

An association **may not acquire control of, hold, acquire, or increase a substantial investment in** an entity that engages in any of the IT activities listed in Section 1 — **if** the total of the following exceeds **5% of the association’s regulatory capital**:

#### **Components of the 5% Threshold**:
1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests the association and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity under **paragraph 390(2)(f)** of the Act.
2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the association and its subsidiaries in **other entities** engaging in the same IT activities that the association controls or has a substantial investment in.
3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the association and its subsidiaries to such entities.

> 🔍 *This threshold is designed to prevent excessive concentration of risk and ensure financial stability by limiting exposure to IT-related ventures.*

### **5. Prohibited Activities in IT Entities (Section 3)**

An association may **not** acquire control of, or make a substantial investment in**, an entity that engages in any of the following:

#### a) **Accepting Deposit Liabilities**
- Entities that accept deposits (e.g., savings accounts) are explicitly prohibited.

#### b) **Engaging in Activities Not Permitted Under the Act**
- Activities that an association is not allowed to conduct under:
  - **Section 378** (e.g., certain lending or investment activities)
  - **Section 382** (e.g., dealing in securities)
  - **Section 382.1** (e.g., certain financial intermediation)

#### c) **Dealing in Securities**
- Prohibited unless:
  - Permitted under **paragraph 390(2)(e)** of the Act, or
  - Permitted under:
    - **Paragraph 376(1)(f)** of the Act (for general associations), or
    - **Subparagraph 376(1)(i)(ii)** (for retail associations)

> ⚠️ *This restricts IT entities from being involved in securities trading unless explicitly authorized.*

#### d) **Dealing in Goods, Wares, or Merchandise**
- Prohibited unless permitted under **subsection 376(3)** of the Act.
- Exceptions exist only where specifically allowed under that section.

#### e) **Activities Prohibited Under Section 381**
- Applies if the entity is a **finance entity** or another entity prescribed under **paragraph 390(3)(c)** of the Act.
- These are activities that would otherwise be restricted under the Act.

#### f) **Acquiring Control of or Holding Substantial Investment in Another Entity**
- **Only allowed if**:
  - In the case of an entity **controlled by the association**, the association itself would be permitted under **Part X of the Act** to make a substantial investment in that entity.
  - In the case of an entity **not controlled by the association**, the association would be permitted to make such an investment under:
    - Subsection **388(2)**  
    - Paragraphs **388(3)(b)** or **(c)**  
    - Subsection **388(4)** or **390(1)** or **(2)** of the Act  
  - *Otherwise, no such investment is permitted.*

> 🔍 *This ensures that even IT ventures must be consistent with broader regulatory rules on investment and ownership.*

### **6. Exemption from Subsection 390(5) (Section 4)**

For the purposes of **subparagraph 3(3)(e)(ii)**, **subsections 390(4) to (6)** of the Act **do not apply** when determining whether an association would be permitted to acquire a substantial investment in another entity under:
- Subsection 388(2)
- Paragraphs 388(3)(b) or (c)
- Subsection 388(4) or 390(1) or (2)

> ✅ *This provides a specific exemption to simplify compliance when evaluating investment in IT-related entities that are limited to the permitted activities.*

---

### **7. Exemption for Entities with Limited Activities (Section 5)**

- **Subsection 390(5)** of the Act **does not apply** when:
  - An association acquires control of, or increases a substantial investment in, an entity whose business is **limited to the activities described in subsection 3(1)** (i.e., IT activities related to financial services).

> ✅ *This allows flexibility in investing in IT-focused entities that do not engage in prohibited financial activities.*

> ⚠️ *This exemption does not limit the operation of subsections 3(2) and (3)* — meaning other restrictions (e.g., on lending or securities) still apply.

---

### **8. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Government of Canada.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Management** | Limits exposure to IT ventures through a 5% regulatory capital cap to prevent over-concentration. |
| **Financial Stability** | Prohibits IT entities from engaging in high-risk activities like accepting deposits or dealing in securities. |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Ensures IT activities are directly tied to financial services and aligned with existing cooperative rules. |
| **Transparency & Oversight** | Requires approval for new IT ventures and clearly defines what constitutes a "substantial investment." |
| **Flexibility** | Allows investment in IT platforms that support financial services, especially if they are limited to those activities. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Information Technology Activities (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* provide a **clear, risk-based framework** for cooperative credit associations to engage in IT-related activities. While recognizing the growing importance of digital platforms in financial service delivery, the regulations impose **strict limitations** to protect cooperative institutions from financial instability, regulatory overreach, and exposure to prohibited activities.

These rules ensure that:
- IT investments remain **aligned with core financial services**,
- Associations do **not overexpose themselves** financially,
- And all activities comply with broader prohibitions under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.

They represent a balanced approach to modernization — enabling digital innovation while preserving the stability and integrity of the cooperative financial system.
