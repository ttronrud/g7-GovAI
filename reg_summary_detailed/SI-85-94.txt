### **Remission of Customs Duties**

- **Scope of Remission**:  
  A full remission of **customs duties** is granted for goods imported during the period:
  - **January 1, 1983** to **March 31, 1998**.

- **Basis of Remission**:  
  The remission applies to duties that would otherwise be payable under the **Customs Tariff**.

> This means that importers are not required to pay customs duties on qualifying goods imported during this timeframe, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.

---

### **Remission of Sales Tax**

- **Sales Tax Remission**:  
  A remission of **sales tax** (under the *Excise Tax Act*) is also granted on qualifying goods, **only when customs duties are remitted**.

- **Calculation Method**:  
  The sales tax remitted equals the **difference between**:
  - The actual sales tax paid or payable on the goods;  
  - The sales tax that would have been payable **if the duty-paid value** (used to calculate sales tax) had been **reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission**.

> This ensures that the tax burden is reduced proportionally to the customs duty relief, reflecting the economic impact of the duty exemption.

> Example:  
> If goods were valued at $100,000 and customs duty was $10,000 (remitted), the duty-paid value becomes $90,000. Sales tax is calculated on $90,000 instead of $100,000. The difference in tax is the amount of remission granted.
