**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of Science**

**Official Citation:**  
S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207  
Reference to Statutes: R.S., c. P-34; S.C. 1997, c. 26  
(“S.C.” = Statutes of Canada; “R.S.” = Revised Statutes of Canada; “c.” = chapter number)

**Nature of the Regulation:**  
This regulation constitutes a formal administrative transfer of powers, duties, and functions under a specific legislative framework. It is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to a provision in the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

---

**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Transfer of Authority:**  
   The powers, duties, and functions previously held by the **Minister of Industry** are being transferred to the **Minister of State styled the Minister of Science**.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision allows for the reallocation of ministerial responsibilities within the federal government, particularly in the context of public service restructuring or policy realignment.

3. **Scope of Transfer:**  
   The transfer specifically applies to the powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Industry as outlined in **Part I of the Budget Implementation Act, 1997** (S.C. 1997, c. 26).  
   - This means that only the responsibilities defined in Part I of that Act are being transferred.  
   - The transfer does not extend to other parts of the Budget Implementation Act or to functions outside the scope of Part I.

4. **Effective Date and Legal Authority:**  
   The regulation is published in the *Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22*, and comes into force as part of that legislative instrument. It is a statutory instrument that operates under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which enables the government to reorganize ministerial responsibilities to better align with current policy priorities.

5. **Implications for Government Structure:**  
   - The Minister of Science (as a Minister of State) now assumes responsibility for the operational and administrative aspects of the former Industry portfolio as defined in Part I of the 1997 Budget Implementation Act.  
   - This reflects a strategic shift in government priorities, likely aimed at integrating science and innovation into broader economic and industrial policy.  
   - The transfer may signal a move toward a more integrated approach to science-based industries, technology development, and innovation policy.

6. **No Change to Ministerial Titles or Status:**  
   The title of the recipient is specified as “Minister of State styled the Minister of Science,” indicating that the individual holds a ministerial-level position, though not necessarily a full cabinet minister. This reflects a common practice in Canadian federal government structure where certain portfolios are assigned to ministers of state with specific responsibilities.

**Background Context:**

- The *Budget Implementation Act, 1997* (S.C. 1997, c. 26) was enacted to implement fiscal and policy changes resulting from the 1997 federal budget. Part I of this Act likely contained provisions related to the management of industrial policy, economic development, or technological advancement.
- The transfer in 2003 appears to be a reorganization effort to consolidate responsibilities under a more strategic portfolio—particularly one focused on science and innovation—thereby aligning with broader national goals in science, technology, and economic competitiveness.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally transfers the powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Industry—specifically as defined in Part I of the Budget Implementation Act, 1997—to the Minister of State for Science. It is a procedural and administrative change authorized under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, reflecting a shift in government structure to better support science-based economic development. The transfer is limited in scope and applies only to those functions explicitly outlined in Part I of the 1997 Act.
