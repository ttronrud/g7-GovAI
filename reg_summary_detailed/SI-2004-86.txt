**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a formal administrative transfer of responsibilities within the Canadian federal public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Issuing Authority**:  
   The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This reflects the constitutional framework under which the federal government can reorganize public service structures with the approval of the Crown, based on ministerial recommendations.

2. **Legal Basis**:  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision enables the government to reassign or transfer control and supervision of public service functions and branches between different departments or offices, provided it serves the public interest and maintains the integrity of the public service.

3. **Transfer of Function**:  
   The specific entity being transferred is the **Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat**, which is a component of the **Intergovernmental Affairs Branch** within the **Privy Council Office (PCO)**.  
   - The Privy Council Office traditionally serves as the central administrative and policy coordination body for the federal government, handling intergovernmental relations, policy development, and executive support.  
   - The Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat historically managed policy and coordination related to Indigenous peoples, including consultation, program development, and intergovernmental engagement on Indigenous affairs.

4. **Destination of Transfer**:  
   The control and supervision of the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat are being transferred from the **Privy Council Office** to the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**.  
   - At the time of this regulation (2004), DIAND was the federal department responsible for policies and programs related to Indigenous peoples, including status, land rights, education, health, and economic development.  
   - This transfer reflects a strategic realignment to ensure that Indigenous affairs policy is managed within a dedicated department, enhancing accountability, expertise, and direct oversight.

5. **Effective Date**:  
   The transfer becomes effective on **July 20, 2004**. This date marks the formal implementation of the reorganization, after which the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat operates under the authority and supervision of DIAND.

6. **Implications and Significance**:  
   - This move represents a shift from centralized, intergovernmental coordination (within the PCO) to departmental management of Indigenous affairs.  
   - It strengthens the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development’s mandate by integrating Indigenous policy development and implementation directly into its core responsibilities.  
   - The transfer supports a more focused and specialized approach to Indigenous governance and policy, aligning with broader government efforts to improve Indigenous service delivery and intergovernmental collaboration.

7. **Purpose of the Rearrangement**:  
   The underlying goal of the transfer is to improve the effectiveness, accountability, and responsiveness of federal policy related to Aboriginal peoples by placing it under a department with a clear mandate and dedicated staff. It also facilitates better coordination with provincial and Indigenous governments, as well as with Indigenous communities.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation formally transfers the administrative control and supervision of the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, effective July 20, 2004. It is a significant reorganization within the federal public service, designed to enhance the management and delivery of Indigenous affairs policy by placing it within a department with a dedicated mandate. The action is grounded in statutory authority and reflects a strategic effort to improve governance and service delivery for Aboriginal peoples in Canada.
