The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2015-200, s. 6]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2015-200, section 6**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2015-200, section 6**, which is a statutory instrument (a type of secondary legislation) issued in Canada in 2015.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 6 of SOR/2015-200 specifically identifies and removes (repeals) a prior regulation. While the original content of the repealed regulation is not included in the provided text, the repealing section implies that it was a prior rule that had governed a specific area of law or administrative practice—likely in a sector such as transportation, environmental management, health, or safety—before being replaced or superseded.
- **Effective Date**: The repeal became effective on the date the regulation was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (SOR/2015-200), which is typically the same day the instrument is issued, unless otherwise specified.
- **Legal Implications**: Once repealed, the regulation no longer applies. Any legal or administrative actions based on it are invalid, and authorities must now operate under the current, active regulations that replaced it (if any).

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest a formatting or technical error—likely from a database or document where the repeal notice was duplicated.
- Without the original text of the repealed regulation, the specific subject matter (e.g., licensing, emissions standards, workplace safety) cannot be determined. To identify the original scope, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation that was repealed by SOR/2015-200, section 6.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory reform or consolidation effort to modernize, simplify, or align the legal framework with current policy goals.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in effect** and was officially **repealed by SOR/2015-200, section 6**. It was likely a previous rule in a specific regulatory area that has since been replaced or withdrawn. To understand the original purpose or scope of the repealed regulation, further research into the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory notes in SOR/2015-200 is required.
