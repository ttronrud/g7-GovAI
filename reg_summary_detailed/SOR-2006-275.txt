### **Detailed Summary of the Solvency Funding Relief Regulations (S.C. 1998, c. 12, s. 1(4), s. 10, s. 263(d), s. 76, R.S., c. 32 (2nd Supp.))**

These regulations, made under the **Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (PBSA)**, provide a **special funding mechanism** for defined benefit pension plans that have an *initial solvency deficiency*—a shortfall between the plan’s assets and liabilities as of a specific valuation date—emerging between **December 30, 2005, and January 1, 2008**. The purpose is to offer **flexibility and relief** to plan administrators and employers facing financial challenges, while ensuring that pension benefits remain protected and that the plan remains viable.

---

## **I. Purpose and Scope**

- **Objective**: To allow plans with an *initial solvency deficiency* to be funded through **special payments** over a **longer period** (up to 10 years) than required under standard solvency rules, without triggering immediate or full termination of the plan.
- **Applicability**:
  - Applies only to **defined benefit plans** established **on or before December 31, 2005**.
  - Excludes plans established **after December 31, 2005**, unless:
    - Formed by **merger** of one or more pre-2005 plans, or
    - Result of **splitting** a pre-2005 plan.
  - Does **not apply** to plans governed by the **Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations**.

> ⚠️ *Key Limitation*: The plan must have **fully paid all prior obligations** to the pension fund before the emergence of the initial solvency deficiency, as required by subsection 9(14) of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985.

---

## **III. Funding Mechanism for Initial Solvency Deficiency**

### **1. Funding via Equal Annual Special Payments**
- The initial solvency deficiency may be funded through **equal annual special payments** over a period of **no more than five years** (or **up to ten years** for multi-employer plans).
- Payments are calculated as:
  > **(Solvency Deficiency ÷ 5)**  
  minus  
  **Going Concern Special Payments** (excluding certain types) payable during the plan year.

> 🔍 *This ensures that the plan is funded in a manageable, predictable way, avoiding large lump-sum demands.*

---

### **2. Deferral of Remittances (for Multi-Employer Plans)**
- For **multi-employer plans**, the administrator may **defer** remittances of special payments, treating the deficiency as being funded over **up to 10 years**.
- This allows greater financial flexibility for employers with multiple participants.

> ✅ *Exception*: If the required annual payments under this Part are **less than** those required under applicable collective agreements, the plan must make **the higher amount** (from collective agreements) to ensure compliance with labor agreements.

---

## **IV. Beneficiary Notification and Objecting Rights**

### **Mandatory Information to Be Provided to Beneficiaries**
The administrator must provide beneficiaries (or their representatives) with the following information:

1. **Solvency ratio** of the plan as of the day the deficiency emerged.
2. **Amount of the initial solvency deficiency**.
3. **Description of how benefits would be reduced** if the plan were fully terminated and wound up.
4. **Warning** that extending the funding period may:
   - Reduce plan asset value during the funding period.
   - Extend the time during which assets are less than liabilities.
5. **Comparison of special payments**:
   - What would be paid under **Part 1** (standard funding).
   - What **will be paid** under this Part (longer-term funding).
6. **Notice that funding may proceed only if less than one-third of members and less than one-third of beneficiaries (excluding members) object**.
7. **No need for Superintendent approval** to fund under this Part.
8. **Right to object** by sending a written objection to the administrator within **30 days** of receiving the information.
9. **Restriction on plan amendments**: During the **first five years** of funding under this Part, **any amendment increasing pension benefits is restricted**.
10. **Right of access** to documents under paragraph 28(1)(c) of the PBSA.

> 📌 *Note*: Each objection by a beneficiary representative counts **separately** for each person they represent.

## **V. Filing Requirements with the Superintendent**

The administrator must file with the Superintendent:

1. **Written notification** of intent to fund under this Part.
2. **Actuarial report** valuing the plan as of the day the initial solvency deficiency emerged.
3. **Board resolution or approval**:
   - For corporate employers: Board resolution authorizing the special payment schedule.
   - For non-corporate employers: Approval from persons with authority to direct actions.
4. **Confirmation** that:
   - All required information was provided to beneficiaries.
   - **Less than one-third of members and beneficiaries** objected.

> ⚖️ *Inconsistency Rule*: If there is a conflict between these regulations and the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, **these regulations prevail**.

---

## **VI. Interest and Accruals**

- Interest on unpaid special payments is calculated using the **interest rate assumed in the valuation** used to determine the initial solvency deficiency.
- The **aggregate amount** of special payments that would have been made under Part 1 (adjusted for reductions due to PBSR rules) **plus interest** is treated as **accrued to the pension fund** if the plan is funded under this Part.

---

## **VII. Post-Deficiency Solvency Deficiencies**

- If a **new solvency deficiency** emerges **after** the initial deficiency:
  - It is calculated using the standard definition in subsection 9(1) of the PBSR.
  - Includes the **present value of special payments** made under this Part (especially those due beyond 5 years).
- The interest rate used for present value calculations is the **same** as the rate used in the solvency liability calculation.

---

## **VIII. Termination and Cessation of Funding**

- A plan may **cease to be funded** under this Part at the start of a plan year by giving **written notice to the Superintendent** not later than **six months after the beginning of that year**.
- The notice must state whether the plan has a **surplus** as of the first day of the year.

### **Consequences of Cessation**:
- If the plan **has a surplus**:
  - This Part **ceases to apply** on the first day of the plan year.
- If the plan **does not have a surplus**:
  - The standard rules under **section 9 of the PBSR** apply (with exceptions outlined in the regulations).

> 💡 *Surplus Calculation*: A surplus is determined as if the plan had been **fully terminated**, per subsection 16(1) of the PBSR.

---

## **IX. Special Provisions for Multi-Employer Plans**

- Funding may extend up to **10 years** (vs. 5 years for single-employer plans).
