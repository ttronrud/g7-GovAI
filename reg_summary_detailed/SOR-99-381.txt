**Detailed Summary of the Exemption from Deposit Insurance By-law (Notice to Depositors)**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This by-law was issued by the **Board of Directors of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)** under two specific provisions of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*:

- **Paragraph 11(2)(g)a**: Authorizes the CDIC to issue by-laws to implement provisions of the Act.
- **Paragraph 26.3(1)(c)b**: Grants the CDIC authority to establish rules governing the exemption of certain financial institutions from deposit insurance when they are authorized to accept deposits without being registered as member institutions.

This by-law serves as a regulatory mechanism to inform depositors of the implications of a new financial institution (an "applicant") being authorized to accept deposits in Canada without being a member institution of the CDIC — and thus, those deposits will no longer be insured by the CDIC.

### **Applicable Legal Provisions**

- **R.S., c. 18 (3rd Supp.), s. 51**: General provisions related to deposit insurance and exemptions.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 15, s. 114**: Legislative amendment that supports the framework for exemptions from deposit insurance for non-member institutions.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*, which governs CDIC’s operations and responsibilities. |
| **Applicant** | A *federal member institution* that applies to CDIC under **section 26.02** of the Act for permission to accept deposits without being a member institution. This typically includes certain federally regulated financial institutions (e.g., credit unions, caisses populaires) seeking to operate as non-member deposit-taking entities. |

### **Core Requirements for Applicants**

An applicant must provide **clear, written notice** to its depositors containing the following **three essential elements**, all in at least one of Canada’s official languages (English or French):

#### **1. Acknowledgment Requirement for Continued Deposits**
> Depositors must provide a **written acknowledgment** to the applicant, in the form provided with the notice, confirming that:
- Their deposits (payable in Canada) will **no longer be insured in whole or in part** by the CDIC once the applicant receives authorization to accept deposits.
  
This is a critical safeguard to ensure that depositors are fully aware of the loss of insurance coverage.

#### **2. Right to Receive Principal and Interest**
> At the depositor’s written request, the applicant will:
- Pay the **principal amount** of the deposit.
- Pay **interest** determined according to the *Exemption from Deposit Insurance By-law (Interest on Deposits)*.

This ensures that depositors retain access to their funds and interest, even though the deposits are no longer insured.

#### **3. Default Liability Transfer**
> If a depositor **fails to provide the required written acknowledgment** or **fails to make a written request for repayment**, then:
- The applicant’s liability for the deposit will be **assumed by another member institution** (a CDIC-insured bank or financial institution).
- The assumption will occur under **the same terms and conditions** as the original deposit.

This provision protects depositors by ensuring that, in the absence of active consent, their funds are not left without a responsible party to honor the obligation.

### **Timing and Delivery Requirements**

#### **Notice to Existing Depositors (as of the day before sending date)**
- The applicant must send the notice and accompanying acknowledgment form **no less than 15 days and no more than 90 days** after receiving the application from the applicant.
- The notice must be sent to **every depositor** listed in the applicant’s records as of the **day immediately before the sending date**.

#### **Delivery Methods**
The notice and form must be delivered via one of the following:
- **Prepaid mail**
- **Courier service**
- **Facsimile (fax)**
- **Other electronic transmission** (e.g., email, secure digital platforms)

The delivery method must ensure that the notice reaches the depositor at their **recorded address or contact number**.

### **Notice to New Depositors (Post-authorization)**

When an applicant accepts a deposit from a person who was **not listed in its records as of the day before the sending date**, the applicant must:

- Provide that person with a **notice and acknowledgment form**.
- Deliver it via:
  - **Personal delivery**, or
  - One of the methods listed in subsection 3(2) (e.g., mail, courier, fax, electronic transmission).

This ensures that **new depositors are also properly informed** of the lack of CDIC insurance and the conditions under which they may receive their funds.

### **Effective Date**

This by-law comes into force on **October 15, 1999**.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

This by-law is designed to:

1. **Ensure transparency** for depositors by clearly communicating that deposits held with a non-member institution will no longer be covered by CDIC insurance.
2. **Protect depositors’ rights** by giving them a clear opportunity to:
   - Acknowledge the loss of insurance,
   - Request repayment of principal and interest,
   - Or have their deposits transferred to a CDIC-insured institution.
3. **Maintain financial stability** by ensuring that deposits are not taken without proper disclosure and consent.
4. **Support the regulatory framework** for federal institutions seeking to operate outside the traditional CDIC membership model, while preserving consumer protection standards.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Applicant (financial institution)** | Must comply with notice and acknowledgment requirements; deliver notices within 15–90 days of receiving application; provide forms in official languages. |
| **Depositors** | Must provide written acknowledgment to waive CDIC insurance; can request repayment of principal and interest; if they do not act, their deposits will be assumed by a member institution. |
| **CDIC** | Acts as the regulatory body ensuring compliance with disclosure and protection standards. |

### **Conclusion**

This by-law establishes a **clear, structured, and legally binding process** for informing depositors when a financial institution is authorized to accept deposits without being a CDIC member. It balances the flexibility needed for financial innovation with the need to protect depositors through full disclosure, informed consent, and a fallback mechanism to ensure fund safety. It reflects CDIC’s commitment to transparency, consumer protection, and financial stability in Canada’s deposit insurance system.
