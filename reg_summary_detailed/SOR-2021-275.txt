Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, drawn from **Section 5 of the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit Act (S.C. 2021, c. 26)**, specifically as it relates to the **Lockdown Regions Designation Order (COVID-19)**.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Context**
- The regulation is issued under **Section 5 of the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit Act (S.C. 2021, c. 26)**.
- It serves to formally designate specific geographic regions in Canada as **"lockdown regions"** in response to **COVID-19 outbreaks**.
- The designation is based on the existence of **"lockdown orders"** under **Section 2** of the same Act, which have been issued by provincial or territorial authorities for specific regions.

#### **2. Definition of "Lockdown Orders" (Section 2)**
- A "lockdown order" is defined as an order that:
  - Applies to a region (as specified in the annexed Order),
  - Imposes measures under **subparagraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii)** of the definition in Section 2,
  - Is in effect for **at least 14 consecutive days**.
- These measures typically include:
  - Restrictions on movement (e.g., stay-at-home orders),
  - Prohibitions on non-essential travel or gatherings,
  - Closure of non-essential businesses or public services.

#### **3. Public Interest Justification**
- The **Minister of Employment and Social Development** has determined that it is in the **public interest** to formally designate these affected regions as "lockdown regions."
- This designation is critical because it enables eligible workers to access the **Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit (CWL Benefit)**, a financial support program designed to assist individuals who are unable to work due to a lockdown or public health emergency.

#### **4. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary purpose of this **Lockdown Regions Designation Order (COVID-19)** is to:
  - Officially recognize regions under active lockdown conditions,
  - Provide clarity and legal authority for the eligibility of workers for the CWL Benefit,
  - Ensure timely and consistent access to financial support during public health emergencies.

#### **5. Scope of the Designation**
- The Order designates **specific regions of Canada** listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** attached to the regulation.
- Each region is designated as a **lockdown region** for a **specific benefit period** listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- The benefit period is aligned with the duration of the lockdown order, ensuring that financial support is available during the time when workers are unable to work due to public health restrictions.

#### **6. Legal Authority**
- The Order is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development**.
- This authority is derived from **Section 3** of the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit Act, which empowers the federal government to designate regions as lockdown regions when public health measures are in place.

#### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.
- This ensures immediate implementation upon publication, allowing for timely access to benefits for affected workers.

### **Key Implications and Outcomes**
- **Eligibility for the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit**: Workers residing in designated lockdown regions during the specified benefit period may be eligible for financial support, even if they are not employed in a traditional sense (e.g., self-employed, gig workers, or those in essential services).
- **Alignment with Public Health Measures**: The designation ensures that federal support is directly linked to actual public health restrictions, preventing overreach or misalignment with on-the-ground realities.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The schedule provides clear, publicly accessible information about which regions are affected and for how long, enhancing transparency in the administration of the benefit program.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a formal, legally binding mechanism to identify and support workers impacted by prolonged public health lockdowns due to the spread of COVID-19. By linking the designation of lockdown regions to existing provincial orders and public health measures, the government ensures that financial assistance is both timely and targeted—supporting workers during periods when they are unable to work due to government-imposed restrictions.
