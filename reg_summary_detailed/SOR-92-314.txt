**Detailed Summary of the Subsidiaries Holding Association Shares (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Background and Authority**  
These regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **paragraph 463(h) of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*** (*Act*). The purpose of the regulations is to allow cooperative credit associations (CCAs) to permit their subsidiaries to hold shares in the parent association, under specific conditions and limitations.

The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and are formally known as the **Subsidiaries Holding Association Shares (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**. They are referenced in the official publication *Statutes Canada*, 1991, Chapter 48 (S.C. 1991, c. 48).

**Key Definitions Used in the Regulations**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, the primary legislation governing cooperative credit associations in Canada. This Act establishes the structure, governance, and operational rules for such associations.

2. **"Distribution"**  
   Defined in subsection **268(3)** of the Act, a "distribution" refers to the issuance or sale of shares of an association to the public or to specific parties. This term is critical because it governs when exceptions to the share-holding limits apply.

3. **"Regulated Securities Entity"**  
   A financial institution whose primary business is dealing in securities and that is regulated in its securities activities by:
   - An Act of Parliament,
   - A provincial legislature, or  
   - The laws of a foreign country.  
   This definition ensures that only entities subject to formal regulatory oversight are eligible to hold shares in the parent association.

**Main Provisions**

### 1. **General Limit on Share Holdings by Subsidiaries**  
Under **paragraph 78(b)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, subject to the provisions of **section 4**, an association may allow a subsidiary that is a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares of the association — **provided** that:

- The **aggregate value** of all shares held by such subsidiaries (excluding shares referred to in **section 80** of the Act)  
- Does **not exceed 1% of the regulatory capital** of the parent association.

> 🔍 *Regulatory Capital*: This refers to the capital amount required by law to ensure the financial stability and solvency of the cooperative credit association. The 1% cap ensures that subsidiary shareholding remains minimal and does not impair the independence or financial integrity of the parent association.

> ⚠️ *Exclusion of Section 80 Shares*: Shares mentioned in section 80 of the Act (typically shares held by members or in connection with specific governance or distribution arrangements) are excluded from the 1% limit, allowing for flexibility in certain member-related share structures.

### 2. **Exception During a Share Distribution**  
When a subsidiary of an association is a regulated securities entity and is acting as a **securities underwriter** in connection with a **distribution of shares** (i.e., a public offering or share issuance), the association may **temporarily permit** the subsidiary to hold shares **in excess of the 1% limit** set in section 3.

> ✅ *This exception applies only during the period of the distribution*, and it ends once the distribution is fully concluded.

> 💡 *Purpose*: This provision supports the financial and operational needs of underwriting activities. It allows subsidiaries to hold shares temporarily to facilitate the issuance process (e.g., to cover underwriting costs, ensure market stability, or support investor confidence), without violating the general capital preservation rule.

**Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Enhances Financial Flexibility**: Allows cooperative credit associations to leverage their subsidiaries—especially those engaged in securities markets—to support share issuances or capital raising activities.
  
- **Maintains Financial Stability**: The 1% cap on subsidiary shareholding protects the parent association from excessive ownership concentration by subsidiaries, which could lead to conflicts of interest or loss of independence.

- **Regulatory Oversight**: The requirement that subsidiaries be *regulated securities entities* ensures that only entities with appropriate oversight and compliance frameworks are allowed to hold shares, reducing risks related to mismanagement or fraud.

- **Supports Market Participation**: The underwriting exception enables subsidiaries to play a more active role in capital markets, particularly during share offerings, which can improve access to capital and investor engagement.

---

**Limitations and Restrictions**

- The rules do **not apply to all subsidiaries** — only those that are **regulated securities entities**.
- The 1% limit applies to **aggregate holdings** across all such subsidiaries.
- The exception during a distribution is **time-bound** and ceases once the distribution ends.
- Shares held under section 80 of the Act are **exempt** from the 1% cap.

---

**Conclusion**

These regulations provide a balanced and risk-managed framework that allows cooperative credit associations to engage with their regulated subsidiaries in shareholding activities. While permitting subsidiaries to hold shares (a previously restricted practice), they do so under strict conditions designed to:

- Protect the financial integrity of the parent association,  
- Ensure transparency and accountability,  
- Support legitimate market activities such as underwriting, and  
- Align with broader regulatory standards for financial institutions.

The rules reflect a pragmatic approach to modernizing cooperative financial structures while maintaining safeguards against potential conflicts of interest and financial risk.
