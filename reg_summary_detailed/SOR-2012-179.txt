**Detailed Summary of the CJFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Enactment**

The *CJFTA Rules of Origin Regulations* were formally issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules governing the origin of goods for the purposes of preferential trade treatment under a free trade agreement.

The regulation is part of the legal framework implementing the **Canada–Jordan Economic Growth and Prosperity Act (CJGPA)**, specifically under **Section 34(1)** of *S.C. 2001, c. 28* (the *Customs Tariff*), and is further supported by the enactment of *S.C. 1997, c. 36*, which provides foundational authority for origin rules in Canadian trade law.

**2. Applicable Provisions of the Canada–Jordan Free Trade Agreement (CJFTA)**

These Regulations give legal effect in Canada to specific provisions of the **Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan**, signed on **June 28, 2009**. The following provisions are incorporated into Canadian law and are deemed to have the force of law:

- **Articles 4-1 and 4-2**: These establish the general principles of origin determination.  
  - Article 4-1 defines the concept of "origin" as the country where the good is produced or manufactured.  
  - Article 4-2 outlines the requirement that goods must meet certain criteria to qualify as originating under the agreement, including the application of rules of origin that ensure the product is substantially transformed in one of the two member countries (Canada or Jordan).

- **Article 4-3, paragraph 1**: This provides the **"substantial transformation"** rule, which requires that a product undergo a significant change in form, character, or nature during production or manufacturing in one of the two countries to qualify as originating. It sets the threshold for determining whether a good has been transformed to the extent necessary to be considered "originating."

- **Articles 4-4 to 4-13**: These constitute a comprehensive set of **rules of origin** that specify the conditions under which goods may be considered originating, including:
  - **Value-added rules** (e.g., a product must contain a certain percentage of value added in Canada or Jordan),
  - **Processing rules** (e.g., goods must be processed in one of the two countries for a specified duration or to a certain degree),
  - **Exclusions and exceptions** (e.g., certain inputs or components from third countries are excluded from qualifying as originating),
  - **Rules for intermediate goods** (e.g., how materials used in production are treated),
  - **Rules for goods manufactured in one country and then exported to the other** (including reprocessing or reassembly).

- **Article 4-15**: This provision addresses **the treatment of goods that are not originating**—such as those that contain significant amounts of non-originating inputs—and sets out the conditions under which such goods may still be eligible for preferential treatment, or when they are subject to full tariff rates.

- **Annex 4-1**: This is a **detailed technical annex** that provides specific examples, definitions, and illustrations of the rules of origin. It includes:
  - Schedules for specific product categories (e.g., textiles, machinery, vehicles, agricultural products),
  - Clarifications on how to apply the rules in practice,
  - Examples of qualifying and non-qualifying goods,
  - Guidance on documentation and certification requirements for origin claims.

**3. Effective Date**

The Regulations come into force on the day that **Section 32 of the Canada–Jordan Economic Growth and Prosperity Act (CJGPA), Chapter 18 of the Statutes of Canada, 2012**, comes into force.  
This section of the Act is the enabling legislation that authorizes the implementation of the CJFTA, and its activation triggers the legal effect of the Rules of Origin Regulations.

**Note**: The regulations are noted to be in force as of **October 1, 2012**, which is the date when the CJGPA and its associated provisions were formally enacted and came into effect.

**4. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of these Rules of Origin Regulations is to:

- Ensure that **only goods that are genuinely produced or manufactured in Canada or Jordan** qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the CJFTA.
- Prevent **tariff dumping** or **misuse of origin rules** by allowing only products that meet clearly defined thresholds of transformation or value addition.
- Provide **clarity and consistency** for Canadian importers, exporters, and customs authorities in determining whether a product qualifies as "originating."
- Facilitate **fair and transparent trade relations** between Canada and Jordan by establishing predictable, rule-based criteria for origin.

**5. Key Implications for Trade**

- **Canadian exporters** must ensure that goods exported to Jordan (or vice versa) meet the rules of origin to benefit from reduced or eliminated tariffs.
- **Importers in Canada** may be required to verify the origin of goods imported from Jordan to determine if they are eligible for preferential treatment.
- **Customs authorities** in Canada use these rules to assess origin claims and determine whether goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment.
- The rules may require **certification** (e.g., by a designated authority or trade body) to prove compliance with the origin criteria.

**Conclusion**

The *CJFTA Rules of Origin Regulations* are a critical component of Canada’s implementation of the Canada–Jordan Free Trade Agreement. By incorporating and giving legal force to specific provisions of the agreement—particularly those related to substantial transformation, value addition, and product classification—the regulations establish a transparent, enforceable, and equitable framework for determining the origin of goods. This ensures that trade benefits under the agreement are accessible only to products that are genuinely produced in either Canada or Jordan, thereby promoting fair competition and sustainable economic growth in both countries.

These regulations are effective from **October 1, 2012**, and remain in force as part of Canada’s broader trade policy with Jordan.
