The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2008-15"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2008/15** has been formally repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Title/Reference**: Statutory Instrument 2008 No. 15 (SI/2008-15)  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument, typically issued by the UK Government (or relevant devolved authority, depending on jurisdiction), and the exact date of repeal is generally specified in the repealing instrument.

### Background and Context:
Statutory Instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation used in the United Kingdom to implement or amend primary legislation. SI 2008/15 was originally introduced to provide specific regulatory provisions, likely in a sector such as health, education, environmental protection, transport, or public administration — though the precise subject matter is not specified in the reference alone.

Since the instrument is marked as **"repealed"**, it means that:
- The regulation was no longer in force.
- It was replaced by another piece of legislation, either through a new SI or by amendment to primary legislation.
- The repeal may have been due to:
  - Obsolescence (outdated or no longer relevant).
  - Merger or consolidation of regulations.
  - A more comprehensive or updated regulatory framework being introduced.
  - A decision by the government to streamline or simplify the regulatory environment.

### Key Implications:
- **Legal Effect**: Any legal obligations, duties, or prohibitions previously set out in SI 2008/15 are no longer enforceable.
- **No Further Application**: The regulation cannot be cited or applied in any legal proceedings or administrative decisions.
- **Replacement**: The content of SI 2008/15 was likely absorbed into another current regulation or primary law. To understand what replaced it, one would need to consult the **repealing statutory instrument** (e.g., SI 2008/XX, or a later SI that explicitly cites the repeal).

### How to Find the Details:
To obtain the full content and context of SI 2008/15 and the reason for its repeal:
1. Access the **UK Statutory Instruments database** (https://www.legislation.gov.uk).
2. Search for **"SI 2008/15"**.
3. Look for the **repealing instrument** (e.g., SI 2008/XX or SI 2010/XX) that explicitly references the repeal.
4. Review the **explanatory notes** or **government statement** accompanying the repeal to understand the rationale.

### Conclusion:
**SI 2008/15 has been formally repealed** and is no longer in legal force. It was likely replaced by a more modern, relevant, or comprehensive regulation. Without access to the full text of the original SI and the repealing instrument, the exact subject matter and reasons for repeal remain unspecified. For a detailed understanding, consultation of the official UK legislation database is required.
