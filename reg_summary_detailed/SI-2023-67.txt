**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Remission Order for Supplemental Benefits Received by Three Governor in Council Appointees Within the Department of Employment and Social Development*

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**, as amended and referenced in *S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*. This provision allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Cabinet) to remit (i.e., cancel or forgive) supplemental benefits that were received due to administrative error.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of this remission order is to **rectify an administrative error** in the payment of supplemental benefits to three specific individuals who were appointed to key positions within the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD). The government determines that collecting these benefits would be **unreasonable and unjust**, given that the payments were the result of a clerical or procedural error — not a result of the appointees' actions or eligibility.

**Appointees and Positions Affected:**  
The remission applies to the following three individuals:

1. **The Chairperson and the Member with particular responsibilities for children’s issues**  
   - **Period Covered:**  
     - As **full-time members of the National Advisory Council on Poverty**, beginning in **April 2021**.  
     - Plus their **prior tenure as Ministerial appointees** under the *Department of Employment and Social Development Act*, from **September 2019 to March 2021**.  
   - **Reason for Remission:**  
     These individuals were mistakenly assigned supplemental benefits during their service on the Council and in prior ministerial roles, due to administrative misclassification or oversight. The remission is granted because the benefits were not earned under proper policy or eligibility criteria and were the result of an error.

2. **The Chief Accessibility Officer**  
   - **Period Covered:**  
     Since her appointment to the **full-time position in May 2022**.  
   - **Reason for Remission:**  
     The Chief Accessibility Officer was also erroneously granted supplemental benefits due to an administrative oversight in the eligibility or classification of her role. The remission ensures fairness and consistency in benefit administration.

**Key Legal and Policy Principles Underlying the Order:**

- **Administrative Error:** The benefits were not awarded based on merit or eligibility but due to a procedural or classification error within the government’s benefit system.
- **Unreasonableness and Unjustness:** The government has concluded that collecting these benefits would be both unreasonable (due to the nature of the error) and unjust (as the appointees were not entitled to them under the rules).
- **Procedural Compliance:** The order follows the established process under the Financial Administration Act, which requires recommendation from the **Treasury Board**, the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, and the **Minister of Families, Children and Social Development** — all of whom have endorsed the remission.

**Scope and Limitations:**  
- The remission is **limited to the specific individuals** named and the **specific time periods** outlined.
- It applies **only to the supplemental benefits** that were erroneously received.
- It does **not affect** any other benefits, entitlements, or compensation received by these individuals.
- The remission does **not imply approval** of the prior benefit payments as valid — rather, it acknowledges the error and removes the financial obligation to repay them.

**Implications and Significance:**  
- This order reflects a commitment to **transparency, accountability, and fairness** in government financial administration.
- It demonstrates that the federal government will take corrective action when errors occur, particularly when those errors affect individuals in advisory or non-executive roles who may not have been intended to receive such benefits.
- It reinforces the principle that **benefit payments must be based on clear eligibility criteria**, and that administrative errors should not result in financial liability for individuals.

**Conclusion:**  
This remission order is a targeted, legally grounded correction to an administrative error. It provides relief to three individuals who were mistakenly granted supplemental benefits due to misclassification or procedural oversight. By remitting these benefits, the government upholds the integrity of its financial systems and ensures that no individual is unfairly burdened by errors that were not their fault. The decision is consistent with established principles of justice and administrative accountability under the Financial Administration Act.
