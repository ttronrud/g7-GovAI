### **Conditions for Remission (Section 3)**

Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to specific administrative and procedural conditions:

1. **Information Sharing Requirement**  
   The **Government of the United States must provide the Minister of National Revenue** with such information as may be required for the proper administration and monitoring of this Order. This ensures transparency and enables Canada to verify compliance.

2. **Prevention of Unauthorized Supply**  
   For goods described in paragraphs (c), (d), or (e), **American authorities must implement administrative measures** to prevent these goods or services from being resold or supplied to individuals **not included** in the protected categories (e.g., non-military personnel, civilians engaged in business).  
   → This prevents abuse of the remission and ensures that only eligible persons benefit.

3. **Timely Claim Submission for Duties (Section 32 of the Customs Act)**  
   A claim for remission of duties (including the tax under Division III of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*) on imported goods must be submitted to the Minister **within two years** after the final accounting for those goods under section 32 of the *Customs Act*.  
   → This establishes a clear deadline for claims and ensures accountability.

4. **Timely Claim Submission for Other Taxes**  
   For **any tax** (other than duties) under the *Excise Tax Act* (e.g., excise taxes on fuel, alcohol, or other goods), a claim for remission must be made to the Minister **within two years** after:
   - The **purchase** of the goods, or  
   - The **supply** of the service, as applicable.

> These deadlines ensure that claims are made promptly and prevent long-term tax liabilities.
