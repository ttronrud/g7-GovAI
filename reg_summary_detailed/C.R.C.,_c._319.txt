### **3. Establishment of the Pension Account**

- A dedicated account, the **Annuities Agents Pension Account**, is established within the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
- All contributions and benefits are managed through this account.

---

### **4. Contribution Requirements**

- Every agent must contribute **5% of their annual earnings** from **current service** (i.e., service on or after October 1, 1961).
- Contributions are **automatically deducted from earnings** (reserved from earnings).

---

### **5. Interest and Funding Mechanism**

Each fiscal year, on the last day of each quarter (June, September, December, March), the following amounts are credited to the account:

1. **Interest**:  
   - 1% annual interest calculated on the balance at the end of the preceding quarter.  
   - This interest is applied to the **current service balance**.

2. **Cost Coverage**:  
   - An amount determined by the **Minister of Finance** to cover the cost of benefits due to **current service contributors**.  
   - An estimated amount to cover the cost of benefits due to **past service contributors**.

> *Note:* The interest and funding are designed to ensure the financial sustainability of the pension system.

---

### **6. Calculation of Annual Earnings (for benefit determination)**

For determining annuity amounts, **average annual earnings** are calculated as follows:

- If the contributor has **at least 6 years of past service** before turning 65:  
  → Average of earnings over the **six years immediately preceding age 65**.

- If the contributor has **less than 6 years of past service** before age 65:  
  → Average of earnings during the **entire period of past service**.

- If the contributor had **less than 6 years of past service before age 65** but now has **6+ years total past service**:  
  → Average of earnings during the **first 6 years of past service**.

---

### **7. Annuity Payment Formula**

The total annuity payable is the sum of two components:

#### **A. Current Service Component**
- 1.5% of annual earnings **not exceeding $6,000**  
- 1% of annual earnings **in excess of $6,000**  
- Multiplied by the number of **years of current service**.

#### **B. Past Service Component**
- 0.75% of average annual earnings **not exceeding $6,000**  
- 0.5% of average annual earnings **in excess of $6,000**  
- Multiplied by the number of **years of past service**.

> *Example*: A contributor with 10 years of current service and 15 years of past service, earning $8,000 annually, would have:
> - Current: (1.5% × $6,000) + (1% × $2,000) × 10 = $1,050  
> - Past: (0.75% × $6,000) + (0.5% × $2,000) × 15 = $900  
> - Total annuity = $1,950 per year

### **8. Special Provision for Agents Who Ceased Service Before the Effective Date**

For agents who stopped working before October 1, 1961 and later joined the Government Annuities Branch:

- Entitled to an **immediate annuity** upon:
  - Leaving the Public Service, or
  - Reaching age 65 — whichever occurs **later**.

> This ensures continuity of benefits for those who transitioned into the new system.

---

### **9. Entitlements Upon Cessation of Employment**

#### **A. Less Than 5 Years of Service**
- Entitled to a **return of contributions** (full refund, no interest).

#### **B. Five or More Years of Service**

| Scenario | Entitlement |
|--------|-------------|
| Ceases before age 65, not due to misconduct | Option to choose: <br> - Immediate annuity <br> - Deferred annuity (paid at age 65) <br> - Return of contributions |
| Ceases before age 65, due to **disability** | Option to choose: <br> - Immediate annuity <br> - Return of contributions |
| Ceases before age 60, not due to disability or misconduct | Option to choose: <br> - Deferred annuity <br> - Return of contributions |
| Becomes disabled before age 65 and was entitled to a deferred annuity | **Loses deferred annuity**, gains **immediate annuity** |
| Ceases due to **misconduct** | Option to choose: <br> - Return of contributions <br> - With Treasury Board consent, a portion of the benefit (but not less than return of contributions) |

> *Note:* If a contributor fails to exercise their option within **one year** of becoming entitled, they are **deemed to have chosen a deferred annuity** if available; otherwise, they are deemed to have chosen a benefit other than return of contributions.

---

### **10. Death Benefits**

#### **A. Contributor with Less Than 5 Years of Service at Death**
- Widow immediately entitled to **return of contributions**.

#### **B. Contributor with 5+ Years of Service at Death**

| Case | Benefit to Widow |
|------|------------------|
| Entitled to immediate annuity | Annual allowance = **half** of the annuity amount |
| Entitled to deferred annuity | Annual allowance = **half** of the deferred annuity amount |
| Entitled to immediate annuity (actuarial equivalent of deferred) | Annual allowance = **half** of the deferred annuity value |

> *Special Rule*: If the contributor was entitled to an annuity immediately before death, the widow gets half of it regardless of whether it was immediate or deferred.

#### **C. Widow’s Allowance Suspension and Resumption**
- Payments are **suspended upon remarriage**.
- Payments **resume upon the death of the remarried spouse**.
- Upon remarriage, the widow may request a **lump-sum payment** equal to:
  > (Return of contributions) – (Total amounts already paid to contributor or widow)

> This provides a final settlement if the widow remarries and no longer qualifies for the allowance.

#### **D. Deemed Predecease of Widow**
- If the Treasury Board determines that the widow lived apart from the contributor for a long period and would not have been entitled to separate maintenance, she is **deemed to have predeceased** the contributor.
- This affects eligibility for widow’s benefits.

#### **E. Reductions in Widow’s Allowance**

1. **If the contributor died within 5 years
