**Detailed Summary of the Seasonal Residents’ Remission Order, 1991 (C.R.C., c. 788)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Seasonal Residents’ Remission Order, 1991* (C.R.C., c. 788) is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act**, specifically **section 23**, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**. This Order serves to **repeal the previous Seasonal Residents’ Remission Order** (C.R.C., c. 788) and replace it with a new, updated version that provides a **remission (exemption)** of certain duties and taxes on goods imported by **seasonal residents** into Canada.

The primary objective of this Order is to **promote fairness and practicality** in the taxation of household goods brought into Canada by non-residents who occupy seasonal residences—particularly those who come to Canada for a limited period each year (e.g., for work, tourism, or seasonal living).

### **Key Provisions and Definitions**

#### **1. Repeal of Previous Provisions**
- The term **"duties"** has been formally **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument SI/98-20, section 2**, meaning it is no longer applicable in this Order. This reflects a broader update in tax terminology and structure.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Household effects** | Refers to furniture and personal goods found in a home, as well as tools and equipment used for home maintenance. <br> **Exclusions**: Construction materials, electrical fixtures, or any goods permanently attached or incorporated into a home. <br> *In French: "effets domestiques"* |
| **Seasonal resident** | A person who is **not a resident of Canada** and either:<br> - Leases a residence in Canada for **three years or more**, or<br> - Owns a residence in Canada for **seasonal use** (e.g., summer home), **excluding** time-sharing residences or mobile homes. <br> *In French: "résident saisonnier"* |

### **Eligibility for Tax Remission**

A seasonal resident is entitled to a **remission of duties and taxes** under **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act*, and any other relevant parts of the Act, **if** the following conditions are met:

#### **Conditions for Remission:**

1. **Personal Use Only**  
   The household effects must be imported **for the personal use** of the seasonal resident or their family.  
   → They must **not** be intended for commercial, industrial, occupational, or any other non-personal purpose.

2. **Ownership and Pre-Existing Possession**  
   The household effects must:
   - Be **owned by the seasonal resident or their family**, and  
   - Have been **in the possession and use** of the resident or their family **before** the resident’s first arrival in Canada to occupy the seasonal residence.

3. **Retention Period**  
   The household effects must **not be sold or otherwise disposed of in Canada** for **at least one full year** after their importation.

> ⚠️ **Important Limitation**: A seasonal resident is entitled to **only one remission** under this Order, regardless of how many times they may bring in household effects.

### **Importation and Documentation Requirements**

- **Timing of Importation**  
  Household effects must be imported **at the time of the seasonal resident’s first arrival** in Canada to occupy the seasonal residence.

- **Customs Accounting Document**  
  All eligible household effects must be **listed on a customs accounting document** submitted to Canadian customs authorities.

- **Exception for Delayed Importation**  
  If household effects are **not imported at the time of first arrival**, they must be **clearly identified** on the customs accounting document as **"household effects to follow"** (i.e., to be imported later).

> This provision allows flexibility for residents who may not be able to bring all items at the initial arrival, but ensures that the remission is only granted when the goods are genuinely part of the resident’s personal household and not commercial in nature.

---

### **Scope of Tax Relief**

The remission applies to:
- Taxes imposed under **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act* (which governs duties on imported goods such as household items).
- Any **other part of the Excise Tax Act** that may apply to the importation of these goods.

This means that the relief covers both **excise taxes** and potentially **duty obligations** associated with the importation of household effects.

---

### **Legal Authority and Citation**

- **Authority**: Section 23 of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations for the administration of public revenue.
- **Issued by**: The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board.
- **Citation**: The Order may be cited as the *Seasonal Residents’ Remission Order, 1991*.

---

### **Policy Objectives and Public Interest Rationale**

The Order is introduced to:
- **Support seasonal residents** who are not permanent residents of Canada but still maintain a home and personal belongings in Canada.
- Prevent **unfair taxation** of personal property that is used for domestic living, especially when the resident has already owned and used the goods prior to arrival.
- Ensure **clarity and consistency** in the treatment of household goods versus commercial or industrial goods.
- Promote **economic fairness** by recognizing the personal nature of such imports, rather than treating them as commercial transactions.

### **Key Implications for Seasonal Residents**

| Implication | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ Tax Exemption | Residents may avoid paying import duties and excise taxes on qualifying household effects. |
| ❌ No Commercial Use | Goods used for business or professional purposes are not eligible. |
| ❌ No Disposal Within 1 Year | Selling or transferring household effects within one year after importation disqualifies them from remission. |
| ❌ One-Time Benefit | Only one remission is allowed per resident lifetime under this Order. |
| ⏳ Must Be Imported at First Arrival | Most goods must be brought in upon initial entry; delayed items must be labeled accordingly. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Seasonal Residents’ Remission Order, 1991* is a targeted, fair, and practical regulation designed to **balance tax compliance with the realities of seasonal living** in Canada. It ensures that non-residents who maintain a seasonal home and bring in personal household goods are not unduly burdened by import duties, provided those goods meet strict criteria of personal use, pre-existing ownership, and retention.

By clearly defining what qualifies as "household effects," setting limits on eligibility, and requiring proper documentation, the Order provides **clarity, accountability, and fairness** in the application of excise and duty laws to seasonal residents.
