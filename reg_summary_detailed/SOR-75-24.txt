**Detailed Summary of the Home Buyer Grant Regulations (1974)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Home Buyer Grant Regulations* were established by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of State for Urban Affairs, under **Vote 12b** in the *Appropriation Act, No. 4, 1974*. These regulations define the eligibility criteria, conditions, and calculation method for a financial grant (referred to as a "grant") provided to individuals who purchase or build a new housing unit in Canada.

The regulations are formally titled the **Home Buyer Grant Regulations** and may be cited as such.

A grant may be issued to an individual **only if** one of the following applies:

1. **Purchase or Construction of a Housing Unit**  
   The individual has purchased or built a housing unit.

2. **Membership in a Cooperative Housing Corporation**

### **Conditions for Grant Approval**

No grant will be issued unless all of the following conditions are met:

1. **First-Time Occupancy Requirement**  
   - The housing unit must **not have been previously occupied**.  
   - The individual must have **occupied the unit for the first time after October 31, 1974**.

2. **Land Ownership or Long-Term Leasehold Interest**  
   The individual must have:
   - A **freehold interest** or **right to acquire freehold interest**, or  
   - A **leasehold interest** or **licence with a term of at least five years**  
   in respect of the land on which the housing unit is located.

3. **Compliance with Building Codes**  
   The individual must provide:
   - A **building permit** or other evidence acceptable to the Corporation  
   - Demonstrating that the housing unit complies with **current building codes** in force in the area where it is located.

4. **Mobile Home Standards (if applicable)**  
   If the housing unit is a **mobile home**, it must conform to specific standards issued by the **Canadian Standards Association (CSA)**:
   - CSA Standard Z240.5-1971  
   - CSA Standard Z240.1-1972  
   - CSA Standard Z240.0-1973  
   - CSA Standard Z240.3.1-1973  
   - CSA Standard Z240.5.1-1973  

   These standards ensure structural, safety, and habitability requirements are met.

### **Loan and Grant Interaction (Cooperative Housing)**

If the Corporation makes a **loan under Section 15 of the National Housing Act** to a **non-profit cooperative association** (as defined in paragraph 15.1(1)(b) of that Act) for a housing project that includes the unit in question, then:
- The grant amount will be **applied toward the reduction of the loan**.
- This ensures that cooperative housing projects receive financial support both through grants and direct lending.

---

### **Calculation of Grant Amount**

The grant amount is determined based on the **cost or purchase price** of the housing unit:

#### **Case 1: Unit Cost ≤ Minimum Required for Maximum Loan Insurance**
- If the cost of the housing unit does **not exceed** the minimum cost required by the Corporation to insure a maximum loan under the *National Housing Act*,  
  → **Grant = $500**

#### **Case 2: Unit Cost > Minimum Required for Maximum Loan Insurance**
- If the cost **exceeds** the minimum threshold,  
  → **Grant = $500 minus $1 for each dollar of excess**

##### Example:
- Suppose the minimum required cost for loan insurance is $20,000.
- If the unit costs $25,000:
  - Excess = $5,000
  - Grant = $500 – $5,000 = **–$4,500** → *This would not be valid.*

> **Important Interpretation**:  
> The formula implies that the grant **reduces** as the unit price increases, but **cannot go below zero**.  
> Therefore, in practice, the grant is **zero** if the unit cost exceeds the threshold by more than $500.  
> However, the regulation does not explicitly state a floor of zero, so it is likely intended that the grant is **only available up to the maximum allowable cost**.

> In real-world application, this means:
> - The grant is **only available for units priced below or equal to the insurance threshold**.
> - For units above that threshold, the grant is **zero** (implied by the structure of the formula).

> This effectively **caps the benefit** and ensures that the grant is not used to subsidize expensive housing.

### **Key Objectives and Policy Intent**

1. **Promote Affordable Housing**  
   The grant aims to make homeownership accessible to individuals who did not own a home before November 1, 1974.

2. **Encourage First-Time Homeownership**  
   The requirement that the individual must occupy the unit **after October 31, 1974** ensures that the program supports new entrants into homeownership.

3. **Ensure Housing Quality and Safety**  
   Mandates compliance with building codes and mobile home standards ensure that recipients receive safe, habitable homes.

4. **Support Cooperative Housing Models**  
   Recognizes cooperative ownership as a viable path to homeownership, especially in community-based or affordable housing settings.

5. **Limit Financial Risk for CMHC**  
   By capping the grant based on loan insurance thresholds, the Corporation limits its exposure and ensures that only cost-effective, insurable housing projects receive support.

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Time-bound eligibility**: Only applies to those who were not homeowners before November 1, 1974.
- **Price-based cap**: The grant diminishes with higher unit prices, effectively discouraging very expensive purchases.
- **No provision for income or credit history**: No mention of income level, credit score, or debt-to-income ratio — indicating a basic, accessible program focused on first-time buyers.
- **No mention of down payment or mortgage terms**: The grant is a one-time payment, not tied to mortgage interest or repayment.
- **Outdated standards**: The referenced CSA standards (from 1971–1973) are obsolete today and would not meet modern safety or accessibility standards.

### **Conclusion**

The *Home Buyer Grant Regulations* of 1974 represent a foundational piece of Canadian housing policy designed to promote **first-time homeownership** among individuals who had not previously owned a home. By establishing clear eligibility, quality standards, and a price-sensitive grant structure, the regulations aimed to balance affordability with financial risk management for the federal housing corporation (CMHC).

While the framework is historically significant and reflects early efforts to expand homeownership access, the regulations are **outdated** in terms of standards and structure. Modern equivalents (such as the *Home Buyer’s Plan*
