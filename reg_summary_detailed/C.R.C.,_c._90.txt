### **Detailed Summary of the Lakehead Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is formally titled:  
**"Lakehead Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
These regulations may be cited as such and are designed to establish zoning and land-use restrictions in areas adjacent to and in the vicinity of **Lakehead Airport**, located in **Thunder Bay, Ontario**.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Lakehead Airport**, Thunder Bay, Ontario.  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A precise geographic point defined in **Part I of the Schedule**. It serves as the reference elevation and location for all height restrictions.  
- **Horizontal Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point**. This surface forms the base of height limitations for most land parcels.  
- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that extends from the ends of designated runways (strips).  
  - It begins at the **strip ends** and slopes upward and outward.
  - Dimensions vary by runway:
    - For **runway 12–30**:
      - 550 feet on each side at the strip ends.
      - 1,250 feet on each side at outer ends.
      - Outer end of approach 12: 200 feet above elevation at strip end.
      - Outer end of approach 30: 250 feet above elevation at strip end.
      - Horizontal distance from strip end: 10,000 feet.
    - For **runway 7–25**:
      - 550 feet on each side at strip ends.
      - 2,000 feet on each side at outer ends.
      - Outer ends: 200 feet above strip end elevation.
      - Horizontal distance: 10,000 feet.
- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from the **outer lateral limits** of a strip and its approach surface, rising upward to meet the **horizontal surface** or another transitional surface.  
  - Slope: **1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally** (i.e., 1:7 gradient).
  - **Exception**: The transitional surface associated with **runway 2–20 is excluded** from this rule (no specific gradient defined).

> *Note:* All surfaces are described in detail on **Plan No. T2173**, dated **September 16, 1964**, and recorded in the Department of Transport.

---

#### **3. Elevation Reference**
- The **airport reference point is deemed to be 635 feet above sea level**.  
- This elevation is used as the foundation for calculating all height restrictions, including the horizontal surface (150 feet above ARP) and approach surfaces.

---

#### **4. Geographic Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all lands**, including **public road allowances**, located:
- **Adjacent to or in the vicinity of Lakehead Airport**,  
- As **specifically described in Part II of the Schedule**.

The area is defined in two primary parcels:

---

##### **Parcel A: South of the Kaministiqua River**
- Located in **Concession 1, South of the Kaministiqua River**.
- Includes:
  - Lots 11 through 20 (inclusive).
  - The **allowance for road** along the **South bank** of the Kaministiqua River.
  - Portions of road allowances between Lots 15 and 16.
  - Subdivision plans registered in the Registry Office (Plans 689 and 695).

> **Boundary Description**:
> Starts at the **southeasterly angle of Lot 11**, proceeds **westward** along the southern boundary of the concession to the **southwesterly angle of Lot 20**, then **northerly** to the **natural high water mark** of the Kaministiqua River, then **easterly** along the high water mark to the **production northerly of the eastern boundary of Lot 11**, and finally **southerly** back to the starting point.

---

##### **Parcel B: North of the Kaministiqua River**
- Covers a large, contiguous area across **Concessions 1 to 5**, all **north of the river**.
- Includes:
  - All of the following lots: 11 through 23, and lot "A" in Concessions 1–5.
  - All **subdivision plans** registered in the Registry Office (Plans 680, 693, 694, 682, 687, 684, 679, 658, 305, 781, 704, 728, 714, 692, 743, 783, 185, 742, 738, 744, 254, 578, 255, 180, 726, 218, 639, 698, 281, 289, 215).
  - All **road allowances** between:
    - Lots 15 and 16, and between 20 and 21.
    - Between Concessions 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 5.
    - Between the Township of Neebing and the Township of McIntyre (specifically involving mineral locations).
  - Includes **mineral locations**:
    - Jean Langlois
    - John C. T. Cochrane
    - J. J. Vickers
  - Includes **all allowances for roads** along the **north bank** of the river.

> **Boundary Description**:
> Begins at the **northwesterly angle of Lot 23 in Concession 5**, proceeds **southerly** along the western boundary of Lot 23 (through Concessions 5, 4, 3, and 2), across the road allowance between Concessions 3 and 4, to the **northwesterly angle of Lot 23 in Concession 3**, and continues in a southerly direction along the western boundary of that lot.

> **Exemption**: The entire **Kaministiqua River** within the described parcel is **excluded** from the regulation's application.

#### **5. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on any land subject to these regulations,
- If the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following **prohibited surfaces** at the location of that point:

1. **Horizontal Surface**  
   - 150 feet above the airport reference point (635 feet = 785 feet above sea level).  
   - Applies to all land within the defined parcels.

2. **Approach Surfaces**  
   - For runways 12–30 and 7–25:
     - The approach surfaces extend **outward from the runway ends**.
     - They define a **sloping boundary** that increases in height with distance from the runway.
     - These are critical for **aviation safety**, preventing obstructions to aircraft during landing and takeoff.

3. **Transitional Surfaces**  
   - Slope of **1 vertical foot per 7 horizontal feet** from the outer edges of the runway and its approach surface.
   - Applies to all strips **except runway 2–20**, which has no transitional surface specified.

> These surfaces project **immediately over and above** the land surface at each location. Any structure exceeding these limits is prohibited.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- Ensure **aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during approach, landing, and takeoff.
- Maintain **clear airspace** around the airport, particularly near runways and approach paths.
- Provide a **clear, legally defined boundary** for land use, ensuring consistency and enforceability.

The height limits are based on **aeronautical engineering standards**, designed to protect aircraft from visual and physical obstructions during critical flight phases.

---

#### **7. Legal and Administrative Notes**

- **Revocation Note**: The term "Minister" was previously referenced in the regulation but has been **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, Section 2**. This indicates that the regulatory authority may have been transferred or replaced.
- **Plan Reference**: All spatial boundaries are tied to **Plan No. T2173 (1964)**, which is recorded in the **Department of Transport**. This plan is essential for legal enforcement and interpretation.
- **Public Road Allowances**: These are included in the scope, meaning even roads adjacent to the airport are subject to height restrictions.
