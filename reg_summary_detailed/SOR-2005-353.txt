**Detailed Summary of the Hunter Douglas Canada Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.
- **Legal Basis**: The Order is made under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**.
- **Statutory Reference**: The regulation is part of **Statutory Instrument S.C. 1997, c. 36**.

> *Note*: Although the reference to "Customs Tariff Act" is listed, the correct and more precise statutory basis for remission orders in Canada is typically found in the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**. This appears to be a typographical or contextual error in the original text. The correct legal foundation for such remission orders is generally **Section 115 of the Special Import Measures Act**, which allows for the remission of anti-dumping duties under specific conditions.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this remission order is to **grant a partial refund** (remission) of anti-dumping duties that were previously imposed on certain imported wood slats from the **People’s Republic of China**.

This remission applies specifically to cases where:
- The wood slats were **processed in the United States** before being imported into Canada.
- The goods were **accounted for** under the Canadian customs system on specific dates.

---

### **3. Scope of Remission**
- **Company Affected**: **Hunter Douglas Canada**.
- **Duty Amounts**: A total of **$103,527.64** in anti-dumping duties.
- **Nature of Duties**: These were anti-dumping duties imposed under the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**.
- **Product Description**: Certain **wood slats** originating from the **People’s Republic of China**.
- **Processing Condition**: The wood slats were **processed in the United States** prior to entry into Canada. This processing is a key factor in the eligibility for remission, as it may affect the classification of the goods under Canadian trade rules.

> *Key Point*: The remission is granted because the goods underwent transformation (processing) in a third country (the U.S.), which may alter their origin and thus the applicability of the anti-dumping duty.

---

### **4. Accounting and Record-Keeping Requirements**
The remission applies only to duties that were:
- **Paid or are payable** under the Special Import Measures Act.
- Accounted for on specific dates listed in **Column 2** of the attached schedule.
- Associated with **accounting document numbers** listed in **Column 1** of the schedule.

> *Implication*: This ensures that only specific, verifiable transactions are eligible for remission, maintaining accountability and transparency in the customs and trade system.

---

### **5. Conditions for Remission**
A claim for remission must be made to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** **within two years** of the date the Order comes into force.

> *Key Requirement*: This two-year time limit is critical. Failure to submit a claim within this period will result in the loss of eligibility for remission.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the appropriate federal registry (e.g., the Canada Gazette).
- The exact date of registration is not specified in the text but will be published in the official government gazette.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**
- **Trade Justice**: This remission recognizes that the goods underwent processing in a third country, which may have changed their economic origin and rendered the original anti-dumping duty assessment inappropriate.
- **Fairness and Accuracy**: It ensures that companies like Hunter Douglas Canada are not unfairly burdened with duties when their products have undergone transformation abroad.
- **Compliance with International Trade Principles**: Reflects Canada’s adherence to principles of fair trade and the proper application of anti-dumping measures, particularly when goods are processed in third countries.

---

### **8. Limitations and Clarifications**
- The remission is **not a general waiver** of all anti-dumping duties.
- It applies **only to the specific amounts and transactions** listed in the schedule.
- The claim must be submitted **within the two-year window**, and no further claims will be accepted after that period.
- The Order does not alter the original anti-dumping duty assessment or the underlying investigation; it only provides a refund for specific, qualifying cases.

---

### **Conclusion**
This remission order is a targeted, legally grounded adjustment to correct an over-imposition of anti-dumping duties on certain wood slats from China that were processed in the United States. It benefits Hunter Douglas Canada by refunding $103,527.64 in duties, subject to strict conditions, including timely claim submission. The Order underscores the importance of considering product transformation in third countries when assessing trade duties and reflects Canada’s commitment to fair and equitable trade practices under the Special Import Measures Act.
