**Detailed Summary of the Non-Profit Grazing Associations (GST) Remission Order**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the **Non-Profit Grazing Associations (GST) Remission Order**, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 23(2)** of the **Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make orders for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes in the public interest.

The Order is specifically designed to address a unique situation involving **non-profit organizations** engaged in the **supply of grazing land** — a type of agricultural or rural land use — and to provide tax relief for taxes under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** (commonly known as the Goods and Services Tax or GST).

The Order was enacted under **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)** and may be cited as the **Non-Profit Grazing Associations (GST) Remission Order**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (forgive) a portion of the GST** that was either:
- **Due** to a non-profit organization before **November 6, 1991**, or  
- **Already paid** by the organization before that date (without having become payable at the time of payment),  
in respect of **property or services** acquired or imported for use in a **business of supplying grazing land**.

This relief is intended to support non-profit organizations that operate in rural or agricultural communities by reducing their tax burden, particularly when they are engaged in supplying real property (such as pastures or ranch land) for grazing purposes — a business activity that may not generate significant commercial profit but serves public or community interests.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies **only to non-profit organizations** that:
- Acquire or import **property or services** for **consumption, use, or supply** in the course of a business involving the **supply of real property for grazing purposes**.
- Are engaged in a **business of supplying grazing land** — meaning they are not merely using land for personal or non-commercial purposes, but are actively involved in the commercial or operational supply of such land.

The tax being remitted is the **tax under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which governs the GST and, in this context, the tax on the supply of goods and services.

### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for remission, the non-profit organization must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **No Entitlement to Input Tax Credit**  
   The organization must **not be entitled to an input tax credit** under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act.  
   → This means the organization cannot claim back the GST paid on inputs (e.g., equipment, services) used in its operations.  
   → This is a key restriction, as it limits the remission to organizations that do not benefit from the standard GST credit mechanism.

2. **Tax Has Not Been Rebated, Refunded, or Remitted Previously**  
   The tax in question must **not have already been**:
   - Rebated (returned by the government),
   - Refunded (paid back to the organization),
   - Or remitted (forgiven) under any other arrangement.  
   → This ensures that the remission is a one-time, specific relief and avoids double benefits.

3. **Registration Under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**  
   The organization must have been:
   - **Registered** under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act **before January 1, 1994**,  
   - And must have **filed an election under section 211** of the Excise Tax Act to take effect **before January 1, 1994**,  
     specifically in respect of the **real property supplied for grazing purposes**.  
   → This ensures that the organization is formally recognized as a GST registrant and has made a deliberate, voluntary choice to apply the GST rules to its grazing operations.

4. **Application to the Minister of National Revenue**  
   The organization must **apply in writing** to the **Minister of National Revenue** for remission **within four years** of:
   - The **date the tax became payable**, or  
   - The **date the tax was paid** (if the tax was paid before it became payable).  
   → This sets a strict deadline for action, ensuring timely administration and preventing indefinite claims.

### **Key Dates and Timeline**

- **Tax Event Date**: The tax must have become payable or been paid **before November 6, 1991**.
- **Registration and Election Deadline**: Must be completed **before January 1, 1994**.
- **Application Deadline**: Must be submitted **within four years** of either:
  - The date the tax became payable, or
  - The date the tax was paid.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The four-year window is critical — failure to apply within this period will result in the loss of eligibility for remission.

### **Significance and Public Interest Rationale**

The Order reflects a **public interest** decision to support non-profit organizations that provide essential rural services — such as grazing land for livestock — which contribute to:
- Agricultural sustainability,
- Rural economic development,
- Community well-being,
- Environmental stewardship.

By removing the GST burden on these organizations, the government promotes the viability of such non-profit activities, especially where the business model is not profit-driven but serves a broader social or environmental purpose.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Profit-making businesses,
  - Organizations that are entitled to input tax credits,
  - Organizations that have already received a refund, rebate, or remission,
  - Entities that failed to register or file the required election by January 1, 1994.
- The relief is **limited to the period before November 6, 1991**, and does not extend to later tax periods.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Non-Profit Grazing Associations (GST) Remission Order** is a targeted, one-time tax relief measure that:
- Forgives GST paid or due by qualifying non-profit organizations,
- Specifically for the acquisition of property or services used in supplying grazing land,
- Under strict eligibility criteria including registration, no input tax credit, and timely application.

It represents a balanced approach to taxation — recognizing the public value of non-profit rural land supply while maintaining compliance with tax administration principles and ensuring fiscal accountability.

**In short**:  
This Order allows certain non-profit organizations that supplied grazing land before November 6, 1991, to have their GST remitted — provided they meet strict conditions related to registration, no input tax credit, and timely application — thereby supporting rural and agricultural community development through targeted tax relief.
