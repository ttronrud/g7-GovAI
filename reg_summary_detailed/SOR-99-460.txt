### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on or around the date of the publication of **SOR/2018-120**, which is the *Supplement to the Regulations of the Government of Canada* issued in 2018.

**Repeal Authority:**  
Section 54 of SOR/2018-120 specifically contains the provision that repeals the referenced regulation. This means that the law or rule previously established by the regulation is no longer applicable or binding.

**Nature of the Regulation (Inferred):**  
While the original content of the repealed regulation is not included in the provided text, the repeated references suggest that it may have been a rule related to **taxation, licensing, compliance, or administrative procedures**—common areas where such regulations are found. However, without the original text, the exact subject matter (e.g., rules on reporting, penalties, definitions, or procedures) cannot be determined from this summary alone.

**Legal Implications:**  
- Any legal or administrative action based on this regulation is now **invalid** or **outdated**.  
- Entities or individuals relying on it must refer to current legislation or regulations that have replaced it.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative modernization, simplification, or consolidation effort.

**Public Access:**  
The repeal is publicly recorded in the *Supplement to the Regulations*, which is an official publication of the Government of Canada. This ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to identify outdated rules.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text is **fully repealed** and **no longer exists** as part of the current legal framework. Its removal was formalized under **Section 54 of SOR/2018-120**, and any reference to it in current legal or compliance contexts should be treated as obsolete. To understand what replaced it, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2018-120 or related successor regulations.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Without the original regulation's content, this summary is based solely on the repealing notice. For a precise understanding of the regulation's original scope, the original text must be accessed through official government databases such as [canada.gov](https://www.canada.ca) or the *Regulations and Codes* section of the Canadian government's legal database.

If you can provide the original regulation's title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation respecting the reporting of financial transactions"), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
