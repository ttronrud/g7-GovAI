## **Key Provisions and Implications**

1. **Tiered Pricing**:
   - Purchases of 1–5 chart sheets are priced at a fixed rate (often with bundled pricing for cover + sheets).
   - Any chart sheet beyond five is charged at a **lower incremental rate**, reflecting cost efficiency for larger purchases.

2. **Cover Included**:
   - The "cover" refers to the protective envelope or booklet that holds the chart sheets. It is often bundled with the charts and priced separately or as a package.

3. **Text Publications**:
   - Fees are also applied per **page of text** (e.g., nautical guides, sailing manuals, or publications with explanatory content), allowing for flexibility in pricing for non-chart materials.

4. **Retail Only**:
   - The Order does not apply to wholesale or institutional sales, ensuring that commercial users are not subject to the same retail pricing.

5. **Legal Authority**:
   - The Order is valid under **Order in Council P.C. 1988-440**, which grants the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the authority to set fees for chart distribution.
