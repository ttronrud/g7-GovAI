**Detailed Summary of the Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1984, No. 1**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

The Order is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This authority stems from **paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which establishes a general reservation of certain territorial lands to the Crown. The Order serves to **waive** (i.e., formally release or remove) that reservation for specific lands.

This Order is formally titled:  
**"Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1984, No. 1"**

---

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **waive the Crown's reservation rights** over a specific parcel of territorial land located in the **Northwest Territories**. By waiving this reservation, the Crown relinquishes its legal claim to the land, allowing it to be granted or transferred to another party—typically a private individual, a municipality, or a government entity—without being subject to the Crown's reserved interest under the Territorial Lands Act.

This waiver is a significant step in land administration, as it enables the transfer or development of land that would otherwise remain under Crown control.

---

**3. Scope of the Waiver:**

The reservation waiver applies specifically to:

- A **portion of Boffa Drive** in the **City of Yellowknife**, Northwest Territories.

This portion is defined by reference to two official records:

- **Plan of Survey of Record Number 40350**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.
- A **sketch plan of record on file 18-1-61** in the **Land Management Division of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development at Ottawa**, where the land is outlined in **green**.

The land in question is a **right-of-way** (a designated strip of land used for public access or infrastructure), and its boundaries are established through these surveyed and recorded plans.

---

**4. Area of the Land:**

The waived portion of Boffa Drive has an area of approximately:

- **0.02 hectares** (about **0.05 acres**), more or less.

This is a very small parcel, indicating a localized infrastructure or access improvement rather than a large-scale land transfer.

---

**5. Legal Significance:**

- The waiver under **paragraph 9(b)** of the Territorial Lands Act removes the Crown’s statutory reservation to the land, which means the land is no longer subject to Crown ownership or control in the manner specified by law.
- This allows for **free disposition** of the land—such as transfer to a municipality, private developer, or other entity—subject to any applicable land use, zoning, or environmental regulations.
- The waiver is not a sale or transfer of ownership, but rather a **relinquishment of a legal reservation**, which is a common tool in land management and urban development.

---

**6. Recordation and Access:**

- A **copy of the plan of survey (record no. 40350)** is filed in the **Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at Yellowknife**, under file number **70**.
- The sketch plan (file no. 18-1-61) is retained in the **Land Management Division** of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development at Ottawa.
- These records serve as official proof of the land’s boundaries and the legal basis for the waiver.

---

**7. Implications:**

- **Urban Development:** The waiver likely supports infrastructure development or urban planning in Yellowknife, enabling the city to manage or expand roadways or access routes.
- **Land Use Flexibility:** It allows for more efficient land use by removing a legal barrier to development or municipal control.
- **Historical Context:** This type of waiver was common during the 1980s as the Canadian government restructured land administration in northern territories, particularly in response to growing urbanization and infrastructure needs.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1984, No. 1* is a targeted legal instrument that removes the Crown’s reserved interest in a small, defined section of Boffa Drive in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. By doing so, it facilitates municipal or public use of the land as a right-of-way. The Order is grounded in the Territorial Lands Act and is supported by official survey records and land management documentation, ensuring transparency and legal enforceability. While the area is small, the significance lies in the administrative and developmental implications for urban infrastructure in the Northwest Territories.
