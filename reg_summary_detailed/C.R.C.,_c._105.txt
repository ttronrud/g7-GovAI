**Detailed Summary of the Regina Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is officially titled the **Regina Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. These regulations establish land-use controls around Regina Airport in the Province of Saskatchewan to ensure safety, operational efficiency, and environmental protection for aviation activities.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several critical terms:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Regina Airport**, located in the Province of Saskatchewan. This is the primary site subject to the zoning controls.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A fixed geographical point used as a datum for elevation measurements.  
  - Defined in **Part I of the Schedule**.  
  - Deemed to be at **1,893 feet above sea level** for all regulatory purposes.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane that starts at the end of a runway strip and slopes upward at a specific angle.  
  - The lower end is a horizontal line perpendicular to the runway centerline, passing through the end of the strip.  
  - Provides a safety zone for aircraft during landing approaches.

- **Horizontal Surface**:  
  An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.  
  - Acts as a baseline for height restrictions across the airport’s surrounding area.

- **Strip**:  
  A 1,200-foot-wide rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface, specifically designated for takeoff and landing in a particular direction.  
  - Includes runways and associated taxiways.  
  - Designated by numbers (e.g., 07–25, 12–30), indicating runway orientation.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane that extends outward from the **outer lateral limits of a strip and its approach surface**, rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally).  
  - It connects the approach surface to the horizontal surface or to another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.  
  - Ensures a smooth, safe transition in elevation between different zones.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to all lands—both public and private—that fall within the following categories:

1. **Lands within the airport boundaries** (including public road allowances).
2. **Lands directly under the portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits described in paragraph 5(a)**.

> This means that even land just beneath the extended approach surfaces (which extend far beyond the physical runway) is included in the regulation’s jurisdiction.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**

No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions) on regulated land **if the highest point of such structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

#### a) **Horizontal Surface**
- A horizontal plane located **150 feet above the ARP (1,893 feet A.S.L.)**, i.e., at **1,893 + 150 = 2,043 feet above sea level**.
- The boundary of this surface is defined by a detailed, precise **legal description** (a chain of coordinates and boundaries) that begins and ends at the **intersection of the southerly boundary of Fourth Avenue and the westerly boundary of Albert Street in Regina**.
- The boundary proceeds through multiple streets, lot lines, and sections of land, extending across several townships and ranges, ultimately forming a large, irregular polygon encompassing a significant area around the airport.
- This surface acts as the **primary height limit** for most structures.

#### b) **Approach Surfaces**
- Applies specifically to the **approach surfaces** of two designated runways:
  - **Strip 07–25**
  - **Strip 12–30**
- Dimensions:
  - **At the strip ends**: 600 feet on each side of the centerline.
  - **At the outer ends**: 7,600 feet on each side of the projected centerline.
- The outer ends are defined as:
  - **1,000 feet vertically above the strip elevation**.
  - **50,000 feet horizontally from the strip ends**.
- These surfaces extend far beyond the physical runway and are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear, unobstructed path during approach and landing.

#### c) **Transitional Surfaces**
- Extend upward and outward from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surface**.
- Slope at a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal).
- Extend until they meet:
  - The horizontal surface, or
  - Another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.
- As shown on **Regina Airport Zoning Plan E.1746**, dated June 9, 1983.

> These surfaces ensure a gradual, safe transition in elevation between the approach zones and the horizontal surface, preventing abrupt changes that could interfere with aircraft navigation.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the height of any of the defined surfaces (horizontal, approach, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **removal of the excessive growth**.
- This provision protects aviation safety by preventing tall trees or overgrown vegetation from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Bird Attractive Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier of regulated land may:
  - Use the land for the **disposal of waste** that is:
    - **Edible** or
    - **Attractive to birds**
- This rule is intended to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can be catastrophic for aircraft safety.

---

### **7. Additional Geographical Reference (for Approach Surface Description)**

A separate, detailed bearing-based description is provided for a specific **approach surface** associated with **strip 07–25**:

> Bearings are astronomical and referenced to the centerline of strip 07–25.

**Chain of coordinates:**
- Begins at the **northeast corner of Section 9, Township 17, Range 20, W of the 2nd Meridian**.
- Proceeds:
  - **Northerly** along the eastern boundary of Section 16 for **1,180.1 feet** to intersect the **western production of the centerline of strip 07–25**.
  - Then, travels **N 89°59′15″ E** (a very steep northeast direction) for **3,452.8 feet**.
  - Then, turns to **N 0°00′45″ W** (a slight westward direction) for **750.0 feet**.

> This detailed path defines the **specific approach surface geometry** for strip 07–25, ensuring precise alignment with runway orientation and flight paths.

---

### **8. Regulatory Authority and Enforcement**

- The **Minister of Transport** is the governing authority responsible for:
  - Enforcing the height restrictions.
  - Issuing directions for removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Monitoring compliance with the waste disposal prohibition.

---

### **9. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Maintain clear flight paths** by limiting vertical obstructions (buildings, trees, waste).
3. **Protect the airport environment** from bird-related hazards.
4. **Provide clear, legally defined boundaries** for regulated zones, enabling consistent enforcement and development control.

### **10. Key Takeaways and Practical Implications**

| Feature | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Height Limit = 2,043 ft A.S.L.** | All new or existing structures must not exceed this elevation. |
| **Large exclusion zone** | The horizontal surface covers a vast area around the airport, including parts of Regina beyond the immediate runways. |
| **Approach surfaces extend 50,000 ft out** | Even structures far from the airport (horizontally) are restricted if they fall within the approach surface zone. |
| **1:7 slope transition** | Prevents sudden elevation changes that could interfere with aircraft navigation. |
| **Bird hazard control** | Prohibits disposal of food or attractive waste that could attract birds near the airport. |
| **Natural growth control** | Trees or vegetation over 150 ft above ARP must be removed if they exceed the surface limits. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Regina Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, technically precise set of rules designed to protect aviation safety by strictly controlling land use and elevation around Regina Airport. They establish clear boundaries and height limits using both geometric descriptions and elevation references, ensuring that no structure, natural growth, or waste disposal poses a risk to aircraft operations. The regulations reflect a balance between development and safety, with strong enforcement mechanisms through the Minister of Transport.

These rules are essential for maintaining the operational integrity of Regina Airport and serve as a model for similar airport zoning regulations in other jurisdictions.
