**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), specifically pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2)** of the Act. These subsections empower the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to:

- **Decide not to add** certain wildlife species to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk* (Schedule 1 to SARA);
- **Refer an assessment** for further review to the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC);
- **Approve the inclusion of specific statements** in the public registry explaining the decisions.

---

### **Species Not Added to the List**

The following species are **not being added** to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk:

1. **Cultus Population and Sakinaw Population of Pacific Sockeye Salmon** (*Oncorhynchus nerka*)  
2. **Polar Bear** (*Ursus maritimus*)  
3. **Northwestern Population of the Grizzly Bear** (*Ursus arctos*)  
4. **Western Population of the Wolverine** (*Gulo gulo*)

### **Key Decisions and Actions**

| Decision | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No listing of sockeye salmon populations** | Despite COSEWIC assessing both the Cultus and Sakinaw populations as "endangered" due to very low numbers and high risk of biological extinction, the decision is made not to list them. |
| **Referral of speckled dace assessment to COSEWIC** | The assessment for the *speckled dace* (*Rhinichthys osculus*) is referred back to COSEWIC for additional information and review. |
| **Statements approved for public registry** | The Minister of the Environment is authorized to include three annexed statements in the public registry: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– Annex 1 | Reasons for not listing the Cultus and Sakinaw sockeye salmon populations. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– Annex 2 | Reasons for not listing polar bears, grizzly bears, and wolverines. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;– Annex 3 | Reasons for referring the speckled dace assessment to COSEWIC. |

### **Rationale for Not Listing Pacific Sockeye Salmon Populations**

Despite the biological risks, the decision to **not list** the Cultus and Sakinaw populations of Pacific sockeye salmon is based on **significant socioeconomic and community consequences** that would result from listing.

#### 1. **Fishery Restrictions Under SARA**
- Listing would trigger **automatic prohibitions** on killing, harming, harassing, capturing, or taking these salmon populations.
- Such prohibitions would apply **unless**:
  - A permit is issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO); or
  - The activity is authorized under a recovery strategy, action plan, or management plan, and also under an Act of Parliament.

#### 2. **Economic Impact Analysis (2004–2007 Four-Year Cycle)**  
A financial analysis—conducted with input from Aboriginal organizations and stakeholders—projects that listing would result in:

- **Approximately $125 million in gross value loss** to the south coast British Columbia (BC) sockeye salmon fishing sector over four years.
- This is **in addition to** an existing estimated $75 million loss due to current protective measures already in place by MFO.

> **Note:** The fishing sector includes:
> - Commercial and recreational fishing
> - First Nations food, social, and ceremonial fishing

#### 3. **Impact on First Nations Communities**
- Approximately **25% of commercial fishers are Aboriginal**, meaning the sector is deeply intertwined with Indigenous livelihoods and cultural practices.
- **Food, social, and ceremonial fishing** would likely be **unmet**:
  - After two years of the four-year cycle, **first nations below the Vedder River** would not meet their traditional fishing needs.
  - In **three out of four years**, there would likely be **no marine commercial fishery** for Fraser River sockeye salmon.

#### 4. **Impact on Processors and Future Fisheries**
- Processors heavily dependent on sockeye salmon would face significant economic hardship.
- The negative impacts would **persist into future four-year cycles**, undermining long-term sustainability of the fishery and related industries.

#### 5. **Conclusion on Listing Consequences**
> The potential consequences of listing are deemed **so severe** that they would effectively **collapse the existing fishery** and **undermine the cultural and economic foundations** of coastal communities in south coast BC.

### **Rationale for Not Listing Polar Bear, Grizzly Bear, and Wolverine**

While the COSEWIC assessments may indicate that these species are at risk, the decision to **not list** them is based on:

- **Insufficient documentation of threats** and **lack of clear biological justification** for listing under current criteria.
- **Concerns raised by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB)**:
  - The COSEWIC status reports used for assessments were based on **pre-Act criteria** that do not fully incorporate:
    - **Community knowledge**
    - **Aboriginal traditional knowledge**
  - Consultations with the NWMB have not been deemed sufficient.
  - The decision to **not list** these species is **intentionally delayed** to allow for **further consultation** with the NWMB to address their concerns.
  - The Minister may **reconsider** the listing decision after completing these consultations.

> This reflects a broader principle in SARA: that decisions must be made with **adequate engagement with Indigenous communities** and respect for **traditional knowledge**.

### **Referral of Speckled Dace Assessment to COSEWIC**

The speckled dace (*Rhinichthys osculus*) is a rare species with a very restricted distribution in Canada. While COSEWIC may have assessed it as "endangered," the regulation identifies **critical gaps in the assessment** that require clarification before a listing decision can be justified.

#### Key Issues Identified:

| Issue | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Inconsistent habitat impact estimate** | COSEWIC claims the proposed dam would result in a **22% loss of habitat**, but the status report states the dam would flood only **2.5 km or 2.7 km** of habitat. Given that speckled dace are found across **112 km of watersheds**, this equates to **only about 2% habitat loss**, not 22%. This inconsistency undermines the basis of the "key threat" claim. |
| **Dam design changes post-assessment** | Since the 2002 assessment, the dam project has been redesigned to flood only **350 meters** (a reduction from 2.5 km), significantly reducing habitat impact. The assessment must now be re-evaluated to determine whether this change affects the species’ status. |
| **Lack of documentation on "urban and industrial development"** | The assessment summary cites "urban and industrial development" as a threat, but **no supporting evidence or data** is provided in the status report. This weakens the biological basis of the threat assessment. |
| **Unsubstantiated population decline estimate** | The technical summary states an estimated **decline of at least 10% per year**, but **no basis or data** are provided for this projection. Without this, the conclusion of "endangered" status cannot be reliably supported. |

#### Conclusion on Speckled Dace
> The current assessment is **not sufficiently grounded in documented evidence**. Further information and scientific review are required to determine whether the "endangered" designation is **biologically justified**.

### **Overall Principles Underlying the Regulation**

1. **Balancing Conservation and Socioeconomic Realities**  
   The regulation demonstrates that while species at risk must be protected, **listing decisions must consider broader consequences**, including economic stability, food security, and cultural practices—especially for Indigenous communities.

2. **Importance of Community and Traditional Knowledge**  
   The decision to defer listing of bears and wolverines reflects a commitment to **inclusive assessment processes** and **meaningful consultation** with Indigenous governance bodies like the NWMB.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   All decisions are documented in the public registry via annexes, ensuring transparency and public access to the rationale.

4. **Scientific Rigor and Accuracy**  
   The regulation emphasizes that biological assessments must be **accurate, well-documented, and updated** with current data, especially when significant changes occur post-assessment (e.g., dam redesigns).

---

### **Next Steps and Future Considerations**

- **COSEWIC will be required to provide updated information** on the speckled dace, particularly regarding:
  - Habitat loss from the dam
  - Population decline projections
  - Documentation of urban/industrial threats
- **The Minister of the Environment may reconsider** the listing of polar bears, grizzly bears, and wolverines **after completing consultations** with the NWMB.
- **Ongoing monitoring** of the sockeye salmon populations is expected, with potential for future review if population trends improve or if new data emerges.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **pragmatic, balanced, and community-sensitive approach** to species at risk management under SARA. It acknowledges the **biological vulnerability** of certain species while recognizing that **listing decisions must not undermine essential economic and cultural activities**—particularly those of First
