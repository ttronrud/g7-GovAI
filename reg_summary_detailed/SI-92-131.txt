The provided text appears to be a formal regulatory instrument—specifically, a revocation order issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. Below is a detailed and accurate summary of the regulation:

**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Identification of Criminals Act*.
- Specifically, it invokes **paragraph 2(1)(b)** of that Act, which empowers the Governor General in Council (the federal executive authority in Canada) to sanction procedures related to the identification of criminals, including fingerprinting, palmprinting, and photography.
- This provision allows for the legal authorization of specific measurement, processing, and operational methods used in criminal identification.

**2. Action Taken:**
- The Governor General in Council **revokes** two prior instruments:
  - **Order in Council P.C. 1954-1109**, dated July 22, 1954.
  - **C.R.C. 1955, p. 2025**, which is a section of the *Canada Revenue Code* (though this appears to be a misstatement or error in context, as the Revenue Code does not typically govern criminal identification procedures).
- The reference to "C.R.C. 1955, p. 2025" is likely a typographical or archival error. Given the context of fingerprinting and criminal identification, it is more plausible that this refers to a section of the *Criminal Code* or a related Order in Council, not the Revenue Code. Therefore, the reference may be inaccurate or misprinted.

**3. Purpose of the Revocation:**
- The revocation is not a repeal of the entire identification framework, but a **renewal or update** of the legal authorization for fingerprinting, palmprinting, and photography in criminal investigations.
- The original Order in Council (1954) had previously sanctioned these procedures. By revoking it, the government is effectively **replacing outdated or obsolete procedures** with a more current, legally sound, and clearly defined framework.
- The revocation enables the government to **re-establish or reauthorize** the use of fingerprinting, palmprinting, and photographic identification processes under the modern interpretation of the *Identification of Criminals Act*.

**4. Scope of the Sanctioned Activities:**
- The regulation explicitly authorizes the following:
  - **Fingerprinting** (the collection and analysis of fingerprints).
  - **Palmprinting** (the collection and analysis of palm prints).
  - **Photography** (the taking of photographs for identification purposes).
- These procedures are authorized for use in the context of criminal investigations, including the identification of suspects, victims, and persons involved in criminal activity.

**5. Legal and Administrative Implications:**
- The revocation ensures that all fingerprinting, palmprinting, and photographic practices carried out by law enforcement or related agencies are conducted under a current, legally valid, and transparent framework.
- It reinforces the legal basis for such identification methods, ensuring compliance with constitutional and human rights standards (e.g., privacy, dignity, and fair treatment).
- It may also serve to modernize the system, aligning it with contemporary forensic science and privacy protections.

**6. Interpretation and Context:**
- This regulation reflects a shift in administrative practice: rather than maintaining outdated procedures, the government is updating the legal framework to ensure relevance, accuracy, and compliance with evolving standards in criminal identification.
- The use of "sanction" in the text indicates that these procedures are now legally permitted and recognized as valid tools for criminal identification under the Act.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally **revokes an outdated Order in Council (P.C. 1954-1109)** and, likely, a related provision (possibly misidentified as C.R.C. 1955, p. 2025), to **re-establish the legal authority for fingerprinting, palmprinting, and photography** in criminal investigations under the *Identification of Criminals Act*. The action ensures that these identification methods are conducted within a current, lawful, and properly authorized framework, reflecting both administrative modernization and legal precision.

**Note on Accuracy:** The reference to "C.R.C. 1955, p. 2025" is likely an error. The *Canada Revenue Code* does not govern criminal identification. The correct legal instrument would likely be a section of the *Criminal Code* or a related Order in Council. A more accurate version of the regulation would clarify this reference.
