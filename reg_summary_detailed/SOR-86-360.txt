### **Purpose of the Order**
This regulatory order establishes a designated chain of succession for officers or employees of the Atomic Energy Control Board (AEBC) to temporarily exercise the powers, duties, and functions of the President of the AEBC **specifically in relation to the Access to Information Act (ATIA)**.  

The primary objective is to ensure that the AEBC remains fully operational and capable of responding to access-to-information requests—even when the President is absent or otherwise unable to perform their duties. This maintains continuity and compliance with the Access to Information Act, which grants individuals the right to request access to information held by government institutions.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Designation of Successor Officers**  
   The Order designates two individuals to act as the head of the AEBC under the Access to Information Act in the absence or inability of the President:

   - **Primary Designee:**  
     The **Director General, Directorate of Fuel Cycle and Materials Regulation** of the Atomic Energy Control Board.  
     *This individual assumes the powers, duties, and functions of the President of the AEBC for the purposes of the Access to Information Act.*

   - **Secondary Designee (in the absence of the primary):**  
     If the Director General is unavailable, the **Director, Planning and Administration Branch** of the AEBC will assume the same powers, duties, and functions.

2. **Scope of Authority**  
   The designated officers are authorized to:
   - Receive and respond to access-to-information requests.
   - Make determinations regarding the release or refusal of information.
   - Exercise all powers and perform all duties of the President **specifically in relation to the Access to Information Act**.

   Importantly, this authority is **limited to the purposes of the Access to Information Act**. It does not extend to other administrative, regulatory, or operational functions of the AEBC.

3. **Conditions for Activation**  
   The designation becomes effective **only when the President of the AEBC is absent or otherwise unable** to perform their duties under the Access to Information Act. This includes situations such as:
   - Vacation or leave.
   - Illness or medical disability.
   - Temporary incapacity (e.g., emergency or administrative reasons).
   - Absence due to official duties or travel.

4. **Legal Citation and Enforcement**  
   The Order may be cited as:  
   *The Access to Information Act Officers or Employees of the Atomic Energy Control Board Designation Order*  
   It is issued under the authority granted by **Section 73 of the Access to Information Act**, which allows the head of a government institution to designate officers to act in their place for the purpose of fulfilling access-to-information obligations.

### **Context and Significance**

- This Order reflects a standard administrative practice in Canadian government institutions: ensuring that access-to-information functions remain uninterrupted despite leadership absences.
- It provides clarity and legal certainty by specifying who can step in when the President is unavailable, reducing ambiguity in the handling of public information requests.
- The selection of the Director General (Fuel Cycle and Materials Regulation) as the primary designee suggests that the AEBC values operational continuity in technical and regulatory oversight areas, which are central to its mandate.
- The secondary designation ensures a fallback mechanism, enhancing institutional resilience.

---

### **Limitations and Boundaries**

- The designated officers do **not** assume the full powers of the President of the AEBC in all respects.
- Their authority is strictly confined to **Access to Information Act-related matters**.
- The Order does not apply to other statutory responsibilities or regulatory functions of the AEBC, which may require different succession arrangements.

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a critical component of the AEBC’s compliance framework under the *Access to Information Act*. It ensures that the institution maintains transparency and responsiveness to public information requests, even during periods when the President is unavailable. By clearly designating two qualified officers—first the Director General and then the Director of Planning and Administration—it provides a practical, legally grounded mechanism to uphold public accountability and access to government information.

This designation supports the broader principles of openness, transparency, and public trust in federal institutions.
