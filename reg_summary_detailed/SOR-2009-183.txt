> [Repealed, SOR/2010-245, s. 20]

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2010-245, section 20**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed**. It is no longer in force.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The regulation was formally repealed by **Section 20 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2010-245** (Statutory Instrument 2010-245).
- **SOR/2010-245**: This is a Statutory Instrument issued in Canada, typically under the authority of a federal or provincial government. In this context, it is likely related to a regulatory framework in a specific area such as environmental protection, transportation, or financial services—though the exact subject matter would depend on the full text of SOR/2010-245.
- **Section 20**: This section specifically designates the repeal of certain provisions, including the one in question. The repetition of the same line suggests that multiple provisions or subsections were repealed under this section, or that the original regulation had multiple parts all of which were removed.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligation, requirement, or rule previously established by this regulation is **no longer enforceable**. Entities previously bound by it must now comply with current, applicable laws or regulations that have replaced it.

### Important Notes:
- Since the regulation is **repealed**, it does not apply to current legal or operational contexts.
- There is **no content or substantive detail** provided in the original text—only the repealing notice. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation’s original content (e.g., its purpose, scope, or provisions) cannot be offered without access to the full, pre-repeal version of the regulation.
- To understand what the original regulation governed, one would need to consult the **full text of the regulation prior to SOR/2010-245**, which may be available through official government databases such as the **Canada Gazette** or the **legislation database of the Government of Canada**.

### Conclusion:
The provided text is a **repeal notice** indicating that a specific regulation has been officially canceled by **SOR/2010-245, section 20**. The regulation itself is no longer valid or in effect. Without the original text, a detailed summary of its content or purpose cannot be provided. This notice serves as a legal record of the removal of the regulation from the current legal framework.
