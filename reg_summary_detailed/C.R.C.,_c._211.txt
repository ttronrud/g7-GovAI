**Detailed Summary of the *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations***

---

### **Regulation Title**  
*Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation establishes a **service charge system** to support the marketing of greenhouse vegetables in Ontario, specifically for **interprovincial trade and export**. It ensures that producers contribute to the marketing infrastructure and services provided by the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board (the *Commodity Board*), particularly in facilitating distribution, sales, and market access outside of Ontario.

The service charge is levied on greenhouse vegetable producers who sell their products outside of direct consumer sales, and it is collected either by the Commodity Board or by appointed shippers, depending on the sales channel.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Appointed Shipper** | A person who has a valid and active certificate of appointment issued by the Commodity Board under the *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Appointed Shippers’ Procedures (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*. This certification authorizes them to handle and market greenhouse vegetables on behalf of producers. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board*, responsible for managing the marketing, pricing, and distribution of greenhouse vegetables in Ontario. |
| **Greenhouse Vegetables** | Specifically includes: <br> - Tomatoes <br> - Cucumbers (all types) <br> - Lettuce <br> All grown in greenhouses or enclosed structures using glass, plastic, or other materials to control temperature and protect plants. |

- Applies **only** to the **marketing of greenhouse vegetables** in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (sales to other provinces)
  - **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada)
- Applies to **persons and property located within the Province of Ontario**.
- **Exemption**: A producer who sells greenhouse vegetables **directly to a consumer** (e.g., at a farm stand or local market) is **exempt** from this regulation for that specific transaction.

### **Service Charge Structure**

The service charge is a **mandatory fee** paid by producers to the Commodity Board to cover marketing costs. The charge varies by vegetable type and unit of measurement:

| Vegetable Type | Unit | Service Charge |
|---------------|------|----------------|
| Tomatoes | Per pound | $0.005 (5 cents per pound) |
| Long, seedless cucumbers | Per dozen | $0.05 (5 cents per dozen) |
| Other cucumbers (not long or seedless) | Per dozen | $0.025 (2.5 cents per dozen) |

> *Note: The charge is not based on volume or weight in a uniform way—different vegetables have different rates based on their market characteristics and handling requirements.*

### **Collection and Payment Mechanisms**

#### **1. Sales through the Commodity Board**
- When a producer sells a product **directly through the Commodity Board**:
  - The Commodity Board **deducts the service charge** from the payment it makes to the producer.
  - The producer receives the net amount after the service charge is subtracted.

#### **2. Sales through an Appointed Shipper**
- When a producer sells through a shipper (e.g., a distributor or wholesaler):
  - The **shipper deducts the service charge** from the payment due to the producer.
  - The shipper must **remit the full amount of the service charge** to the Commodity Board **within 21 days** of receiving the product.

> This ensures timely collection and transparency in the financial flow between producers, shippers, and the marketing board.

### **Key Regulatory Principles**

1. **Fair and Proportional Cost Recovery**: The service charge is designed to fairly recover the costs associated with marketing greenhouse vegetables in interprovincial and export markets, including logistics, pricing, and market access.
2. **Targeted Application**: Only applies to non-consumer sales, protecting small-scale direct-to-consumer sales from additional fees.
3. **Clear Accountability**: The Commodity Board and appointed shippers are clearly defined as responsible parties for collection and remittance.
4. **Transparency and Compliance**: The rules provide clear procedures for who pays, when, and how the charge is applied, reducing ambiguity in trade operations.

### **Implications for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Producers** | Must pay service charges on all interprovincial and export sales. Exempt only in direct consumer sales. Charges are small per unit but cumulative at scale. |
| **Appointed Shippers** | Act as intermediaries; responsible for collecting the service charge from producers and remitting it to the Commodity Board within 21 days. |
| **Commodity Board** | Receives revenue to fund marketing, promotion, and market development activities. Also ensures compliance and fair distribution. |
| **Retailers/Export Buyers** | Not directly affected, but indirectly impacted through the pricing structure passed down through shippers and the marketing board. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations* serve as a **critical mechanism** for ensuring that greenhouse vegetable producers in Ontario contribute to the cost of marketing their products beyond provincial borders. By establishing clear, tiered charges based on product type and sales channel, the regulation promotes equitable cost-sharing, supports market stability, and enables the Commodity Board to invest in infrastructure and services that enhance competitiveness in interprovincial and international markets.

It balances the need for producer support with the realities of commercial trade, while protecting direct consumer sales from unnecessary fees. The system is designed to be transparent, enforceable, and aligned with the broader goals of the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board.
