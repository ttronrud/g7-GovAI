### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically **paragraph 11(2)(a)a**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to amend or repeal orders in council related to financial administration. This provision allows for the modification or removal of administrative rules and regulations that govern the management of public funds and government financial operations.

**2. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2008-798**  
- The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2008-798**, issued on **April 25, 2008**.  
- This order was likely a directive or administrative regulation concerning financial procedures, reporting requirements, or budgetary controls.  
- The repeal becomes effective on **July 1, 2009**.  
- The repeal is formally cited as **[Repealed, SI/2009-45]**, indicating that it was officially canceled or superseded by a subsequent Statutory Instrument (SI) issued on April 27, 2009 (SI/2009-45). This suggests that the government replaced or removed the 2008 order with a new or revised rule.

**3. Repeal of Paragraph (b) – Effective January 1, 2016**  
- In addition to repealing the full Order in Council, the regulation also **repeals a specific paragraph (b)** within the order.  
- The repeal of paragraph (b) is effective from **January 1, 2016**.  
- This indicates that the original order contained multiple provisions (likely under a section or subsection), and only one of them—paragraph (b)—was deemed obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent with current financial policy or legislation.  
- The removal of this paragraph may have addressed a specific administrative or procedural requirement that no longer applied or had been superseded by updated legislation or policy.

**4. Legal References and Citations**  
The regulation is cross-referenced with several key legal documents:  
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 8**: Refers to a section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003*, Chapter 22 (likely a legislative act such as the *Financial Administration Act* or a related enabling statute). Section 8 may provide the legal basis for the authority to issue or repeal orders in council.  
- **R.S., c. F-11**: Refers to the *Regulations of the Financial Administration Act*, Chapter F-11. This is the primary regulatory framework governing government financial administration and provides the structure for administrative rules like those in the repealed order.  
- **SI/2008-43**: A prior Statutory Instrument that may have introduced or amended the original order or provided context for its existence.

### **Key Implications and Interpretation**

- **Policy Evolution**: The repeal of P.C. 2008-798 and its paragraph (b) reflects a shift in government financial administration policy. It suggests that the financial procedures or reporting obligations previously mandated by that order were either rendered obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent with updated fiscal or administrative standards.
  
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Repealing outdated or ineffective provisions improves administrative clarity and reduces regulatory burden on government departments and agencies.

- **Legal Continuity**: The reference to SI/2009-45 shows that the repeal was not a standalone action but part of a broader legislative or administrative review process. The 2009 instrument likely introduced a new regulatory framework or clarified financial responsibilities.

- **Timing of Repeals**:  
  - The **July 1, 2009** effective date for the full repeal indicates a prompt transition to new rules.  
  - The **January 1, 2016** effective date for paragraph (b) suggests a more gradual or phased removal, possibly due to ongoing compliance obligations or transitional arrangements.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally **repeals a 2008 Order in Council (P.C. 2008-798)** and a specific paragraph (b) within it, effective July 1, 2009 and January 1, 2016, respectively. The action is taken under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* and aligns with broader efforts to modernize and streamline government financial administration. The repeal reflects evolving policy priorities and the need to eliminate outdated or ineffective administrative provisions, ensuring that financial governance remains efficient, transparent, and compliant with current legal and fiscal standards.
