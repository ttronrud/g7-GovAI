     - Have submitted a **duly completed application for a visitor visa** to enter Canada **once** (single entry).

   - This remission applies only to individuals who are **participating** in the event as attendees, not as organizers or staff.

2. **Remission of the $150 Visitor Visa Fee (Multiple Entry):**  
   - The fee of **$150**, normally applicable under **Item 4 of the Schedule to the Immigration Act Fees Regulations**, is **fully waived** for applicants who:

- It does **not apply to individuals who are not directly involved in World Youth Day 2002**, nor to those participating in other religious or youth events.

---

**Public Interest Justification:**

The Governor General in Council determined that it is in the **public interest** to waive these fees because:
- World Youth Day 2002 was a significant international event that brought together thousands of young people from around the world.
- Waiving the fees helps ensure broad and inclusive participation, especially from young people from developing countries or regions with limited financial resources.
- It supports Canada’s role as a host of a major global religious and youth gathering, enhancing Canada’s international image and fostering intercultural understanding.
- It aligns with the government’s broader policy of promoting youth engagement and religious freedom in a multicultural society.

---

**Legal and Administrative Context:**

- The regulation is part of a broader framework of **visa fee exemptions** under the Financial Administration Act, which permits fee remission in exceptional circumstances.
- It reflects a **temporary, event-specific policy** rather than a permanent change to the immigration fee structure.
- The regulation is not subject to annual review or renewal in the same way as general immigration policies, but its applicability is time-bound to the event year (2002).

**Conclusion:**

This Visitor Visa Fee (World Youth Day 2002) Remission Order is a targeted, temporary measure that removes financial barriers for youth participants and volunteer organizers of a major international Catholic youth event. By waiving the standard visitor visa fees—$75 for single entry and $150 for multiple entry—the Canadian government enabled greater accessibility and participation in World Youth Day 2002, promoting youth engagement, interfaith dialogue, and international goodwill. The order remains a notable example of how immigration policy can be adapted to support significant cultural and religious events in the public interest.
