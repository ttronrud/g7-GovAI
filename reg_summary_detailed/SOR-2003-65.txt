**Detailed Summary of the Information Technology Activities (Foreign Banks) Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Information Technology Activities (Foreign Banks) Regulations* (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 132; S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183; S.C. 1991, c. 46) are a set of regulatory rules made under the authority of the *Bank Act* of Canada. These regulations impose restrictions on foreign banks and their associated entities from acquiring control of, or making substantial investments in, Canadian companies that engage in certain **information technology (IT) activities**—specifically, those involving data transmission systems, information sites, communication devices, or information platforms used to provide information services.

The primary objective is to **protect the stability and integrity of the Canadian financial system** by limiting foreign banks' exposure to non-banking, high-risk digital activities that could pose systemic risks or create conflicts of interest.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Bank Act*, which provides the legal framework for regulating banks and financial institutions in Canada.

2. **Balance Sheet Value**  
   The value of shares or ownership interests reported on a **non-consolidated basis** in the entity’s balance sheet. This is the value used to calculate thresholds for investment limits.

3. **Minority Interest**  
   An equity interest in an entity controlled by a foreign bank, held by someone other than the foreign bank or by another entity under its control. It includes any equity stake not directly owned by the foreign bank.

4. **Regulatory Capital**  
   For a foreign bank, regulatory capital is calculated using the following formula:

   > Regulatory Capital = (Shareholders’ Equity + Minority Interests + Subordinated Indebtedness) – Goodwill  
   
   - *Shareholders’ equity* and *minority interests* are included as full amounts.
   - *Subordinated indebtedness* is only included if it meets specific criteria (see below).
   - *Goodwill* is subtracted because it is not considered a reliable measure of financial strength.

5. **Eligibility Criteria for Subordinated Debt or Preferred Shares**  
   A security may be included in regulatory capital only if:
   - It is **subordinate in payment** to all other liabilities except those that rank equally or are subordinate to it;
   - It is **fully paid up**;
   - For subordinated debt or preferred shares:
     - It has an **initial term of five years or more**, or **no fixed term**;
     - It **cannot be redeemed or purchased** during the first five years after issuance.

### **What Constitutes a "Prescribed Activity"?**

Under paragraph **522.08(1)(f)** of the *Bank Act*, a "prescribed activity" includes:

> Developing, designing, holding, managing, manufacturing, selling, or otherwise dealing with any **data transmission system, information site, communication device, or information platform or portal** used to provide **information services**.

This includes activities related to internet platforms, software development, cloud services, digital content delivery, and similar digital infrastructure.

### **Prohibited Acquisitions and Investments**

A foreign bank or an entity associated with it **may not acquire or hold control of, or make a substantial investment in**, a Canadian entity engaged in a prescribed IT activity **if the total of the following exceeds the lesser of**:

- **5% of the foreign bank’s regulatory capital**, or  
- **$1 billion**  

#### **The Three Components That Must Be Added Together:**

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests the foreign bank (or associated entity) would acquire in the Canadian IT entity.

2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests currently held by:
   - The foreign bank,
   - Any entity associated with the foreign bank,
   - In Canadian IT entities that the foreign bank or its associates control or have a substantial investment in.

3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by:
   - The foreign bank,
   - Any entity associated with the foreign bank,
   - To Canadian IT entities that are controlled or substantially invested in by the foreign bank or its associates.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The threshold applies cumulatively across all such entities and activities.

### **Application to Entities Associated with Foreign Banks**

The same restrictions apply to **entities associated with a foreign bank**—such as subsidiaries, affiliates, or joint ventures—regardless of whether they are directly owned or operate independently. These entities are treated as part of the foreign bank’s “associated group” for purposes of calculating exposure.

The thresholds for such associated entities are **even broader**, including:
- All holdings (direct and indirect),
- All loans (direct and joint),
- All related entities under control or substantial investment.

This ensures that **the entire network of related parties** is monitored to prevent systemic overexposure.

---

### **Prohibited Activities of the Canadian IT Entity**

A foreign bank or its associated entity **may not acquire or invest in** a Canadian IT entity if the Canadian entity engages in any of the following:

#### 1. **Activities Prohibited for Banks**
- Any activity that a bank is not permitted to engage in under:
  - **Section 412** (e.g., dealing in certain types of securities),
  - **Section 417** (e.g., dealing in financial instruments like derivatives),
  - **Section 418** (e.g., certain investment activities).

#### 2. **Dealing in Securities**
- Prohibited unless:
  - Permitted under **paragraph 522.08(1)(e)** of the *Bank Act*, or
  - Permitted under **paragraph 409(2)(c)** (which allows limited securities trading for banks).

#### 3. **Dealing in Goods, Wares, or Merchandise**
- Prohibited unless explicitly allowed under **subsection 410(2)** of the *Bank Act*.

#### 4. **Finance Entity or Prescribed Entity Activities**
- Prohibited if the Canadian entity engages in activities that a **finance entity** or another **prescribed entity** is not allowed to conduct under:
  - **Section 416** of the *Bank Act*.

#### 5. **Acquisition of Another Canadian Entity**
A foreign bank or associated entity may only acquire or invest in another Canadian entity **if**:
- In the case of an entity **controlled by** the foreign bank or its associate:
  - The foreign bank or associated entity itself would be permitted to acquire or invest in that entity under:
    - Section 522.07, 522.08, 522.1, or Division 8 of Part XII of the *Bank Act*.
- In the case of an entity **not controlled** by the foreign bank or its associate:
  - The foreign bank or associated entity would be permitted to acquire or invest under:
    - Section 522.07 or 522.08,
    - Any of the paragraphs **522.1(a), (c), (d), or (e)**,
    - Or Division 8 of Part XII of the *Bank Act*.

> This ensures that only activities within the **permissible scope of banking or financial institutions** are allowed.

### **Exemptions and Exceptions**

#### **Exemption from Subsection 522.22(1)**

- **Subsection 522.22(1)** of the *Bank Act* normally prevents foreign banks from acquiring or investing in certain entities due to risk exposure. However, **this rule does not apply** in the following cases:

1. If a foreign bank acquires or holds control of a Canadian entity whose business is **limited to the prescribed IT activities** (i.e., data systems, information platforms, etc.) — as defined in subsection 2(1).

2. If an **entity associated with a foreign bank** acquires or holds control of such a Canadian IT entity.

> ✅ These exceptions allow foreign banks to participate in pure IT services (e.g., hosting, cloud platforms, digital infrastructure) **without triggering broader restrictions**, provided the business is narrowly focused.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: These exemptions **do not limit** the operation of subsections (2) and (4) of the regulation — meaning the **$1 billion or 5% capital threshold still applies**.

### **Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Government of Canada.

### **Purpose and Regulatory Rationale**

The core purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Prevent foreign banks from overexposing themselves** to non-core, high-growth, and potentially volatile digital sectors in Canada.
- **Mitigate systemic risk** by limiting foreign banks’ involvement in information technology services that may not align with traditional banking functions.
- **Ensure compliance with Canadian financial oversight** by requiring transparency in ownership, investment, and risk exposure.
- **Protect Canadian financial institutions** from foreign competition or influence in critical digital infrastructure.

By restricting foreign banks from holding significant stakes in IT companies—especially those involved in data transmission, platforms, or information services—these rules aim to preserve the **stability, integrity, and national interest** in Canada’s financial and technological sectors.
