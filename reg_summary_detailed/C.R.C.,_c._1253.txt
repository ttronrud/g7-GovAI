The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed**. Specifically, the entries state:

> [Repealed, SOR/2006-124, s. 74]  
> [Repealed, SOR/97-174, s. 1]

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Regulation**
The listed entries indicate that certain provisions of a former regulation (or statute) have been **officially repealed** (i.e., canceled or removed from legal force). This means that the specific section(s) referenced no longer apply or are no longer enforceable under current law.

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Government of Canada* (or more specifically, *Statutory Rules* in the context of provincial legislation).
- **SOR/2006-124** refers to a statutory instrument issued in 2006, specifically the 124th instrument of that year.
- **s. 74** means Section 74 of that instrument.
- **SOR/97-174, s. 1** refers to Section 1 of the 174th statutory instrument from 1997.

#### 2. **Repeal Details**
- The regulation in question was **repealed by SOR/2006-124, Section 74**.
- This means that the law previously established in the section(s) referenced was formally removed and is no longer valid.
- The repeal of SOR/97-174, s. 1 suggests that a prior provision from a 1997 statutory instrument was also invalidated — likely due to being superseded, redundant, or inconsistent with newer legislation.

#### 3. **Legal Implications**
- Any legal obligation, requirement, or rule derived from the repealed section(s) is **no longer binding**.
- Legal practitioners, regulators, or institutions must now refer to current, active legislation for compliance or interpretation.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Streamline or modernize the law,
  - Resolve inconsistencies,
  - Align with new regulatory frameworks,
  - Reflect changes in policy or public interest.

#### 4. **Frequency of Repeal References**
The repeated appearance of "[Repealed, SOR/2006-124, s. 74]" suggests that this particular section was referenced multiple times across different parts of a legal document or database — possibly indicating that it was a key or commonly referenced repealed provision.

#### 5. **Status of the Regulation**
- The regulation **does not currently exist** in legal force.
- It is **inactive**, and any references to it in prior legal documents or case law must be interpreted with caution — they may now be outdated or irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The provided list is not a detailed regulation itself, but rather a **record of repeals**. The summary indicates that **specific sections of a prior statutory instrument (particularly Section 74 of SOR/2006-124 and Section 1 of SOR/97-174) have been formally repealed**. These provisions are no longer part of the current legal framework and should be disregarded in any legal, administrative, or compliance context.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> This document is a list of repeals, not an active regulation. It shows that certain legal provisions (specifically Section 74 of SOR/2006-124 and Section 1 of SOR/97-174) have been officially removed from law by a 2006 statutory instrument. As such, those sections are no longer enforceable or applicable. Any prior reliance on them is invalid. The repeal likely reflects legislative modernization or consolidation.

If you have a specific regulation or context (e.g., provincial jurisdiction, area of law like health, environment, or employment), I can provide a more targeted interpretation.
