The provided text consists of four identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2006-168, s. 3]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 3 of the Statutory Instruments (SOR/2006-168)**, which was published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on April 28, 2006.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal took effect as part of the statutory instrument **SOR/2006-168**, which was issued on April 28, 2006. Section 3 of that instrument specifically designated the regulation as repealed.
- **Legal Basis**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of a federal statute or legislative framework, likely related to the regulation’s original subject matter (which is not specified in the provided text). SOR/2006-168 is a Statutory Instrument (SI), meaning it is a secondary or delegated legislation that implements or modifies rules under a primary act.
- **Purpose of the Repeal**: The repeal suggests that the regulation was outdated, redundant, or superseded by new legislation or policy. It may have been replaced by a more modern, comprehensive, or relevant regulation.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously established under this regulation are no longer enforceable. Entities or individuals relying on it must now refer to current, active regulations in place after the repeal.

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation is not included in the text, the summary is based solely on the repeal notice. Without the original content of the regulation, we cannot describe its scope, purpose, or key provisions.
- The repeated appearance of the same repeal notice four times may be a formatting or typographical error, possibly indicating a duplication in a document or database.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2006-168, section 3**, meaning it is no longer valid or enforceable under Canadian law. It should be disregarded in legal or administrative contexts. For current regulatory requirements, one must consult the updated legislation or regulations that succeeded it—though the successor is not specified in the provided text.

To fully understand the context, the original regulation's title, subject matter (e.g., environmental, health, transportation), and the legislation under which it was created would need to be identified.
