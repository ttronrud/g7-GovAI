### **Detailed Summary of the National Energy Board Electricity Regulations (S.C. 1990, c. 7, s. 23 and s. 34)**

---

#### **Overview and Legal Basis**

These regulations, known as the **National Energy Board Electricity Regulations**, were enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources, under **sections 58.39a and 119.094b of the National Energy Board Act (NEBA)**. Their purpose is to implement and regulate provisions of the NEBA related to:

- The **construction and operation of international power lines** connecting Canada to the United States;
- The **exportation of electricity** from Canada to other countries, particularly the U.S.

These regulations provide a comprehensive legal and procedural framework governing the **application process, environmental assessments, technical requirements, and operational conditions** for international electricity transmission and export.

The regulations may be cited as the **National Energy Board Electricity Regulations**.

## **Key Definitions**

The regulations define key terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the National Energy Board Act. |
| **Electricity transfer** | Includes five types: sale, equichange, adjustment, carrier, and storage transfers. |
| **Energy** | Total quantity of electricity transmitted over time, measured in watt-hours (Wh) or multiples/sub-multiples. |
| **Power** | Rate of energy transfer, measured in watts (W) or multiples/sub-multiples. |
| **Power system** | Encompasses generating stations, transformers, switching stations, transmission lines, substations, and distribution networks. |
| **Power transfer capability** | Maximum power that can be transferred between two interconnected systems without compromising reliability. |
| **Firm energy/power** | Energy or power guaranteed to be available at all specified times under an agreement. |
| **Interruptible energy/power** | Energy or power that can be curtailed or interrupted at the supplier’s discretion. |
| **Adjustment transfer** | Used to balance energy accounts or compensate for services rendered. |
| **Border accommodation transfer** | Transfers made to provide electricity to: (1) persons in the U.S. lacking access; (2) cross-border works; or (3) individuals affected by emergencies in the U.S. |
| **Carrier transfer** | Power routed through another system’s circuits to reach a third party or return to the original system. |
| **Storage transfer** | Energy stored temporarily in a reservoir (e.g., hydroelectric) with expectation of return later. |
| **Environmental effect** | Any change in the environment—including health, socio-economic, cultural, or heritage impacts—caused by a project, including accidents, cumulative effects, or environmental feedback. |
| **Notice** | Public notice of permit applications, published per NEBA sections 58.12 or 119.04. |
| **Permit** | Authorization for either (1) construction/operation of an international power line (Part III.1), or (2) exportation of electricity (Part VI). |
| **Power line outside Canada** | The section of a power line in the U.S. from the border crossover point to the first U.S. switching station. |

## **Inspection Authority**

- Members of the National Energy Board (NEB) or individuals **authorized in writing** by the Board may inspect:
  - Instruments, devices, plant, equipment, books, records, accounts, and other materials used in the **exportation of electricity**.
- Inspections may include **testing** necessary to verify compliance.
- Authorized personnel must **produce their written authorization** upon request.
- Operators or persons in charge of premises or equipment must **permit inspections** and **assist** the Board or authorized persons in carrying them out.
