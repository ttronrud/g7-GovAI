### **5. Loan Amounts and Types**

#### **A. Standard Loans (by the Board)**

#### **B. Larger Loans (for Mergers, Acquisitions, or Amalgamations)**
- The Board may approve loans **exceeding $1,500,000** *only* if the restructuring involves:
  - Acquisition, merger, or amalgamation of one or more manufacturers.

  - A **trustee, receiver, receiver-manager, or other person** appointed to manage the business (e.g., during bankruptcy or receivership) to protect Her Majesty’s interest in those assets.

> These follow-on loans are designed to prevent asset depletion or loss during restructuring or liquidation phases.

---

### **6. Interest Rates**

- Interest rates are set **on the day the loan application is approved** and must fall within a prescribed range:
  - **Minimum**: Not less than the interest rate charged by the Government of Canada to Crown corporations for loans of a similar term.
  - **Maximum**: Not more than **2.25% above** the base rate.
- **Special Rule**: For loans related solely to the acquisition of working capital, the **highest rate** (i.e., 2.25% above the base rate) applies.
- This ensures affordability while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

---

### **7. Loan Term and Repayment**

- Loan terms **cannot exceed 15 years**.
- Repayment can be made **in full or in part** at any time, **without notice or penalty**, as determined by the Board.

  - **Surrender, retransfer, or reconvey** any security as needed.
  - **Amend the terms** of existing security agreements.

### **Conclusion**

The *Footwear and Tanning Industries Assistance Regulations* create a structured, risk-managed financial support system for manufacturers in two declining or struggling Canadian industries. The regulations emphasize:

- **Due diligence** through mandatory restructuring plans and expert consultation,
- **Fiscal responsibility** through interest rate caps and oversight,
- **Asset protection** via security and follow-on loans,
- **Strategic support** for major transformations (e.g., mergers, acquisitions),
- And **clear governance** through the Board and its Executive Committee.

These provisions aim to preserve viable operations, prevent total business collapse, and protect public funds while supporting industrial modernization and competitiveness in a challenging economic environment.

**Note**: The regulations reflect a historical policy context—likely enacted during a period of industrial decline in Canada’s footwear and leather sectors (e.g., mid-to-late 20th century). They represent a form of government intervention to stabilize key manufacturing sectors through financial restructuring support.
