**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Order Respecting the Remission of Fiscal Stabilization Overpayments Made to Certain Provinces Under the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act** (R.S., c. F-11), which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) to make orders regarding the remission of certain fiscal overpayments to provinces.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., cancel or forgive) fiscal stabilization overpayments** made to specific provinces under the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*. These overpayments were made by the federal government to support provincial finances during a particular fiscal period. However, the federal government determines that these overpayments may have had a negative impact on the recipient province’s fiscal situation, and thus, a remission is necessary to prevent or mitigate such adverse effects.

**Scope of the Remission:**  
- The remission applies to **specific provinces** listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** attached to the Order.  
- Each province is entitled to a **specific monetary amount** listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**, which corresponds to the overpayment made to that province during the fiscal year **beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March 31, 2016**.  
- The overpayments were made under the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*, which governs financial transfers and stabilization mechanisms between the federal and provincial governments.

**Fiscal Context:**  
The fiscal year in question (2015–2016) was a period of financial adjustment, during which the federal government provided stabilization payments to provinces to help them manage economic downturns or fiscal challenges. These payments were intended to support provincial budgets and maintain public services. However, the federal government, through the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board, concluded that continuing to retain these overpayments could negatively affect the fiscal health of the recipient provinces—such as increasing their debt burdens, distorting budget planning, or creating financial instability.

**Key Provisions:**  
1. **Remission of Overpayments:** The full amount specified in the Schedule is forgiven or "remitted" to the respective province.  
2. **No Reimbursement:** The province is not required to repay the remitted amount.  
3. **Public Interest Justification:** The Governor General in Council determines that the remission is in the **public interest**, as it prevents harm to provincial fiscal stability and promotes equitable financial management across jurisdictions.  
4. **Effective Date:** The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, making it legally effective upon publication.

**Legal and Administrative Process:**  
- The Order is issued following a formal recommendation by the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, indicating that the decision is based on rigorous financial and policy analysis.  
- The Governor General in Council acts as the formal authority to approve the remission, reflecting the constitutional framework of financial governance in Canada where federal fiscal decisions are made through established administrative and legislative processes.

**Implications:**  
- For the provinces: The remission reduces their fiscal obligations and may improve their balance sheets by removing a liability associated with the overpayment.  
- For the federal government: It demonstrates fiscal responsibility and a commitment to ensuring that financial transfers do not create long-term fiscal imbalances.  
- For broader fiscal policy: This Order reflects a mechanism for adjusting intergovernmental financial arrangements in response to changing economic conditions and fiscal realities.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a targeted fiscal adjustment designed to correct a potential imbalance in provincial finances by canceling specific overpayments made during the 2015–2016 fiscal year. It is grounded in legal authority, driven by public interest considerations, and implemented through a transparent, policy-based administrative process. The remission serves both as a corrective measure and a safeguard for the long-term fiscal sustainability of the provinces involved.
