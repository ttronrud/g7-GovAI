### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Definitions**

The regulation begins with precise definitions of key terms:

- **Document**:  
  Includes not only physical or written records but also *transcripts of any proceedings*. This broad definition ensures that court records, including verbatim notes or summaries of hearings, are covered under the regulation.

- **Judge**:  
  Refers to any of the following judicial officers:
  - The Chief Justice of New Brunswick  
  - The Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench of New Brunswick  
  - A judge of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick  
  - A judge of the Court of King’s Bench of New Brunswick  
  - A judge of the Provincial Court of New Brunswick  

  This definition ensures that all levels of the criminal justice system within New Brunswick are covered, from provincial to appellate courts.

- **Official Translator**:  
  A person officially appointed by the **Lieutenant-Governor in Council** under **section 44 of the Official Languages Act (OLA)**. These translators are recognized as qualified and authorized to perform official translations between English and French.

- **Proceedings**:  
  Refers specifically to any criminal matter involving:
  - A preliminary inquiry or trial  
  - Conducted under an Act of Parliament  
  - Before one of the following courts in New Brunswick:
    - Provincial Court  
    - Court of King’s Bench  
    - Court of Appeal  

  This limits the scope to criminal proceedings and excludes civil matters or non-criminal administrative processes.

- **Translation**:  
  Defined as a translation from one official language (English or French) to the other, carried out by an **Official Translator**.

#### **2. Certification of Translations and Evidence**

**Subsection (1): Certificate by an Official Translator**  
- If an Official Translator signs or purports to sign a certificate stating that a translation is accurate, **that certificate is admissible as evidence** of the statement contained in it.  
- Importantly, **no further proof is required** to establish the validity of the translation—such as proof of the translator’s appointment, signature, or official status.  
- This simplifies judicial procedures and reduces delays caused by requiring additional verification of the translator’s credentials.

> **Effect**: A certified translation is treated as legally reliable and binding in court without needing to go through a separate authentication process.

---

#### **3. Admissibility of Certified Translations**

**Subsection (2): Admissibility in Evidence**  
- Any translation of a document—whether complete or partial—that has been certified under subsection (1) is **admissible in evidence** in criminal proceedings.  
- This means that even if only a portion of a document is translated, as long as it is certified correctly, it can be presented in court.

> **Effect**: Ensures flexibility and practicality in legal proceedings, especially when only specific parts of a document (e.g., a name or date) are relevant.

---

#### **4. Authenticity and Weight of Translated Documents**

**Subsection (3): Equal Authenticity and Weight**  
- A certified translation is **equally authentic and of equal weight** in evidence as the original document.  
- This means that a translated version is not considered a secondary or inferior form of evidence; it carries the same legal standing as the original.

> **Effect**: Reinforces the principle of equality of language rights under the *Official Languages Act*, ensuring that neither English nor French speakers are at a disadvantage in accessing or presenting evidence.

---

#### **5. Objection to Specific Translations**

**Subsection (4): Right to Object to Word-Level Translations**  
- A party (plaintiff, defendant, or any other participant) who believes a translation contains an inaccuracy or misrepresentation may **object to a specific word or phrase** in the translated document.  
- The objection must be raised **by motion**, either orally or in writing, at the **first available opportunity** during the preliminary inquiry or trial.  
- The objection must be directed to the **presiding judge**, who will then rule on it.

> **Effect**: Provides a formal and timely mechanism for parties to challenge translation errors, ensuring accuracy and fairness in the presentation of facts. It also places responsibility on the judge to ensure linguistic integrity in court records.

### **Legal Basis and Purpose**

- **Section 533 of the Criminal Code** provides the authority for the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to amend or repeal regulations related to translated documents in criminal proceedings.  
- The regulation is grounded in the **Official Languages Act**, which mandates equal treatment of English and French in federal and provincial institutions, including the justice system.

### **Key Objectives of the Regulation**

1. **Ensure Equal Access to Justice**  
   By affirming that translations are equally authentic and admissible, the regulation ensures that individuals in both official language communities can fully participate in legal proceedings.

2. **Simplify Legal Procedures**  
   By eliminating the need to prove the translator’s credentials or the validity of the certificate, the process becomes faster and more efficient.

3. **Enhance Accuracy and Accountability**  
   The right to object to specific translations allows for scrutiny of linguistic fidelity, helping to prevent misrepresentations in court.

4. **Align with Federal Standards**  
   The regulation harmonizes New Brunswick’s approach with national standards set by the *Official Languages Act* and the *Criminal Code*, promoting consistency across jurisdictions.

### **Practical Implications for Legal Practice**

- **Prosecutors and defense counsel** can rely on certified translations from Official Translators without needing to verify the translator’s status.
- Courts are empowered to accept a translation as evidence without further inquiry, streamlining trial preparation and presentation.
- Parties may raise objections to specific phrases or terms, promoting transparency and accuracy in the record.
- The inclusion of **transcripts** as "documents" means that even recorded proceedings (e.g., witness statements or trial notes) can be translated and used in evidence.
