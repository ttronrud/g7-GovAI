- **Under authority of:** Subsection 2.4(1)a of the *Bank Act*  
- **Statutory Citation:**  
  - S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 2  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 46  

> This regulation establishes the legal criteria for determining which banks or bank holding companies are considered **"distributing banks"** or **"distributing bank holding companies"** under the *Bank Act*. These designations are critical for regulatory oversight, particularly in relation to securities disclosure, market conduct, and financial stability.

---

### 🔹 **Purpose of the Regulation**
To define precisely which financial institutions — specifically banks or bank holding companies — are classified as **distributing banks or distributing bank holding companies** for the purposes of the *Bank Act*, especially in relation to securities issuance and reporting obligations.

This classification impacts how these institutions are monitored and regulated, particularly when they are involved in public offerings, mergers, or capital market activities.

---

### 🔹 **Key Definitions and Criteria**

#### ✅ **What Constitutes a Distributing Bank or Distributing Bank Holding Company?**

A bank or bank holding company qualifies as a **distributing bank or distributing bank holding company** if **any one** of the following conditions applies:

---

#### **1. Reporting Issuer under Provincial or Federal Securities Legislation**
> A bank or bank holding company is a distributing entity if it is a **"reporting issuer"** under any of the listed securities laws in **column 2 of the Schedule**.

> This means that if the institution files financial reports or disclosures with a securities regulator (e.g., under provincial or federal securities acts), it falls under the definition of a distributing bank.

> The applicable legislation includes:
- *Securities Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5 (Ontario)  
- *Securities Act*, R.S.Q., c. V-1.1 (Quebec)  
- *Securities Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 418 (New Brunswick)  
- *Securities Act*, S.N.B. 2004, c. S-5.5 (Newfoundland and Labrador)  
- *Securities Act*, C.C.S.M., c. S50 (British Columbia)  
- *Securities Act*, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418 (British Columbia)  
- *Securities Act*, 1988, S.S. 1988-89, c. S-42.2 (Saskatchewan)  
- *Securities Act*, R.S.A. 2000, c. S-4 (Nova Scotia)  
- *Securities Act*, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. S-13 (Newfoundland and Labrador)

> These definitions are **as amended from time to time**, meaning they are updated to reflect changes in provincial securities laws.

---

#### **2. Public Offering or Listing on a Stock Exchange**
> A bank or bank holding company is considered a distributing entity **if**:
- It has filed a **prospectus or registration statement** under **provincial or foreign legislation**, and  
- **Any of its securities are listed and posted for trading** on a stock exchange **in Canada or outside Canada**.

> This provision applies even if the institution is not a "reporting issuer" under the above laws — it still qualifies if it has publicly traded securities.

> Example: A bank that issues shares to the public through a Canadian or international stock exchange (e.g., TSX, NYSE) would be considered a distributing bank.

---

#### **3. Involvement in Specific Corporate Events**
> A bank or bank holding company is a distributing entity if it is involved in, formed for, results from, or continues after one of the following corporate actions:
- Amalgamation  
- Reorganization  
- Arrangement  
- Statutory procedure  

> **But only if one of the participating corporate bodies is:**
- A reporting issuer under any of the listed securities laws (as in paragraph 1), **or**
- A bank or bank holding company that has filed a prospectus or registration statement (as in paragraph 2)

> This ensures that financial institutions involved in major corporate restructuring are subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as those with public securities exposure.

---

### 🔹 **Exemption Clause (Important Limitation)**

> A bank or bank holding company that is **exempt** under provincial securities legislation, **or** that has received an **order from a provincial securities regulator** stating it is **not a reporting issuer**, is **not** considered a distributing bank or distributing bank holding company.

> This means:
- If a provincial regulator determines a bank does not need to file regular reports (e.g., due to small size or private ownership), it is **excluded** from the definition of a distributing bank.
- This provides regulatory flexibility for smaller or less complex institutions.

> Example: A regional bank not listed publicly and not required to file reports under provincial law would **not** be classified as a distributing bank.

---

### 🔹 **Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., when officially published in the *Canada Gazette* or other official register).

> This ensures immediate applicability upon formal adoption.

---

### 🔹 **Key Regulatory Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Regulatory Scrutiny** | Distributing banks are subject to enhanced regulatory oversight under the *Bank Act*, particularly regarding disclosure, capital adequacy, and market conduct. |
| **Disclosure Requirements** | These institutions must comply with securities disclosure rules in their respective provinces or under federal frameworks. |
| **Mergers & Reorganizations** | Any major corporate action involving a distributing bank triggers additional regulatory review. |
| **Cross-Jurisdictional Coverage** | The rules apply to both domestic and foreign-listed securities, ensuring consistency across borders. |
| **Exemption Protection** | Smaller or non-listed banks are shielded from being classified as "distributing" if they fall under exemptions. |

---

### 🔹 **Why This Regulation Matters**

This regulation bridges the gap between:
- The **Bank Act**, which governs banking operations and systemic risk,
- And **provincial securities legislation**, which governs public offerings and investor protection.

By clearly defining which banks are "distributing," the government ensures:
- Consistent application of financial regulation,
- Protection of investors in public offerings,
- Enhanced transparency in financial markets,
- Appropriate risk management in bank mergers and capital structures.

It also supports the **principle of proportionality** — only banks with significant public exposure or involvement in capital markets are classified as "distributing," avoiding over-regulation of smaller or private institutions.

---

### 🔹 **Conclusion**

The *Distributing Bank and Distributing Bank Holding Company Regulations* provide a **comprehensive, legally grounded framework** to identify which banks and bank holding companies are subject to enhanced regulatory treatment due to their public market exposure or participation in significant corporate transactions.

It:
- Builds on existing provincial securities definitions,
- Applies to both domestic and international listings,
- Excludes entities with valid exemptions,
- Ensures regulatory coherence across jurisdictions.

This regulation is a vital tool for maintaining financial stability, protecting investors, and ensuring that banks with public market exposure are held to higher standards of transparency and accountability.
