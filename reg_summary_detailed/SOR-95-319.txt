**Detailed Summary of the Directions to the CRTC (Direct-to-Home (DTH) Satellite Distribution Undertakings) Order**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulatory order, issued on **April 30, 1995**, establishes the policy framework for the **licensing of Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite distribution undertakings** in Canada. It was developed under the authority of the *Broadcasting Act* and approved by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Communications.

The primary objective is to ensure that **DTH satellite distribution services** — which deliver television programming directly to homes via satellite — are integrated into Canada’s broadcasting policy in a way that:

- Promotes **competitive markets**;
- Supports the **development of Canadian content**;
- Maintains the **integrity and diversity** of the Canadian broadcasting system;
- Ensures **equitable access** to programming in both official languages (English and French);
- Encourages innovation in new services, including **pay-per-view (PPV)** offerings.

### **Key Background Provisions**

1. **Significance of Satellite Broadcasting**  
   All types of satellite broadcasting play a crucial role in implementing Canada’s broadcasting policy (as set out in subsection 3(1) of the *Broadcasting Act*), particularly in delivering programming to remote and rural areas across the country.

2. **Growing Role of DTH Services**  
   DTH services are expected to become increasingly important as **primary and alternative distribution channels** for:
   - Canadian programming (in both official languages);
   - Foreign programming;
   - New and emerging services, including pay-per-view.

3. **Potential for Canadian Pay-Per-View Development**  
   If properly regulated, DTH platforms can become key vehicles for distributing **independently produced Canadian pay-per-view services**, thereby supporting domestic content creation.

4. **Need for a Competitive, Regulated Market**  
   DTH distribution undertakings should operate within a **dynamically competitive market**, subject to clear regulatory requirements — especially regarding **contributions to Canadian programming** — to ensure fair competition with other distribution methods (e.g., cable, SMATV).

5. **No Refusal Based on Economic Viability**  
   The CRTC must **not deny a licence** solely because the applicant lacks economic viability. This ensures that market entry is open and inclusive.

6. **Public Interest and Timeliness**  
   Licensing should proceed as quickly as possible — the government had already recommended completion by **September 1, 1995**, and this Order sets a target of **November 1, 1995**, for finalizing the licensing process.

7. **Policy Alignment**  
   The CRTC must uphold the **overall integrity of the Canadian broadcasting system** and ensure that DTH services comply with the national broadcasting policy.

8. **Consultation and Parliamentary Process**  
   The proposed Order was:
   - Published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **April 29, 1995**;
   - Opened for public comment;
   - Laid before both Houses of Parliament;
   - Allowed 40 sitting days for review — a period that had expired by the time of issuance.

### **Core Regulatory Directions to the CRTC**

#### 1. **Promotion of a Dynamic Competitive Market**
The CRTC is directed to **promote a competitive market** for DTH distribution undertakings, encouraging multiple providers to enter the market and offer programming services in competition with one another and with traditional distribution methods (e.g., cable, SMATV).

#### 2. **Equal Programming Rights and Policies**
To ensure fairness and consistency, DTH distribution undertakings must be governed by **rules substantially identical to those applied to other distribution undertakings**, including:

- **Selection of Canadian and foreign programming services**;
- **Use of Canadian and foreign satellite facilities**, in accordance with generally applicable Canadian satellite policy.

This prevents DTH providers from gaining unfair advantages or being restricted in programming choices.

#### 3. **Equitable Obligations and Contributions to Canadian Programming**
DTH undertakings must make **significant financial contributions to Canadian programming**, specifically:

- **At least 5% of gross annual revenues** must be directed toward the production of Canadian content;
- This contribution must be **administered independently** of the DTH undertaking’s operations to ensure transparency and accountability.

This requirement aims to ensure that DTH companies are not just profit-driven but actively contribute to the development of Canadian culture and media.

#### 4. **Freedom to Distribute Equivalent Programming**
DTH undertakings **cannot be blocked** from offering programming that is already available through other licensed distribution services (e.g., cable) due to contractual arrangements made by other licensees. This prevents monopolistic or restrictive practices and ensures **consumer choice**.

#### 5. **Restrictions on Pay-Per-View Services**
- DTH distribution undertakings **may only distribute pay-per-view services** that are licensed specifically as **DTH pay-per-view television programming undertakings**.
- They are **prohibited from distributing any PPV service not licensed under this specific framework**.

#### 6. **Permitted Use of Foreign Satellites for PPV**
- A DTH undertaking **may distribute a pay-per-view service using a foreign satellite**, **provided**:
  - The use is consistent with **general Canadian satellite policy**;
  - The service is otherwise compliant with all other requirements.

This allows flexibility in service delivery while maintaining national policy oversight.

#### 7. **Bilingual Programming Requirement**
- If a DTH provider chooses to distribute **one or more English-language pay-per-view services**, it is **required to distribute at least one French-language pay-per-view service** as soon as that service becomes available for DTH distribution.

This enforces **bilingualism and equity** in programming access, a cornerstone of Canadian broadcasting policy.

---

### **Licensing Authority and Prohibitions**

- The CRTC **must not authorize** any person or group to operate a DTH distribution undertaking **without a licence** issued by the CRTC.
- After the licensing process concludes, the CRTC must ensure that **no one is authorized** to operate such a service through any unauthorized means (e.g., informal agreements, unlicensed operations).

> This establishes **strict licensing control** to prevent unregulated or uncompetitive entry into the market.

---

### **No Barrier to Existing PPV Licences**

- The CRTC **must not refuse** to issue a DTH distribution licence to an applicant **just because** that applicant already holds a licence for a **DTH pay-per-view programming undertaking**.

This encourages the growth of integrated service providers who can offer both distribution and programming services, without creating regulatory barriers.

---

### **Timeline for Licensing Process**

- The CRTC is required to:
  - **Immediately call for licence applications** upon the coming into force of this Order;
  - Complete the licensing process **as quickly as possible**, and
  - In the absence of "the most compelling of circumstances," **no later than November 1, 1995**.

This deadline reflects the urgency of establishing a competitive and viable DTH market in alignment with broader national policy goals.
