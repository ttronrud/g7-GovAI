**Detailed Summary of the *Exempt Debt Obligation Transactions (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **section 978a of the Bank Act**.  
- The Bank Act is the primary legislation governing banking activities in Canada, including requirements related to transparency, disclosure, and the issuance of debt instruments.  
- Section 978a empowers the government to create regulations that define specific exemptions from certain disclosure and prospectus filing requirements for debt obligations issued by banks and bank holding companies.

This regulatory instrument aims to provide **exemptions from prospectus filing obligations** for certain types of debt obligations, thereby enabling more efficient and flexible financing mechanisms—particularly for international and structured debt instruments—without requiring full public disclosure under Canadian securities laws.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The main objective is to **identify and define conditions under which debt obligations issued by banks or bank holding companies may be exempt from the requirement to file a prospectus** under Canadian or foreign securities laws.  
This exemption applies only to specific types of debt obligations that meet defined criteria, ensuring that:
- The financial stability of banks is not compromised by excessive disclosure burdens.
- Banks can access international capital markets efficiently.
- Investor protection is maintained through reasonable safeguards.

### **3. Prescribed International Agencies (Section 482(2)(b)(ii) and 944(2)(b)(ii))**

For the purposes of **subparagraphs 482(2)(b)(ii)** and **944(2)(b)(ii)** of the Bank Act, the following institutions are recognized as **"prescribed international agencies"**:

| Agency | Region/Function |
|-------|----------------|
| Asian Development Bank (ADB) | Asia |
| Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) | Americas |
| International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) | World (World Bank Group) |

| European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) | Europe |
| Council of Europe Development Bank (CEDB) | Europe (Council of Europe) |

👉 **Implication**: Debt obligations issued by a bank or bank holding company to these international development banks are automatically exempt from prospectus filing requirements, provided they meet other applicable conditions.

> This recognition streamlines access to funding through multilateral development institutions and supports cross-border financial operations.

### **4. Definition of "Widely Distributed" Debt Obligations (Sections 482(2)(d) and 944(2)(d))**

The regulations establish a detailed definition of what constitutes a **"widely distributed" debt obligation**, which is key to qualifying for exemption from prospectus filing.

#### **Conditions for Exemption (in respect of debt obligations):**

A debt obligation qualifies as "widely distributed" **if at least one of the following is satisfied**:

---

#### ✅ **Condition A: Distribution to 90% of Authorized Principal**
- At least **90% of the maximum authorized principal** of the debt obligation must be held by **persons other than**:
  - The bank or bank holding company, and
  - Its subsidiaries.

> This ensures that the majority of investors are external to the issuing institution, reducing the risk of insider concentration.

---

#### ✅ **Condition B: Distribution to at least 25 Persons (within 6 months of first issuance)**  
- The debt obligations must have been issued to **at least 25 different persons** (excluding the bank or its subsidiaries) within **six months** of the first issuance.

> This promotes broad investor dispersion and limits the risk of concentrated ownership.

---

#### ✅ **Condition C: Average of at least 25 Holders (for continuous issuance)**  
- If the debt obligations are issued **on a continuous basis**, then **on average**, there must be **at least 25 holders** (excluding the bank or its subsidiaries) over time.

> This applies to ongoing or recurring debt offerings (e.g., floating-rate notes or bonds issued periodically).

---

#### ✅ **Condition D: Meeting Three of Four Criteria at Initial Distribution**  
At the time of initial distribution, the debt obligations must meet **at least three of the following four criteria**:

| Criterion | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1. Initial term < 1 year | Short-term debt (e.g., commercial paper, notes with maturities under 12 months) |
| 2. Rated by a rating agency | Independent credit rating (e.g., Moody’s, S&P) adds transparency |
| 3. Distributed through a person authorized to trade in securities | Ensures compliance with securities trading rules |
| 4. Distributed via offering circular or similar document | Formal offering materials provide investor information |

> This ensures that even short-term, less complex instruments are reasonably transparent and compliant with disclosure norms.

---

#### ⚠️ **Alternative Requirement (for other debt obligations):**
If the debt obligation **does not fall under the above categories**, then it must have been issued **with a prospectus filed** under:
- Canadian securities laws, or
- Provincial laws, or
- Laws of a jurisdiction outside Canada.

> This ensures that non-exempt debt obligations still meet standard disclosure requirements.

---

### **5. Definition of "Maximum Authorized Principal"**

- **"Maximum authorized principal"** refers to the **maximum amount of debt** that can be issued under the terms of the debt obligation or any related agreement.
- This is a critical metric used in determining whether the debt is widely distributed (e.g., whether 90% of the principal is held by third parties).

> Example: A bank issues a $100 million bond with a maximum authorized principal of $100 million. If only $10 million is actually issued, the 90% threshold is still assessed based on the full authorized amount.

### **6. Effective Dates**

- The regulations include a **"Repeal" clause**, indicating that prior versions or conflicting rules are being replaced or superseded by this version.  
- This ensures regulatory clarity and alignment with updated financial market practices.

### **Conclusion**

The *Exempt Debt Obligation Transactions (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* are a targeted piece of regulatory policy designed to **enhance the efficiency and flexibility of banking financing** while maintaining investor protection and transparency.

These rules are especially relevant for:
- Banks issuing commercial paper or short-term notes,
- Debt instruments to multilateral development banks,
