### **Detailed Summary of the Burwash Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

The **Burwash Airport Zoning Regulations** are formally adopted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in official journals (e.g., *Canada Gazette Part I*) and in local media (e.g., *The Whitehorse Star*) to provide a reasonable opportunity for public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt and implement proposed regulations after public consultation.

These regulations were:
- First published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette Part I* on **February 18 and 25, 1995**.
- Published in two successive issues of *The Whitehorse Star* on **February 23 and 24, 1995**.

This publication process ensured that stakeholders—such as residents, developers, aviation authorities, and environmental groups—had sufficient time to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport before final adoption.

> ✅ **Outcome**: Based on this public consultation, the Governor in Council formally enacted the regulations on **February 25, 1995**, pursuant to section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Burwash Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Citation**: S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10 (refers to the enabling legislation)
- **Effective Date**: February 25, 1995 (date of publication and enactment)

#### **3. Definitions and Key Terms**

The regulations define several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Burwash Airport, located near Burwash Landing, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the runway centerline, 915 meters from the threshold of runway 28. It serves as the origin for all elevation and distance measurements. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 10–28), designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches. Each has a **1:40 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 40 meters horizontal run). They rise to an imaginary horizontal line 3,000 meters from the runway end, 525 meters offset from the runway centerline, and 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane 45 meters above the ARP elevation. However, where this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent unreasonable restrictions. |
| **Strip** | The active runway area (1,950 meters long, 150 meters wide), centered on the runway 10–28. It includes the runway and adjacent areas designated for takeoff and landing. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes (1:7 slope) extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising to intersect the outer surface. These ensure a smooth transition between the runway environment and the outer zone. |

> 🔍 **Elevation of ARP**: 793.7 meters above sea level.

#### **4. Geographic Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all land** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Burwash Airport, including:
- Public road allowances
- Private properties
- Any land within the defined boundary

This land is **specifically delineated** in **Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulations, which references the **Burwash Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3027**, dated **February 24, 1994**.

> 📍 **Boundary of the Zone**:  
> The outer boundary is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

This creates a large, circular zone around the airport where construction is strictly controlled.

#### **5. Core Restriction: Height Limitations**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures) **if the highest point of that structure exceeds**:

1. The **approach surfaces**  
2. The **outer surface**  
3. The **transitional surfaces**

> ⚠️ This restriction applies to **every point** of any structure within the regulated zone. Even small structures (e.g., antennas, towers, sheds, or windbreaks) must comply with these height limits.

This rule is designed to:
- Prevent interference with aircraft during takeoff and landing
- Minimize visual and navigational hazards
- Ensure safe flight operations by maintaining clear airspace and visibility

---

#### **6. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- **Safety**: To protect aircraft during approach and departure by maintaining unobstructed flight paths.
- **Air Navigation**: To preserve visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR) operations by ensuring adequate clearance.
- **Environmental and Community Protection**: To prevent noise and visual pollution from nearby development.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: To provide a consistent, measurable, and enforceable framework for land use near the airport.

---

#### **7. Visual Reference and Planning Basis**

All spatial elements (approach surfaces, outer surface, strip, transitional surfaces) are **based on the Burwash Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3027**, approved on **February 24, 1994**. This plan serves as the authoritative spatial reference for:

- Determining the location of the ARP
- Defining the geometry of approach and transitional surfaces
- Establishing the outer boundary

> ✅ This ensures consistency with existing aviation planning and regulatory standards.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, enforcement would typically involve:
- Land use inspections by local or territorial authorities
- Coordination with the **Ministry of Transportation (Yukon)** or aviation oversight bodies
- Penalties for non-compliance (e.g., fines, demolition orders, or legal action)

Compliance is mandatory for all new construction, modifications, or expansions within the regulated zone.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

The **Burwash Airport Zoning Regulations** establish strict height limits on all structures near Burwash Airport in Yukon. These limits are based on precise geometric planes (approach, transitional, and outer surfaces) that extend from the runway and are designed to ensure aircraft can safely take off and land without obstruction.

- The airport's central point (ARP) is at 793.7 meters above sea level.
- A 4,000-meter radius circle defines the area under regulation.
- Structures cannot exceed the height of any of the three defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional).
- The rules were developed after public notice and consultation to balance aviation safety with community development.

### **Conclusion**

These regulations represent a comprehensive and technically sound approach to airport zoning in a remote, high-altitude region like Yukon. By using standardized, measurable surfaces derived from a detailed zoning plan, the regulations balance the needs of aviation safety with the practical realities of land use and community development. They remain a foundational document for managing growth and infrastructure near Burwash Airport to this day.
