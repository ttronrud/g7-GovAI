### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Policy Background**

The **Canadian Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) Regulations** were enacted under the **Aeronautics Act** to promote fair competition and transparency in the Canadian air travel market. The primary objectives are:

- To ensure **fair, neutral, and comprehensive presentation** of passenger air services in computer reservation systems (CRS) operating in Canada.
- To guarantee that **travel agents and consumers** have access to accurate, balanced, and comparable information about air services available in Canada.
- To protect against **unfair discrimination** in how carriers are displayed or promoted within CRS platforms.

These regulations aim to level the playing field among airlines, prevent market distortions, and enhance consumer choice and trust in air travel information systems.

---

#### **2. Scope of Application**

The Regulations apply to all **computer reservation systems (CRS)** operated in Canada for the purpose of **displaying or selling passenger air services**, regardless of:

- The **legal status or nationality** of the system vendor;
- The **source of data** or location of the data processing center;
- The **geographic location** where the air services are provided.

**Exclusions:**
- Systems used **internally by carriers, their affiliates, or charterers** in their own offices or sales counters.
- **Carrier-owned websites** (e.g., official airline websites) are not subject to these rules.

> ⚠️ Important: These Regulations do **not** exempt any party from compliance with other federal laws such as the **Competition Act** or the **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**.

#### **4. Core Obligations of System Vendors**

##### **4.1 Fair, Neutral, and Comprehensive Displays**
- All displays of carrier information must be:
  - **Comprehensive**: Include all relevant details (schedules, fares, rules, availability).
  - **Neutral**: Not favor one carrier over another.
  - **Non-discriminatory**: Not based on carrier identity, market share, or other biased factors.

> ✅ System vendors must apply **consistent standards** across all participating carriers and city-pair markets.

##### **4.2 Prohibition of Carrier-Based Bias**
- System vendors **must not use any factor related to carrier identity** when:
  - Constructing or ordering flight displays.
  - Editing connecting flights.
  - Determining which flights appear or are prioritized.

> This prevents preferential treatment of certain airlines (e.g., larger or more profitable ones).

##### **4.3 Equal Treatment of Flights and Stops**
- In cities with **multiple airports**, the system must ensure **no discrimination based on airport served**.
- Flights involving **stops, changes of aircraft, carriers, or modes of transport** must be **clearly identified** to avoid confusion.

##### **4.4 Charter Air Services**
- Charter services must be:
  - **Clearly labeled** as "charter air services."
  - **Displayed only once** per city-pair market if multiple charterers offer the same service.
  - The **names of all charterers** must be clearly indicated.

> ❌ Tourism products (e.g., all-inclusive packages) are **excluded** from CRS displays.

##### **4.5 No Automatic Carrier Preference**
- System vendors **cannot create functions** that automatically favor one carrier over others.

##### **4.6 Consistent Treatment of Non-Participating Carriers**
- If a system displays information from **non-participating carriers**, it must do so in the **same manner** as for all other non-participating carriers.

##### **4.7 Transparency in Display Criteria**
- System vendors must:
  - Provide, upon request, the **current criteria used** to construct and order flight displays.
  - Disclose the **weight assigned to each criterion** (e.g., time, price, route, etc.).

##### **4.8 Default Display Rights**
- Subscribers have the right to:
  - **Select a default display** at no extra cost.
  - Have that display remain active unless they request otherwise.
- The default display must be **at least as useful** as any other display in terms of functionality and ease of use.

> Note: A consumer can request a different display for each transaction without the default being suppressed.

---

#### **5. Information Accuracy and Integrity**

##### **5.1 Accuracy of Carrier Data**
- Participating carriers must provide **accurate and non-misleading** information.
- If a carrier provides **inaccurate or misleading information**, the system vendor must:
  - Notify both the carrier and subscribers.
- Flights operated by a carrier **other than the one identified by the designator code** must clearly identify the **actual operating carrier** (except in rare short-term arrangements).

##### **5.2 Disclosure of Code-Sharing and Wet Leases**
- In **code-sharing or long-term wet lease arrangements**:
  - Subscribers must **inform consumers orally and in writing** that:
    - The carrier whose designator appears on the ticket is **not necessarily the one operating** the flight.
    - The **actual transporting carrier** must be clearly identified at the time of booking and sale.
- In **non-oral/recorded transactions**, the subscriber may meet this requirement by including a **notation in the PNR** (Passenger Name Record).

---

#### **6. Fair Access and Equal Treatment**

##### **6.1 Equal Access to Distribution Facilities**
- All carriers (including new or small ones) must have **equal opportunity** to:
  - Access the system’s distribution facilities.
  - Use service enhancements (e.g., seat selection, last seat availability, boarding passes).
- System vendors **cannot require** carriers to buy or sell other goods/services as a condition of participation.

##### **6.2 Equal Loading Standards**
- System vendors must apply **the same standards of care and timeliness** when loading data from all participating carriers.
- If a carrier receives special loading capabilities (e.g., faster updates), the vendor must offer the **same capability to all other carriers** when technically feasible.

##### **6.3 Data Sharing and Transparency**
- Carriers may request:
  - Current **database update procedures** and **data formats** (e.g., for schedules and fares).
- System vendors are **not required** to display information from carriers that do not intend to enter into a contract with them.

---

#### **7. Billing and Transaction Transparency**

- Billing must be:
  - **Detailed and verifiable**.
  - Delivered via an **electronic medium compatible** with the carrier’s systems.
- Each billable segment must include:
  - Type of booking (e.g., reservation, cancellation)
  - Booking status code
  - Booking/cancellation indicator
  - PNR record locator
  - Passenger name, country of origin
  - Agency code (e.g., IATA/ARC/BSP)
  - Pseudo-city code
  - Transaction date
  - City-pair or segment
  - Flight date and number
  - Class of service

> This ensures transparency and accountability for all transactions.

---

#### **8. Separation of Services**

- System vendors must **separate distribution facilities** (where bookings are made) from **hosting services** (where seat inventory is managed) — either **physically or logically**.
- This ensures that:
  - Hosted and non-hosted carriers are treated **equally** in terms of:
    - Procedures
    - Protocols
    - Inputs and outputs
- Interfaces must be **compatible with industry standards** (e.g., IATA, ICAO).

---

#### **9. Disclosure of Regulations and Improvements**

- The **complete, unedited text of these Regulations** must be displayed in the system’s reference information.
- Any **improvement** to:
  - Distribution facilities
  - Service enhancements
  - Equipment
  must be **offered to all participating carriers** (subject to technical limitations outside the vendor’s control).
