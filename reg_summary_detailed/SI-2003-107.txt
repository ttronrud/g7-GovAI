### Detailed Summary:

**Status of the Regulation**:  
The regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially cancelled or withdrawn) by **Statutory Instrument 2008-20, Section 5**. This means that the regulation no longer exists in legal force and is no longer applicable.

**Legal Context**:  
Statutory Instruments (SIs) are a form of secondary legislation used in the United Kingdom (and other Commonwealth jurisdictions) to make laws without requiring a full parliamentary act. SI 2008-20 is a specific instrument issued in 2008, and Section 5 of that instrument explicitly **repeals a prior regulation** — likely one related to a sector such as health, safety, environmental protection, or administrative procedures — that had previously been in effect.

**Nature of the Repeal**:  
The repeated references suggest that the repeal applies to a **specific provision or set of provisions** previously issued under a different statutory authority or schedule. While the original regulation is not provided, the repeal indicates that:

- The regulation was previously active and had legal effect.
- It was formally removed from law by SI 2008-20, s. 5.
- The repeal may have been implemented to:
  - Replace the regulation with a more modern or effective version,
  - Correct a legal error or inconsistency,
  - Align with new policy objectives,
  - Simplify or streamline existing legislation.

**Practical Implications**:  
- Any legal, administrative, or operational obligations previously derived from the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Authorities or individuals relying on the regulation must now refer to the current, valid legislation in place.
- The repeal may have triggered a transition period or required updates to internal policies, compliance procedures, or licensing frameworks.

**Note on Availability**:  
Since the original regulation is not included in the provided text, a detailed description of its content (e.g., subject matter, scope, key provisions) cannot be offered. To reconstruct its content, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory notes accompanying SI 2008-20.

### Conclusion:  
The summary of the regulation is that **it has been formally repealed by Statutory Instrument 2008-20, Section 5**. As such, it is no longer in force and should not be referenced in current legal or administrative practice. The repeal reflects a legislative update or correction, but without access to the original regulation, specific details about its content or purpose remain unavailable.

For further information, reference should be made to the full text of SI 2008-20 and its explanatory notes, or to the original regulation being repealed.
