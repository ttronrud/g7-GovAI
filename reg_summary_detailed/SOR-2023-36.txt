### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This Order establishes a **fee remission program** for specific medical device establishment licence applications that were processed during the **COVID-19 pandemic**, with the goal of supporting the rapid response needed to meet increased demand for medical devices during public health emergencies. It provides **remission of licence fees and associated interest** for applications that were submitted, examined, and ultimately cancelled within a defined timeframe.

---

### **Key Definitions and References**

- **"Regulations"** refers to the *Medical Devices Regulations*.
- Unless otherwise specified, terms used in this Order have the same meaning as assigned in the *Medical Devices Regulations* or the *Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Order* (FDMDO).

---

### **Scope of Remission**

The fee remission applies to:

1. **Applications for an establishment licence** submitted under **section 45 of the Medical Devices Regulations**; or  
2. **Applications for the annual review of an establishment licence** submitted under **section 46.1 of the Medical Devices Regulations**.

This remission covers:
- The **fee payable** under subsection 71(1) of the *Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Order*;
- Any **interest** that may have accrued on that fee;
- Any adjustment to the fee amount due to prior remissions under subsection 6(1) or section 74 of the FDMDO.

---

### **Conditions for Fee Remission**

To qualify for remission, the following **four conditions must all be met**:

1. **Submission Date:**  
   The application must have been submitted to the Minister **on or after April 1, 2020**.  
   → This aligns with the onset of the global pandemic and the heightened need for medical device access.

2. **Examination Completion Date:**  
   The Minister must have **completed the examination of the application on or before December 31, 2021**.  
   → This ensures that the processing occurred during the pandemic-related emergency period and within a defined window of urgency.

3. **Non-Payment of Fee Prior to Examination Completion:**  
   The fee for the examination must **not have been paid to the Minister before the examination was completed**.  
   → This ensures that the remission is only applied to cases where the fee was due and not already paid, preventing double benefits.

4. **Cancellation of Licence or Review Before a Deadline:**  
   The Minister must have **issued the establishment licence or completed the annual review**, but **cancelled it on or before January 31, 2022**.  
   → This is a critical condition indicating that the application was ultimately not approved, reflecting a temporary or emergency response that was later withdrawn. It ensures the remission is not granted for approved or ongoing licences.

### **What is Remitted?**

- The **full fee** for the examination (as set out in the FDMDO), **adjusted for any prior remissions** (e.g., under subsection 6(1) or section 74 of the FDMDO).
- Any **interest** that may have accrued on the unpaid fee during the period between submission and cancellation.

> *Note:* The remission is not retroactive to applications before April 1, 2020, nor does it apply to applications that were approved or not cancelled by January 31, 2022.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Government of Canada (i.e., the date of publication in the Canada Gazette or official registry).

---

### **Policy Rationale and Context**

- This Order responds to the **urgent need during the pandemic** to expedite the licensing of medical device establishments to support healthcare delivery.
- Many applications were processed under accelerated timelines due to public health emergencies, and the fees associated with such examinations were often deferred or waived as part of emergency measures.
- This remission **acknowledges the financial burden** on applicants who submitted applications during a time of high demand and uncertainty, especially when those applications were ultimately cancelled.
- It supports **regulatory flexibility** during public health crises while maintaining accountability through clear eligibility criteria.

---

### **Exclusions and Limitations**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Applications submitted before April 1, 2020.
  - Applications that were approved or not cancelled by January 31, 2022.
  - Applications where the fee was already paid before examination completion.
- The remission is **not available for applications related to drug licensing** (this Order is specific to medical device establishment licences).
- The remission applies only to **examination fees**, not other fees such as application fees or renewal fees.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted, time-bound remission of examination fees** for medical device establishment licence applications that were submitted during the early stages of the pandemic, examined within a defined period, and ultimately cancelled. It reflects a pragmatic and compassionate approach to regulatory oversight during a public health emergency, balancing financial accountability with the need for rapid access to medical devices.

It serves as a **temporary measure** to support the health system during the pandemic and does not extend to other types of applications or licensing processes.

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
Applicants who submitted a medical device establishment licence or annual review application on or after April 1, 2020, and whose applications were completed by December 31, 2021, and cancelled by January 31, 2022, without prior fee payment, may be eligible for full remission of the examination fee and any interest. This remission is only available under strict eligibility conditions.
