**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Title:**  
*Order Designating Newfoundland and Labrador for the Purposes of Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code*

**Date of Coming into Force:**  
April 1, 2019 (the first day on which the specified provincial legislative measures are all in force)

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation is a formal administrative order issued by the **Governor in Council** of Canada, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada**, and the **Minister of Industry**.

The primary objective of this order is to **designate the province of Newfoundland and Labrador** as a jurisdiction where **Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada** applies — specifically, the provision that criminalizes the **unlawful offering or providing of payday loans** that are **excessively costly or exploitative**.

This designation is significant because, under **section 347.1 of the Criminal Code**, certain financial transactions involving high-interest, short-term loans (commonly known as payday loans) may constitute a criminal offense if they involve **unreasonable or excessive costs** — particularly when such costs are not justified by the actual risk or need of the borrower.

However, **section 347.1 does not apply automatically across all provinces**. It is only applicable in jurisdictions where **provincial legislation has established regulatory frameworks** that align with the federal framework and where **provincial measures have been implemented to limit the total cost of borrowing** in payday loan agreements.

### **Legal Basis**

The order is made under **subsection 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code**, which provides the authority for the Governor in Council to designate a province for the purposes of section 347.1. This provision allows Canada to apply the criminal provisions related to exploitative lending only where **provincial laws have established safeguards** to protect consumers from predatory lending practices.

The regulation is grounded in the following:

- **S.C. 2007, c. 9, s. 2** – Reference to the original enactment of the Criminal Code, which includes the relevant provisions.
- **R.S., c. C-46** – The full text of the *Criminal Code*, specifically section 347.1.

### **Key Legislative Requirements for Designation**

For Newfoundland and Labrador to be officially designated under section 347.1, **three specific provincial legislative measures must be in force**:

1. **An Act to Amend the Consumer Protection and Business Practices Act, S.N.L. 2016, c. 46**  
   – This amendment strengthens consumer protection by introducing rules governing lending practices, including requirements for transparency, disclosure of loan terms, and limitations on interest and fees.

2. **Payday Loans Regulations**  
   – These regulations establish specific rules governing the structure, terms, and conditions of payday loans, including caps on interest rates, fees, and the total cost of borrowing.

3. **Payday Loans Licensing Regulations**  
   – These regulations require that only licensed lenders can offer payday loans, ensuring that lenders meet standards of financial responsibility, consumer education, and accountability.

These measures must all be **fully enacted and in force** before the order takes effect.

### **Effective Date and Conditions**

- The order **does not come into force immediately** upon issuance.
- It becomes effective on **April 1, 2019**, which is the **first day** when all three of the above-mentioned provincial legislative instruments are in full force.
- This conditional commencement ensures that the criminal provisions of the Criminal Code are only applied in a jurisdiction where **robust consumer protection laws are already in place**, thereby preventing the criminalization of legitimate, regulated lending practices.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Consumer Protection**:  
   The designation reinforces the protection of vulnerable borrowers by ensuring that exploitative lending practices — such as those involving exorbitant interest rates or hidden fees — are subject to criminal penalties.

2. **Alignment with Federal and Provincial Policy**:  
   This order reflects a coordinated approach between federal and provincial governments to address financial exploitation and promote responsible lending.

3. **Legal Clarity**:  
   It provides legal certainty for lenders, borrowers, and law enforcement by clearly defining when and where the criminal provisions of section 347.1 apply.

4. **Prevention of Predatory Lending**:  
   By linking criminal liability to the presence of strong provincial safeguards, the regulation discourages lenders from offering loans with excessive or unfair terms.

### **Conclusion**

This Order Designating Newfoundland and Labrador is a key step in Canada’s broader effort to **combat predatory lending practices** through a combination of **federal criminal law and provincial consumer protection legislation**. It ensures that only in jurisdictions with strong, enforceable safeguards will the criminal penalties under section 347.1 of the Criminal Code be triggered — thereby protecting consumers while maintaining a balanced and fair financial system.

The effective date of April 1, 2019, marks the point at which Newfoundland and Labrador’s legislative framework was deemed sufficient to support the application of federal criminal provisions in the context of payday lending.

**Note:**  
This order is part of a national strategy to modernize and strengthen consumer financial protections, particularly in light of the growing use of high-cost, short-term lending products. It underscores the importance of **provincial legislative capacity** in enabling federal criminal enforcement to be both effective and proportionate.
