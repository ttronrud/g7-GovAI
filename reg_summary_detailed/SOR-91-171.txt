### **Detailed Summary of the Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

These regulations are established under the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Section 5.4** and **Section 5.5**, which govern the process for adopting zoning regulations at Canadian airports.

- A **proposed version** of the zoning regulations was first published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **August 19 and 26, 1989**, and later in two issues of the local newspaper *News/North* on **January 2 and 8, 1990**.
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit formal representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on this public consultation, the **Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally adopted the regulations.

> ✅ **Key Outcome**: The regulations are now legally binding and apply to the Chesterfield Inlet Airport area in the Northwest Territories.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: *R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.)*  
- These regulations define and enforce spatial constraints around the airport to ensure safe aircraft operations.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Chesterfield Inlet Airport, located near Chesterfield Inlet, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport's centerline of runway 124–304, located **457.0 meters from the threshold of runway 304**, at an elevation of **6.0 meters above sea level**. This point serves as the origin for all dimensional measurements. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. It ensures clear airspace for aircraft during landing and takeoff approaches. <br> - For **runway 124**: Slope = 1:30 (1 meter rise per 30 meters horizontal), rising to a horizontal line 2,500 meters from the end of the strip. <br> - For **runway 304**: Same slope and distance. <br> - The horizontal line is **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**, and extends **295 meters outward from the centerline**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane located **45 meters above the airport reference point** (i.e., 6.0 + 45 = 51 meters above sea level). <br> - However, if this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe construction. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, consisting of a **90-meter-wide** rectangular zone (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,340 meters in length**, associated with runway 124–304. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal), extending from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces** until it intersects the outer surface. This ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

#### **4. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances.
- The exact boundaries and lands covered are **specifically described in Part VI of the schedule** (not reproduced here but referenced in the regulation).
- The boundary of the outer limits is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

> 📍 **Geographic Coverage**: Any land within a 4 km radius (4,000 meters) of the ARP is subject to these zoning restrictions.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities**

No person may:

- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**;
- Add any **extension or modification** to an existing structure;

**on any land covered by these regulations**, if the **highest point** of such construction would exceed:

1. The **approach surface**;
2. The **outer surface**;
3. The **transitional surface**.

> ⚠️ **Purpose**: To prevent obstacles that could interfere with aircraft takeoffs, landings, or approaches — especially in low-visibility or adverse weather conditions.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Safety Rationale**

These zoning rules are designed to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear flight paths and approach corridors.
- Prevent **visual obstructions** that could compromise aircraft navigation.
- Maintain **minimum clearances** for aircraft during critical phases of flight (takeoff, landing, and approach).
- Provide a **consistent, measurable, and enforceable framework** for land use near the airport.

The design of the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and outer surface follows international aviation standards (similar to those used in ICAO and FAA guidelines), adapted to the remote and often rugged terrain of the Northwest Territories.

---

#### **7. Reference to Existing Zoning Plan**

All dimensional and spatial descriptions are based on the **Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2634**, dated **May 2, 1988**. This plan provides the foundational layout and technical specifications for the airport’s design and regulatory boundaries.

> 🔍 The regulations do not introduce new data — they **formally adopt and operationalize** the zoning plan into enforceable law.

---

#### **8. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **1:30 Approach Slope** | Provides a gradual slope to allow aircraft to see and navigate safely during approach. |
| **2,500 m Approach Distance** | Ensures sufficient distance for aircraft to establish stable approach paths. |
| **45 m Outer Surface** | Creates a buffer zone to protect aircraft from ground-level obstructions. |
| **1:7 Transitional Slope** | Smoothly connects the runway edge to the outer surface, minimizing abrupt changes in elevation. |
| **4,000 m Radius Boundary** | Defines the maximum extent of land subject to height restrictions. |

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are **enforceable by the Minister of Transport**.
- Any construction or development within the designated area must comply with these height limits.
- Violations could result in **fines, project halts, or legal action**.
- Local authorities or developers must consult with Transport Canada before initiating any construction.

---

#### **10. Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations establish strict **height limits** for all buildings and structures near Chesterfield Inlet Airport. The goal is to keep the airspace clear so that aircraft can safely take off and land, especially in challenging weather or visibility conditions.

- **No building can rise higher than**:
  - A sloped surface (1:30) extending 2.5 km from each end of the runway;
  - A flat surface 45 meters above the airport reference point (or 9 meters above ground if lower);
  - A sloped transition zone (1:7) from the runway edges to the outer surface.
- The entire area within a **4-kilometer radius** of the airport centerline is regulated.
- The rules are based on a 1988 zoning plan and were made public for public comment before being adopted.

### ✅ Conclusion

The **Chesterfield Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations** are a critical piece of aviation infrastructure policy designed to **protect flight safety** in a remote and challenging environment. By clearly defining spatial and elevation boundaries, the regulations ensure that development near the airport does not compromise aircraft operations. They represent a balanced approach between community development and aviation safety, grounded in established technical standards and transparent public consultation.

> 📌 **Bottom Line**: No structure can exceed the defined approach, transitional, or outer surfaces — these are not arbitrary limits but scientifically derived safety zones essential for safe air travel.
