**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Directive to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Regarding the Health of Canadians  
**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to subsection 19(1) of the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (S.C. 1997, c. 9)  
**Issued by:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources

### **Overview:**

This directive establishes a specific policy direction for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) in its regulatory activities related to nuclear substances. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the production, possession, and use of nuclear substances in Canada are conducted in a manner that prevents unreasonable risks to public health—particularly with regard to Canadians who rely on nuclear substances for medical purposes.

### **Key Provisions:**

1. **Regulatory Objective:**  
   The CNSC is required to consider the health of Canadians who depend on nuclear substances produced by nuclear reactors for medical applications when developing and enforcing regulations. These medical applications include diagnostic imaging (e.g., PET scans, bone scans) and cancer treatments (e.g., radiotherapy, targeted radionuclide therapy).

2. **Scope of Application:**  
   The directive applies to all aspects of nuclear substance regulation, including:
   - The production of nuclear materials in nuclear reactors
   - The handling, storage, and transportation of nuclear substances
   - The licensing and oversight of facilities involved in nuclear operations  
   The emphasis is on ensuring that these activities do not pose unreasonable risks to public health, especially for vulnerable populations who rely on such substances for life-saving or diagnostic medical care.

3. **Health-Centric Approach:**  
   The directive explicitly requires the CNSC to integrate the health of Canadians—particularly those dependent on medical nuclear technologies—into its risk assessments and regulatory decisions. This reflects a broader public health mandate that balances nuclear safety with medical necessity.

4. **Policy Justification:**  
   The regulation recognizes that nuclear reactors play a vital role in producing medical isotopes (such as technetium-99m, iodine-131, and lutetium-177), which are essential for modern healthcare. By ensuring the safe and reliable production of these isotopes, the directive supports both national health security and access to critical medical services.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The directive comes into force on the day it is officially registered in the Canada Gazette, marking the beginning of its enforceable application.

### **Significance and Implications:**

- **Balancing Safety and Medical Need:** This directive ensures that nuclear safety regulations are not applied in a way that could inadvertently disrupt or limit access to life-saving medical treatments. It promotes a health-based, rather than purely risk-averse, regulatory framework.
  
- **Strengthening Public Trust:** By acknowledging the medical benefits of nuclear technology, the directive enhances public confidence in the CNSC’s role in managing nuclear activities responsibly.

- **Support for Healthcare Infrastructure:** It supports Canada’s healthcare system by reinforcing the safe and continuous supply of medical isotopes, which are often produced in a limited number of specialized reactors (e.g., at Chalk River Laboratories or the National Research Universal reactor).

- **Alignment with National Health Goals:** The directive aligns with broader Canadian health policy objectives, including equitable access to medical care and the sustainability of healthcare services.

### **Conclusion:**

This directive is a significant policy statement that embeds the health of Canadians—especially those who depend on nuclear-based medical treatments—into the core of nuclear safety regulation. It ensures that while safety remains paramount, the regulatory framework is also responsive to the real-world medical needs of the population. By doing so, it promotes a balanced, evidence-based, and health-sensitive approach to nuclear oversight in Canada.

**Note:**  
This directive is not a standalone law but a regulatory instruction issued under the authority of the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*, and it serves as a guiding principle for the CNSC in its day-to-day operations.
