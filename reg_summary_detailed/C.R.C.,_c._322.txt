**Detailed Summary of the Development Tax and Redevelopment Tax Grant Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the *Development Tax and Redevelopment Tax Grant Regulations*. It may be cited as such and serves to establish the rules governing the payment of grants in lieu of development or redevelopment taxes on federal property within designated areas.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **Defined Area**
- A "defined area" refers to a specific geographic region within a municipality where a development tax or redevelopment tax is imposed.
- This area is typically designated for infrastructure development and is subject to tax collection to fund capital improvements.

#### **Development Tax or Redevelopment Tax**
- A **compulsory levy** imposed by a municipality on real property located within a defined area.
- It is payable by the **taxable owner** of real property due to either:
  - Ownership of the property, or
  - Specific actions taken by the owner to develop the property (e.g., construction, expansion).
- The tax is calculated based on one or more attributes of the land or buildings, such as:
  - Frontage (length of property line along a road),
  - Total area of land,
  - Size of buildings (e.g., number of rooms, living units, beds),
  - Actual or estimated construction cost.
- It is assessed at a **uniform rate** across all owners within the defined area.
- Purpose: To finance **capital costs** related to:
  - Construction or reconstruction of **trunk or arterial roads**,
  - Other capital services (e.g., utilities, drainage, public facilities) being carried out, currently being carried out, or planned within the defined area.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Taxes that are covered by grants under **Section 4 or 6 of the Municipal Grants Act**.
  - Taxes paid by way of **land transfers** or **cash in lieu of land transfers** to municipalities.

#### **Other Attribute of Land or Buildings**
- Includes measurable or estimable features such as:
  - Construction cost,
  - Number of rooms,
  - Number of living units or beds,
  - Number of persons occupying the property.
- These attributes are used to determine the tax liability of property owners.

#### **Federal Property**
- Defined as federal property under **Section 6(3) of the Municipal Grants Act**.
- Refers to land or property owned by the federal government.

### **3. Grant in Lieu of Tax (Section 4 – General Provision)**

#### **Eligibility and Application**
- Subject to **Section 4** of the Municipal Grants Act, the Minister of the federal government may provide a **grant in lieu of a development or redevelopment tax** to a municipality.
- The grant is **only available for federal property** located within a defined area.
- The municipality must submit an **application in a prescribed form** as set out by the Minister.

#### **Maximum Grant Amount**
- The grant amount **cannot exceed** the development or redevelopment tax that would have been payable **if the federal property had been treated as taxable property**.
- This ensures that the grant is not greater than the tax that would have been collected from a private owner.

---

### **4. Adjustment of Grant Amount (Section 4 – Deduction for Federal Government Services)**

The Minister has discretion to **adjust the grant amount** in a way that accounts for the extent to which the federal government has already funded certain services.

#### **Calculation Method**
- The Minister may **deduct** a portion of the total development/redevelopment tax proceeds in a given area.
- The deduction is based on the following formula:

> **Deduction = (Total proceeds of the tax in the area) × [Portion of total proceeds allocated to services funded by the federal government]**

Where:
- **Total proceeds** = Total amount of development or redevelopment tax collected in the area.
- **Portion of proceeds related to federal services** = The fraction of the total tax proceeds that corresponds to capital services **already funded or planned to be funded by the federal government**.

#### **Purpose of Deduction**
- To ensure **fairness and equity** in the grant system.
- Prevents double funding: if the federal government has already paid for a service (e.g., road construction), the municipality should not receive a grant that would effectively cover the same cost.
- Encourages municipalities to consider the **overlap** between municipal tax revenue and federal infrastructure spending.

---

### **5. Scope and Applicability**

- These regulations apply **only to development or redevelopment taxes on federal property** that would have become due and payable **on or after January 1, 1974**.
- This means the rules are retrospective only to that date and do not apply to earlier taxes on federal property.
- The regulations do not cover taxes on private property or taxes that are already reimbursed through grants under the Municipal Grants Act.

### **6. Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Support for Municipal Infrastructure** | Provides a mechanism for municipalities to fund capital projects without placing a direct financial burden on federal property owners. |
| **Fairness in Taxation** | Ensures that federal property is not taxed at the same rate as private property, which would be inequitable. |
| **Avoiding Double Funding** | Prevents duplication of federal investment in infrastructure by adjusting grants based on existing federal contributions. |
| **Promotion of Economic Development** | Encourages development in designated areas by making it more affordable for federal property owners to participate in urban growth. |

### **7. Summary of Key Provisions (Bullet Points)**

- The regulations govern grants in lieu of development or redevelopment taxes on **federal property**.
- A **grant is payable** only if a municipality applies in the prescribed form.
- The **maximum grant** is capped at the tax that would have been due if the federal property were taxable.
- The **grant amount is reduced** by a fraction based on the portion of tax proceeds that correspond to services already funded by the federal government.
- The regulations **only apply to taxes due on or after January 1, 1974**.
- Excludes taxes that are covered by other grants or paid via land transfers.

### **Conclusion**

These regulations represent a **targeted fiscal mechanism** to support municipal infrastructure development while protecting federal property owners from undue tax burdens. By providing **grants in lieu of taxes** and adjusting them based on existing federal service contributions, the regulations promote **equity, efficiency, and fiscal responsibility** in the financing of urban development. They are a critical component of intergovernmental cooperation between federal and municipal authorities in Canada, particularly in areas where infrastructure investment is essential for economic growth.
