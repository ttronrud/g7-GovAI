**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Prescribing Alternative Means of Publication (Foreign Companies)"**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is grounded in specific provisions of the **Insurance Companies Act**:
  - **Section 1015a** – Provides the authority for the Governor General in Council to make regulations related to the publication of information by insurance companies.
  - **Paragraph 1021(a)a** – Authorizes the regulation of alternative methods of publishing certain required information, particularly for foreign insurance companies.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **modernize and improve access to regulatory information** by providing foreign insurance companies with a more efficient and accessible method of fulfilling their public disclosure obligations.

**Key Provision:**

- Under **section 585 of the Insurance Companies Act**, foreign insurance companies are required to **publish certain information quarterly in the Canada Gazette**, a traditional government publication.

- However, this regulation **allows foreign companies to meet this requirement by publishing the information on the official website of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)** instead of in the Canada Gazette.

**What Is Covered:**

- The information required to be published includes:
  - Financial and operational data relevant to the company’s activities in Canada.
  - Information about the company’s capitalization, financial condition, and other regulatory disclosures necessary for transparency and investor confidence.

- The content must be **accurate, timely, and consistent** with the requirements of section 585 of the Insurance Companies Act.

**Alternative Publication Method:**

- **Primary Alternative**: The required quarterly disclosures may now be published on the **OSFI’s official website**.
- This replaces the traditional method of publishing in the *Canada Gazette*, which can be costly, time-consuming, and less accessible to stakeholders.

**Benefits of the Change:**

1. **Improved Accessibility**: Stakeholders (e.g., investors, regulators, the public) can access information more easily and promptly through a digital platform.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Foreign companies avoid the administrative and printing costs associated with Canada Gazette publication.
3. **Timeliness**: Web-based publication allows for faster dissemination of information.
4. **Modernization**: Reflects current trends in regulatory transparency and digital governance.

**Effective Date:**

- The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the *Statutes of Canada* (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465; S.C. 1991, c. 47).

**Important Notes:**

- The regulation **does not replace** the requirement to provide information to the public — it only changes the **medium** of publication.
- The content published on the OSFI website must still comply with all legal and regulatory standards set out in the Insurance Companies Act.
- The OSFI retains responsibility for ensuring the accuracy, availability, and integrity of the information published on its platform.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant step toward modernizing regulatory disclosure practices for foreign insurance companies operating in Canada. By allowing quarterly information to be published on the OSFI website instead of in the Canada Gazette, it enhances transparency, improves access for stakeholders, and reduces administrative burdens on foreign insurers, all while maintaining regulatory oversight and public accountability.
