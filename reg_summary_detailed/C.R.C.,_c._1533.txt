**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: *Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Dubawnt Lake N.W.T.) from Disposal Order***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled:  
**"Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Dubawnt Lake N.W.T.) from Disposal Order"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a legal instrument under the *Territorial Lands Act* of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to **set aside and permanently withdraw specific lands in the Northwest Territories** from being available for disposal (i.e., sale, lease, or transfer) for the purpose of establishing a **game sanctuary**. This designation is intended to protect wildlife habitats, particularly those supporting native game species, and to ensure conservation of natural ecosystems in the region.

---

### **3. Legal Basis**
The Order is issued under the authority of the **Territorial Lands Act**, which grants the government the power to withdraw lands from disposal for specific public purposes. This action does not alter ownership or title but restricts the use of the land for commercial or private development.

---

### **4. Lands Withdrawn from Disposal**
The lands described in the Schedule (which is not included in this text but referenced) are **fully withdrawn from disposal** under the Territorial Lands Act. This includes:

- All surface lands within the described boundaries.
- **All minerals underlying the land**, whether:
  - Precious (e.g., gold, diamonds)
  - Base (e.g., copper, nickel)
  - Solid, liquid, or gaseous (e.g., oil, natural gas)

This means that **mineral rights are not subject to sale, lease, or exploitation** by private parties or companies under this order.

---

### **5. Protection of Existing Rights**
Crucially, the Order **does not extinguish or affect** the rights of individuals or entities who already hold valid mineral interests. Specifically:

- **Recorded mineral claims** in good standing under the *Canada Mining Regulations* remain protected.
- **Permits or leases** in good standing under the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* remain valid and enforceable.

This ensures that existing stakeholders in mineral development are not unfairly impacted by the withdrawal of the land for conservation purposes.

### **6. Geographic Description of the Area**
The area is precisely defined by a detailed boundary description, using cardinal directions, stream banks, lakes, rivers, and approximate coordinates. The description is based on the **National Topographic Series (NTS) maps** available as of **January 17, 1956**, at a scale of **8 miles to 1 inch**.
