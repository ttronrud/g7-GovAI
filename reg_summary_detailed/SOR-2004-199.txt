**Detailed Summary of the Bank Holding Company Proposal Regulations (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183; S.C. 1991, c. 46)**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under **section 678a of the Bank Act**, establish a comprehensive framework governing the process by which a **widely held bank** in Canada may establish a **bank holding company (BHC)** and transition its operations through a structured, transparent, and shareholder-approved process. The regulations ensure that such proposals are thoroughly reviewed, publicly disclosed, and subject to both internal shareholder approval and external ministerial oversight to protect financial stability, shareholder interests, and regulatory compliance.

The regulations are designed to implement **section 678 of the Bank Act**, which permits a widely held bank to create a holding company structure — a common practice in the banking sector to improve governance, diversify operations, and manage risk — but only under strict procedural and financial safeguards.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanations**

---

### **1. Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary legislation governing banking institutions in Canada.
- **Bank**: A "widely held" bank (as defined in section 2.3 of the Bank Act) that makes an application under subsection 678(1) of the Act.
- **Proposal**: A formal plan submitted by the bank to establish a bank holding company, including transactions involving the creation of the holding company and the exchange of shares.

> *Note: The term "widely held" implies that the bank has a large number of shareholders, typically more than 100, which triggers specific regulatory requirements.*

---

### **2. Content Requirements of a Proposal**

A valid proposal must include the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a)** Description of transactions to establish the BHC | Must detail all transactions (e.g., capital contributions, share issuance) that would require approval under **section 973 of the Bank Act** (which governs certain corporate actions requiring regulatory approval). |
| **(b)** Description of share exchange | Must describe how shares of the bank will be exchanged for shares in the new bank holding company. |
| **(c)** Description of other transactions or actions | Any additional transactions or actions (e.g., divestitures, restructurings) that require regulatory approval under section 973. |
| **(d)** Proposed timing | Clear timeline for when each transaction or action will occur. |
| **(e)** Voting procedures for amendments | A description of how shareholders will be informed and how they will vote on any future amendments to the proposal. |

> These requirements ensure transparency and allow shareholders to make informed decisions.

---

### **3. Disclosure to Shareholders**

- The bank must **send the full proposal and an independent advisor’s report** to all shareholders.
- The disclosure must be **sufficiently detailed** so that shareholders can form a **reasoned judgment** about the proposal.
- This includes financial details, risks, benefits, and strategic rationale.

> *Purpose*: To ensure fair and informed participation by all shareholders, especially minority ones.

---

### **4. Shareholder Approval Process**

- A **special meeting** of shareholders must be held to obtain approval of the proposal.
- Each share entitles the shareholder to **one vote**, regardless of whether the share has voting rights under normal circumstances.

> *Note*: This ensures equal representation and prevents disproportionate influence from certain classes of shares.

---

### **5. Separate Voting Rights (Class and Series)**

Shareholders of a class or series may vote separately if the proposal affects them in a particular way. Separate voting rights apply when:

#### **(a) Changes to authorized shares or rights:**
- Increase or decrease the maximum number of authorized shares of a class.
- Increase authorized shares of a class with rights equal or superior to the class in question.
- Effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or part of the shares.

#### **(b) Changes to rights, privileges, or conditions:**
- Remove or change prejudicial rights (e.g., to dividends, redemption rights, conversion privileges, pre-emptive rights).
- Reduce or eliminate dividend preferences or liquidation preferences.
- Add or remove conversion options, voting rights, transfer rights, or rights to acquire securities.
- Create or modify sinking fund provisions.

#### **(c) Creation of superior or inferior classes:**
- Create a new class of shares equal or superior to the existing class.
- Make a class inferior to another class equal or superior to it.

#### **(d) Asset sales:**
- If the bank sells all or substantially all of its assets, shareholders of a particular class or series may vote separately **if the sale affects them differently** from other classes or series.

> *Exception*: If the bank’s by-laws prohibit separate voting on amendments to specific provisions (e.g., in section 218(1)(a), (b), or (e) of the Bank Act), and the proposal only relates to those exact provisions, then separate voting rights do **not** apply.

> *Definition of "corresponding provision"*: A direct match between a provision in the regulations and the corresponding provision in the Bank Act.

---

### **6. Approval Threshold**

- A proposal is approved when:
  - The **shareholders** approve it by **special resolution** (i.e., a majority of votes cast by shareholders present or represented by proxy, and a required threshold of votes — typically a 75% majority for major changes).
  - **Each class or series** of shares entitled to separate voting also approves the proposal.

> *This ensures that all affected shareholders have given their consent.*

---

### **7. Application to the Minister**

An application to the Minister to give effect to the proposal must include:

| Component | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| Copy of the proposal | As defined in section 2 |
| Board resolution | Instructing management to prepare the proposal |
| Notice of special meeting | Including form of proxy and management proxy circular |
| Independent advisor’s report | Must state that the **consideration (or lack thereof)** offered in the proposal is **fair from a financial point of view** |
| Pro forma financial statements and capital adequacy calculations | For the bank holding company and all its Canadian financial institution subsidiaries (as defined in section 2 of the Bank Act) |
| Business plan | For the bank holding company and its subsidiaries |

> *Purpose*: To ensure that the financial and strategic aspects of the proposal are sound, transparent, and properly evaluated.

### **8. Justification for Regulatory-Required Actions**

The application must include:

- An explanation of **why** certain transactions or actions (that require approval under section 973 of the Bank Act) are **necessary or desirable** to implement the proposal.

> *Example*: If a bank is transferring assets to a holding company, the application must explain why this is essential for operational efficiency, risk management, or compliance.

---

### **9. Justification for Proceeding Despite Prohibitive Provisions**

The application must include:

- A **list of any provisions in the Bank Act** (e.g., restrictions on share transfers, dividend payments, or capital structure) that the bank intends to **go against**.
- For provisions listed in **paragraph 14(b)** (e.g., restrictions on dividends or share exchanges), the bank must provide a **detailed explanation** of why it seeks to proceed despite these restrictions.

> *Purpose*: To ensure that the bank justifies any deviation from statutory rules, especially where such deviations could pose risks to financial stability or shareholder value.

---

### **10. Minister’s Review Authority**

- The Minister may **request additional information** to assess the application.
- The Minister has discretion to **require clarification, data, or documentation** to determine whether the proposal is in the public interest.

> *This ensures regulatory oversight and protects against speculative or risky proposals.*
