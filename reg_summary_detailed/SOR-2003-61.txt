**Detailed Summary of the Information Technology Activities (Banks) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **sections 474a and 978b of the Bank Act**. This means the regulations are a formal administrative implementation of provisions in the Bank Act, which governs the activities, operations, and risk management of banks in Canada.

- **Statutory Basis**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 127* and *s. 183* (providing authority for regulation of IT activities)  
  - *S.C. 1991, c. 46* (the original Bank Act, which includes relevant provisions on banking activities and control)

These regulations specifically address **information technology (IT) activities** conducted by banks and their affiliated entities, focusing on **risk management, diversification, and compliance with the Bank Act**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations establish key definitions to ensure clarity and consistency:

- **"Act"** means the *Bank Act* (Loi sur la Banque).  
- **"Balance sheet value"** refers to the value of shares or ownership interests reported on an **unconsolidated basis** in a bank’s balance sheet. This is the value as reflected in the entity’s financial statements, not consolidated with subsidiaries.  
  *(Note: The term "book value" was previously used but has been repealed by SOR/2008-168, s. 5.)*  
- **"Member of a bank’s group"** has the same meaning as defined in **subsection 464(2)** of the Bank Act — referring to entities that are part of the bank’s corporate group (e.g., subsidiaries, affiliates).

---

### **3. Permitted IT Activities by Banks and Their Groups**

A bank (or a member of its group) may engage in the following **IT-related activities**, provided they are **materially related** to the provision of financial products or services:

- Developing, designing, holding, managing, manufacturing, selling, or otherwise dealing with:
  - Data transmission systems  
  - Information sites (e.g., websites)  
  - Communication devices  
  - Information platforms or portals  

> **Key Condition**: These activities must serve a purpose or occur in a circumstance that is **materially related** to the bank’s or its group members’ financial services (e.g., online banking, payment processing, customer service portals).

> **Approval Requirement**: Such activities must be approved under **paragraph 410(1)(c.1)** of the Bank Act, which governs certain types of new or expanded activities involving technology.

---

### **4. Restrictions on Acquiring Control or Substantial Investments**

A bank **may not acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in**, an entity that engages in the IT activities described above **if the total of the following exceeds 5% of the bank’s regulatory capital**:

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests the bank and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity under **paragraph 468(2)(f)** of the Bank Act.  
2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests held by the bank and its subsidiaries in **other entities** that are engaged in such IT activities and that the bank controls or holds a substantial investment in.  
3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the bank and its subsidiaries to such entities (whether controlled or not).

> This 5% threshold is a **risk-based limit** designed to prevent banks from overexposing themselves to concentrated risks in IT-related ventures.

> The calculation is **unconsolidated**, meaning it does not combine the financials of subsidiaries into a single entity’s balance sheet.

---

### **5. Prohibited Activities of Entities in Which a Bank May Invest**

A bank **may not** acquire control of or increase a substantial investment in an entity that engages in any of the following activities:

- **Accepting deposit liabilities** (e.g., acting as a depository or accepting customer deposits).  
- **Dealing in securities**, except where permitted under:
  - Paragraph **468(2)(e)** of the Bank Act (limited securities dealing), or  
  - Paragraph **409(2)(c)** of the Bank Act (specific exceptions for certain securities activities).  
- **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** that a bank is not permitted to deal in under **subsection 410(2)** of the Bank Act — **except** where permitted under subsection (1).  
- **Engaging in activities prohibited under section 416 of the Bank Act**, **if** the entity is a:
  - Finance entity, or  
  - Any other entity prescribed under **paragraph 468(3)(c)** of the Bank Act.  
- **Acquiring control of or holding a substantial investment in another entity** unless:
  - In the case of an entity **controlled by the bank**, the bank itself would be permitted under **Part IX of the Bank Act** to acquire a substantial investment in that entity; or  
  - In the case of an entity **not controlled by the bank**, the bank would be permitted under one of the following:
    - Subsection **466(2)**  
    - Paragraphs **466(3)(b)** or **(c)**  
    - Subsection **466(4)**  
    - Subsection **468(1)** or **(2)** of the Bank Act  
  - Or if the activity falls under a **prescribed activity under paragraph 468(3)(e)** of the Bank Act.

> This ensures that IT investments do not lead to exposure in areas where banks are otherwise restricted.

### **6. Exemption from Certain Provisions**

- **Subsections 468(4) to (6)** of the Bank Act (which normally restrict certain types of investments) **do not apply** when determining whether a bank would be permitted to acquire a substantial investment in an entity under subsections 466(2), 466(3), or 468(1) or (2).  
  → This allows for more flexibility in evaluating investment approvals in the context of IT activities.

- **Subsection 468(5)** of the Bank Act (which may impose additional restrictions on certain investments) **does not apply** when a bank acquires control of or increases a substantial investment in an entity whose business is **limited to the activities described in subsection 3(1)** of the regulations (i.e., only IT-related activities related to financial services).  
  → This provides a **safe harbor** for banks investing in pure IT platforms that do not involve traditional banking or prohibited activities.

> Importantly, **this exemption does not limit** the operation of **subsections 3(2) and (3)** — meaning other restrictions (e.g., capital adequacy, risk management) still apply.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures immediate applicability upon official publication.

### **Summary of Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | To allow banks to innovate in IT and digital services while managing systemic and financial risks. |
| **Permissibility** | IT activities related to financial services are allowed, provided they are materially connected to banking operations. |
| **Risk Limitation** | A 5% cap on total exposure (in terms of balance sheet value and loans) to such IT entities ensures capital adequacy and risk diversification. |
| **Prohibitions** | Banks cannot invest in entities that offer deposits, securities, or other restricted activities. |
| **Investment Approval** | Any investment in such entities requires a formal determination under the Bank Act’s investment rules. |
| **Exemptions** | Pure IT platforms (without traditional banking functions) are exempt from certain investment restrictions. |

### **Implications for Banks and Regulators**

- **For Banks**:  
  - Can develop digital platforms (e.g., mobile apps, online banking, customer portals) without violating core banking restrictions.  
  - Must carefully assess the balance sheet exposure and loan risk when investing in or partnering with IT firms.  
  - Must ensure all such activities are approved under the Bank Act’s activity approval framework.

- **For Regulators (e.g., Bank of Canada)**:  
  - These regulations provide a clear framework for monitoring digital innovation in the banking sector.  
  - Enable risk-based oversight of IT investments, ensuring that banks do not overextend into prohibited or high-risk areas.

### **Conclusion**

The *Information Technology Activities (Banks) Regulations* strike a balance between **encouraging technological innovation** and **protecting financial stability**. By allowing banks to engage in IT-related services that support financial products and services, while imposing strict limits on exposure and prohibiting investments in high-risk or non-compliant activities, the regulations promote **responsible digital transformation** within the Canadian banking sector.

These rules are a critical tool in adapting the regulatory framework to the evolving digital landscape of financial services.
