### **Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a formal transfer of administrative control and supervision within the federal public service. Specifically, it reorganizes the governance structure of a key federal office responsible for infrastructure policy and oversight.

#### **(a) Transfer of Control and Supervision**

Pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, the control and supervision of the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada** are transferred from the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** to the **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs**.

- The *President of the Queen’s Privy Council* historically serves as the head of the federal executive branch and oversees the administrative structure of the federal government, including the appointment and oversight of certain offices.
- This transfer signifies a shift in operational and policy authority for the Office of Infrastructure of Canada from a high-level ceremonial and constitutional office to a specific ministerial portfolio.
- The transfer is not merely symbolic—it involves the delegation of day-to-day management, policy direction, and accountability for the office’s functions.

#### **(b) Appointment of Minister as Presiding Officer**

The regulation further orders that the **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** shall **preside over the Office of Infrastructure of Canada**.

- This means the Minister is now the principal authority responsible for:
  - Setting strategic priorities
  - Overseeing operations and performance
  - Approving budgets and resource allocations
  - Ensuring alignment with federal infrastructure policy goals
- The Minister is also accountable to Parliament for the performance and effectiveness of the Office.

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**: This section of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* provides the legal authority for transferring control of specific offices or functions within the federal public service. It allows for reorganization to improve efficiency, accountability, and policy coherence.
- **R.S., c. P-34**: This refers to the *Public Service Act*, which establishes the framework for the structure, duties, and accountability of federal public service institutions, including the role of the President of the Privy Council and the ministerial oversight of offices.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary objectives of this regulation are:

1. **Improved Accountability**: By placing the Office of Infrastructure of Canada under a ministerial portfolio, decision-making becomes more directly accountable to the government and Parliament.
2. **Policy Integration**: The Office is now aligned with the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, ensuring that infrastructure planning and investment are coordinated with broader national goals in transportation, community development, and intergovernmental relations.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: The transfer streamlines governance by removing the Office from a broad, constitutional-level oversight structure and placing it within a dedicated, policy-focused ministry.
4. **Enhanced Coordination**: The Minister can now coordinate infrastructure initiatives more effectively across departments and with provincial and territorial governments.

### **Implications**

- The Office of Infrastructure of Canada (OIC) becomes a key policy and strategic unit within the Ministry of Infrastructure.
- It is likely responsible for:
  - Strategic planning of federal infrastructure projects
  - Policy development and coordination
  - Oversight of federal infrastructure funding and programs
  - Interdepartmental and intergovernmental collaboration
- The Minister now has direct authority over staffing, performance monitoring, and strategic direction.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. It formally transfers the governance of the Office of Infrastructure of Canada from the President of the Queen’s Privy Council to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, with the Minister now presiding over the office. This move enhances ministerial accountability, aligns infrastructure policy with government priorities, and supports more effective federal planning and delivery of infrastructure services.
