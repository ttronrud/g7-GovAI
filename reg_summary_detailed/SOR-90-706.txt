**Detailed Summary of the Canada Development Investment Corporation Registered Office Relocation Order**

---

### **1. Background and Context**

This regulatory instrument is a **Governor in Council Order** issued under the *Financial Administration Act (FAA)*, specifically **subsection 91(4)**, which governs the authorization process for parent Crown corporations to apply for amendments to their corporate articles.

The **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)** is a **parent Crown corporation** established under the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)*. As such, it is subject to the regulatory framework outlined in **Part X of the Financial Administration Act**, which imposes specific requirements on Crown corporations regarding changes to their corporate structure, including amendments to their articles.

---

### **2. Legal Basis for the Order**

The Order is grounded in two key provisions of the *Financial Administration Act*:

- **Subsection 91(4)**: This provision requires that any application for articles of amendment by a **parent Crown corporation** must be authorized by an **order of the Governor in Council**. This ensures that significant corporate changes involving Crown entities are subject to appropriate governmental oversight and approval.

- **Subsection 91(6)**: This provision allows the Governor in Council to determine that a Crown corporation is **otherwise empowered** to apply for articles of amendment under section 173 of the *Canada Business Corporations Act*, provided that the proposed change does not materially alter the corporation’s objectives, purposes, or operational restrictions.

---

### **3. Nature of the Proposed Change**

The proposed amendment involves a **relocation of CDIC’s registered office**:

- **Current Registered Office**: Vancouver, British Columbia  
- **Proposed Registered Office**: Toronto, Ontario  

This change is **not** intended to:
- Expand or alter the corporation’s **objects or purposes** as defined in its original articles.
- Modify any **restrictions on business activities** or the types of operations CDIC may conduct.
- Introduce new or expanded financial, operational, or strategic mandates.

Thus, the change is **limited to administrative and legal formalities**—specifically, the physical location of the corporation’s official registered address.

---

### **4. Justification and Approval**

The Governor in Council has determined, pursuant to **subsection 91(6)**, that CDIC is **already empowered** to pursue this amendment under section 173 of the *Canada Business Corporations Act*. This means that the corporation has the legal authority to apply for the amendment without requiring further legislative action, as long as the change does not constitute a material alteration of its corporate structure or purpose.

The decision was made on the **recommendation of the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs)**, reflecting the department’s oversight responsibility for Crown corporation matters related to privatization and regulation.

### **5. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Authorize CDIC to formally apply** for articles of amendment to its corporate articles to relocate its registered office from Vancouver to Toronto.
- Provide **legal certainty and procedural clarity** for CDIC in carrying out this administrative change.
- Facilitate **operational efficiency**, potentially enabling better access to regional markets, government services, or stakeholder engagement in Ontario, where CDIC has significant operations or partnerships.

---

### **6. Scope and Effectiveness**

- The Order is **specific and narrowly tailored** to the relocation of the registered office.
- It does **not** affect CDIC’s governance, financial structure, investment mandate, or operational activities.
- The Order is **self-contained** and does not require further legislative or ministerial action beyond the application process initiated by CDIC.
- It may be cited as:  
  **"The Canada Development Investment Corporation Registered Office Relocation Order"**

### **7. Conclusion**

This Order represents a **routine administrative change** within a Crown corporation’s corporate structure. It reflects the principle that while Crown corporations are subject to strict oversight, minor, non-material changes—such as relocating a registered office—can be authorized through established procedural mechanisms under the *Financial Administration Act*. The decision underscores the balance between operational flexibility and fiscal accountability in the governance of public institutions.

---

**Key Takeaways:**
- The change is **non-material** and does not alter CDIC’s purpose or business restrictions.
- Authorization is granted under **section 91(4)** of the *Financial Administration Act*.
- The Governor in Council has confirmed CDIC’s **legal capacity** to proceed under section 173 of the *Canada Business Corporations Act*.

This Order ensures compliance with statutory requirements while enabling CDIC to operate more effectively in a key economic and administrative hub.
