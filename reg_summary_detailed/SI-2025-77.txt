**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities (Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada)**

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is made under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign certain powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers in the Public Service.

**Subject Matter:**  
This regulation specifically transfers from the **Minister of Industry** to the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** the powers, duties, and functions related to the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA)**.

**Key Details of the Transfer:**

1. **Agency Involved:**  
   The Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA) is a federal agency established to support economic development in the Pacific region of Canada—specifically the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon—by promoting investment, job creation, and regional growth.

2. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer is not a reorganization of the agency itself, but rather a change in ministerial oversight. The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities assumes responsibility for all functions, policy direction, funding decisions, and administrative oversight of PEDA that were previously managed under the purview of the Minister of Industry.

3. **Scope of Transferred Powers and Duties:**  
   This includes all responsibilities associated with:
   - Strategic planning and policy development for PEDA;
   - Budgetary allocation and financial management;
   - Oversight of PEDA’s programs and projects;
   - Coordination with provincial and territorial governments;
   - Reporting to Parliament and the Cabinet;
   - Implementation of federal economic development initiatives in the Pacific region.

4. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is grounded in the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reallocation of ministerial responsibilities to better align with current government priorities, structural changes, or regional development needs. The specific provision (paragraph 2(a)(a)) enables the transfer of duties without requiring new legislation, provided it is recommended by the Prime Minister and approved by the Governor General in Council.

5. **Effective Date and Implementation:**  
   While the regulation itself does not specify an effective date, such transfers are typically effective upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and formal notification to relevant departments and stakeholders. In practice, the transfer would take effect immediately upon the publication of the regulation in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (or similar official publication).

6. **Rationale and Policy Context:**  
   This reallocation reflects a broader government strategy to strengthen regional economic development by placing PEDA under a minister with broader responsibilities for infrastructure and community development. The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is better positioned to integrate PEDA’s work with infrastructure investment, housing, and community development initiatives—particularly in rural and remote areas of the Pacific region.

7. **Impact on PEDA Operations:**  
   The agency’s day-to-day operations remain unchanged, but its strategic direction and funding priorities may now align more closely with infrastructure and community development goals. This may lead to greater coordination between economic development, transportation, and housing policies.

8. **Reference to Statutes:**  
   - The regulation is cited as **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** — the relevant section of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.  
   - It is also referenced in **R.S., c. P-34**, which is the *Regulations under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, indicating that the transfer is formalized through statutory regulation.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative realignment within the Canadian federal government. It shifts the ministerial responsibility for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. The change enhances interdepartmental coordination and aligns PEDA’s mandate with broader infrastructure and community development priorities. It is a legally sound and operationally effective transfer, grounded in existing legislative authority and designed to improve regional economic outcomes in Canada’s Pacific region.
