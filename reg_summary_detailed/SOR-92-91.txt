**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Sheep and Wool Order**

---

**1. Purpose and Legal Basis**  
The *Quebec Sheep and Wool Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. This Order grants specific authority to the **Office des producteurs d’agneaux et de moutons du Québec (Board)** to regulate the marketing of **sheep and wool** produced in the Province of Quebec in both **interprovincial and export trade**.

This Order is intended to ensure fair, orderly, and sustainable marketing practices for sheep and wool, protect producers' interests, and promote stable market conditions across Quebec’s agricultural sector.

**2. Official Citation**  
The Order may be cited as the **Quebec Sheep and Wool Order**.

---

**3. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Board**: Refers to the *Office des producteurs d’agneaux et de moutons du Québec*, a provincial organization representing sheep and wool producers in Quebec.  
- **Sheep**: Means sheep that are **produced in the Province of Quebec** (i.e., born and raised within Quebec’s borders).  
- **Wool**: Defined as **unwashed wool shorn from a sheep**. This excludes washed or processed wool, focusing on the raw, natural product at the point of shearing.

These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in the application of the Order.

---

**4. Authority to Regulate Marketing**  
The Board is granted broad regulatory powers to oversee the **marketing of sheep and wool** in two key markets:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between Quebec and other Canadian provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales of sheep and wool outside of Canada)

With respect to persons and property located within Quebec, the Board may exercise **all or any powers** that are currently available to it under the **An Act respecting the marketing of agriculture, food and fish products and amending various legislation (S.Q. 1990, c. 13)** — specifically those related to the **local marketing of sheep and wool within Quebec**.

This enables the Board to apply familiar regulatory tools (such as pricing mechanisms, quality standards, and market access rules) to the interprovincial and export markets, ensuring consistency and fairness.

---

**5. Powers to Impose Levies and Charges**  
Under Section 3 of the Order, the Board may:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on individuals or entities involved in the **production or marketing** of sheep and wool.
- These levies or charges may be applied **differently depending on the group** of producers or marketers, based on the Board’s classification of members.

The Board may **classify persons** into distinct groups (e.g., small-scale farmers, large producers, exporters, etc.) and determine **different levies or charges** for each group. This allows for equitable and differentiated financial treatment based on production scale, market role, or other relevant factors.

---

**6. Collection of Levies and Charges**  
The Board has the authority to **collect** the levies or charges directly from those persons engaged in sheep or wool production or marketing. This ensures a reliable and consistent source of revenue to support the Board’s operations and functions.

---

**7. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected from levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial buffers during market downturns)
- **Payment of operational expenses** (such as administrative costs, market research, and marketing campaigns)
- **Reimbursement of losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of sheep or wool (e.g., unsold inventory, price drops)
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers  
  → This is a key mechanism to ensure that producers who face poor market conditions (e.g., low prices) are not unfairly burdened, while those who benefit from favorable sales can share in the surplus.

The Board may determine the **time period** over which these equalizations or adjustments will occur — for example, annually or after a market downturn — to maintain financial stability and fairness among members.

---

**8. Overall Objectives and Implications**  
This Order supports the following goals:

- **Market stability**: By regulating pricing and ensuring fair access to markets.
- **Producer protection**: By creating financial safeguards against price volatility and market shocks.
- **Economic sustainability**: By enabling the Board to manage risks and support long-term viability of sheep and wool production in Quebec.
- **Fair distribution of benefits**: By using collected funds to equalize income among producers, especially during periods of market stress.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Quebec Sheep and Wool Order* establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework that empowers the Office des producteurs d’agneaux et de moutons du Québec to manage the interprovincial and export marketing of sheep and wool from Quebec. It enables the Board to impose fair and differentiated charges, collect revenue, and use those funds to stabilize markets, support producers, and ensure equitable outcomes. This regulatory tool is essential for protecting the interests of Quebec’s sheep and wool producers in a dynamic and competitive market environment.
