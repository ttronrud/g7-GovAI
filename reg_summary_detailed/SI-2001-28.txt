**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity Remission Order (Part IX of the Excise Tax Act)**  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance), provides for a **tax remission** to the **Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)** and its **Executive Secretary** under the **Excise Tax Act**, specifically Part IX. The remission is granted to address the tax liability of these entities during a defined period, taking into account their international status and the exemptions they are entitled to under international agreements.

The purpose of the regulation is to recognize the **public interest** in supporting international environmental organizations — particularly one established under a major global treaty — by allowing them to avoid or reduce excise tax obligations that would otherwise apply, based on their diplomatic or international functional status.

### **Key Legal Basis**

- **Authority**: The regulation is made under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council to grant remissions of taxes when it is in the public interest.
- **Recommendation**: Made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, indicating a fiscal and policy-level assessment of the public benefit.

### **Core Provision: Tax Remission**

#### **1. Remission for the Secretariat**

> A remission is granted to the **Secretariat** of the CBD in the amount by which:
>  
> - The **actual tax** that became payable by the Secretariat during the period **from February 1, 1996, to November 19, 1997**,  
>  
> **exceeds**  
>  
> - The tax that would have become payable **if the exemptions under Article II of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations (UNPI)** had applied to the Secretariat during that period.

**Key Points**:
- The remission is **not a blanket exemption**, but a **difference-based relief**.
- The calculation is based on a **hypothetical scenario**: what the tax would have been **if the Secretariat were treated as a UN entity** under the UNPI Convention.
- This reflects the principle that the Secretariat, as an international body established under a global environmental treaty, should be granted certain **diplomatic immunities and tax exemptions** similar to those enjoyed by UN agencies.

#### **2. Remission for the Executive Secretary**

> A remission is granted to the **Executive Secretary** in the amount by which:
>  
> - The **actual tax** that became payable by the Executive Secretary during the period **from May 6, 1996, to November 19, 1997**,  
>  
> **exceeds**  
>  
> - The tax that would have become payable **if all exemptions granted in Canada under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to diplomatic agents had applied to the Executive Secretary** during that period.

**Key Points**:
- The Executive Secretary is treated as a **diplomatic agent** in this context.
- The remission is calculated based on the **difference between actual tax liability and the tax that would have been avoided** had the Executive Secretary been fully protected under the **Vienna Convention**.
- This recognizes the individual’s role as a representative of an international organization and aligns with international norms for diplomatic personnel.

### **Exclusions from Remission Calculation**

> **No remission will be granted** for any tax amount that:
> - The Secretariat or the Executive Secretary was **already exempt from paying**, or
> - Was **entitled to recover** through **refund, rebate, or remission** under existing laws or agreements.

**Purpose**: Ensures that the remission only applies to **new or incremental tax liabilities** that arise due to the lack of applicable exemptions — not to pre-existing or recoverable amounts.

---

### **Conditions for Payment**

Payment of any remitted amount is **conditional** on:

1. The Secretariat or the Executive Secretary (as applicable) **submitting a written application** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
2. The application must be submitted **before the first day of the third calendar month** following the calendar month in which this Order is made.

**Example**:  
If the Order is made in **December 1997**, the application must be submitted **before March 1, 1998**.

**Implications**:
- This creates a **time-bound procedural requirement**, ensuring timely and accountable administration.
- It gives the Minister of National Revenue the opportunity to assess the application and process the remission appropriately.
- It prevents indefinite or uncontrolled tax relief and ensures compliance with fiscal governance standards.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council explicitly states that the remission is in the **public interest**. This is grounded in:

- The **global significance** of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which aims to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.
- The **role of international organizations** in addressing global environmental challenges.
- The **principle of reciprocity and international cooperation**, where countries recognize the importance of enabling such bodies to operate without undue financial burden.
- The **need to support multilateral environmental governance** through fiscal accommodation.

---

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

1. **International Law Integration**:  
   The regulation reflects Canada’s commitment to international environmental law by applying exemptions from the **UN Privileges and Immunities Convention** and the **Vienna Convention** to a key environmental body.

2. **Fiscal Prudence**:  
   The remission is not automatic or unlimited — it is **calculated precisely** based on the difference between actual and hypothetical tax liabilities, ensuring fiscal responsibility.

3. **Administrative Clarity**:  
   Clear definitions, defined periods, and strict procedural requirements provide transparency and predictability for both the Secretariat and the Minister of National Revenue.

4. **Precedent Setting**:  
   This Order may serve as a precedent for future tax remissions granted to other international organizations or diplomatic representatives operating in Canada.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, legally sound, and publicly justified measure that:

- Grants **tax relief** to the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Executive Secretary,
- Does so **based on international legal frameworks** (UNPI and Vienna Convention),
- Is **calculated precisely** to reflect actual tax exposure versus hypothetical exemption,
- Includes **clear procedural safeguards** to ensure accountability and compliance,
- And is rooted in the **public interest** of supporting global environmental cooperation.

It represents a balanced approach to fiscal policy and international obligations — recognizing the importance of environmental governance while maintaining fiscal integrity and legal accountability.

**Final Note**: This Order remains in force as of its issuance in 1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)) and applies to the specified time period (1996–1997), making it a historical but still relevant instrument in Canada’s international environmental policy framework.
