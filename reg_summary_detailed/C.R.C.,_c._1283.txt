**Detailed Summary of the *Materials for the Use of the Blind Regulations***  

---

### **Regulation Title**  
These Regulations may be cited as the **Materials for the Use of the Blind Regulations**.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to **ensure the free and accessible postal delivery of materials specifically designed for blind or visually impaired individuals** in Canada. The regulations establish conditions under which such materials may be sent **free of postage**, define the **format and labeling requirements**, and outline **procedures for handling, protection, and delivery** of these materials.

> Note: These regulations were previously revoked by *SOR/83-800, section 2*, indicating they are no longer in force as of that date. However, the content provided appears to be a historical or archived version, possibly reflecting prior policy or a transitional framework. As such, this summary is based on the text provided and should be interpreted in context of its historical status.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Material for the Use of the Blind**  
   This term encompasses the following types of materials:
   - Matter impressed in **Braille or similar raised type** (e.g., tactile books, instructional guides).
   - **Plates** used for manufacturing such Braille or raised-text materials.
   - **Tapes, records, and other sound recordings** that are:
     - Posted (mailed) by blind individuals in Canada, or  
     - Mailed by or addressed to a **recognized institution for the blind**.
   - **Tapes, records, sound recordings, and special paper** intended solely for the use of the blind, if:
     - Mailed by or addressed to a recognized institution for the blind.

   > *Note:* The definition emphasizes that the material must be **intended exclusively for the blind** and must be in accessible tactile or auditory formats.

2. **Postage**  
   Refers to the **charge payable for handling and conveyance** of materials designated as "for the use of the blind."

## **Conditions for Free Postage**

Materials for the use of the blind may be sent **free of postage** under the following conditions:

### **For Delivery in Canada**  
The item must meet **all of the following criteria**:
- The **combined length, width, and depth** of the material must not exceed **2 meters**.
- The **greatest single dimension** (length, width, or depth) must not exceed **1 meter**.
- The material must be **at least 10 cm in length and 7 cm in width**.

> *Rationale:* These dimensions ensure that the item is reasonably sized for standard postal handling and does not exceed typical envelope or package limits.

### **For Delivery Outside Canada**  
The item must meet **all of the following criteria**:
- The **combined length, width, and depth** must not exceed **90 cm**.
- The **greatest single dimension** must not exceed **60 cm**.
- The material must be **at least 14 cm in length and 9 cm in width**.

> *Rationale:* These dimensions are adjusted for international mail handling, which involves different customs, size constraints, and postal systems.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** These provisions were **revoked** under *SOR/83-800, section 2*, meaning the regulation is **no longer legally enforceable** in current Canadian law. This may reflect a shift in postal policy or the implementation of broader accessibility frameworks.

---

## **Maximum Weight Limit**

- The **maximum weight** of any item of material for the use of the blind that may be sent by post under these regulations is **7 kilograms**.

> *Note:* This weight limit ensures that materials remain manageable for postal systems and do not incur excessive handling or shipping costs.

---

## **Labeling and Marking Requirements**

All items of material for the use of the blind must be clearly marked or labeled to identify their purpose. The specific requirements depend on the **delivery destination**.

### **For Delivery in Canada**
The item must bear **one of the following** on the **address side**:
1. The words **“Literature for the blind”** or **“Documentation à l’usage des aveugles”** in the **upper right corner**.
2. A **label in a form approved by the Corporation** (likely the Canadian Post Corporation or a designated government body at the time).

> *Purpose:* Ensures clear identification for postal staff and automated systems, facilitating proper sorting and handling.

### **For Delivery Outside Canada**
The item must bear **one of the following** on the **address side**:
1. The words **“Cécogrammes”** or **“Cécogrammes (Literature for the blind)”** in the **upper right corner**.
2. A **label in a form approved by the Corporation**.

> *Note:* “Cécogrammes” is the French term for “blind literature” or “materials for the blind,” reflecting the bilingual nature of Canadian public services.

> *Purpose:* Enables international postal systems to recognize and process the item appropriately, especially in customs and delivery contexts.

---

## **Customs Documentation Requirements**

Every item of material for the use of the blind must comply with all applicable **customs documentation requirements** as set out in the **International Letter-Post Items Regulations**.

> *Implication:* Even though the materials are for blind persons, they are still subject to international customs rules, including declarations, import restrictions, and security checks. This ensures legal compliance during cross-border transport.

---

## **Protection and Accessibility Requirements**

- The material must be **prepared for posting** in such a way that:
  - Its **contents are sufficiently protected** (e.g., from damage, moisture, or wear).
  - It allows for **quick and easy verification** (e.g., the Braille or raised text is clearly readable and intact upon opening).

> *Purpose:* To ensure that the tactile or auditory content remains legible and usable by the intended recipient, even after postal transit.

---

## **Free Delivery via Registered Mail and Xpresspost™**

- Every item of material for the use of the blind may be accepted for:
  - **Registered mail** (with proof of delivery),
  - Or **Xpresspost™ mail** (a faster, guaranteed delivery service in Canada),

  **at no charge**.

> *Significance:* This provision ensures that blind individuals and institutions can receive materials quickly and securely without incurring postal fees, reinforcing equitable access to information.

## **Historical and Legal Context**

- These regulations were **revoked by SOR/83-800, section 2**, meaning they are **no longer in effect**.
- The revocation suggests that **modern postal and accessibility policies** have replaced or superseded this framework.
- Current accessibility policies in Canada (e.g., under the *Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)* or the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*) likely now govern the distribution of materials for persons with visual impairments through broader inclusive practices, rather than specific postal exemptions.

> **Recommendation:** While this regulation is no longer active, its principles—such as **free access to tactile and auditory materials**, **clear labeling**, and **equitable postal delivery**—remain relevant and may inform current or future accessibility standards.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Materials for the Use of the Blind Regulations* were a historically significant piece of legislation designed to **remove financial and logistical barriers** to the distribution of accessible information for blind Canadians. By enabling **free postage** under specific size and labeling conditions, the regulation promoted inclusion and independence.

However, due to its **revocation in 1983**, it is **not currently applicable**. Its legacy lives on in the ongoing commitment to accessibility in public services, education, and postal systems across Canada.

For current guidance, stakeholders should refer to:
- The *Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)*,
- The *Canadian Post Corporation’s accessibility policies*,
- Or the *Canadian Association of the Blind and Visually Impaired (CABVI)* recommendations.
