The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulatory instrument, specifically:

- **SOR/2009-230, s. 1** (Statutory Instrument 2009-230, section 1)
- **SOR/98-324, s. 3** (Statutory Instrument 1998-324, section 3)

These references indicate that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by subsequent legislation. However, **no substantive content or text of the original regulation is included** in the provided input. As such, it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the regulation itself — only to summarize the legal status of the reference.

### Detailed Summary of the Legal Status:

1. **Repeal by SOR/2009-230, s. 1**  
   - Section 1 of Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 2009-230 formally repeals a previous regulation.  
   - This means that the regulation previously in force was **officially canceled and no longer applies**.  
   - The repeal is effective from the date of publication or as specified in the instrument.

2. **Repeal by SOR/98-324, s. 3**  
   - Section 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 1998-324 also contributed to the repeal of the same or a related regulation.  
   - This earlier repeal suggests that the regulation may have been subject to multiple legislative actions before its final removal.

3. **Multiple Repeats**  
   - The repeated entries (e.g., five times for SOR/2009-230, s. 1) are likely a formatting or data-entry error and do not indicate multiple distinct provisions or legal effects. In legal databases, such repetition is typically a technical artifact and not meaningful.

### Conclusion:

✅ **The regulation referenced in the text has been repealed.**  
❌ **There is no actual content or text of the regulation to summarize.**

Therefore, **a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be provided** due to the absence of its text. The only factual information available is that:

> The regulation was repealed by Statutory Instrument SOR/2009-230, section 1, and also previously by SOR/98-324, section 3. As a result, it is no longer in force and has no current legal effect.

If you have the original regulation's text or a specific title (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of certain trades"), I can assist in summarizing it once the content is available.
