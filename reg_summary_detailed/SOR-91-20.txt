**Detailed Summary of the Specified Tangible Personal Property (GST/HST) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Specified Tangible Personal Property (GST/HST) Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 277(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act*. This provision grants the government the authority to prescribe specific thresholds and tax rates for certain types of tangible personal property for the purpose of Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST).

These regulations are formally cited as the **Specified Tangible Personal Property (GST/HST) Regulations** and are part of the broader framework governing the application of GST/HST to personal property.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to define the **threshold amount** and **tax treatment** for specific categories of tangible personal property when it is sold or transferred. This ensures that certain high-value or culturally significant items are subject to GST/HST in a way that reflects their nature and market value, while also providing clarity and consistency in tax application.

### **Prescribed Thresholds and Tax Treatment**

Under sections 183 and 184 of the *Excise Tax Act*, the following thresholds apply to specified tangible personal property:

| **Type of Property** | **Prescribed Amount / Tax Rate** |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Print, etching, drawing, painting, sculpture, or other similar work of art** | **$2,000** |
| **Jewellery** | **$2,000** |
| **Rare folio, rare manuscript, or rare book** | **$2,000** |
| **Stamp** | **Face value of the stamp** |
| **Coin** | **Zero (no tax)** |

> **Note:** The provision for coins was previously in effect but was **repealed** by *SOR/99-172, section 4* (Statutory Order 1999, No. 172, Section 4). As a result, the tax treatment for coins is no longer governed by these regulations. This means that coins are **not subject to GST/HST** under this regulation, or any subsequent version, as the rule has been removed.

---

### **Application of the Regulations**

- **Sections 1, 3, and 4** came into force on **April 23, 1996**.  
  These sections govern the general application of the thresholds and apply to transactions involving the specified tangible personal property.

- **Section 2** (which likely deals with transitional or implementation provisions) is **deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1997**.  
  This provides a clear timeline for when specific provisions of the regulations began to apply, ensuring a smooth transition in tax administration.

### **Key Interpretations and Implications**

1. **Threshold of $2,000**:
   - For most specified personal property (artworks, jewellery, rare books), the tax is only applied if the **value of the item exceeds $2,000**.
   - This means that items valued at or below $2,000 are **exempt from GST/HST** under these regulations.
   - The threshold is not based on the selling price or market value, but rather on the **value of the item at the time of sale**, as determined by the seller or as assessed under applicable standards.

2. **Stamps**:
   - The tax is based on the **face value** of the stamp, not on the market value or the total transaction price.
   - This reflects the fact that stamps are often considered a form of currency or collectible, and their tax treatment is tied directly to their official value.

3. **Coins**:
   - The regulation originally provided that coins are **exempt from GST/HST** (zero tax).
   - However, this provision was **repealed in 1999** (SOR/99-172, s. 4), meaning that **coins are no longer covered under this regulation**.
   - As such, the tax treatment of coins is now governed by other provisions in the Excise Tax Act or by general rules, and this regulation does not apply to them.

4. **Exemption for Certain Art and Cultural Items**:
   - The exemption for items like paintings, sculptures, and rare books below $2,000 recognizes the cultural and artistic value of such property and avoids imposing tax on low-value personal effects.

### **Legal and Practical Significance**

- These regulations provide **clear, rule-based guidance** for tax authorities, retailers, and individuals involved in the sale of personal property.
- They help prevent **tax avoidance** by ensuring that only items above a defined value are subject to GST/HST.
- The exemption for items below $2,000 supports the principle of **fairness and simplicity** in taxation, especially for small-scale transactions involving personal or collectible goods.

---

### **Repeal and Updates**

- The **repeal of the coin provision** (SOR/99-172, s. 4) indicates that the government has updated its tax policy to reflect changes in the economy or administrative priorities.
- This highlights the **dynamic nature** of tax regulations and their ability to adapt over time.

### **Conclusion**

The *Specified Tangible Personal Property (GST/HST) Regulations* establish a clear, value-based threshold for the application of GST/HST to certain tangible personal property. Items such as artwork, jewellery, and rare books are subject to tax only when their value exceeds $2,000. Stamps are taxed at face value, and coins were previously exempt but are now excluded from this regulation. The regulations came into effect in 1996 and were fully implemented by 1997, with specific transitional provisions ensuring a smooth administrative transition.

These rules are essential for ensuring that GST/HST is applied fairly, consistently, and in a manner that reflects the nature and value of the goods involved, particularly in the cultural and collectible sectors.
