**Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Portions of the Parks Canada Agency Regulations**

**Governing Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under subsection 123(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA). This provision empowers the federal government to transfer certain portions of federal public administration to different units or agencies within the public service, subject to specific employment and administrative rules.

**Regulatory Text and Scope**  
The regulation transfers specific operational and administrative portions of the Parks Canada Agency into new units designated as:

1. **The Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit**  
2. **The Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit**

These units are established to manage and oversee critical technical infrastructure and services essential to the operational efficiency of Parks Canada, particularly in the areas of email systems, data center operations, and network services.

**Applicability of Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) Subsection 132(1)**  
Subsection 132(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act* applies to all individuals who are employed or engaged in the operations of these two newly designated units. This means that:

- All employees and contractors working within the Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit and the Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit are subject to the employment standards, rights, obligations, and protections outlined in the PSEA.
- These standards include, but are not limited to, terms of employment, working conditions, grievance procedures, disciplinary actions, and collective bargaining rights.
- The regulation ensures that personnel in these units are treated in accordance with federal public service employment principles, maintaining consistency and fairness in employment practices.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on **November 15, 2011**. This date marks the official implementation of the transfer and the application of the employment provisions under subsection 132(1) to the personnel in the two units.

**Purpose and Rationale**  
The transfer is intended to:

- Improve the efficiency, security, and scalability of Parks Canada’s information technology infrastructure.
- Centralize and professionalize the management of core IT services (email, data centers, and networks), which are critical for day-to-day operations and public service delivery.
- Align these services with broader federal public service standards for employment and governance.
- Ensure that technical staff are employed under clear, transparent, and consistent employment rules that support accountability, performance, and workforce stability.

**Key Implications**  
- Employees in these units are now governed by the same employment protections and procedures as other federal public servants.
- The transfer may reflect a broader strategy to modernize Parks Canada’s IT operations and enhance service delivery through better infrastructure management.
- It may also signal a shift toward greater specialization and operational autonomy in IT functions within federal agencies.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a structural and administrative reorganization within Parks Canada’s public service framework. By transferring key IT functions into dedicated units and applying the full scope of the *Public Service Employment Act*, it ensures that technical personnel are employed under standardized, fair, and transparent conditions. The effective date of November 15, 2011, marks the formal integration of these units into the federal public service structure and the beginning of their operational and employment governance under established federal employment laws.
