**Detailed Summary of the General Excise and Sales Tax Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **General Excise and Sales Tax Regulations** and may be cited as such. They form part of the regulatory framework governing the collection, reporting, and administration of **sales tax and excise tax** under the **Excise Tax Act (Act)**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, which provides the legal foundation for excise and sales tax administration.
- **Department**: The *Department of National Revenue* (DNR), responsible for enforcing and administering the tax laws.
- **Licensee**: Any individual or entity that has been granted a licence under the Excise Tax Act to operate in the sale or manufacture of taxable goods.
- **Manufacturer**: Includes producers; broadly defined to cover those who produce or manufacture goods subject to excise or sales tax.
- **Manufacture**: Includes "produce," meaning the act of producing goods.
- **Minister**: Refers to the *Minister of National Revenue*, who has authority to issue directives, interpret regulations, and enforce compliance.

---

### **3. Application for Licences**

#### **Manufacturer’s Licence (Sales or Excise Tax)**
- Applications for a **manufacturer’s sales tax licence**, **excise tax licence**, or both must be submitted to the Department in **Form L15** (Schedule III).

#### **Wholesaler’s Sales Tax Licence**
- Applications for a **wholesaler’s sales tax licence** must be submitted in **Form L16** (Schedule IV).

> These forms are standardized to ensure consistency in application and processing.

### **4. Reporting and Notification Requirements (Changes in Business Operations)**

Licensees must promptly notify the Department of any significant changes affecting their operations:

| Change | Required Action |
|-------|------------------|
| **Change in ownership** of the business (individual or partnership) | Immediate application for a new licence |
| **Change in business name** | Immediate application for a new licence |
| **Change or discontinuation of operations** at any place of business covered by the licence | Immediate notification to the Department |
| **Commencing manufacture** at a location not specified in the licence | Immediate notification to the Department |
| **Commencing operations** at a new division or branch not listed in the licence | Immediate notification to the Department |

> These provisions ensure that the Department maintains accurate records of licensed operations and prevents unauthorized or unregistered activities.

---

### **5. Exemption from Licensing**

Under **subsection 40(2)** of the Excise Tax Act, certain **small manufacturers or producers** are exempt from obtaining a licence **for Parts III and IV** of the Act (sales and excise tax) **if** they fall within a class exempted under **subsection 31(2)** of the Act from paying consumption or sales tax.

> **Note**: This exemption is no longer in effect — the regulation explicitly states "[Revoked, SOR/82-328, s. 1]" and "[Revoked, SOR/80-284, s. 1]".  
> **Conclusion**: This exemption is **currently revoked** and does not apply.

---

### **6. Security Requirements for Wholesalers and Jobbers**

Under **section 32 of the Excise Tax Act**, wholesalers or jobbers must provide security when applying for a sales tax licence. The amount and conditions are specified:

#### **Amount of Security**
- **Initial Security**: Double the amount of sales tax paid or payable on goods sold during the **three months immediately before** the application month.
- **Ongoing Security**: After initial approval, the security must be equal to **double the amount of sales tax** from the **three largest monthly taxable sales** during the **previous calendar year**.

> This ensures financial responsibility and acts as a safeguard against tax evasion or non-payment.

#### **Form of Security**
- **Government Bond**: Must be:
  - Fully registered (principal and interest)
  - Accompanied by a **transfer form** in favour of the Receiver General
  - Signed by the transferor, with **attestation** by a bank or financial institution acceptable to the Bank of Canada

- **Chartered Bank Guarantee**: Must be in a form **satisfactory to the Minister**

> These requirements ensure that the security is legitimate, traceable, and enforceable.

---

### **7. Tax Returns and Filing Obligations**

Every person required to pay sales or excise tax — or holding a licence under Parts III, IV, or V of the Act — must file a **monthly return** in **Form B93** (Schedule II), showing:

- Total taxable sales during the period
- Amount of sales tax and excise tax payable

#### **Special Filing Options (Reduced or Periodic Returns)**

A person may file a return in a period **shorter than one month** or **longer than one month** under specific conditions:

| Condition | Eligibility |
|--------|-------------|
| Tax payable for the **last preceding calendar year** ≤ $2,400<br>And tax payable for the current period = **nil** | Can file a return for any period between **1 and 6 consecutive months**, starting on **January 1 or July 1** |
| Tax payable for the current period = **nil** | Can file a return for any period between **1 and 3 consecutive months**, starting on **January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1** |
| Sales are **seasonal** and tax payable is nil | Can file a return for any period up to 6 months |
| Tax payable ≤ **$200/month** in the current period<br>And average tax payable in the same period of the previous year ≤ $200/month | Can file a return for up to 3 consecutive months |

> **Prerequisite**: The person must provide **written notification** to the Minister **no later than the last day of the first month** of the reporting period.

> This flexibility supports small businesses with seasonal operations or low-volume sales.

---

### **8. Consequences of Non-Compliance**

If a person fails to file a return under the special provisions (subsection 2 or 3) or fails to pay taxes within the prescribed timeframes:

- **Failure to file** or **default in payment** (as per paragraphs 50(3)(b) or (c) of the Act) triggers a requirement to file a return under **subsection 50(1) or (2)** of the Act.
- Upon notification by the Minister, the person **must file a return** within the prescribed time.

> This ensures compliance and prevents tax avoidance through non-reporting.

---

### **9. Signature and Delivery of Returns**

- Returns must be signed by:
  - The **proprietor** or **partner** of the business (for sole proprietorships or partnerships), or
  - A **company officer** (president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, manager), or any person **duly authorized** to sign on behalf of the company.

- Returns must be delivered to:
  - The **Regional Director, Excise**, for the region where the licence was issued, **or**
  - The Regional Director for the region where the business is located (if not licensed)

> Unless otherwise directed by the Regional Director.

---

### **10. Refund or Deduction for Exported Goods**

When goods on which sales or excise tax has been paid are **exported without use in Canada**, a **refund** of taxes paid or a **deduction from future tax liabilities** may be granted **if**:

- For **domestic goods**: Evidence of tax payment on purchase is maintained on file and presented to Department officers.
- For **imported goods**: Evidence of tax payment at importation (e.g., a **receipted copy of the original import entry**) is maintained and presented.

> The Minister may approve the refund or deduction **only if** satisfactory evidence is provided that the goods were **actually exported from Canada**.

> This provision supports international trade and prevents double taxation on exported goods.

---

### **11. Legal References and Amendments**

- The regulation references **SOR/78-821, s. 2** and **C.R.C., C. 594, p. 3947 and 3949** — indicating that certain provisions may be subject to further interpretation or amendment by statute or court decisions.
- Several sections have been **revoked** (e.g., SOR/82-328 and SOR/80-284), meaning they are no longer in force and do not apply.
