**Detailed Summary of the Broadcasting Information Regulations, 1993**

---

### **Overview**

The *Broadcasting Information Regulations, 1993* (S.C. 1991, c. 11) are a set of administrative regulations made under the authority of the *Broadcasting Act* of Canada. These regulations establish specific information reporting and disclosure obligations for broadcasting licensees. They were published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on July 3, 1993, following a public notice period that allowed stakeholders—including licensees and the public—to submit comments or representations. On August 5, 1993, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) formally adopted and issued these regulations.

The regulations are designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and public trust in the broadcasting sector by requiring licensees to provide timely and accurate information about their operations, financial status, programming, and compliance with regulatory and industry standards.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. Annual Statement of Accounts (Section 2)**

- **Requirement**:  
  Every broadcasting licensee that charges fees to subscribers or to another licensee (who in turn charges fees to subscribers) must submit a **statement of accounts** to the CRTC.

- **Timing**:  
  The statement must be submitted **on or before November 30 of each year**.

- **Form**:  
  The statement must be included in the **annual return of broadcasting licensee form**.

- **Coverage Period**:  
  The financial data reported must cover the year **ending on August 31 of the previous year**.

> *Example*: For the 1993 reporting period, the statement would cover the fiscal year ending August 31, 1992, and be submitted by November 30, 1993.

- **Purpose**:  
  This requirement enables the CRTC to monitor revenue, service costs, and financial sustainability of broadcasting services, particularly for commercial broadcasters who operate on fee-based models.

#### **2. Response to Complaints, Disputes, and Requests for Information (Section 2)**

- **Mandatory Obligation**:  
  A licensee must respond to any of the following requests made by a person or entity:

  a. **Complaints or disputes** filed by any individual or organization;  
  b. **Requests for resolution of disputes** related to programming content or technical operations;  
  c. **Requests for information** about:
     - Programming originated or distributed by the licensee;
     - The licensee’s technical operations;
     - Subscribership (number and details of subscribers);
     - Financial affairs (e.g., revenues, expenditures);
     - Ownership structure (e.g., ownership of shares, corporate control);  
     - Compliance with:
       - The terms of its broadcasting licence;
       - The *Broadcasting Act*;
       - These regulations;
       - Industry standards, practices, or codes;
       - Any other self-regulatory mechanism (e.g., industry associations or codes of conduct).

- **Scope of Information**:  
  The licensee must provide information relevant to the inquiry, including factual data and any supporting documentation, as reasonably required.

- **Purpose**:  
  This provision enhances accountability and ensures that the public and interested parties can access information about broadcasting operations, thereby promoting transparency and trust in the system.

#### **3. Definition of "Subscriber" (Section 2)**

- A **"subscriber"** is defined as:

  1. **A household** of one or more persons—whether living in a single-unit dwelling or a unit within a multi-unit building—**to which broadcasting service is provided directly or indirectly** by the licensee (as defined in Section 2 of the *Broadcasting Act*); or

  2. **The owner or operator** of any commercial or institutional facility—such as:
     - Hotels;
     - Hospitals;
     - Nursing homes;
     - Other commercial or institutional premises—**to which service is provided by the licensee**.

- **Significance**:  
  This definition ensures that the scope of subscriber counts and service delivery is clearly defined, helping licensees accurately report subscriber numbers and service reach, especially in institutional or business settings.

---

#### **4. Exemption from Reporting (Section 2, Exception Clause)**

- **Exception**:  
  If a licensee is **already required** by another regulation under the *Broadcasting Act* to provide information on the same form or about the same matters (e.g., financial reports, programming logs, ownership disclosures), **it is not required to submit that information again** under the current regulations.

- **Purpose**:  
  This prevents duplication of reporting and reduces administrative burden on licensees while ensuring that all required information is still disclosed—just through the appropriate regulatory channel.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations are made under **subsection 10(1)** of the *Broadcasting Act*, which authorizes the CRTC to make regulations for the administration of the Act.
- The initial proposal was published under **subsection 10(3)**, which provides for a reasonable opportunity for public comment before final adoption.

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Transparency**:  
   Ensures that the public and regulatory bodies have access to accurate and timely information about how broadcasting services are operated.

2. **Accountability**:  
   Holds licensees responsible for their financial, operational, and programming decisions.

3. **Public Trust**:  
   Builds confidence in the broadcasting system by enabling public scrutiny of service quality, pricing, and content.

4. **Regulatory Efficiency**:  
   Avoids redundant reporting through the exception clause.

---

### **Applicability**

- Applies to **all broadcasting licensees** in Canada who:
  - Charge fees to subscribers; or
  - Licensee-to-licensee fee arrangements exist (e.g., cable companies charging fees to satellite providers).

- Does **not apply** to non-commercial or public broadcasters that do not charge fees (unless they engage in fee-based service provision).

### **Conclusion**

The *Broadcasting Information Regulations, 1993* represent a foundational step in the CRTC’s efforts to strengthen regulatory oversight of the Canadian broadcasting industry. By mandating annual financial disclosures and requiring responsiveness to public inquiries, the regulations promote transparency, accountability, and public confidence in the delivery of broadcast services.

While the regulations are relatively straightforward in structure, they establish a consistent and enforceable framework for information sharing between broadcasters and the regulator, setting a precedent for future regulatory initiatives in the sector.
