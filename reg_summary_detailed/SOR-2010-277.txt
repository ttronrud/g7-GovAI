**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) Rules of Practice and Procedure (2010)**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**

The **Rules of Practice and Procedure** of the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** were adopted on **November 26, 2010**, pursuant to:

- **Section 10 and 21 of the Broadcasting Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 11)
- **Section 57 and 67 of the Telecommunications Act** (S.C. 1993, c. 38)

These rules were initially proposed and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 31, 2010**, giving licensees and interested parties a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** before final adoption.

This regulatory framework establishes the procedural standards governing how the CRTC conducts hearings, processes applications, manages document submissions, and ensures fairness, transparency, and public interest in its decision-making.

### **2. Scope of Application**

#### **Applicable Proceedings**
These Rules apply to **all CRTC proceedings** except:

- Proceedings arising from applications listed in **Schedule 1** (e.g., certain specific types of applications like those involving emergency services or spectrum allocation).
- Proceedings involving **administrative monetary penalties (AMPs)** under sections 72.001 to 72.19 of the Telecommunications Act, **unless** such penalties are imposed in the course of a proceeding referenced in section 72.003.

#### **Excluded Proceedings**
The Rules **do not apply** to proceedings under:
- Sections 6 to 46 of *An Act to promote the efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy* (commonly known as the "Electronic Commerce Act"), which governs activities that discourage reliance on electronic means of commercial transactions.

> This exclusion ensures that the CRTC’s procedural rules do not interfere with regulatory frameworks designed to regulate digital commerce and e-business.
