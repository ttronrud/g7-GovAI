### **Detailed Summary of the La Ronge Airport Zoning Regulations (1987)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

The **La Ronge Airport Zoning Regulations** were formally enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

Prior to enactment, the proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of:
- *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **May 16 and May 23, 1987**, and  
- *The Northerner La Ronge* on **July 8 and July 15, 1987**.

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport. The public consultation process ensured transparency and stakeholder input before final adoption.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *La Ronge Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to all lands, including public road allowances, that are:
  - Within the **outer limits** of the lands described in **Part VI of the schedule**, and  
  - Directly under the portions of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

These lands are defined in precise geographic terms based on a detailed zoning plan.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | La Ronge Airport, located in the vicinity of La Ronge, Saskatchewan |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the centerline of runway 17–35, 762 meters southerly from the 17 end of the runway. Its elevation is **372 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip to protect aircraft during landing. Described by slope ratios and horizontal distances. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, except where this would be less than 9 meters above ground level — in which case, it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area designated for takeoff and landing, including runways. Two strips are defined: 17–35 and 10–28. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object on regulated land such that the **highest point** of that object exceeds:

- The **approach surface**,  
- The **outer surface**, or  
- The **transitional surface**.

> This ensures that no obstruction — whether man-made or natural — interferes with aircraft operations during approach, takeoff, or flight paths.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to:

- Remove the growth, or  
- Remove only the part that exceeds the surface elevation.

This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural features while maintaining safety standards.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**

No owner or occupier may allow any land under these regulations to be used for the disposal of **waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical safety measure to prevent bird strikes, which pose a significant risk to aircraft during takeoff and landing.

#### **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces (Based on Public Works Canada Plan No. E.1882, July 5, 1985)**

##### **A. Airport Reference Point**
- Located on the centerline of runway 17–35.
- 762 meters south of the 17 end of the runway.
- Elevation: **372 meters above sea level**.

##### **B. Approach Surfaces (Four in total)**

| Runway Approach | Slope Ratio (Initial) | Slope Ratio (Final) | Horizontal Distance | Height at Final Line | Distance from Centerline |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Runway 35** | 1:60 (vertical:horizontal) | 1:50 | 15,000 m | 291.5 m above end of strip | 2,400 m |
| **Runway 17** | 1:60 | 1:50 | 15,000 m | 292.3 m above end of strip | 2,400 m |
| **Runway 10** | 1:40 | — | 2,500 m | 62.5 m above end of strip | 280.5 m |
| **Runway 28** | 1:40 | — | 2,500 m | 62.5 m above end of strip | 280.5 m |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during approach by ensuring no obstructions rise above safe altitudes.

##### **C. Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP** (372 m = 417 m above sea level).
- If 45 m above ground would be less than 9 m, then the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.
- Acts as a boundary beyond which no structure may rise.

##### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length | Lateral Dimensions |
|--------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| **17–35** | 300 m | 1,949 m | 150 m on each side of centerline |
| **10–28** | 61 m | 974 m | 30.5 m on each side of centerline |

> These are the active areas for aircraft operations.

##### **E. Transitional Surfaces**

| Runway | Slope Ratio | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **17–35** | 1:7 (vertical:horizontal) | Extends from lateral edges of strip and approach surfaces to intersect outer surface or adjacent transitional surface |
| **10–28** | 1:5 | Same as above, but steeper slope |

> These surfaces connect the strips and approach areas to the outer surface, ensuring smooth transitions in the airspace and preventing obstructions near the edges.

#### **8. Boundary of Outer Limits (Geographic Description)**

The boundary of the regulated land is defined by a **precise, circular and linear path** centered at the **Airport Reference Point** (ARP), with the following description:

1. **Starts** at the southeasterly limit of **Public Reserve R5**, where it intersects a **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered at the ARP.
2. **Travels easterly** along the circumference of the circle **counterclockwise** until it meets the **northwesterly limit of Poirier Street**.
3. Proceeds **southwesterly** along Poirier Street to intersect the **northeasterly limit of Lot 23, Block 29**.
4. Moves **southeasterly** across Poirier Street to the **westerly corner of Lot 25, Block 29**.
5. Proceeds **northeasterly** along the northwesterly limits of Lots 25, 26, and 27, Block 29, to the **northerly corner of Lot 27**.
6. Travels **southeasterly** along the northeasterly limit of Lot 27 and across **Finlayson Street and Parcel J**, to the **northwesterly limit of Block 38**.
7. Proceeds **northeasterly** along the northwesterly limit of Block 38 to the **northerly corner of Lot 17**.
8. Moves **southeasterly** along the northeasterly limit of Lot 17 to its **easterly corner**.
9. Proceeds **northerly, easterly, and southeasterly** along the easterly, southerly, and southwesterly limits of Lots 16 to 2, Block 38, and the intervening lane, to the **most southerly corner of Lot 2, Block 38**.
10. Turns **northeasterly** along the southeasterly limits of Lots 2 and 1, Block 38, to the **easterly corner of Lot 1, Block 38**.
11. Moves **southeasterly** across Studer Street to the **easterly corner of Lot 2, Block 36**.
12. Proceeds **northeasterly** along the southeasterly limit of Block 36 to the **
