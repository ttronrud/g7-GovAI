> ... (repeated eight times)

### Summary:

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Regulations*, which are legal instruments issued under the authority of a federal or provincial government in Canada.
- **SOR/2017-84** is the specific regulation number issued in 2017.
- **Section 1** of that regulation contains the provision that formally repeals the prior regulation.

### Interpretation:

The repeated references confirm that the regulation being summarized is **no longer in force**. There is no active legal content to summarize because it has been officially removed from the legal framework.

### Conclusion:

✅ **The regulation has been repealed.**  
❌ **There is no active or current content to summarize.**  
📌 **The repeal was enacted by SOR/2017-84, section 1**, meaning that the previous regulation was formally canceled and replaced or superseded by a new legal provision or policy.

> Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself is not possible — it no longer exists in force. Any reference to it should be treated as obsolete or historical.
