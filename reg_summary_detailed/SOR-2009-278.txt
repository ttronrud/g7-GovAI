**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Title of the Regulation**  
**Order Designating British Columbia for the Purposes of the Criminal Interest Rate Provisions of the Criminal Code**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulatory order designates **British Columbia (BC)** as a jurisdiction where the **criminal interest rate provisions** of the *Criminal Code of Canada* — specifically **section 347.1** — apply to **payday loans**. The purpose is to align BC’s legal framework with federal criminal provisions that prohibit excessive interest rates on loans, thereby protecting consumers from exploitative lending practices.

The order is grounded in two key legislative and policy premises:

1. **Provincial Legislative Safeguards**:  
   British Columbia has enacted specific legislation — the *Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act, 2007* (S.B.C. 2007, c. 35) — that includes measures to protect borrowers from predatory lending. These include:
   - Limits on the total cost of borrowing under payday loan agreements.
   - Consumer protections such as clear disclosure requirements and restrictions on loan terms.

2. **Federal Request for Designation**:  
   The Lieutenant Governor in Council (representing the provincial government) formally requested that the Governor in Council designate BC under **section 347.1a** of the *Criminal Code* (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 347.1a), which allows certain provinces to apply federal criminal interest rate laws to payday loans.

### **Legal Authority**

The order is made under **subsection 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code**, which authorizes the Governor in Council to designate a province for the purposes of applying the criminal interest rate provisions (section 347.1) to payday loans, provided that:
- The province has appropriate legislative and regulatory safeguards in place.
- The designation is recommended by the **Minister of Justice** and the **Minister of Industry**.

This ensures that the federal criminal law is applied in a manner consistent with provincial consumer protection efforts.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Designation of British Columbia**  
   British Columbia is officially designated for the purposes of **section 347.1 of the Criminal Code**, which prohibits the **charging or collection of interest rates that exceed the legal maximum** on loans.  
   This means that **any person who unlawfully charges or collects interest in excess of the maximum allowed under BC law may be criminally liable** under federal criminal law.

2. **Effective Date**  
   The order comes into force on the **first day** when all of the following are in full force and effect:
   - The **Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act, 2007** (S.B.C. 2007, c. 35), **except** for the following provisions:
     - Sections **112.12 to 112.15** of the *Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act* (S.B.C. 2004, c. 2), as amended by section 4 of the 2007 Act.
     - Sections **5 and 6** of the same Act.
     - Paragraph **189(4)(f.6)** of the *Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act*, as amended by section 8 of the 2007 Act.
   - Sections **5.1 and 7.3** of the *Business Practices and Consumer Protection Regulation* (B.C. Reg. 294/2004), as amended by **B.C. Reg. 57/2009**.
   - The full text of the **Payday Loans Regulation**, as enacted by **B.C. Reg. 57/2009**.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**: The order does **not** apply to the above-excluded sections, which may still govern certain aspects of consumer protection or loan administration, but are not part of the criminal interest rate framework.

3. **Time Zone Consideration**  
   The effective date is determined based on **Pacific Time** for the majority of BC (e.g., Vancouver, Victoria), and **Mountain Time** for areas in the mountain time zone (e.g., parts of northern BC such as the Rockies). This ensures consistency across time zones within the province.

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Consumer Protection**: By applying federal criminal interest rate laws, the order strengthens consumer protections against **predatory lending**, where lenders may charge exorbitant interest rates that are unaffordable or exploitative.
  
- **Criminal Liability**: Lenders or financial institutions that charge or collect interest in excess of the legal maximum under BC law (as set by the Payday Loans Regulation) may now face **criminal penalties** under the *Criminal Code*, including fines or imprisonment.

- **Alignment with Provincial Regulation**: The designation ensures that BC’s strong consumer protection framework — including limits on total borrowing costs and transparent lending practices — is supported by federal criminal enforcement, reinforcing the integrity of the financial system.

- **Provincial Autonomy with Federal Oversight**: This order exemplifies a cooperative model between federal and provincial governments, where provincial legislation creates a safe environment for federal criminal law to apply in a targeted and effective way.

---

### **Date of Entry into Force**

The order officially came into force on **November 1, 2009** — the first day when all required provincial laws and regulations were in effect.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a significant step in the regulation of payday lending in British Columbia. It:
- Legally designates BC as a jurisdiction where **federal criminal interest rate laws apply** to payday loans.
- Ensures that **unlawful interest rates** are not only a civil or regulatory violation but also a **criminal offense**.
- Provides a strong deterrent against predatory lending by linking financial misconduct to criminal liability.
- Reflects a commitment to consumer safety through a combination of **provincial regulation and federal criminal enforcement**.

It remains a foundational piece of policy in Canada’s efforts to regulate high-cost lending and protect vulnerable borrowers.
