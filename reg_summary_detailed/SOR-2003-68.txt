**Detailed Summary of the *Information Technology Activities (Property and Casualty Companies) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**:

- **Section 501a** – Powers to make regulations concerning the activities of insurance companies.
- **Section 1021b** – Authority to regulate information technology activities in property and casualty (P&C) insurance companies.

The regulations were introduced to **establish rules governing the involvement of property and casualty (P&C) and marine insurance companies in information technology (IT) activities**, particularly those involving data transmission systems, information platforms, and related services.

They were originally enacted under:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 426** and **s. 465**
- **S.C. 1991, c. 47**

> Note: Some definitions and provisions have been repealed or amended over time (e.g., "book value" was repealed in 2008; "member of a property and casualty company’s group" was repealed in 2009), so the current version reflects updated, active provisions.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA), the primary legislation governing insurance companies in Canada. |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value of shares and ownership interests reported on an **unconsolidated basis** in the entity’s balance sheet. This is the key metric used to assess financial exposure. |
| **Member of a company’s group** | Defined as per **subsection 490(2)** of the ICA — refers to companies within the same corporate group, including subsidiaries and affiliates. |
| **Prescribed activity** | As defined in the ICA under **paragraph 441(1)(d.1)(iii)**, a purpose or circumstance that is **materially related to providing financial products or services** by the company or a member of its group. |

> The regulation interprets the "prescribed purpose or circumstance" to mean activities directly tied to financial services delivery — ensuring that IT investments serve insurance operations.

---

### **3. What Constitutes a "Prescribed Activity" (Under Section 495(4)(f))**

A prescribed activity includes:
- Designing, developing, holding, managing, manufacturing, selling, or otherwise dealing with:
  - Data transmission systems
  - Information sites (e.g., websites)
  - Communication devices
  - Information platforms or portals

> These are considered **IT infrastructure or services used to deliver information services** — such as customer portals, claims processing systems, or data analytics platforms — that support insurance operations.

---

### **4. Prohibition on Acquiring Control or Substantial Investments**

A **property and casualty (P&C) company or marine company** is **prohibited from**:

#### ✅ Acquiring control of, or increasing a substantial investment in, an entity that engages in a prescribed IT activity **if** the sum of the following exceeds **5% of the company’s regulatory capital**:

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests the company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity under paragraph 495(4)(f).
2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the company and its subsidiaries in **other entities** that engage in prescribed IT activities and that the company controls or holds a substantial investment in.
3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the company and its subsidiaries to such entities.

> This creates a **5% capital threshold limit** to prevent excessive exposure to IT-related entities. The rule applies cumulatively across all such entities, whether directly or indirectly controlled.

> The balance sheet value is calculated on an **unconsolidated basis**, meaning it does not combine the financials of parent and subsidiary companies into one consolidated figure.

---

### **5. Additional Prohibitions on IT Entities**

A P&C or marine company **cannot acquire control or a substantial investment in an IT entity** if the entity engages in any of the following activities:

#### ❌ Prohibited Activities:

| Prohibited Activity | Explanation |
|--------------------|-----------|
| **Accepting deposit liabilities** | Entities that take deposits (like banks or credit unions) are excluded. This prevents P&C companies from becoming depository institutions. |
| **Activities prohibited under section 466 or 469 of the ICA** | These include activities such as engaging in investment banking or certain types of lending not allowed for insurers. |
| **Financial intermediary activities exposing the entity to material market or credit risk** | Includes activities of: <br> - Finance entities (e.g., lending, financing) <br> - Factoring entities (e.g., selling accounts receivable) <br> - Financial leasing entities (e.g., leasing assets) <br> These carry significant risk and are not permitted for insurers. |
| **Activities of a specialized financing entity** | Entities that provide specialized financing (e.g., for vehicles, equipment) are excluded. |
| **Dealing in securities** | Except where explicitly permitted: <br> - Under **paragraph 495(4)(e)** of the ICA <br> - Or under **paragraph 440(2)(b)** of the ICA (which allows limited securities dealing for certain purposes). |
| **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** | Prohibited unless permitted under subsection **441(3)** of the ICA. This prevents insurers from engaging in retail trading. |
| **Acquiring control of or holding a substantial investment in another entity** | Unless one of the following applies: <br> - The entity is **controlled by the P&C or marine company**, and the company itself is **permitted** under **Part IX of the ICA** to invest in that entity; <br> - The entity is **not controlled** by the insurer, but the insurer itself would be permitted to acquire a substantial investment under: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Subsection **493(2)** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Paragraph **493(3)(b)** or **(c)** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Subsection **495(1)** or **(4)** of the ICA |

> This ensures that even indirect investments in other entities are only allowed if the parent company has explicit authorization under the ICA.

---

### **6. Exclusion of Subsection 495(7) in Certain Cases**

> **Subsection 495(7)** of the ICA normally imposes restrictions on investment in entities based on their risk profile. However, **this subsection does not apply** when determining whether a P&C or marine company can acquire a substantial investment in an entity under:

- Subsection **493(2)**
- Paragraphs **493(3)(b)** or **(c)**
- Subsection **495(1)** or **(4)**

> This means that **when evaluating investment eligibility**, the stricter risk-based restrictions under 495(7) are **not triggered** — allowing more flexibility in cases where the investment is permitted under other provisions.

---

### **7. Exception for Entities with Limited Activities**

> **Subsection 495(7)** of the ICA **does not apply** if a P&C or marine company acquires control of or increases a substantial investment in an entity whose business is **limited to activities described in subsection 3(1)** of the ICA.

> This means:
- If the IT entity only provides **core IT services** (e.g., secure data platforms, internal communication tools) and **does not engage in any prohibited financial activities**, then the 5% capital threshold and other restrictions **do not apply**.
- This exception supports **innovation and operational efficiency** within the insurance sector by allowing companies to invest in essential IT infrastructure without triggering full regulatory scrutiny.

> **Note**: This exception **does not limit** the operation of **subsections 3(2) and (3)** of the ICA, which may still apply to other aspects of company conduct.

---

### **8. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Management** | Limits exposure to IT entities that could introduce financial risk (e.g., through lending, securities, or deposits). |
| **Operational Focus** | Ensures that IT investments are directly linked to financial services (e.g., claims processing, underwriting, customer service). |
| **Capital Prudence** | Enforces a 5% regulatory capital cap on total exposure to IT-related entities, protecting insurer solvency. |
| **Prevention of Diversification into Prohibited Activities** | Prevents insurers from indirectly entering into banking, financing, or securities markets. |
| **Support for Innovation** | Allows limited investment in IT platforms that enhance core insurance operations — promoting digital transformation. |

### **Summary in Plain Language**

This regulation sets strict limits on how property and casualty (P&C) and marine insurance companies can invest in or control **information technology (IT) companies** — such as those that develop websites, manage data systems, or operate digital platforms.

- **You can only invest** in such IT companies if:
  - The IT company only offers **information services** (not
