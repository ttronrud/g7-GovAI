**Detailed Summary of the Designated Employees Pension Protection Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *Designated Employees Pension Protection Regulations* (the "Regulations") were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under **subsections 5(3) and (4)** of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 5).  

These Regulations are designed to **protect the pension rights of certain employees**—specifically, those who were employed in designated airport authorities—following the transfer of those airports from the federal government to regional or private entities. The Regulations ensure that these employees are not disadvantaged in terms of pension entitlements due to changes in employment structure resulting from the transfer.

The Regulations may be cited as the **Designated Employees Pension Protection Regulations**.

### **Applicability of the Public Service Superannuation Act**

**Section 1 – General Applicability**

Subject to **Sections 3 and 4** of the Regulations, the **Public Service Superannuation Act** and its associated regulations **apply to a person who makes an election under paragraph 5(1)(e)** of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act*.

- This means that employees of designated airport authorities who elect to be treated as part of the federal public service for pension purposes are governed by the standard pension rules under the Public Service Superannuation Act.
- The key trigger for this application is the **election under paragraph 5(1)(e)**, which allows individuals to maintain their pension rights under the Public Service Superannuation Act despite being employed by a designated airport authority.

> 🔍 *Implication:* Employees who choose to participate in the public service pension system retain the same rights and benefits as other public servants, including pensionable service accrual and retirement benefits.

### **Exclusions from Certain Pension Provisions**

**Section 2 – Exemptions from Key Provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act**

The following provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act **do not apply** to certain individuals who were married or had children with a designated employee *after* the transfer date of the airport:

#### 1. **Surviving Spouse of a Designated Employee**
- A **surviving spouse** of a designated employee who:
  - Became the spouse of that employee **on or after the transfer date** of the airport,
- Is **not** entitled to the benefits under subsections 12(4), (6), (7), and 13(2) and (3) of the Public Service Superannuation Act **unless**:
  - The designated employee had **again become a contributor** under the Public Service Superannuation Act after the transfer date.

> ✅ *Interpretation:* If the employee resumed public service contributions after the transfer, their spouse may qualify for pension benefits under the Act.  
> ❌ *Otherwise:* The spouse is excluded from the standard survivor pension benefits.

#### 2. **Children of a Designated Employee**
- A **child** of a designated employee who:
  - Was **conceived by**, **adopted by**, or **became a stepchild of** the employee **on or after the transfer date**,
- Is **not** entitled to pension benefits under the relevant sections (12(4), (6), (7), 13(2), (3)) **unless**:
  - The designated employee had **again become a contributor** under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

> ✅ *Interpretation:* If the employee re-joined the public service and contributed again, the child may qualify for pension benefits.  
> ❌ *Otherwise:* The child is excluded from the pension benefits available to children of public servants.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This exclusion applies only to children born or adopted *after* the transfer date. Children born or adopted before the transfer date are not affected.

> 💡 *Purpose:* This protects the pension rights of employees who were not re-employed in the public service after the transfer, preventing automatic entitlements to pension benefits for spouses or children who would otherwise be entitled under the general rules.

### **Amendments to the Definition of Pensionable Service and Retirement Dates**

**Section 3 – Adjustments to Key Definitions in the Public Service Superannuation Act**

For the purposes of **Section 5** of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act*, the following adjustments are made to specific provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act:

#### 1. **Year of Cessation of Employment (Subparagraphs 10(9)(b)(i) and (ii))**
- The **year in which a person ceases to be employed in the Public Service** is defined as:
  > *The year in which the person ceases to be employed by a designated airport authority.*

> ✅ *Effect:* This ensures consistency in determining pension eligibility and service years. For example, if an employee leaves a designated airport authority in January 1993, the year of cessation is 1993, not the year they left the broader public service.

#### 2. **Pensionable Service and Service Periods (Subsections 12(1) to (3), (6) to (8), and Section 13)**
- The **number of years of pensionable service** and **number of years of service** for a designated employee includes:
  > *Any period of service with a designated airport authority during the period beginning on the transfer date and ending on the day before the person ceases to be employed by the designated airport authority.*

> ✅ *Effect:* Service rendered *after* the transfer date (but before leaving the airport authority) counts toward pensionable service. This is critical for employees who were employed in the airport authority post-transfer and whose service is otherwise excluded from public service pension calculations.

- The **day on which a person ceases to be employed in the Public Service** is defined as:
  > *The day on which that person ceases to be employed by a designated airport authority.*

> ✅ *Effect:* This aligns the retirement date with the actual end of employment at the airport authority, rather than with a broader public service exit date.

#### 3. **Retirement Year/Month (Subsection 69(3))**
- For a designated employee for an airport:
  - The **retirement year or retirement month** is defined as:
    > *The year or month, as the case may be, in which the transfer date for the airport occurs.*

> ✅ *Effect:* This is a significant change. Instead of retiring based on when they actually retire, their retirement is tied to the **transfer date** of the airport.  
> Example: If the transfer date is March 15, 1992, then the employee’s retirement year/month is March 1992 — regardless of when they actually retire.

> ⚠️ *Important Note:* This provision may create a mismatch between actual retirement and the official retirement date for pension purposes. It suggests that pension benefits may be calculated based on the transfer date, not the actual retirement date.

> 💡 *Possible rationale:* This may be intended to ensure fairness and consistency in pension calculations when employees are transitioning from federal public service to a new entity (e.g., a regional authority). It prevents a situation where someone who worked in the airport authority for years after the transfer would have a retirement date that is later than the transfer date.

### **Effective Date**

These Regulations **came into force on July 1, 1992**.

> ✅ *This means all provisions apply from that date onward*, and any pension or benefit calculations involving designated employees must reflect these rules from July 1, 1992.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pension Continuity** | Ensures that employees of designated airports are not disadvantaged in pension terms due to the transfer of those airports. |
| **Service Recognition** | Service rendered *after* the transfer date with a designated airport authority is recognized as pensionable service. |
| **Fairness in Survivor/Child Benefits** | Spouses and children who were formed after the transfer date are not automatically entitled to pension benefits unless the employee re-joined the public service. |
| **Clarity in Retirement Dates** | Retirement is tied to the transfer date, not the actual retirement date, which may simplify administrative processing. |
| **Administrative Consistency** | Aligns definitions of service, cessation, and retirement with the timing of the airport transfer. |

---

### **Limitations and Caveats**

- The Regulations **only apply to employees who make an election under paragraph 5(1)(e)** of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act*.  
- Exclusions from survivor and child benefits apply **only if the employee did not re-engage in public service contributions** after the transfer.  
- The retirement date being tied to the transfer date may lead to **disputes or confusion** in actual pension claims, especially if employees retire years later.  
- The Regulations do **not extend to other types of employees** or transfers outside the airport context.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Designated Employees Pension Protection Regulations* provide a **structured and fair framework** to protect the pension rights of employees who worked in designated airport authorities during or after a transfer. By:

- Recognizing service after the transfer date,
- Aligning retirement dates with the transfer date,
- Excluding certain spouses and children from benefits unless the employee re-joined the public service,

the Regulations balance **administrative simplicity** with **equity** in pension entitlements.
