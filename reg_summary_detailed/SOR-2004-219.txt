Certainly. Below is a **detailed and accurate summary** of the provided regulation, which appears to be an **Alberta Provincial Exemption Order** under the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*, specifically addressing the application of provincial and federal privacy laws.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Organizations in the Province of Alberta Exemption Order"**

#### **1. Background and Context**
This regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry** of the Province of Alberta. It is grounded in the **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**, which is the federal privacy law governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in the private sector across Canada.

The regulation is specifically designed to **grant exemptions** to certain organizations in Alberta from the **federal PIPEDA** provisions — particularly **Part 1** of PIPEDA — when those organizations are already subject to the **Alberta Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)**, enacted as **S.A. 2003, c. P-6.5**.

#### **2. Legal Basis**
The Order is made under **paragraph 26(2)(b) of PIPEDA**, which allows for the exemption of certain organizations from Part 1 of PIPEDA **if they are already subject to a provincial privacy law** that is "substantially similar" to Part 1 of PIPEDA.

This provision enables provincial privacy legislation to serve as a **sufficient legal basis** for organizations operating within the province to be exempt from federal privacy requirements — provided that the provincial law provides comparable protections.

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Scope of Exemption**:
  - The exemption applies to **organizations in the Province of Alberta** that are **not federal government entities**, **federal Crown corporations**, or **federal businesses**.
  - These organizations must be subject to the **Alberta Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)**, which is substantially similar to Part 1 of PIPEDA.

- **Exempt Activities**:
  - The exemption covers the **collection, use, and disclosure of personal information** that occurs **within the Province of Alberta**.
  - This means that such organizations do **not need to comply with Part 1 of PIPEDA** (which governs the privacy rights of individuals and the obligations of private-sector organizations) in respect to personal information handled in Alberta.

- **Applicability of PIPA**:
  - The Order confirms that the **Alberta Personal Information Protection Act (S.A. 2003, c. P-6.5)** applies to the described organizations.
  - The fact that PIPA is "substantially similar" to Part 1 of PIPEDA is a critical legal threshold — meaning that the protections and obligations under PIPA are considered equivalent to those under the federal law.

#### **4. Purpose and Rationale**
The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- **Avoid regulatory duplication** by ensuring that organizations operating in Alberta are governed by a single, consistent privacy framework — the provincial law (PIPA).
- Promote **simplification and compliance** for businesses and institutions that operate within Alberta, reducing the burden of complying with both federal and provincial privacy rules.
- Reflect the principle that **provincial laws should govern personal information practices within their jurisdiction**, especially when those laws are comparable in scope and strength to federal standards.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the appropriate provincial or federal authority (typically the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions or the Registrar of Regulations in Alberta).
- This date is not specified in the text, but it is standard practice for such orders to take effect upon registration.

#### **6. Implications and Significance**
- **For Organizations in Alberta**:
  - They can operate under **Alberta’s PIPA** instead of complying with both PIPA and Part 1 of PIPEDA.
  - This provides **greater certainty and operational clarity** for businesses, especially those with operations only in Alberta.
  
- **For Individuals**:
  - Individuals’ rights to privacy are protected under PIPA, which is considered equivalent to federal standards, ensuring that personal information is handled with similar safeguards.

- **For Federal and Provincial Regulatory Frameworks**:
  - This Order reinforces the **coexistence of federal and provincial privacy laws**, with provinces able to manage their own privacy regimes when they meet federal standards.
  - It also supports the **principle of jurisdictional competence** — that provincial governments have the authority to regulate personal information within their borders.

#### **7. Limitations and Exceptions**
- The exemption **does not apply to federal organizations** (e.g., federal government departments, Crown corporations, or federally funded businesses).
- The exemption is **limited to activities occurring within Alberta** — so if an organization collects or discloses personal information outside the province, federal PIPEDA may still apply.
- The exemption does **not extend to other parts of PIPEDA** (e.g., Part 2, which deals with access and correction rights, or Part 3, which covers enforcement and penalties), which may still apply depending on the context.

### **Conclusion**
This **Alberta Organizations Exemption Order** is a legally sound and operationally practical measure that:
- Exempts eligible Alberta-based private organizations from the application of **Part 1 of PIPEDA**,
- Ensures compliance with **Alberta’s PIPA**, which is deemed substantially similar to federal law,
- Reduces regulatory burden while maintaining strong privacy protections for individuals,
- Reflects the federal government’s recognition of provincial jurisdiction in privacy matters under the **principle of proportionality and jurisdictional competence**.

It serves as a key example of how **provincial privacy legislation** can function effectively within the broader Canadian privacy framework, ensuring both consistency and efficiency in privacy governance.

**Note**: The original text contains a typographical or formatting error: "PIPEDA Acta" appears to be a typo. The correct name of the federal law is the **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**. The reference to "S.C. 2000, c. 5" may be a misattribution or outdated citation — this Order is more likely a modern provincial exemption based on PIPA (S.A. 2003, c. P-6.5), not a reference to an earlier federal statute.
