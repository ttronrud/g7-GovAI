---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs** issued this General Import Permit under **subsection (1.1)a of the Export and Import Permits Act**.
- This provision allows the Minister to issue permits for the import of specific goods, particularly when such imports are governed by international trade agreements or to ensure orderly trade flows.

---

### **2. Official Publication and Date**
- **Issued on**: December 30, 1996  
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 1997 (as noted in the note: "Permit in force January 1, 1997, see SI/97-9")  
- The permit comes into force on the date that **Section 45 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 33 of the Statutes of Canada, 1996) comes into effect.

---

### **3. Definitions**
Two key definitions are provided in the permit:

#### a) **"Imported from Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary"**
- This term is defined by reference to the **Regulations Defining Certain Expressions for the Purposes of the Customs Tariff**.
- It refers to goods imported from **Israel** or any country that is a **beneficiary of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)**.
- This ensures clarity in determining the origin of the imported roses and aligns with CIFTA’s framework for tariff treatment and trade facilitation.

#### b) **"Roses"**
- Specifically means **cut roses and rose buds**, which are:
  - **Fresh**
  - **Suitable for bouquets or ornamental purposes**
- These are classified under:
  - **Tariff item No. 0603.10.11** (in the Customs Tariff), or
  - **Heading Nos. 98.04 or 98.06** in the *List of Tariff Provisions* (Schedule to the Customs Tariff)
- This precise classification ensures that only specific types of roses fall under the scope of this permit.

---

### **4. Scope of the Permit**
- **Who can import?**  
  Any **resident of Canada** may import roses under the authority of this permit.
- **From where?**  
  Roses must be imported from **Israel** or **another CIFTA beneficiary country**.
- **Conditions**:  
  The import is authorized **only under the conditions set forth in the permit**, including the annual quota limitation.

---

### **5. Accounting and Reporting Requirements**
- If the imported roses are subject to **accounting requirements** under **subsection 32(1), (3), or (5)** of the *Customs Act*, the importer must include the following statement on the prescribed form:
  - In **English**: *"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 193 — Roses"*
  - In **French**: *"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 193 — Roses"*
- This ensures transparency and traceability of goods imported under this specific permit.

---

### **6. Quota Limitation (Key Restriction)**
- The permit applies **only to roses imported and accounted for** under the Customs Act’s subsections 32(1), (3), or (5) **on or before the day** in a calendar year when the **annual quota of 90,000 dozen roses** is reached.
- This quota is tied to the **Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff**, which provides preferential tariff treatment to roses from Israel and other CIFTA beneficiaries.
- **Important**: Once the 90,000 dozen limit is reached, no further imports of roses under this permit are allowed for that year.

> Example: If the quota is reached on March 15, 1997, then imports under this permit are permitted only up to that date. Any imports after March 15, 1997, would fall outside the scope of this permit.

---

### **7. Purpose and Context**
- This permit was established to:
  - Facilitate the import of **fresh cut roses and rose buds** from Israel and other CIFTA countries.
  - Ensure that **Canada maintains a controlled, predictable, and tariff-advantaged flow** of these high-value floral products.
  - Align with the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement**, which includes provisions to promote trade in agricultural and horticultural products.
- The quota mechanism prevents over-importation and protects domestic markets or other trade interests.
