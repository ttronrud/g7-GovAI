The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-72, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2015-72**, which is a *Supplemental Order Respecting Regulations* issued in **2015**.
- **Section Responsible**: **Section 1** of that order specifically identifies the repeal of the regulation.
- **Legal Implication**: Because the regulation has been repealed, it is **no longer in force** and **does not apply** to any current legal or administrative context. Any provisions, obligations, or requirements previously established by the regulation are now void and superseded by other laws or regulations that may have been enacted in its place (if any).

### Contextual Notes:
- The repetition of the same line eight times appears to be a formatting or technical error—likely due to a data input or copying issue—rather than indicating multiple distinct regulations.
- In Canadian regulatory practice, a repeal in a Supplemental Order (SOR) is a formal mechanism by which a government (typically at the federal level) removes a regulation from the legal framework. Such actions are typically taken for reasons including:
  - Obsolescence
  - Redundancy
  - Inconsistency with newer legislation
  - Streamlining of the regulatory framework
  - Legislative modernization

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text **has been formally repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable**. It was removed from the legal system by **Section 1 of SOR/2015-72**, which came into effect in 2015. Therefore, **no further action or interpretation of this regulation is required or permitted under current law**.

> ⚠️ Important: If you are seeking information about what replaced this regulation or its original scope, additional research into the original regulation (which is now obsolete) or the subsequent legislation would be required. The current legal framework may now reference a different rule or policy in its place.
