### **Summary of the CUKTCA Rules of Origin Regulations (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1); S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- The **Rules of Origin Regulations** are made by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, based on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- This action is authorized under **paragraph 16(2)(a)a of the Customs Tariff** (a key provision of Canada’s tariff legislation), which empowers the government to establish rules governing the origin of goods for trade purposes.
- The regulation is formally established under **section 34(1)** of **S.C. 2001, c. 28**, and is supported by **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which provides foundational legal framework for rules of origin in Canadian trade law.

---

#### **2. Legal Basis of the Regulations**
These Regulations are not created independently but are **based on the Protocol on Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures** of the **Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)**, which has been **incorporated by reference** into the **Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (CUKTCA)**.

Specifically, the following provisions of the CETA Protocol have **the force of law in Canada** under the CUKTCA:

| Provision | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Articles 1 and 2** | Define the general principles of origin, including the concept of "originating goods" and the requirement that goods must meet specific criteria to be considered "originating" for tariff treatment. |
| **Paragraphs 1 to 2C and 3 of Article 3** | Establish the **rules of origin** for goods from the European Union and the United Kingdom, including the **"substantial transformation"** test and the **"value added"** criteria. These are critical for determining whether a product qualifies as originating under the agreement. |
| **Articles 4 to 17** | Cover detailed procedures and administrative rules related to origin determination, including documentation requirements, the use of origin certificates, and the responsibilities of importers and customs authorities. |
| **Annexes 1, 4, 5, 5-A, and 7** | Provide **specific, sectoral rules of origin** for key product categories such as: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Annex 1 | Rules for **textiles and apparel**. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Annex 4 | Rules for **agricultural products**. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Annex 5** | Rules for **manufactured goods** (e.g., machinery, vehicles, electronics). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Annex 5-A** | Rules for **chemicals and pharmaceuticals**. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Annex 7** | Rules for **food and beverages**. |

> These annexes provide **product-specific thresholds** (e.g., percentage of value added, number of processing stages, or local content requirements) that determine whether a good qualifies as originating under the CUKTCA.

---

#### **3. Effective Date and Implementation**
- The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 37 of the Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 2021) comes into force.
- **Section 37** governs the implementation and enforcement of the CUKTCA, including the activation of rules of origin.
- **Exception**: If the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after** the initial effective date, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely and predictable manner, with a clear transition point tied to the formal adoption of the CUKTCA in Canada.

---

#### **4. Key Implications and Purpose**
- The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish a clear, transparent, and enforceable framework** for determining whether goods are "originating" for the purposes of tariff treatment under the CUKTCA.
- This is essential for:
  - **Reducing trade barriers** between Canada and the UK (especially in the post-Brexit context).
  - **Ensuring fair and consistent application** of origin rules across industries.
  - **Supporting compliance** by businesses in preparing origin documentation and claiming preferential tariff treatment.
- The rules help **prevent fraud or misrepresentation** by requiring documented evidence of origin (e.g., origin certificates) and ensuring that goods meet specific transformation or value-added thresholds.

---

#### **5. Reference to Published Version**
- The regulations are **in force as of April 1, 2021**, as noted in **SI/2021-14** (Statutory Instrument 2021-14).
- This means that the rules were formally adopted and published in the *Canada Gazette* on or around that date, and are now legally binding.

### **Conclusion**
These **Rules of Origin Regulations** are a critical component of Canada’s trade policy with the United Kingdom under the **Trade Continuity Agreement**. They implement the **rules of origin from the CETA Protocol**, adapting them to the Canada–UK context. By defining when a good is considered "originating," the regulations ensure that Canadian and UK businesses can benefit from preferential tariff treatment, while maintaining transparency, consistency, and legal certainty in cross-border trade.

They reflect Canada’s commitment to **free, fair, and rules-based trade** with the UK, particularly in the aftermath of Brexit, and provide a clear pathway for compliance and trade facilitation.
