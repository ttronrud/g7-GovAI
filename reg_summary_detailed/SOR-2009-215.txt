**Detailed Summary of the CPFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Source and Authority**  
The *CPFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under subsection 16(2)a of the *Customs Tariff* (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)). This regulatory instrument is part of the implementation framework of the **Canada–Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)**, specifically designed to determine the origin of certain goods for tariff treatment purposes.

The regulation is referenced in the *Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act*, Chapter 16 of the Statutes of Canada, 2009 (S.C. 1997, c. 36), and came into force on the date that Section 36 of that Act became effective — **August 1, 2009** (as noted in SI/2009-67).

**Key Definitions**

- **Casual Goods**:  
  The term "casual goods" is defined as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or similar purpose**.  
  In other words, casual goods are typically goods imported for personal, non-commercial, or incidental use — such as personal use, household purposes, or temporary use — and are not intended for resale or business operations.

**Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in Peru**

For casual goods imported from Peru, the following rules determine whether they are considered to originate in Peru and thus qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the CPFTA:

1. **Marking Requirement (Positive Indication of Origin)**  
   The goods must bear a mark that:
   - Complies with Peru’s marking laws; and  
   - Clearly indicates that the goods are the product of **Peru or Canada**.

   If such a mark is present and meets the legal requirements, the goods are deemed to originate in Peru and are eligible for the reduced or preferential tariff rates under the CPFTA.

2. **Absence of Marking or Negative Indication**  
   If the goods **do not bear any mark**, or if there is **no indication** that they are not the product of Peru or Canada, they are still considered to originate in Peru.

   This provision ensures that the absence of a foreign origin label (e.g., no "Made in China" or "Not Made in Peru") does not automatically disqualify the goods from being treated as originating in Peru — provided there is no clear indication of a different country of origin.

**Purpose and Significance**

- This regulation establishes a **simplified origin rule** for casual goods — goods not intended for commercial or industrial use — to ensure that such goods can still benefit from the preferential tariff treatment under the CPFTA, even when they are not part of a formal commercial transaction.
- It reflects the practical realities of trade, where individuals or entities may import goods for personal use (e.g., for family, travel, or personal consumption) without engaging in commercial supply chains.
- The rule supports the **principle of origin** in free trade agreements: goods must demonstrate a clear link to a specific country of origin to qualify for preferential treatment.

**Effective Date**

The regulations came into force on **August 1, 2009**, coinciding with the effective date of Section 36 of the *Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act*.

---

**Conclusion**

The *CPFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a clear, accessible, and practical mechanism to determine the origin of non-commercial goods imported from Peru. By focusing on the presence or absence of marking and the intended use of the goods, the regulation ensures that casual imports — which might otherwise be excluded from preferential tariff treatment — can still benefit from the trade advantages of the Canada–Peru Free Trade Agreement. This supports fair and consistent application of origin rules while accommodating the realities of personal and non-commercial imports.

*Note: These regulations are part of a broader framework of origin rules under the CPFTA and are intended to complement other rules of origin for commercial goods, ensuring that both commercial and non-commercial imports are treated fairly and transparently.*
