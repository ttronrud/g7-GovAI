## 📊 Creditable Periods and Eligibility Rules

### 1. **Creditable Periods in Peru**
- A period of **employment or self-employment** in Peru counts as a **creditable period**.
- Includes **deemed equivalent periods** (e.g., periods recognized as contributions under certain conditions).

### 2. **Creditable Periods in Canada**
- A period of **employment or self-employment** in Peru counts as a **creditable period** under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**.
- A period of **residence in Peru** counts as a **period of residence in Canada** for **OAS eligibility**, for the person and their **spouse or common-law partner and dependants**.

> ✅ This means that someone working in Peru can build CPP credits there, which count toward Canadian pension eligibility.

### 3. **Creditable Periods in Canada for Peru’s Rules**
- A **calendar year of CPP contribution** (in Canada) counts as **12 months** of contribution in Peru.
- A **month of OAS contribution** (in Canada) that does **not overlap** with CPP credits counts as **1 month** of contribution in Peru.

> This allows individuals to build eligibility in Peru using Canadian contributions.

### 4. **Totalizing of Periods**
- If a person has **insufficient creditable periods** under one country’s rules, eligibility is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Creditable periods under Canada and Peru.
  - Creditable periods under **third countries** with which both Parties have social security agreements.
- **Maximum limit**: If total creditable periods are **less than one year**, the country will **not pay a benefit** based only on those periods.
- However, the **other country may still consider** those periods when determining eligibility.

### 5. **Eligibility for Partial Benefits**
- If eligibility is based **solely on totalizing**, Canada calculates the benefit as follows:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based on CPP pensionable earnings.
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Pro-rated using the **ratio of actual CPP contributions to the minimum qualifying period** (maximum ratio = 100%).

> Example: If someone has 12 months of CPP contributions out of a required 40, the flat-rate portion is reduced proportionally.

### 6. **Peru’s Calculation of Benefits**
- If eligibility is established **only through totalizing**, Peru:
  - Calculates the **theoretical benefit** if all periods were under Peru’s own system.
  - Applies a **ratio
