**Detailed Summary of the Offshore Area Exclusion Order (1984)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**

The **Offshore Area Exclusion Order** is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** of Canada. This action was taken in accordance with specific provisions of the **Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement on Offshore Oil and Gas Resource Management and Revenue Sharing**, specifically **subsection 6(2)** of the *An Act respecting the Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement on Offshore Oil and Gas Resource Management and Revenue Sharing*.

This provision requires that before any exclusion of offshore areas from the application of Part I of the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act, the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** must consult with the **Minister of Mines and Energy for the Province of Nova Scotia**. The Order confirms that such consultation has occurred and that the Nova Scotia Minister has **given formal approval** to the exclusion.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **exclude certain designated areas of the offshore region** from the application of **Part I of the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act**. 

Part I of the Act normally governs the **management, development, and revenue-sharing arrangements** between Canada and Nova Scotia for offshore oil and gas resources. By excluding specific areas, the Order effectively **removes the jurisdictional framework** of the Agreement from those zones, allowing for different regulatory or operational arrangements—potentially enabling provincial or private development without the constraints of federal revenue-sharing or joint management rules.

### **3. Scope of the Excluded Offshore Areas**

The exclusion applies to specific parts of the offshore area, defined using a **grid system** established in the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 1518). These areas are described in terms of **latitude ranges and compass directions (quadrants)** to precisely identify geographic boundaries.

The excluded areas are as follows:

| Description | Coordinates (Latitude Range and Quadrant) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 | 46°40′ — 61°00′ E/2 |
| 2 | 46°30′ — 61°00′ |
| 3 | 46°30′ — 61°15′ SE/4 |
| 4 | 46°20′ — 61°00′ NW/4 |
| 5 | 46°20′ — 61°15′ E/2 & SW/4 |
| 6 | 46°10′ — 61°15′ W/2 |
| 7 | 46°10′ — 61°30′ SE/4 |
| 8 | 46°10′ — 64°00′ SE/4 |
| 9 | 46°00′ — 61°30′ E/2 |
| 10 | 46°00′ — 61°45′ SW/4 |
| 11 | 46°00′ — 63°30′ S/2 |
| 12 | 46°00′ — 63°45′ |
| 13 | 45°50′ — 62°00′ SW/4 |
| 14 | 45°50′ — 62°15′ S/2 |
| 15 | 45°50′ — 62°30′ |
| 16 | 45°50′ — 62°45′ |
| 17 | 45°50′ — 63°00′ |
| 18 | 45°50′ — 63°15′ NE/4 |

> **Note**: The coordinates are based on a **grid system** where:
> - Latitude ranges are expressed in degrees and minutes (e.g., 46°40′ means 46 degrees and 40 minutes).
> - The directional quadrants (e.g., E/2, SE/4, SW/4) indicate specific sectors of a grid cell, dividing the ocean floor into four or two parts.
> - The system allows for precise mapping of offshore zones, particularly in the Atlantic region near Nova Scotia.

### **4. Legal Effect of the Exclusion**

By declaring that **Part I of the Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act does not apply**, the Order means that:
- The **federal revenue-sharing obligations** under the Agreement are **not triggered** in these zones.
- The **joint management regime** between Canada and Nova Scotia (including decision-making, environmental oversight, and resource allocation) **does not apply**.
- The **provincial government of Nova Scotia** may manage or allow exploration and development activities in these areas **independently**, without requiring federal consent or revenue-sharing agreements.
- The **federal government is not responsible** for revenue collection or regulatory oversight in these excluded areas.

This provides **greater flexibility** for Nova Scotia to pursue energy development in specific offshore zones without being bound by the shared governance and revenue-sharing framework of the broader Agreement.

---

### **5. Consultation and Approval Process**

This Order is grounded in the requirement for **intergovernmental consultation** under subsection 6(2) of the Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement. The process includes:
- The **federal Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** initiating the proposal.
- **Consultation with the Nova Scotia Minister of Mines and Energy**, who has the authority to approve or reject the exclusion.
- The **Nova Scotia Minister's formal approval** being a prerequisite for the Order to be valid and enforceable.

This ensures that the exclusion is not unilateral and respects **provincial interests and jurisdiction** over their offshore resources.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The Order **came into force on July 28, 1984**. This date marks the point at which the exclusion becomes legally effective and begins to apply to the specified offshore areas.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**

- **Provincial Autonomy**: The Order enhances Nova Scotia’s ability to manage its offshore resources independently, promoting local economic development and control over energy policy.
- **Resource Development**: It may facilitate private or provincial-led exploration and development in these areas, potentially accelerating investment in oil and gas.
- **Revenue Implications**: Canada does not receive revenue-sharing from these zones, which may impact federal revenue from offshore resources.
- **Environmental and Regulatory Considerations**: Since Part I of the Act typically includes environmental and operational standards, the exclusion may result in **different environmental oversight** in these areas—potentially raising concerns about long-term ecological management.

---

### **8. Citation and Legal Status**

The Order is officially cited as:
> **The Offshore Area Exclusion Order, 1984**

It is part of **Chapter 29 of the Statutes of Canada 1984**, and forms a **related and consequential amendment** to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Oil and Gas Agreement Act*, reflecting the evolving nature of offshore resource governance between federal and provincial governments.

### **Conclusion**

The **Offshore Area Exclusion Order of 1984** is a significant regulatory decision that **exempts specific offshore zones off the coast of Nova Scotia** from the federal-provincial resource-sharing framework established under the Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement. By doing so, it grants Nova Scotia greater autonomy in managing and developing its offshore oil and gas resources, subject to provincial oversight and compliance with other applicable laws. The Order underscores the balance between federal coordination and provincial self-governance in shared natural resource management.
