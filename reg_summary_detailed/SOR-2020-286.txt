**Detailed Summary of the Canada – European Union Tariff Withdrawal Order (United Kingdom)**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
This regulation, formally known as the *Canada – European Union Tariff Withdrawal Order (United Kingdom)*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to **withdraw the entitlement of goods originating in the United Kingdom (UK) to the preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)**.

The decision was made in response to the **UK’s departure from the European Union (Brexit)**, which fundamentally altered the UK’s status as a member of the EU and, consequently, its eligibility for the preferential tariff benefits previously granted under CETA.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**
The Order is enacted under **paragraph 49.91(1)(b)a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2017, c. 6, s. 97; S.C. 1997, c. 36). This provision allows the Government of Canada to withdraw tariff benefits from certain countries or regions if they are no longer eligible or if their status changes—such as due to political or economic shifts like Brexit.

### **3. Scope of the Withdrawal**
- **Goods in question**: All goods that originate in the United Kingdom are **no longer entitled** to the preferential tariff treatment under CETA.
- **Definition of "United Kingdom" in this Order**:
  - Includes:  
    - The **United Kingdom** (as a sovereign state)
    - The **Channel Islands** (Jersey and Guernsey)
    - **Gibraltar**
    - **Isle of Man**
  - **Excludes**:
    - Anguilla  
    - British Antarctic Territory  
    - British Indian Ocean Territory  
    - Bermuda  
    - British Virgin Islands  
    - Cayman Islands  
    - Falkland Islands  
    - Montserrat  
    - Pitcairn  
    - Saint Helena and its Dependencies (Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha)  
    - South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands  
    - Turks and Caicos Islands  

> *Note*: This exclusion ensures that only the UK and its associated Crown Dependencies are treated as "UK" for the purposes of this tariff withdrawal. Other British territories are not considered part of the UK in this context and are not affected by this Order.

### **4. Impact on Trade**
- **Loss of preferential tariff treatment**: Goods originating in the UK will now be subject to **standard Canadian tariff rates** (i.e., non-preferential duties) when imported into Canada, unless otherwise exempted under other provisions of the Customs Tariff.
- This means that UK-origin goods will generally face **higher duties and potential trade barriers** compared to goods from EU member states, which continue to benefit from CETA’s tariff reductions.

---

### **5. Exception – Transit Goods**
- **Section 2 of the Order does not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada on or before January 1, 2021**.
- This provision provides **protection for existing shipments** that were already in the process of being transported into Canada prior to the effective date of the Order.
- These goods may still benefit from the original tariff treatment under CETA, even after the withdrawal, as long as they were in transit before the cutoff date.

> This exception ensures **trade continuity** and avoids penalties or disruptions for goods already en route, minimizing economic disruption during the transition period.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on January 1, 2021**.
- This date marks the official start of the withdrawal of tariff benefits for UK-origin goods under CETA.

---

### **7. Key Implications**
- **Economic impact**: Canadian importers and businesses that previously benefited from lower tariffs on UK goods now face increased costs, potentially affecting competitiveness and pricing.
- **Trade policy shift**: Canada’s policy reflects the broader geopolitical and trade realignment following Brexit, emphasizing that only EU member states (and certain other designated partners) remain eligible for CETA benefits.
- **Clarity in trade rules**: The regulation provides clear legal and administrative boundaries regarding which territories are included or excluded from CETA benefits, reducing ambiguity in customs classification and compliance.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Canada – European Union Tariff Withdrawal Order (United Kingdom)* is a direct result of the UK’s exit from the EU. It legally removes the UK’s entitlement to preferential tariff treatment under CETA, effective January 1, 2021. While it applies to all goods originating in the UK (including Crown Dependencies), it includes an important exception for goods in transit before that date. This regulation ensures Canada maintains consistent and transparent trade policy in light of changing international trade relationships.
