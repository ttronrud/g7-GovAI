The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain regulatory provisions under the **Statutory Instrument (SOR) /2008-141, section 141**, and one additional reference to **SOR/96-307, section 8**.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Repeal of Provisions under SOR/2008-141, s. 141**
- The repeated entries indicate that **multiple provisions** (likely specific rules, definitions, or requirements) were **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **section 141 of Statutory Instrument No. 2008-141**.
- SOR/2008-141 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued in Canada (specifically under the *Regulations of the Government of Canada*), and section 141 was enacted to **remove or revoke** certain outdated, redundant, or obsolete regulations.
- The fact that this section is cited **over 100 times** suggests that it was used to repeal a **large number of provisions** across various parts of the regulation or in multiple related regulations. This could reflect a comprehensive regulatory modernization or consolidation effort.
- These repealed provisions were likely related to **public health, safety, environmental protection, or administrative procedures**, depending on the original context of the regulation being amended or replaced.

#### 2. **Repeal of SOR/96-307, s. 8**
- This entry indicates that **Section 8 of Statutory Instrument No. 96-307** was also **repealed**, likely as part of a broader regulatory review or consolidation.
- SOR/96-307 is a historical regulation, likely from the 1990s, and its section 8 may have dealt with specific administrative or procedural requirements (e.g., licensing, reporting, or compliance).
- The repeal of this section suggests that the government determined that the provision was **no longer necessary, inconsistent with current law, or superseded by newer legislation**.

#### 3. **Implications of Repeal**
- **Legal Effect**: Once a regulation is repealed, it is **no longer enforceable**. Any legal obligations, penalties, or procedural requirements tied to the repealed section are **void**.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Repeals help simplify the regulatory landscape by removing outdated or overlapping rules, making it easier for individuals, businesses, and regulators to understand current obligations.
- **Policy Evolution**: The repeal likely reflects a shift in policy, technological advancement, or changes in governance priorities (e.g., environmental standards, health protocols, or administrative efficiency).

#### 4. **Contextual Notes**
- The repetition of the same repeal notice does not imply that the regulation itself is still active or that the repeal was applied to multiple different rules — rather, it reflects how such repeals are **listed or referenced** in official legal databases or legislative summaries.
- Without the original regulation or the full text of the provisions being repealed, it is not possible to identify the **specific content** of the repealed rules (e.g., what they governed or how they were applied).
- This summary is based solely on the **metadata** of the repeal notices, not on the actual text of the original regulations.

### Conclusion:

The provided text is a **list of repeals**, indicating that **a large number of regulatory provisions** were formally canceled by **section 141 of SOR/2008-141**, and **one provision (section 8 of SOR/96-307)** was also repealed. These actions were part of a **regulatory modernization effort** aimed at streamlining laws, removing outdated requirements, and aligning regulations with current policy and administrative needs. However, **no specific content of the repealed rules is provided** in this text, and the detailed substance of the original regulations must be consulted in official legal databases or legislative records.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Since the regulation itself has been repealed, it is **no longer in force** and should not be used as a source of current legal obligations. Any current compliance or legal interpretation must be based on **current, active regulations**.
