### **Detailed Summary of the Black Lake First Nation Water Power Regulations (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 63)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legislative Authority**

The **Black Lake First Nation Water Power Regulations** were enacted under the authority of two key federal statutes:

- The **First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act (FN-CIDA)**, particularly **paragraph 5(1)(a)** and **5(1)(b)**.
- Section **3b** of the FN-CIDA and **paragraph 15(d)** of the **Dominion Water Power Act**.

These provisions allow the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND) to recommend to the Governor in Council the creation of regulations that apply federal law to a specific First Nation project — in this case, a hydroelectric development — within the limits of federal constitutional authority.

The regulations were adopted in response to a **formal resolution by the Black Lake First Nation Council**, requesting that the federal government recommend the creation of such regulations to govern the development and operation of a hydroelectric project on its lands.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of the regulations is to:

- Apply **Saskatchewan laws** (specifically those listed in Schedule 2) as **federal law** to the project, within the scope of federal constitutional authority.
- Establish a clear legal framework for the **construction, modification, operation, decommissioning, reclamation, and abandonment** of hydroelectric facilities on the Black Lake First Nation’s lands.
- Ensure that **provincial authorities** (e.g., Saskatchewan government agencies) have the legal power and responsibility to enforce these laws in relation to the project.
- Provide a mechanism for **cooperative governance** between the First Nation, the Province of Saskatchewan, and the federal government.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Incorporated laws** | Refers to specific Saskatchewan statutes and regulations listed in Schedule 2, as amended and adapted by the regulations. |
| **Project** | Includes all stages of the hydroelectric project: construction, operation, decommissioning, reclamation, abandonment, and electricity generation on designated lands. |
| **Project lands** | Specifically defined as the lands of the Black Lake First Nation’s **Chicken Reserve No. 224**, as set out in **Schedule 1** of the regulations. |

> The project lands are depicted as **Surface Zone A** on **Administrative Area Plan 104899**, filed in the Canada Lands Surveys Records.

---

#### **4. Application of Saskatchewan Laws**

- The **incorporated laws** are to be interpreted in accordance with the **Saskatchewan Interpretation Act, 1995**, as amended.
- References to "enactment" in that Act include the incorporated laws.
- Adaptations made by the regulations (sections 13–34) are **integrated into the incorporated laws** and form part of their legal effect.

> **Key Principle**: The incorporated laws apply **only to the extent they fall within federal constitutional authority**.

---

#### **5. Enforcement and Jurisdictional Rules**

The regulations specify that:

- **Enforcement**, **prosecution of offences**, **appeals**, and **service of legal documents** must follow **Saskatchewan law**, even if those laws are not explicitly listed in Schedule 2.
- A person or body with a power, duty, or function under Saskatchewan law **retains that same function** under the regulations, **subject to adaptations** made by the regulations.

> This ensures continuity of legal processes while adapting them to the unique context of the project.

---

#### **6. Offences and Penalties**

- If a Saskatchewan law incorporated in these regulations constitutes an **offence**, then contravention of the incorporated law is also an **offence**, subject to **the same penalties**.
- If it constitutes a **violation**, then contravention is also a violation, subject to **the same administrative monetary penalties**.

> This ensures that violations are treated consistently under provincial law.

---

#### **7. Financial and Revenue Provisions**

- **Water rentals** (from the *Water Power Rental Regulations*) are split equally:
  - **50% to the Water Security Agency** (or its successor),
  - **50% to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- The **50% paid to Her Majesty in right of Canada is designated for the use and benefit of the Black Lake First Nation**.
- Payments to Her Majesty in right of Canada must be **remitted to the Receiver General of Canada** and are **for the benefit of the First Nation**.

> This establishes a financial mechanism that ensures the First Nation receives direct benefit from the project.

---

#### **8. Exclusions from Other Laws**

The following **federal and provincial laws do not apply** to the project:

- The **Dominion Water Power Regulations**
- The **Indian Reserve Waste Disposal Regulations**
- The **Indian Timber Regulations**

This exclusion ensures that the project operates under a tailored, simplified regulatory regime focused on water power.

---

#### **9. Leases, Permits, and Easements**

- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** may issue **leases, permits, or easements** for the purpose of carrying out the project.

> This grants the federal government flexibility in managing access and rights to the project lands.

---

#### **10. Adaptations to Saskatchewan Laws (Sections 13–34)**

These sections contain **specific modifications** to Saskatchewan laws to ensure they are appropriately applied to the project. Key adaptations include:

| Adaptation | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **"Crown" does not include Her Majesty in right of Canada** | Clarifies that federal Crown (Canada) is distinct from the provincial Crown. |
| **"Crown lands" and "Crown mineral lands" do not include project lands** | The project lands are not considered Crown lands for purposes of mineral rights or land disposition. |
| **"Crown disposition" excludes dispositions by Her Majesty in right of Canada** | Prevents federal dispositions from being treated as Crown dispositions. |
| **Exclusions from certain provisions** | The regulations omit or exclude provisions related to: <br> - spent provisions <br> - appointments and remuneration <br> - internal management of provincial bodies <br> - spending from general revenue funds <br> - expropriation powers <br> - taxation or tax credits |

> These exclusions prevent the application of laws that would interfere with First Nation sovereignty or financial independence.
