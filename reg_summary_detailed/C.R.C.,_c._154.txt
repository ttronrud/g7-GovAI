**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Hog Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Manitoba Hog Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal instrument under the *Natural Products Marketing Act* of Manitoba, establishing specific rules and powers related to the marketing of hogs in the province.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act* of Manitoba, specifically *C.C.S.M. c. N20* (Loi). This is the foundational legislation that provides the legal authority for the regulation of hogs and other natural products.  
- **"Commodity Board"**: This entity has been **repealed** by *SOR/97-422, section 1*. Therefore, it no longer exists or holds any legal authority under this Order.  
- **"Hog"**: Defined as a member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig), regardless of breed, grade, or class. This broad definition ensures that all types of domestic pigs are included under the regulation.  
- **"Plan"**: Refers to any marketing plan for hogs established and amended over time in accordance with the *Natural Products Marketing Act*. The Plan sets out the framework for how hogs are marketed, including pricing, distribution, and market access.  
- **"Producer Board"**: Refers to the *Manitoba Pork Est.* (Manitoba Pork Marketing Association), which has been formally continued and authorized under subsection 3(1) of the *Manitoba Hog Producers’ Marketing Plan Regulation*. It functions as the governing body responsible for overseeing hog marketing activities.

**3. Authority of the Producer Board**  

The Producer Board is granted **significant regulatory authority** over the marketing of hogs, both within Manitoba and in interprovincial and export markets. Specifically:

- It may **exercise all or any powers** granted to it under the *Act* and the *Plan*—but now extended to **interprovincial and export trade**.  
- This includes the power to regulate pricing, market access, and other marketing-related activities involving hogs sold outside Manitoba or to foreign buyers.

---

**4. Power to Impose Levies and Charges**  

The Producer Board is authorized to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of hogs**.  
- These levies or charges may be **classified into different groups** of producers or marketers.  
- Each group may be assigned a **different amount** of levy or charge based on factors such as production volume, market role, or other relevant criteria.  

For example:
- A small-scale farmer might pay a lower levy than a large commercial hog producer.
- A producer involved in export may pay a different rate than one selling locally.

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., financial buffers to manage market fluctuations).  
- **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., unsold stock, price drops, or market downturns).  
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among hog producers.  
  - This ensures that producers who experience poor market conditions (e.g., low prices) are compensated, while those who benefit from high prices may contribute to a shared pool.  
  - The goal is to **promote fairness and stability** in income distribution across the hog industry.

---

**6. Time Periods and Flexibility**  

The Producer Board has discretion over:
- The **duration** of the levies or charges (e.g., for a specific year or season).  
- The **periods of time** during which equalization or adjustments are applied.  
This flexibility allows the Board to respond to changing market conditions and economic cycles.

---

**7. Legal and Regulatory Context**  

This Order operates within the broader framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act*, which empowers producer organizations to manage the marketing of agricultural commodities. The Manitoba Hog Order specifically tailors these powers to the hog industry, ensuring that producers are protected from market volatility and that the industry remains financially sustainable.

---

**Key Objectives of the Order**  

1. **Stabilize market conditions** by managing pricing and supply.  
2. **Ensure fair distribution of income** among hog producers, especially during market downturns.  
3. **Support the long-term viability** of the hog industry through financial planning and risk mitigation.  
4. **Enable effective interprovincial and export marketing** through coordinated regulatory oversight.

---

**Conclusion**  

The *Manitoba Hog Order* establishes a robust regulatory framework that empowers the Manitoba Pork Est. (Producer Board) to manage the marketing of hogs beyond provincial borders. By allowing the Board to impose tiered levies, collect funds, and use those funds for financial stability and income equalization, the Order promotes equity, resilience, and sustainable growth within Manitoba’s hog sector. It reflects a practical approach to balancing market efficiency with producer protection in a volatile agricultural environment.  

> ⚠️ Note: The repeal of the Commodity Board indicates a shift in governance structure, with authority now centralized in the Producer Board, which operates under the Act and the Plan.
