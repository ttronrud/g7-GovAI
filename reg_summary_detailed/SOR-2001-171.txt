## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations**

### 📌 **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were made under the authority of the *Excise Tax Act* (ETA), specifically through a combination of provisions in Sections 225.2(1)(d)a, 225.2(2) (descriptions of A, Ca, F, Ga), 228(2.2)b, 237(5)(b)(ii), 277d, 363(2)(a)(ii), (b), (c)(ii), and (d). The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, enacted these rules to establish an **attribution method for determining the GST/HST liability of selected listed financial institutions**.

The primary objective is to **ensure that the appropriate provincial and federal tax is applied to transactions involving financial institutions** that are publicly traded or listed on stock exchanges — particularly those that are subject to the GST/HST regime.

These regulations are part of the broader framework governing **tax attribution in the financial services sector**, ensuring that where a financial institution has a "permanent establishment" or engages in activities in a province, the GST/HST liability is appropriately attributed to that jurisdiction.
