Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, key provisions, legal basis, and implications.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **Regulatory Text Overview**
The regulation, issued on **May 12, 2010**, in Ottawa, amends the application of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to certain **student employment programs** within the Canadian federal public service. It consists of two main components:

1. **Re-application of the PSEA to previously excluded persons and positions**  
2. **Exclusion of specific provisions of the PSEA from applying to participants in designated student employment programs**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **Section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act**, and is approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.

---

### **Background and Context**

- In **1997**, the Public Service Commission (PSC) issued **Order in Council P.C. 1997-488** (and subsequent regulation SOR/97-194), which **excluded certain provisions of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** from applying to participants in student employment programs such as:
  - Federal Student Work Experience Program  
  - Research Affiliate Program  
  - Post-Secondary Co-op/Internship Program  
  - Any other student employment program established by the Treasury Board after consultation with the PSC

- The rationale for this exclusion was that it was **neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service** to apply full PSEA provisions (such as those related to hiring, employment terms, and protections) to student participants during their training or work experience.

- However, by **2010**, the PSC re-evaluated the situation and concluded that:
  - The original exclusion was no longer sustainable.
  - Applying the PSEA to student participants during hiring and employment **was now both practicable and in the public interest** — particularly in ensuring consistent standards, fair treatment, and accountability in public service hiring.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### **1. Re-Application of the PSEA**
> The Public Service Commission is authorized to **re-apply the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act** to individuals and positions that were previously excluded under Order in Council P.C. 1997-488.

- This means that **student participants in these programs are now subject to the full scope of the PSEA**, including:
  - Employment standards
  - Hiring procedures
  - Contractual obligations
  - Performance management
  - Termination rules
  - Disciplinary processes

- This re-application applies to **all student employment programs** established by the Treasury Board, provided they have consulted with the Public Service Commission.

> *Note:* This re-application is conditional and limited in scope — it does **not** apply to all provisions of the Act.

---

#### **2. Exclusion of Specific Provisions of the PSEA**
Despite the re-application, the regulation **excludes certain sections of the PSEA** from applying to student participants during hiring and employment.

These **excluded sections** are:
- **Section 2** (General provisions — applies only to certain matters)
- **Subsections 15(1) and (2)** (related to probationary periods and employment terms — partially retained)
- **Sections 16 to 21** (related to employment conditions, such as working hours, leave, and benefits)
- **Section 24** (on disciplinary procedures)
- **Section 25** (on termination)
- **Section 29** (on appeals)
- **Section 34** (on internal transfers)
- **Section 54** (on pay scales)
- **Section 55** (on salary review)
- **Sections 66 to 72** (on promotion and career development)
- **Sections 111 to 122** (on training, development, and education)
- **Sections 134 and 135** (on reporting and accountability)

> ⚠️ **Important**: The exclusion means that **student participants are not subject to these specific sections** during their employment under student programs.

---

### **Scope of Application**

The regulation applies to:
- Participants in the following programs:
  - Federal Student Work Experience Program  
  - Research Affiliate Program  
  - Post-Secondary Co-op/Internship Program  
  - Any other student employment program established by the Treasury Board **after consultation with the Public Service Commission**

- The application is limited to:
  - The **hiring process**
  - The **course of employment** under the program

> It does **not** extend to:
> - Permanent positions  
> - Long-term or full-time employment beyond the duration of the program  
> - Employment outside of the student program framework

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act** grants the Public Service Commission the power to:
  - Determine whether the Act applies to certain persons or positions
  - Make orders to exclude or re-apply provisions of the Act

- The regulation is **approved by the Governor in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**, confirming its legitimacy and alignment with federal policy.

- The **consultation requirement** with the Treasury Board ensures that any student employment program subject to this regulation has been reviewed and approved for consistency with public service standards.

---

### **Rationale and Intent**

The regulation reflects a **shift in policy** from a "flexible, program-specific" approach to a more **standardized, equitable, and accountable** model for student employment in the public service.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Ensure Fairness and Equity**: Students should be treated fairly under the same employment standards as other public servants.
2. **Improve Accountability**: Clear application of employment rules supports transparency and consistency in hiring and performance management.
3. **Support Training and Development**: By applying relevant provisions (e.g., performance reviews, reporting), students gain valuable experience in public service operations.
4. **Maintain Public Service Integrity**: Ensures that student participants do not receive preferential treatment or benefits not available to regular employees.

### **Implications**

| Area | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **Hiring Process** | Students must now go through formal hiring procedures (e.g., job postings, applications, interviews) consistent with PSEA standards. |
| **Employment Terms** | Students are subject to employment contracts, probationary periods, and performance evaluations — though not all PSEA sections apply. |
| **Benefits and Leave** | Excluded sections (e.g., sections 16–21) mean students do **not** receive standard benefits like vacation pay, sick leave, or pensions. |
| **Disciplinary Procedures** | Students are not subject to full disciplinary rules (e.g., section 24), but may still be held accountable under program-specific guidelines. |
| **Career Development** | While sections 66–72 and 111–122 are excluded, some training and development elements may still apply. |

---

### **Conclusion**

This 2010 regulation represents a **significant policy evolution** in how the Canadian federal government manages student employment in the public service. It:

- **Reinstates the full application of the PSEA** to student participants, recognizing their role as part of the public service workforce.
- **Retains flexibility** by excluding certain provisions that are not appropriate or practical for temporary, training-based roles.
- Balances **public service standards** with the **educational and developmental goals** of student programs.

It underscores the importance of **consultation, equity, and accountability** in public employment practices, while respecting the unique nature of student participation.
