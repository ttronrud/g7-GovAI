- **Order in Council P.C. 1995-698**, dated April 26, 1995

### **2. Scope of "Pardon Services"**

The Order defines *pardon services* broadly to include all activities and processes involved in evaluating and processing applications for pardons or record suspensions. Specifically, this includes:

1. **Eligibility Inquiries**  
   - Determining whether an applicant meets the legal requirements to apply for a pardon or record suspension.

2. **Conduct Reviews**  
   - Investigating the applicant’s behavior and conduct since their most recent conviction, if necessary.

3. **Disrepute Assessments**  
   - Evaluating any factors that the Parole Board of Canada (PBC) may consider to determine whether granting a pardon or ordering a record suspension would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

4. **Decision-Making Processes**  
   - The internal procedures, reasoning, and deliberations undertaken by the Parole Board in making decisions.

5. **Granting or Refusing Pardons or Record Suspensions**  
   - The actual decision to grant or deny a pardon or to order or refuse a record suspension.

6. **Notifications and Record Management**  
   - Notifying the applicant of the decision.  
   - Informing relevant organizations (e.g., employers, educational institutions, or government bodies) that have files or information related to the conviction.  
   - Maintaining separate and confidential records for each application, ensuring that information is not shared beyond what is necessary.

This comprehensive definition ensures that the fee covers the full range of administrative, investigative, and decisional services provided by the Parole Board.
