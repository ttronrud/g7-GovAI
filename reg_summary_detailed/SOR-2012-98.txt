### **Detailed Summary of the Cape Dorset Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Cape Dorset Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the *Aeronautics Act* (R.S., c. A-2) to ensure the safe operation of Cape Dorset Airport in Nunavut by preventing developments or land uses that could interfere with aviation safety, communications, or aircraft operations.

---

## **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulations were made pursuant to **subsection 5.5(1)a** of the *Aeronautics Act* and **paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a** of the same Act.  
  These provisions allow the Minister of Transport to establish zoning regulations for airports to protect aviation safety and operational integrity.

- **Notice and Public Participation**:  
  A notice of the proposed regulations was published in two successive issues of the *Nunatsiaq News* on **February 10 and 17, 2012**, and a copy was published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 19 and March 26, 2011**.  
  This provided a reasonable opportunity for interested parties (e.g., local communities, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

- **Final Adoption**:  
  Based on the recommendations of the Minister of Transport, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** formally enacted the regulations.

## **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives are to:

1. **Prevent incompatible land use or development** near the airport that could compromise the safe operation of aircraft.
2. **Prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems) that are essential for aircraft takeoff, landing, and flight control.
3. **Protect aviation safety** by minimizing hazards such as wildlife (especially birds) that could pose a risk during flight operations.

## **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Cape Dorset Airport, located in the vicinity of Cape Dorset, Nunavut. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | The geometric center of the runway thresholds at coordinates **7,123,555.931 N, 426,034.620 E** (latitude 64°13′49″ N, longitude 76°31′30″ W). It lies on the centerline of the strip surface, 668.70 meters from the end of runway 13–31. Elevation: **46.72 m above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface extending from each end of the runway (runway approaches 13 and 31). It ascends at a **1:30 slope** (1 meter vertically for every 30 meters horizontally). It extends 2,500 meters from the runway end, forming a horizontal line 295 meters from the runway centerline and 83.33 meters above the base elevation. |
| **Outer Surface** | A circular imaginary surface extending **4,000 meters** from the airport reference point. It maintains a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, but is capped at **9 meters above ground level** if that would place it below 9 meters. This ensures no structures or growths penetrate below safe thresholds. |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary rectangular surface associated with the runway. For runway 13–31: <br> - Total width: **90 meters** (45 meters on each side of centerline) <br> - Length: **1,337.40 meters** (from 60 meters northwest of threshold 13 to 60 meters southeast of threshold 31) <br> - Elevation varies between ends: 46.57 m (end 13), 42.26 m (end 31) <br> - Centerline azimuth: **S 51°10′07″ E** <br> - Threshold coordinates: 13 = (7,123,937.47 N, 425,560.61 E); 31 = (7,123,174.39 N, 426,508.63 E) |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip surface and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it meets the outer surface. |
| **Zoning Plan** | **Plan No. E 3263**, prepared by the Department of Public Works and Government Services and dated **December 1, 2008**, which serves as the foundational map for defining all surfaces and boundaries. |

## **4. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Cape Dorset Airport** within a **circular boundary of 4,000 meters** centered on the Airport Reference Point.
- This includes:
  - Land **under water**
  - Public road allowances
- The area is defined geometrically using grid coordinates and elevation data based on standardized geodetic systems.

> **Note on Coordinates and Elevation**:
> - All grid coordinates are in **metres (m)** using the **1983 North American Datum, Zone 18 UTM projection**, with a combined average scale factor of **0.9996563**.
> - All elevations are referenced to the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum (CGVD28)**.

## **5. Prohibited Activities and Developments**

### **(a) Construction or Placement of Structures**
No person may:
- Place, erect, construct, or permit another to do so on any land within the zone:
  - A **building, structure, or object** whose part **penetrates** any of the following surfaces:
    - Approach surface
    - Outer surface
    - Transitional surface

> This means no buildings, towers, trees, or other physical features can extend beyond these defined imaginary surfaces.

### **(b) Use or Development Causing Signal Interference**
No person may:
- Use or develop any land **under the outer surface** in a way that causes **interference with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical facilities (e.g., radar, radio towers, navigation beacons)

> This protects critical communication infrastructure used for flight safety.

### **(c) Growth of Natural Objects**
No person may:
- Permit **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to grow in a way that **penetrates**:
  - Approach surface
  - Outer surface
  - Transitional surface

> This prevents overgrowth that could block visibility or create hazards during approach and landing.

### **(d) Wildlife Attraction**
No person may:
- Use or permit use of any land for activities that **attract wildlife**, especially **birds**, which could pose a direct hazard to aircraft (e.g., feeding, open fields, uncontrolled land use).

> This is a key measure to reduce bird strikes — a known aviation hazard.

---

## **6. Exceptions and Permissible Uses**

Despite the above restrictions, the following **exceptions** are allowed:

- A person may use or permit use of the land as a **site for an open water storage reservoir** (e.g., for water supply or emergency use), **for a period of no more than 48 hours**.

> This exception is intended to allow temporary, low-impact water storage without violating the core safety provisions.

---

## **7. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day when the requirements under **subsection 5.6(2)** of the *Aeronautics Act* are satisfied.  
  (This typically involves a formal review or certification process by Transport Canada, ensuring compliance with procedural and legal standards.)

> **Note**: The regulations were in force as of **April 2, 2013**.
