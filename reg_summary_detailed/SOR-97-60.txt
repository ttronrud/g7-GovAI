**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Specifying Limits on the Annual Aggregate Quantity of Goods of Tariff Item No. 0603.10.21 Entitled to the Benefit of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Tariff

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under **section 58.3a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended), pursuant to the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** and by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**. This means the government, acting on advice from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has formally enacted the order through a statutory instrument.

**Governing Act:**  
The regulation is part of the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act**, specifically **S.C. 1996, c. 33**, and is governed by **section 45** of that Act. This section authorizes the setting of quantitative limits on goods eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA).

**Key Provision:**  
The regulation imposes an **annual aggregate quantity limit** on **roses** (specifically, those classified under **Tariff Item No. 0603.10.11**) that are entitled to the benefits of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement tariff.

- **Tariff Item:** 0603.10.11  
  This is a specific classification under the Harmonized System (HS) for **fresh roses** (or cut roses), which are subject to preferential tariff treatment under the CIFTA.

- **Quantity Limit:**  
  The total quantity of roses (in **dozen**) that can be imported into Canada under the CIFTA tariff benefit is **90,000 dozen per calendar year**.  
  This is a **cumulative limit** — meaning the total amount of roses from Israel that qualify for the preferential tariff across all importers and shipments during the year cannot exceed this amount.

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on the day that **section 45 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (S.C. 1996, c. 33) comes into force.  
This date is **January 1, 1997**, as noted in the note at the end of the regulation.  
Thus, the 90,000 dozen annual limit began on **January 1, 1997**, and applies to all imports of roses under tariff item 0603.10.11 from Israel that are eligible for CIFTA tariff benefits.

**Purpose and Context:**  
The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that the benefits of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement — which includes reduced or eliminated tariffs on certain goods — are applied in a **fair and sustainable manner**. While the agreement aims to promote trade and economic cooperation, it also includes **quantitative restrictions** to prevent market distortion, protect domestic industries, or manage supply levels (e.g., in the case of a highly valued, seasonal product like roses).

In this case, the limit on roses reflects a balance between facilitating trade with Israel and ensuring that Canadian consumers and domestic producers are not adversely affected by an influx of imported roses beyond manageable levels.

**Note on Legal Status:**  
This regulation is a **Statutory Instrument (SI)** — a form of secondary legislation used to implement primary legislation. It is referenced as **SI/97-9**, confirming its official publication and legal validity.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a clear, enforceable cap of **90,000 dozen roses (approximately 750,000 individual roses)** per calendar year that can be imported into Canada under the preferential tariff terms of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement. It ensures that the agreement’s benefits are applied within defined boundaries and remains in line with Canada’s broader trade policy objectives of fairness, competitiveness, and economic stability.
