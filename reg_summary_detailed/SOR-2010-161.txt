**Offences Classified as Serious Offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA):**

Although the *CDSA* is a separate act, these offences are included in the definition of "serious offence" under subsection **467.1(1)** of the *Criminal Code* due to their severity and public health implications. This linkage allows the *Criminal Code* to apply enhanced sentencing provisions to these drug-related crimes.

The following CDSA offences are designated as serious offences:

1. **Trafficking in Any Substance Included in Schedule IV**  
   - **Legal Basis**: Paragraph 5(3)(c) of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*  
   - **Description**: The illegal distribution, sale, or transport of substances listed in Schedule IV (which includes highly addictive and dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine, fentanyl, and certain synthetic stimulants).  
   - **Significance**: Schedule IV substances are considered high-risk due to their potential for abuse, addiction, and public health crises.

2. **Trafficking in Any Substance Included in Schedule II in an Amount That Does Not Exceed the Amount Set Out in Schedule VII**  
   - **Legal Basis**: Subsection 5(4) of the *CDSA*  
   - **Description**: This applies even to relatively small quantities of Schedule II substances (such as heroin, cocaine, or morphine), as long as the amount does not exceed the quantity specified in Schedule VII.  
   - **Note**: This is unusual because typically, trafficking in small amounts may not be considered serious. However, the inclusion here reflects the severity of trafficking in controlled substances, even at lower volumes.  
   - **Significance**: Demonstrates a broad interpretation of seriousness in drug trafficking, aiming to deter even minor trafficking activities.

3. **Importing or Exporting Any Substance Included in Schedule IV or V**  
   - **Legal Basis**: Paragraph 6(3)(c) of the *CDSA*  
   - **Description**: The unauthorized entry or exit of controlled substances from or into Canada, including substances in Schedules IV and V (which include substances like opioids, sedatives, and stimulants).  
   - **Significance**: Cross-border trafficking is considered a serious threat to public safety and national security.

4. **Producing Any Substance Included in Schedule IV**  
   - **Legal Basis**: Paragraph 7(2)(d) of the *CDSA*  
   - **Description**: The unlawful manufacturing or synthesis of a Schedule IV substance.  
   - **Significance**: Production is a high-risk activity due to the potential for widespread availability of dangerous drugs and the associated health and social harms.
