The provided text consists entirely of repeated legal notation:

> "[Repealed by operation of law, 2011, c. 25, s. 64]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by operation of law, meaning that its repeal was enacted automatically through legislation, rather than by a specific legislative act or order.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation is **no longer in effect**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal occurred in **2011**.
- **Legal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Chapter 25 of the Statutes of 2011** (commonly referred to as "c. 25").
- **Specific Section**: Section **64** of that chapter contains the provision that resulted in the repeal.
- **Nature of Repeal**: The repeal was not the result of a specific legislative decision targeting the regulation, but rather "by operation of law," meaning that the legal framework or procedural mechanism of the statute automatically rendered the regulation invalid upon coming into force. This often happens when a new law supersedes or replaces an older one, or when a statutory provision is deemed obsolete or inconsistent with current law.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, duties, or requirements previously established by the regulation are **no longer enforceable**. Legal or administrative bodies are no longer required to comply with it, and references to it in existing law or practice are considered outdated or invalid.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text has been **permanently repealed** and is **not currently in force**. Its removal from the legal system was part of a broader legislative update in 2011 (specifically in Chapter 25, Section 64), which streamlined or modernized the legal framework. As such, no further action or interpretation of this regulation is required or permitted under current law.
