**1. Purpose and Authority**  
These regulations establish a specific fee that must be paid by individuals seeking a licence from the Solicitor General of Canada to possess or sell devices used for the surreptitious interception of private communications.  

The regulations were made under the authority granted by **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Solicitor General and the Treasury Board) to prescribe fees related to administrative or regulatory services, including the issuance of licences. In this case, the fee applies to the administrative process of authorizing the use of surveillance devices that intercept private communications without the knowledge of the individuals involved.

**2. Scope of the Regulation**  
The regulation applies specifically to:  
- Individuals who wish to obtain a licence from the Solicitor General of Canada  
- For the **possession** or **sale** of devices designed or used for the **surreptitious interception of private communications**  

Such devices may include, but are not limited to:  
- Wiretaps or eavesdropping equipment  
- Surveillance tools capable of capturing voice, data, or digital communications  
- Any technology that enables covert monitoring of private conversations or messages  

The term "surreptitious interception" means the unauthorized, covert capture of private communications, which is governed by strict legal and privacy safeguards under Canadian law, particularly the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the *Privacy Act*.

**3. Fee Amount**  
The fee prescribed under these regulations is **$56**.  

This fee is payable by the individual applicant as a condition of applying for and receiving a licence to possess or sell such devices. It is a non-refundable administrative fee, intended to cover the costs associated with the processing, review, and oversight of licence applications involving sensitive surveillance technology.

**4. Regulatory Context**  
These regulations operate within a broader legal and policy framework designed to:  
- Balance national security and law enforcement needs with the protection of individual privacy rights  
- Ensure that only authorized and properly vetted individuals or entities can access surveillance technology  
- Provide transparency and accountability in the licensing process  

The licensing process is closely tied to the *Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)* and the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)*, which are responsible for overseeing the use of such technologies in accordance with the *Security of Information Act* and other relevant statutes.

**5. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The fee is not a penalty or a charge for illegal activity; it is a prerequisite for lawful access to surveillance equipment.  
- The application process will likely involve background checks, justifications for the need for interception, and compliance with legal authority (e.g., court orders or statutory powers).  
- The fee is fixed and uniform for all individuals, regardless of the type of device or intended use, reflecting a standardized administrative approach.

**6. Enforcement and Oversight**  
- The Solicitor General of Canada is responsible for reviewing applications and issuing licences.  
- The Treasury Board and the Solicitor General jointly ensure that the fee structure is reasonable, transparent, and consistent with public accountability principles.  
- The regulations are subject to periodic review and potential amendment in response to technological developments or changes in privacy legislation.

**Conclusion**  
The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Private Communications Interception Fee Regulations* establish a clear, legally grounded fee of **$56** for individuals seeking a licence to possess or sell devices used to surreptitiously intercept private communications. These regulations reflect a balance between enabling lawful law enforcement and intelligence activities and protecting civil liberties through strict oversight and cost accountability. The fee serves as both an administrative cost recovery mechanism and a regulatory safeguard to ensure that access to surveillance technology is tightly controlled and justified.
