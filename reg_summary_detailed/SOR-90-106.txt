The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulatory instrument, specifically:

- **SOR/2017-159, s. 20** (multiple times)
- **SOR/2009-235, s. 5** (once)

Here is a detailed summary of what this means:

---

### **Summary of the Regulation (as indicated by the provided text)**

**Status:**  
The regulation in question has been **fully repealed**. There is no active, current regulation being referenced — instead, the text indicates that certain sections of a prior regulation were formally removed (repealed) by subsequent statutory instruments.

---

### **Key Details of the Repeal**

1. **Repeal by SOR/2017-159, s. 20**  
   - This statutory rule (Statutory Instrument 2017-159) contains **Section 20**, which formally **repeals** certain provisions from a previous regulation.
   - The section is cited repeatedly — indicating that **multiple provisions** were repealed under this single section.
   - SOR/2017-159 is a *Statutory Instrument* issued in 2017, which typically implements or amends legislation passed by Parliament. In this case, it serves to **remove outdated, obsolete, or redundant rules**.

2. **Repeal by SOR/2009-235, s. 5**  
   - This earlier instrument (issued in 2009) also contains **Section 5**, which repealed a prior regulatory provision.
   - This suggests that the provision in question had a history of being amended or removed over time, with the 2009 repeal being a prior step in its eventual removal.

### **Implications of the Repeal**

- The specific sections referenced (likely related to **licensing, compliance, or operational requirements**) are **no longer enforceable or applicable**.
- Any legal or administrative obligations derived from those sections have been **terminated**.
- Regulatory agencies or institutions that previously relied on these rules must now refer to **current, active regulations** that have replaced or superseded them.
- The repeal may have been motivated by:
  - Legislative modernization
  - Streamlining of regulations
  - Inconsistencies or overlaps with other laws
  - Obsolescence due to changes in policy or technology

### **Conclusion**

The provided text does **not represent an active regulation** but rather a **record of repeal**. It indicates that:

> A specific regulatory provision (or set of provisions) was formally removed from the law through two distinct statutory instruments:
> - SOR/2009-235, s. 5 (initial repeal)
> - SOR/2017-159, s. 20 (final, comprehensive repeal)

As a result, **the regulation referenced is no longer in force** and should not be applied or cited in current legal or operational contexts.

### **Recommendation for Users**
If you are seeking information about the **current status** of a particular rule or requirement, you should:
- Consult the **current version of the relevant statute or regulation**
- Access the **Canada Gazette** or official government databases (e.g., [canada.gov](https://www.canada.ca) or [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca))
- Search for the **replaced regulation** and its **successor** or replacement provision

**Note:** Without knowing the original regulation being repealed (e.g., the name of the regulation or the subject matter — such as licensing, environmental standards, or financial compliance), a more detailed summary of the *content* of the repealed sections cannot be provided. The summary above is based solely on the structure and repeals listed in the input.

Let me know if you have the name of the original regulation or the subject area (e.g., insurance, agriculture, transportation), and I can provide a more targeted analysis.
