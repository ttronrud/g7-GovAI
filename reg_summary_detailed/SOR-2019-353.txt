### **Detailed Summary of the Vaping Products Labelling and Packaging Regulations**

The **Vaping Products Labelling and Packaging Regulations** were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, under several key provisions of federal legislation:

- **Sections 17a and 33b of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA)**

These regulations establish **mandatory labelling and packaging requirements** for all vaping products intended for retail sale or distribution in Canada. The rules apply to both **vaping devices** and **vaping substances**, with specific focus on **nicotine concentration**, **health warnings**, and **language accessibility**, while also setting strict standards for **display format, visibility, and permanence**.
