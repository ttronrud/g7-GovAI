### **Key Definitions**

### **Eligibility for Tax Remission**

Remission of excise taxes is granted **only if** the following criteria are satisfied:

#### **1. Type of Use Determines Tax Relief Amount**

##### **For Side Shows:**
- **If used solely at fairs or exhibitions subsidized by the Department of Agriculture:**  
  → Remission of **$100 per 30-day period (or part thereof)**.
  
- **If used in Canada for purposes other than agricultural fairs/exhibitions:**  
  → Remission of **$200 per 30-day period (or part thereof)**.

##### **For Concessions:**
- **If used solely at fairs or exhibitions subsidized by the Department of Agriculture:**  
  → Remission of **$50 per 30-day period (or part thereof)**.

- **If used in Canada for purposes other than agricultural fairs/exhibitions:**  
  → Remission of **$100 per 30-day period (or part thereof)**.

> *Note:* The "purpose" referred to in subparagraph (i) means the use of the goods at a government-subsidized agricultural fair or exhibition.

### **Reduction of Remission Amount (Conditional Half-Remission)**

The remission amount is **reduced by half** (i.e., 50% of the base amount) **if both** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Market Availability Justification:**  
   It is established to the **satisfaction of the Minister of National Revenue** that:
   - The imported goods were **in lieu of and similar to goods not available in the immediate vicinity** of the location where they were used at the time of importation.

2. **Duration of Use:**  
   The goods are used in Canada for **less than two months** (i.e., fewer than 60 days total).

> *Example:* A side show using imported food items at a rural fair in a remote area where no local equivalent exists and the show runs for only 40 days would qualify for a 50% reduction in the $200 per period tax remission.

### **Conditions for Granting Remission (Mandatory Requirements)**

Remission is **only granted** if the following requirements are fulfilled:

#### **(a) Written Application to Chief Officer of Customs**

#### **(b) Information Required in the Application**
The application must include:
- The **specific places in Canada** where the goods will be used.
- The **start and end dates** for each place of use (i.e., when the goods will begin and cease being used at each location).

#### **(c) Notification of Changes**
- The owner must **notify the chief officer of customs immediately** if there are any changes to the information provided in the application (e.g., change in location, date of use, or duration).

#### **(d) Export Requirement**
- The goods must be **exported immediately** after the date they cease to be used as stated in the application or as notified under paragraph (c).

- The goods must be **presented to customs for examination** before exportation at one of the following locations:
  - The customs office where the goods were originally exported from Canada, **or**
  - An **inland customs office** where the goods will be transported to a customs office for export — **provided** the transportation is conducted by a person authorized under the *Transportation of Goods Regulations*.

#### **(f) Required Documentation on Export Form**
When goods are presented for examination, the owner must provide, on a form satisfactory to the Minister of National Revenue:
1. A **description of the goods being exported**.

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

This regulation serves several key objectives:
- **Supports local events and rural economies** by enabling the import of goods for temporary entertainment or concession services at fairs and exhibitions, especially those subsidized by the Department of Agriculture.
- **Reduces administrative and financial burdens** on small-scale operators (e.g., vendors, performers) who might otherwise face high excise costs.
- **Promotes fair competition** by allowing imported goods to be used when locally available alternatives are not available.
- **Ensures accountability and transparency** through mandatory applications, reporting, and export documentation.

---

### **Key Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excludes goods imported solely for resale or disposal in Canada.**
- **No remission applies to goods used beyond two months** unless a half-remission applies (based on local unavailability).
- **No remission if the goods are not properly applied for or exported.**
- **Only applies to side shows and concessions at circuses, fairs, exhibitions, or rodeos.**

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** has the authority to determine whether the conditions for remission (especially the "local unavailability" requirement) are satisfied.
- Failure to comply with any of the procedural requirements (e.g., missing application, failure to notify changes, no export examination) results in **denial of remission**.
- The requirement to present goods for customs examination before export ensures that goods are not retained or misused in Canada.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Side Shows and Concessions Remission Order* is a targeted, practical, and fair regulatory measure designed to:
- Encourage participation in agricultural and community fairs,
- Support temporary economic activity in rural and underserved areas,
- Provide tax relief for goods used in non-commercial, event-based settings,
- Maintain compliance through clear procedural requirements.

It balances **tax policy objectives** with **economic support**, ensuring that while excise taxes are collected, they are not imposed in ways that unduly burden legitimate, short-term, community-oriented events.

---

**In essence:**  
Importers of goods for side shows or concessions at fairs or exhibitions may claim **partial or full remission of excise taxes** under strict conditions — including a formal application, proper use duration, local unavailability justification, and compliance with export procedures — making it a valuable but highly regulated tool for event-based commerce in Canada.
