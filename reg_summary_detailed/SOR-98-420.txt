### **Overview**
This regulation, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, establishes a **customs duty remission program** for specific textile and apparel goods imported from **Mexico or the United States**. The purpose is to support trade within the **free trade area** (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) by reducing or eliminating customs duties on qualifying goods that meet certain production and origin criteria.

The remission applies only to goods that are **produced or assembled in Mexico or the U.S.** using raw materials (fabric, yarn, fibre) **originating outside the free trade area**. This promotes regional value addition and supports supply chain efficiency while ensuring compliance with trade rules of origin.

### **Duty Remission Provisions**

- **Remission of Duty**:  
  A **customs duty remission** is granted on imports of:
  - Apparel  
  - Fabric and made-up goods  
  - Spun yarn  
  from **Mexico or the United States**.  
  The remission applies to the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff rates**.

- **Annual Quantitative Limits**:  
  - The remission is **limited to annual quotas** set out in **Appendices 1 to 3 of Annex 6–A to Chapter 6 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**.  
  - These limits are **per product type**, and the total amount of goods eligible for remission cannot exceed these caps.  
  - This ensures that the benefit is not abused and maintains balance in trade flows.

- **Conditions for Remission**:
  Importers or owners of eligible goods must:
  
  1. **Provide a Certificate under the Export and Import Permits Act and Import Certificate Regulations**:
     - At the time the goods are **accounted for** under subsections **32(1), (3), or (5)** of the *Customs Act*, or when applying for a **refund of customs duty**.
     - The certificate must identify the **quantity available for remission or refund** under the Annex 6–A quotas.

  2. **Submit a Written Declaration**:
     - In **English or French**, confirming that the required certificate (from point 1) is **in the possession** of the importer or owner.

  3. **Provide an Exporter Certification**:
     - At the time of **release of goods**, or **anytime after** the declaration in (b) is submitted, the importer must provide:
       - A **certification from the exporter**, in **English, French, or Spanish**, in a **form specified in the schedule**.
       - A **copy of the applicable invoice or sales agreement**.
       - If the certification is in **Spanish**, an **English or French translation** must be attached.

### **Certification Requirements (Exporter Statement)**

The exporter must sign and provide the following:

> *"I, the exporter of the goods referred to in the attached invoice or sales agreement, certify that those goods comply with the applicable requirements specified in Annex 6–A to Chapter 6 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement."*

**Required Information to be Included**:
- Name of exporter  
- Title  
- Company name  
- Telephone and fax numbers  
- Invoice number  
- Signature of exporter  
- Date of signature  

This certification serves as **proof of compliance** with origin rules and is essential for qualifying for duty remission.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

- **Promotes Regional Trade Integration**:  
  Encourages manufacturing and assembly of textile and apparel goods in North America, using foreign-origin raw materials, thereby strengthening regional supply chains.

- **Supports Trade Rule of Origin Compliance**:  
  Ensures that only goods meeting strict criteria (e.g., use of non-free-trade-area fibre/yarn) qualify for duty relief, preventing fraud or misuse.

- **Balances Trade Flows**:  
  Annual quotas prevent overuse of the remission and protect domestic producers from unfair competition.

- **Facilitates Compliance and Transparency**:  
  The requirement for detailed documentation (certificates, invoices, declarations) enhances traceability and accountability in cross-border trade.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on August 26, 1998**.

> Note: While the regulation was issued in 1997, its implementation began in 1998, aligning with the broader trade framework established by the **Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**, which later formalized and updated similar provisions.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted trade facilitation measure** designed to support the integration of North American textile and apparel industries under a rules-based framework. By allowing duty remission on goods that meet strict origin and production criteria, it encourages **value-added manufacturing** in the U.S. and Mexico while ensuring **fair and transparent trade practices**. The requirement for detailed documentation ensures compliance and helps prevent abuse of the duty relief system.

It remains a foundational element of the **CUSMA trade regime**, particularly in the textile and apparel sectors, and continues to influence customs policy in Canada regarding origin and duty treatment of goods from the U.S. and Mexico.
