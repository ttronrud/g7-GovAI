### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**. It has been formally **repealed** by Statutory Instrument 2014-109, section 5.

**Repealing Instrument:**  
- **Statutory Instrument 2014-109** (SI 2014/109)  
- **Section 5** of this SI explicitly repealed the specific regulation in question.

**What This Means:**  
- The regulation was previously in effect, likely governing a specific area such as licensing, environmental standards, employment practices, or administrative procedures.  
- However, due to changes in policy, redundancy, or the introduction of more up-to-date legislation, it was deemed obsolete or unnecessary.  
- SI 2014/109, section 5, formally removed it from the legal framework, meaning it no longer applies or creates any legal obligations or rights.

**Legal Implications:**  
- Any legal action, compliance requirement, or interpretation based on the repealed regulation is now invalid.  
- Authorities or individuals must refer to the current legislation in place, which may be found in a newer statute or regulation introduced after SI 2014/109.

**Note on Redundancy:**  
The repetition of the same entry six times suggests a possible formatting or data entry error — it does not imply that the regulation was repealed multiple times or that multiple sections were affected. It is likely a technical duplication in the source document.

### Conclusion:  
The regulation in question has been **fully repealed** by **SI 2014/109, section 5**. It is **no longer legally operative** and should not be referenced in current legal or compliance contexts. For any ongoing legal or regulatory purposes, practitioners and officials should consult the current legislation that succeeded or replaced it, if applicable.
