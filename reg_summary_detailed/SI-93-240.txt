Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.  
The action is authorized specifically under **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**. This provision typically allows for the inclusion of certain lands—particularly those with specific geographical or administrative significance—into land sales or disposals, especially when such inclusion serves public interest, Indigenous rights, or land management objectives.

---

**2. Key Provision: Land Included in Sale**  
The regulation directs that **any portion of the lands described in the schedule attached to this order**—which are located within **30.48 metres (100 feet) of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Prosperous Lake**—shall be **included in the sale of those lands**.

- **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)**: This is a legally defined boundary used in land surveys and land title determinations. It refers to the highest level to which water reaches during ordinary (non-flood) conditions. Lands within this zone are often subject to special rules due to their proximity to water, such as flood risk, access rights, or potential for being considered part of a water body or riparian zone.
- **Inclusion in Sale**: By specifying that land within 100 feet of the OHWM is included in the sale, the regulation ensures that these areas are not excluded from the transaction, even if they are near water. This may have implications for land use, access, or environmental considerations.

---

**3. Specific Lands Identified**  
The regulation explicitly identifies the following parcels:

- **Lots 1088 to 1115 inclusive**  
- Located in **Quad 85 J/9**  
- Within the **community of Prosperous Lake**, Northwest Territories  

These lots are referenced in an official **plan of survey of record number 75196**, which is held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.  
A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District at Yellowknife**, under **file number 2310**.

This ensures that the description of the lots is officially documented, verifiable, and accessible for legal and administrative purposes.

---

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
- The inclusion of land within 100 feet of the OHWM in the sale may reflect:
  - A need to ensure clear title and marketability of the land.
  - A determination that the water-related land is not subject to separate legal or Indigenous rights (e.g., access, fishing, or traditional use).
  - A land management or development decision to facilitate a sale or transfer.
- However, such inclusion may raise concerns about:
  - Environmental protection.
  - Indigenous rights or traditional use of water-dependent areas.
  - Potential impacts on access to water or floodplain stability.

---

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- The regulation is binding and enforceable under the Territorial Lands Act.
- It provides clarity and specificity in defining which parcels are being sold, especially in areas adjacent to natural water bodies.
- The reference to a recorded survey plan and a filed copy in the Land Titles Office ensures transparency, legal accountability, and ease of access for stakeholders (e.g., buyers, Indigenous groups, land users, or regulators).

---

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation formally orders that all land portions within 100 feet of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Prosperous Lake—specifically within Lots 1088 to 1115 in Quad 85 J/9—are to be included in the sale of those lots. The decision is grounded in statutory authority and supported by official survey records, ensuring legal precision and administrative consistency in land disposition in the Northwest Territories.

---

**Note**: While this regulation appears to be a straightforward land sale directive, it should be reviewed in the context of broader Indigenous land rights, environmental assessments, and local community interests, particularly given the proximity to a lake and the potential significance of riparian zones.
