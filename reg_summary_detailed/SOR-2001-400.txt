The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2008-163, s. 3]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 3 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2008-163**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2008-163**, which stands for *Statutory Instrument 2008-163*.
- **Section Repealed**: Specifically, **Section 3** of that Statutory Instrument repealed the original regulation.
- **Legal Context**: SOR (Statutory Instruments of Ontario) are instruments used in Ontario, Canada, to implement or amend legislation. SOR/2008-163 is an administrative or regulatory instrument that modifies or removes certain provisions of existing laws or regulations.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are no longer applicable. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to updated or successor provisions, if any.

### Important Notes:
- The fact that the same statement appears three times does not indicate a tripartite regulation but rather a repetition, possibly due to formatting or data entry error.
- Since the regulation is fully repealed, **there is no active legal content** to summarize in terms of rules, definitions, or requirements.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or simplification effort to eliminate outdated or redundant provisions.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable** under Ontario law. Its removal was formalized in **SOR/2008-163, section 3**, meaning that any prior application of the regulation is now void. Legal or regulatory practitioners should consult current, active legislation or successor instruments for any relevant provisions.

> ✅ Summary: The regulation is **repealed** and **no longer in effect**. It was removed by **SOR/2008-163, section 3**, and therefore, it has no current legal standing.
