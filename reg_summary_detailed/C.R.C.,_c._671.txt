---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulations are officially titled the *Accountable Travel and Moving Advance Regulations (Dependants of Members of the Canadian Forces)* and may be cited accordingly. This title reflects the specific scope and purpose of the regulation: to govern the issuance of accountable advances to dependants of Canadian Forces personnel.

---

**2. Scope of Application**  
These regulations apply specifically to the **dependants** (such as spouses, children, or other eligible family members) of **officers and men** serving in the Canadian Forces. The provisions are not intended for use by members of the public or non-depandants of military personnel.

---

**3. Authorization for Advances**  
The **Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)** holds the authority to authorize the issuance of **accountable advances of public funds** to dependants under specific circumstances. These advances are only permitted when the dependant is required to:

- **Move from one location to another**, or  
- **Move their furniture and personal effects** from one location to another, or  
- **Both** of the above,  
as permitted under existing military and administrative regulations.

This provision ensures that dependants receive financial support to manage necessary relocation expenses, such as transportation, storage, and moving costs, during times of transition or crisis.

**4. Triggering Events for Advance Authorization**  
Advances may be authorized in the following specific situations involving the Canadian Forces member:

- The officer or member **dies**;  
- The officer or member is **officially reported missing**;  
- The officer or member is a **prisoner of war (POW)**;  
- The officer or member is **interned or detained by a foreign power**; or  
- The officer or member is **declared by a competent medical authority to be mentally incapacitated**.

These conditions are considered exceptional and often involve significant disruption to the dependant’s life, making financial assistance essential for stability and continuity.

**5. Limitation on Advance Amounts**  
All advances issued under these regulations must be **limited to the amount necessary to cover estimated permissible expenses**. This means:

- The amount must be reasonable and justified based on actual or anticipated moving and travel costs;  
- No arbitrary or excessive funding is allowed;  
- The advance must not exceed what is considered a reasonable and necessary expense under established financial guidelines.

This ensures fiscal responsibility and prevents misuse or overadvancement of public funds.

**6. Accountability and Recovery**  
The regulations emphasize **accountability** and **recovery** of funds. Under the authority granted by the Financial Administration Act, the Chief of the Defence Staff may issue **orders** to ensure that:

- Dependants provide full and accurate documentation of expenses incurred;  
- Advances are properly accounted for and audited;  
- Any unused or unapproved funds are recovered if necessary.

Specifically, the regulations reference **subsections 31(2), (3), and (4)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which provide the legal basis for enforcing accountability and recovery mechanisms. These subsections allow the government to require:

- Reporting of expenditures;  
- Verification of claims;  
- Recovery of funds in cases of non-compliance or misuse.

The overarching purpose of these regulations is to:

- Provide **temporary, necessary financial support** to dependants during times of crisis or significant life disruption;  
- Maintain **financial accountability** and ensure public funds are used responsibly;  
- Protect the well-being of dependants while upholding the integrity of military financial systems.

The regulations balance humanitarian support with fiscal discipline, ensuring that dependants are not left in financial hardship due to the service of a family member, while also preventing waste or abuse of public funds.
