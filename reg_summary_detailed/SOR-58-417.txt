### **3. General Rule for Pension Increases**

The **annual rate** of a recipient’s pension may be increased by the **lesser of two amounts**:

#### **Option 1: Percentage Increase Based on Service Period**
- Multiply the **lesser of**:
  - The current annual pension rate, or  
  - The annual rate specified in **Column I of Schedule B** (a base rate per recipient category),
- By the **percentage figure** in **Schedule A**, which corresponds to the **period of service** used to calculate the pension.

> The percentage in Schedule A is selected based on the **latest period of service** used to calculate the pension (e.g., 10 years, 15 years, etc.).

#### **Option 2: Fixed Cap Based on Schedule B**
- Increase the pension to reach the **annual rate specified in Column II of Schedule B** (a maximum cap per recipient category).

> **Key Limitation**:  
> The final increased pension rate **cannot exceed** the amount in **Column II of Schedule B**.

> This ensures that no recipient receives a pension increase beyond a set ceiling.

---

### **4. Payment of Increases**

- The increase must be:
  - Paid **at the same time**,  
  - In the **same manner**,  
  - During or in respect of the **same period**,  
  - Subject to the **same terms and conditions**, including termination clauses.

> This ensures continuity and consistency in pension payments.

---

### **5. Exclusions from Increases**

#### **(a) During Salary Periods**
- No increase is made if the recipient is **being paid salary, wages, or allowances** from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** or by an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada.

> This prevents pension increases during active employment.

#### **(b) Transferred Newfoundland Employees**
- If a recipient was a **transferred pensionable Newfoundland employee** who:
  - Made an election under the *Civil Service Superannuation Act* to **exclude their Newfoundland service** from being counted toward pensionable service,
- Then **no increase** is made **unless** the pension was calculated on the basis of **non-Newfoundland service**.

> This protects employees who chose not to count their Newfoundland service.

#### **(c) Multiple Pensions – Total Exceeding Column II Cap**
- If the **total of all pensions**, when computed at an annual rate, **exceeds the annual rate in Column II of Schedule B**, **no increase** is made for any pension.

> This prevents overpayment and maintains the cap.

#### **(d) Multiple Pensions – Two Pensions (Specific Rules)**

When a recipient receives **two pensions** and the **total does not exceed the Column II cap**:

- **First Pension (earlier period of service)**:
  - If its rate is **equal to or exceeds Column I of Schedule B**, it is increased under Section 3.
  - **No increase** is made to the second pension.

- If the first pension is **less than Column I**:
  - The **second pension** is increased under Section 3.
  - If the **combined total of both pensions** does **not exceed Column I**, the second pension is increased.
  - If the **combined total exceeds Column I**, the second pension is **deemed payable** at a rate equal to:
    > (Column I rate – First pension rate)
    Then this **deemed rate** is increased under Section 3.

> **Final Cap**: The total of all pensions and increases **must not exceed Column II of Schedule B**.

#### **(e) More Than Two Pensions**

- If a recipient has **three or more pensions** and the total annual rate does **not exceed Column II of Schedule B**:
  - Each pension is increased by a rate **determined by the Treasury Board**.
  - The **total of all increases** must not exceed the **lesser of**:
    1. The annual rate in **Column III of Schedule B**, or  
    2. The amount that, when added to the total pension payments, equals the Column II cap.

> This allows flexibility in multi-pension cases while maintaining overall control over total pension payments.

---

### **6. Special Rule for Widows**

- A widow receiving pensions **as a widow** is **exempt from increases** unless:
  - The **total of all her pensions**, when computed annually, **does not exceed $3,000**.

> In such cases:
- Each pension is increased under Section 3.
- But the **total of all increases** must not exceed the lesser of:
  1. An amount that, when added to the total pension payments, totals **$3,000**, or  
  2. A maximum increase of **$640 per year**, set by the Treasury Board.

> This provides a **safeguard against excessive increases** for widows, especially when pension entitlements are high.

---

### **7. Schedule B – Column II (Special Note)**

> **Column II of Schedule B** is the **maximum allowable total pension** after increases.  
> It applies to recipients whose pensions were **not calculated on a 10-year average salary basis** due to having **less than 10 years of pensionable service**.

> This means that for individuals with insufficient service history, the increase is still capped based on a specific column (Column II), ensuring equity and preventing disproportionate increases.

---

### **8. Clarifications and Interpretations**

- **"First Pension" and "Second Pension"**:
  - The "first pension" is the one calculated using the **earlier** period of service.
  - The "second pension" is the other one.
  - This helps determine the order of increase and prevents double increases when the total cap is reached.

- **"Salary" includes wages and pay and allowances**  
  → Ensures consistency in terminology when referring to income sources.

### **9. Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proportionality** | Increases are tied to the employee’s service period and base rates. |
| **Capping** | No pension can exceed a defined maximum (Column II of Schedule B). |
| **Equity** | Prevents overpayment, especially for those with multiple pensions or high total benefits. |
| **Fairness** | Protects individuals with special circumstances (e.g., widows, Newfoundland transfers, active salary payments). |
| **Administrative Clarity** | Clear rules for multiple pensions and service periods reduce ambiguity. |

### **10. Summary of Key Provisions in a Table**

| Scenario | Increase Rule |

| Single pension | Increase by lesser of: (1) % of current/base rate based on service period, or (2) to reach Column II cap |
| Two pensions | Only one pension increases; based on which is below
