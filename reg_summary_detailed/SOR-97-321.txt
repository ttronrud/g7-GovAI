    - The **Chile Tariff**
  - These spirits must be:
    - Imported in **bulk** (not in finished bottled form)
    - Into a **province** of Canada
    - By a **duly licensed distiller**
    - On or **after July 5, 1997**
  - With the **purpose of bottling in bond** (i.e., for packaging and sale under bonded conditions, where the product remains under customs supervision until released)

### **4. Conditions for Remission**
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be met:

#### **Condition 1: Timely Claim Submission**
- A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the distilled spirits are **accounted for under Section 32 of the Customs Act**.
- "Accounted for" means the official record of the spirits being received, stored, or transferred in accordance with customs procedures.

#### **Condition 2: Provision of Required Information**
- The claimant (i.e., the distiller) must provide the Minister of National Revenue with:
  - All information reasonably required for the administration and audit of this Order.
  - The information must be submitted in the **prescribed form** (as defined by the Minister or in official regulations).

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with customs and revenue requirements.

### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the day that **Section 9 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 1997) comes into force.
- This ensures alignment with trade agreements and the implementation of free trade provisions between Canada and Chile.

> *Note*: This Order is effective as of **July 5, 1997**, which is also the date of the first importation of qualifying spirits under the terms of the Order. The reference to SI/97-86 (Statutory Instrument 97-86) indicates that this Order builds upon or replaces prior regulations in force on that date.

### **6. Repeal Clause**
- This Order **repeals** any previous regulations that may have conflicted with or superseded it, particularly those in force on July 5, 1997.
- This ensures a clear, current, and legally binding framework for the remission of duty on distilled spirits imported for bottling in bond.

### **Key Objectives and Impacts**
- **Supports Canadian Distillers**: Enables licensed distillers to import bulk spirits from countries with favorable tariff treatment (U.S., Mexico, Chile) without paying customs duties, reducing production costs.
- **Encourages Trade Integration**: Aligns Canada’s customs policy with international trade agreements, particularly the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement.
- **Promotes Efficient Bottling in Bond**: Allows distillers to store spirits in bonded warehouses (under customs supervision) until final bottling and sale, reducing risk and improving inventory management.
- **Ensures Regulatory Compliance**: Requires timely claims and documentation, maintaining oversight and preventing abuse of the remission.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a targeted and time-bound remission of customs duties on distilled spirits imported into Canada for bottling in bond, specifically benefiting licensed distillers who import from countries with reciprocal tariff advantages. It is designed to promote trade, support the distilling industry, and ensure compliance with both domestic customs law and international trade obligations. The regulation is effective as of July 5, 1997, and remains in force until amended or repealed by subsequent legislation.
