Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

---

## **Steel and Aluminum Goods Surtax Order**  
*Made under subsection 53(2)a and paragraph 79(a)b of the Customs Tariff Act*  
*Effective: July 31, 2025 (or date of registration if later)*  
*Published in S.C. 2020, c. 1, s. 191(1); S.C. 2012, c. 26, s. 63(4); S.C. 1997, c. 36*

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This Order establishes a **25% surtax** on certain **steel goods** and **aluminum goods** imported into Canada if they contain steel or aluminum that was **melted and poured in China** (for steel) or **smelted and cast in China** (for aluminum). The surtax is designed to address concerns related to **geopolitical supply chain risks**, particularly in response to trade practices involving China, and to ensure that goods originating from or processed in China are subject to additional scrutiny and tariff obligations.

The surtax applies **only when specific conditions are met**, and there are **exemptions** for certain types of goods or low-value imports.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **Aluminum Goods**
- Goods classified under a tariff item listed in **Part 2 of the Schedule**; or  
- Goods classified under a tariff item in **Chapter 99 of the List of Tariff Provisions** that are otherwise classifiable under a tariff item in Part 2 of the Schedule.

> *Note: Chapter 99 typically covers "miscellaneous goods" or "goods not elsewhere classified."*

#### **Steel Goods**
- Goods classified under a tariff item listed in **Part 1 of the Schedule**; or  
- Goods classified under a tariff item in **Chapter 99** that are otherwise classifiable under a tariff item in Part 1 of the Schedule.

> *Part 1 and Part 2 of the Schedule are detailed tariff classifications for steel and aluminum products, respectively.*

---

### **3. Determining Whether Goods Contain Steel or Aluminum Produced in China**

#### **For Steel Goods:**
Goods are deemed to contain steel **melted and poured in China** if:
- The **raw steel** (or any portion thereof) was first produced in a liquid state in a steel-making furnace and poured into its first solid form (e.g., semi-finished or finished steel product) **in China**.

> This includes both the initial melting and solidification process, regardless of where the final product is manufactured.

#### **For Aluminum Goods:**
Goods are deemed to contain aluminum **smelted and cast in China** if:
- The **largest volume** (and, if applicable, the **second largest volume**) of primary aluminum in the goods was produced in China; **or**
- The aluminum was **most recently liquified and cast into a solid state** (in a semi-finished or finished form) in China.

> The "most recent" process is critical — it means the final processing step (smelting and casting) occurred in China, even if earlier stages occurred elsewhere.

---

### **4. Surtax Provisions**

#### **Applicable Surtax Rate**
- A **25% surtax** is applied to the **value for duty** determined under **sections 47 to 55 of the Customs Act**.

> This surtax is **added to the total duty** owed on the importation of qualifying goods.

#### **When the Surtax Applies**
- The surtax applies **automatically** if the goods contain steel or aluminum processed in China, **unless** the importer provides a valid certificate proving otherwise.

#### **Certificate Requirement**
- Importers must provide a **certificate** to Customs officers when requested, demonstrating that:
  - For **steel goods**: the steel was **not melted and poured in China**.
  - For **aluminum goods**:  
    - The **largest volume** (and second largest, if any) of primary aluminum was produced **outside China**; and  
    - The aluminum was **most recently liquified and cast outside China**.

> **Failure to provide such a certificate** results in the **automatic application of the 25% surtax**.

### **5. Exemptions from the Surtax**

The following goods are **exempt** from the surtax, even if they contain steel or aluminum processed in China:

| Exemption | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Low-value goods** | Goods accounted for under subsections 32(1), (3), or (5) of the Customs Act in a single declaration with a **cumulative value for duty of $5,000 or less**. |
| **Subject to prior surtax** | Goods already subject to a surtax under the **China Surtax Order (2024)**. |
| **Casual goods** | Goods defined as "casual goods" under **section 2 of the Persons Authorized to Account for Casual Goods Regulations**. |
| **Chapter 98 goods** | Goods classified under **Chapter 98** of the List of Tariff Provisions (e.g., "miscellaneous manufactured goods" or "goods not elsewhere classified") — **even if otherwise classifiable under the schedule**. |
| **Goods originating in the U.S.** | Goods that originate in the **United States**, as determined under the **Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (CUSMA Countries) Regulations**. |
| **In-transit goods** | Goods **in transit to Canada** on the day the Order comes into force. |

> These exemptions are designed to avoid overburdening small shipments, goods with different origin rules, or those already covered by other measures.

---

### **6. Effective Date and Implementation Timeline**

- **Main Order**: Comes into force on **July 31, 2025**.  
  - If the Order is registered (officially published) after July 31, 2025, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

- **Sections 6 and 7** (likely provisions related to enforcement, certification, or administrative duties) come into force on **September 22, 2025**.

> This phased implementation allows for administrative preparation and compliance planning.

---

### **7. Tariff Schedule Coverage**

The Order applies to goods classified under the following **HS (Harmonized System) tariff headings**:

> A comprehensive list of 138 tariff items (from 7201.10.00 to 7609.00.00), covering a wide range of steel and aluminum products such as:
- Steel products (e.g., sheets, plates, bars, structural shapes)
- Aluminum products (e.g., extrusions, profiles, containers, machinery parts)
- Semi-finished and finished goods (e.g., rolled steel, cast aluminum)

> These include common industrial and consumer goods used in construction, manufacturing, transportation, and packaging.

---

### **8. Legal Basis and Authority**

The Order is made under:
- **Subsection 53(2)a** of the *Customs Tariff Act* — which allows the Governor in Council to impose surtaxes on goods under specific conditions.
- **Paragraph 79(a)b** — which authorizes surtaxes on goods that are "of a type that may be subject to special economic measures."

> This reflects Canada’s authority to implement targeted trade measures in response to international supply chain and economic concerns.

---

### **9. Key Implications and Business Considerations**

#### For Importers:
- Must **track the origin and processing history** of steel and aluminum components in their goods.
- Must **maintain and provide documentation** (certificates) to prove that key processing steps (melting, casting) occurred outside China.
- Failure to provide such documentation results in **automatic surtax** of 25% on the duty value.

#### For Regulators and Customs Officers:
- Can request certificates at any time during importation.
- May initiate audits or investigations if there is suspicion of non-compliance.
- Enforcement is based on **duty value**, not final sale price.

#### For Policy and Trade:
- A tool to **discourage reliance on China** for key raw materials.
- Part of a broader strategy to **diversify supply chains** and reduce vulnerability to Chinese industrial practices.
- May influence sourcing decisions by manufacturers in Canada and abroad.
