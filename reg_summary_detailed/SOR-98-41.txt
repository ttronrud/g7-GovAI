**Detailed Summary of the Prison Manufactured or Produced Goods Regulations, 1998**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *Prison Manufactured or Produced Goods Regulations, 1998* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This action was authorized under **subparagraph 132(1)(m)(i) of the Customs Tariff Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to amend the Customs Tariff to regulate the importation of certain goods, particularly those produced using prison labor.

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **exclude certain goods manufactured or produced wholly or in part by prison labor** from the scope of customs duties and import restrictions, **provided** that the goods are imported solely for **personal use** and **not for commercial or business purposes**.

This policy reflects a recognition of the role of prison labor in the production of goods and seeks to facilitate the importation of such goods under specific, non-commercial conditions, thereby supporting economic initiatives within the correctional system while maintaining compliance with trade and customs laws.

**Amendment to the Customs Tariff:**

The regulation amends **Tariff Item 9897.00.00** of the Customs Tariff. This tariff item originally applied to goods that are generally subject to customs duties and import controls. The amendment modifies its scope by:

- **Excluding** goods that are **manufactured or produced wholly or in part by prison labor** from the application of standard customs duties and import restrictions.

**Key Conditions for Exemption:**

For a good to be exempt under this amendment, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Importation for Personal Use Only:**  
   The goods must be imported **solely for personal use**. This means they cannot be intended for resale, distribution, or any form of commercial activity.

2. **Exclusion of Business or Occupational Use:**  
   The goods must **not be imported for business, commercial, or occupational purposes**. This includes no use in a trade, enterprise, or professional capacity.

3. **Applicable Importer Categories:**  
   The exemption applies to two distinct categories of importers:
   - **Non-residents of Canada** (individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of Canada), or  
   - **Residents of Canada** who are importing the goods **at the time of their return to Canada** (i.e., they have been abroad and are bringing the goods back for personal use).

   This provision ensures that the exemption is not available to individuals importing goods for resale or business operations, even if they are Canadian residents.

---

**Repeal Clause:**

The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that this specific set of rules is being introduced as a temporary or transitional measure. The repeal provision implies that this regulation may be reviewed or replaced in the future, depending on policy changes, economic conditions, or legislative updates.

---

**Effective Date:**

The regulations **come into force on January 1, 1998**. This date marks the beginning of the application of the amended tariff item and the new import exemption for goods produced by prison labor under the specified conditions.

---

**Key Implications and Observations:**

- **Support for Prison Labor:** The regulation acknowledges the economic contribution of prison labor by enabling the importation of goods produced in correctional facilities.
- **Personal Use Focus:** The strict personal-use limitation ensures that the exemption does not enable commercial exploitation or circumvention of customs duties.
- **Targeted Exemption:** The exemption is narrowly defined and does not apply to all goods made in prisons — only those falling under tariff item 9897.00.00.
- **Limited Scope:** The regulation does not extend to goods produced in prisons for sale or distribution, which would fall outside the scope of this exemption.
- **Geographic and Citizenship Restrictions:** The exemption is tied to the status of the importer (non-resident or returning Canadian resident), which helps prevent misuse or abuse of the provision.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Prison Manufactured or Produced Goods Regulations, 1998* represent a targeted and carefully limited regulatory intervention to allow for the importation of goods produced by prison labor under strict conditions. By excluding such goods from customs duties when imported for personal use by eligible individuals, the regulation supports both the economic utilization of prison labor and the integrity of Canada’s customs system. It is a pragmatic measure that balances public policy, economic development, and trade compliance, effective from January 1, 1998.
