## **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Declaring that the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) Do Not Apply in British Columbia, 2025**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Act**: *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), specifically:
  - **Section 93(1)(d)**: Authorizes the Minister of the Environment to make regulations to reduce the release of methane and certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the upstream oil and gas sector.
  - **Section 10(3)**: Allows the Minister to declare that federal regulations do not apply in a province if equivalent or similar provincial regulations are in force.
  - **Section 10(4) and (5)**: Provide for public notice and opportunity for comment or objection to such declarations.
  - **Section 10(6)**: Requires the Minister to publish a report summarizing how comments or objections were addressed.

- **Governing Instrument**: The Order is made under **subsection 10(3)** of CEPA 1999, which enables the federal government to **exclude** the application of federal environmental regulations in a province where **provincial laws are deemed equivalent or sufficiently similar** in scope and effect.

### **2. Background and Context**

#### **Proposed Order (June 29, 2024)**
- On **June 29, 2024**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed Order** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, declaring that the federal regulations on methane and VOC emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector **would not apply in British Columbia**.
- This proposal was accompanied by a **public comment period**, during which:
  - Individuals, organizations, and stakeholders could submit **comments** supporting or opposing the proposed exclusion.
  - Any party could file a **notice of objection**, requesting a **board of review** to assess whether the provincial laws were truly equivalent to the federal ones.

#### **Agreement Between Federal and Provincial Governments (December 18, 2024)**
- On **December 18, 2024**, the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Government of British Columbia** entered into a **written agreement** under **section 10(3)** of CEPA 1999.
- The agreement establishes that:
  1. **Provincial laws in British Columbia are equivalent** to the federal regulations under **section 93(1)(d)** of CEPA 1999 — specifically, the *Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector)*.
  2. **Provincial laws are similar** to sections 17 to 20 of CEPA 1999, which govern the **investigation of alleged environmental offences** (e.g., enforcement, investigations, and penalties).

> This agreement effectively **demonstrates that British Columbia already has regulatory frameworks that fulfill the environmental protection objectives** of the federal regulations.

#### **Public Notice of Agreement (June 29, 2024)**
- The Minister published a notice in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on June 29, 2024, informing the public of the **availability of the agreement**.
- This notice allowed stakeholders to:
  - Submit **comments** on the agreement.
  - File a **notice of objection** to the agreement, requesting a board of review.

#### **Public Report on Objections (December 21, 2024)**
- On **December 21, 2024**, the Minister published a **report** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* summarizing:
  - All comments and objections received.
  - How those submissions were reviewed and addressed.
  - Whether any objections warranted a board of review.

> This step ensures **transparency and public accountability** in the regulatory decision-making process.

### **3. Final Order (Issued by the Governor in Council)**

- On the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** issued the **final Order** on **December 21, 2024** (implied from the publication date).
- The Order is titled:  
  **"Order Declaring that the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) Do Not Apply in British Columbia, 2025"**

---

### **4. Key Provisions of the Order**

| Provision | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Exemption from Federal Regulations** | Except for **federal works or undertakings**, the federal regulations on methane and VOC emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector **do not apply in British Columbia**. |
| **Scope of Exemption** | Applies to all activities within British Columbia’s upstream oil and gas sector (e.g., drilling, production, transportation) unless they involve federal jurisdiction. |
| **Termination of Order** | The Order **ceases to have effect** on the day the agreement between the federal government and British Columbia **terminates** under **section 10(8)** of CEPA 1999. |
| **Repeal of the Order** | The Order is **repealed** upon termination of the agreement. This ensures that the federal regulations may reapply if the equivalence is no longer valid. |
| **Effective Date** | The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized by the government). |

### **5. Legal and Policy Implications**

#### ✅ **Positive Implications**
- **Regulatory Alignment**: British Columbia has demonstrated that its environmental regulations meet or exceed federal standards, reducing regulatory duplication and administrative burden.
- **Provincial Autonomy**: Allows BC to manage its own environmental standards in the oil and gas sector, consistent with its jurisdiction and priorities.
- **Economic and Operational Flexibility**: Oil and gas operators in BC can operate under provincial rules, potentially reducing compliance costs and streamlining operations.

#### ⚠️ **Potential Concerns**
- **Federal Oversight Gaps**: Without federal regulation, there may be **less uniformity** in methane and VOC emission controls across Canada.
- **Environmental Protection**: Critics may argue that provincial laws may not be as rigorous or enforceable as federal standards, potentially leading to **higher emissions**.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement for public comment and review ensures that decisions are open to scrutiny, but the final outcome relies on the validity of the equivalence claim.

### **6. Relationship to Other Regulatory Instruments**

- **SOR/2018-66**: Refers to the original federal regulations on methane and VOCs.
- **S.C. 2023, c. 12, s. 33(1) to (6)**: Likely refers to provisions in the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act* that support regulatory equivalence and enforcement.
- **S.C. 2023, c. 12, s. 55**: May relate to the authority to make such declarations.
- **SOR/2020-60**: Possibly a reference to a prior order or regulation related to methane or VOCs.

---

### **7. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **provincial enforcement mechanisms** (as outlined in sections 17–20 of CEPA 1999) are considered **similar** to federal enforcement provisions.
- This means that:
  - The BC government can **investigate alleged environmental offences**.
  - It can **impose penalties** for non-compliance.
  - It can **conduct inspections and audits** in the upstream oil and gas sector.

> This ensures that even though the federal regulations do not apply, **enforcement remains robust** at the provincial level.

---

### **8. Timeline Summary**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **June 29, 2024** | Proposed Order published; public comment period opened. Agreement on equivalence announced. |
| **December 18, 2024** | Final agreement between federal and provincial governments signed. |
| **December 21, 2024** | Minister publishes report on comments/objections and issues the final Order. |
| **[Date of Registration]** | Order comes into force. |

---

### **9. Conclusion**

This Order is a **legally sound and procedurally transparent** decision under CEPA 1999 that **exempts British Columbia from the federal regulations** on methane and VOC emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector, **because the province already has equivalent or similar environmental protections in place**.

It reflects a **principle of regulatory equivalence** — where provinces can manage environmental standards without duplicating federal rules, provided they meet equivalent standards.

However, the **exemption is conditional and temporary**, ending when the agreement terminates. This ensures that the federal government retains the ability to re-apply its regulations if necessary, preserving flexibility and accountability.

- **BC is exempt** from federal methane and VOC regulations in upstream oil and gas operations.
- The exemption is **based on a formal agreement** between federal and provincial governments.
