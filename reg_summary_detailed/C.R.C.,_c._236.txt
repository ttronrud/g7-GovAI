**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Vegetable Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
This regulation is officially titled the *Prince Edward Island Vegetable Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the broader framework of the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Act).

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Loi). This is the enabling legislation that provides the legal foundation for the Commodity Board’s authority to regulate the marketing of natural products, including vegetables.

- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Vegetable Commodity Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation). This body is established under the Act and is responsible for overseeing the marketing and economic management of vegetables within the province.

- **"Plan"**: Denotes any marketing plan developed and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan sets out rules, procedures, and objectives for the marketing of vegetables, including pricing, distribution, and market access strategies.

- **"Vegetable"**: Is specifically defined as *any turnip produced in the Province of Prince Edward Island*. This narrow definition limits the scope of the Order to turnips only — indicating that the regulation applies exclusively to turnips, not other vegetables like carrots, beets, or potatoes.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The definition of "vegetable" is highly restrictive and may reflect historical or agricultural specificity in PEI’s vegetable industry.

---

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted broad authority to regulate the **marketing of turnips** in two key areas:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales to other provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada)

For these purposes, the Board may exercise **all or any powers** it has over the local marketing of turnips within Prince Edward Island — including powers related to pricing, distribution, quality control, and market access — even when those powers are normally applied within the province.

This ensures consistency and continuity in how turnips are managed across domestic and international markets.

---

**4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**  
A central provision of the Order grants the Commodity Board the power to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of turnips** within Prince Edward Island.

This power is specifically limited to persons located *within the province* and applies to those involved in either growing or selling turnips.

- The Board may **classify producers or marketers into different groups** (e.g., small farmers, large growers, exporters, etc.).

- Each group may be assigned **different levies or charges**, based on factors such as production volume, market participation, or type of operation.

- These levies or charges are **not merely punitive**; they serve a functional economic purpose.

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., financial buffers to stabilize prices during downturns)
- **Payment of operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, marketing campaigns)
- **Covering losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of turnips (e.g., price collapses, spoilage, market failures)
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers

This last point is particularly significant: the Board may redistribute funds to ensure that producers who experience lower returns (due to market fluctuations) are compensated, thereby promoting **economic equity** and **stability** in the vegetable sector.

> ✅ The mechanism supports a form of **market stabilization and risk-sharing**, especially useful in agricultural commodities where prices are volatile.

---

**6. Historical Note – Revocation**  
An earlier provision in the Order (previously listed as "[Revoked, SOR/80-90]") has been **revoked**. This indicates that a prior version of the regulation — possibly one that included broader or outdated powers — was replaced or canceled in 1980 (SOR stands for *Statutory Orders Regulation*). The current version reflects updated policy or administrative needs.

---

**7. Scope and Limitations**  
- The Order applies **only to turnips** produced in Prince Edward Island.
- It does **not extend** to other vegetables or crops.
- It applies only to **persons and property within the province**.
- The powers are **derived from and limited by** the *Natural Products Marketing Act* and the approved marketing plan.

---

**8. Purpose and Policy Implications**  
The overall goal of this Order is to:

- Ensure fair and stable marketing conditions for turnip producers
- Protect producers from market volatility
- Promote equitable distribution of income
- Provide a mechanism for financial resilience through levies and reserves
- Support the economic viability of the turnip industry in Prince Edward Island

It functions as a **market stabilization tool** and a **producer support mechanism**, blending regulatory control with economic policy.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Prince Edward Island Vegetable Order* is a targeted, narrow regulatory instrument that empowers the Prince Edward Island Vegetable Commodity Marketing Board to manage the interprovincial and export marketing of turnips. By imposing tiered levies based on producer groups, and using collected funds to stabilize prices, cover losses, and equalize incomes, the Order aims to ensure the long-term sustainability and fairness of the local turnip industry. Its scope is strictly limited to turnips produced in PEI, and it reflects a historically grounded approach to agricultural marketing regulation. The revocation of an earlier provision underscores ongoing regulatory refinement.

> 📌 **Key Takeaway**: This Order is a specialized tool for managing agricultural risk and promoting equity in a single crop (turnips) within a specific jurisdiction.
