### **Detailed Summary of the Baker Lake Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

The **Baker Lake Airport Zoning Regulations** are formally established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act** (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.)), which authorizes the Governor in Council to adopt zoning regulations for airports following public consultation.

- A **proposed version** of the regulations was published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **February 10 and 17, 1990**, and in two successive issues of the *News/North* on **March 12 and 19, 1990**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., local communities, landowners, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on this public consultation and the Minister’s recommendation, the Governor in Council officially **adopted and promulgated** the final regulations.

#### **2. Title and Scope**

- **Title:** These Regulations are known as the **Baker Lake Airport Zoning Regulations**.
- **Applicability:** The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Baker Lake Airport**, including public road allowances. The specific boundaries of these lands are detailed in **Part VI of the schedule**.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Baker Lake Airport, located in the vicinity of Baker Lake, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. It is located on the centerline of runway 161–341, 640.0 meters from the threshold of runway 341. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. It ensures safe aircraft approach by limiting obstructions. Defined with a 1:40 slope (1 meter rise per 40 meters run) rising to a horizontal line 3,000 meters from the runway end. The outer ends of this line are 525 meters from the runway centerline. The horizontal line is 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 3.0 m above sea level → 48 m above sea level). However, if this elevation is less than **9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground** to ensure safety and practicality. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing surface associated with runway 161–341. It is **150 meters wide** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,400 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it intersects with the outer surface. This ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

> **Elevation Reference:** The elevation of the ARP is **3.0 meters above sea level**, which serves as the baseline for all height measurements.

#### **4. Regulatory Prohibition**

A core provision of the regulations is a **strict height restriction** on any construction or development:

> **No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object** on land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that structure exceeds**:
> - The **approach surface**,
> - The **outer surface**, or
> - The **transitional surface**.

This means that all structures — including residential buildings, sheds, towers, or even trees — must be designed and located so that their **tops do not rise above any of these imaginary surfaces**.

This restriction is essential for **aviation safety**, as it prevents obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

#### **5. Reference to Existing Zoning Plan**

The regulations are based on **Baker Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2670**, dated **August 24, 1988**, which provides the spatial and design framework for the airport.

- The **ARP**, **approach surfaces**, **strip**, **transitional surfaces**, and **outer surface** are all derived from this plan.
- The **boundary of the regulated land area** is precisely defined in a detailed survey description:
  
  > **Starting Point:** On the southeasterly boundary of Baker Lake Settlement (Plan 567, Yellowknife Land Titles Office), where it intersects a circle of **4,000 meters radius** centered at the ARP.
  >
  > **Path:** 
  > - Follow the circumference of the circle **clockwise** to its intersection with the northeasterly boundary of the settlement.
  > - Then follow the northeasterly and southeasterly limits of Plan 567 to the intersection with the northeasterly limit of **Lot 1,000, Quad 66 A/8** (Plan 1269).
  > - Proceed **northwesterly** to the most northerly corner of that lot.
  > - Then **southwesterly** to the most westerly corner.
  > - Then **southeasterly** to the intersection with the southeasterly boundary of the settlement.
  > - Finally, **southwesterly** back to the starting point.

This creates a **circular buffer zone** (radius 4,000 meters) around the airport, ensuring that all developments within this zone are subject to the height restrictions.

#### **6. Purpose and Intent**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations.
- To **protect the integrity of the airport’s operational environment** by defining clear spatial and elevation boundaries.
- To **balance development needs** with the requirement for unimpeded flight paths, especially in remote Arctic communities where air travel is a vital mode of transportation.

---

#### **7. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Circular boundary (4,000 m radius)** | Creates a wide buffer zone around the airport, protecting a large area from vertical obstructions. |
| **Height limits based on approach and outer surfaces** | Prevents even small structures from interfering with aircraft approaches and flight paths. |
| **1:40 and 1:7 slopes** | Reflect standard aviation safety standards for approach and transition zones. |
| **Elevation-based thresholds** | Ensures consistent safety margins regardless of local terrain. |
| **Public consultation process** | Demonstrates transparency and accountability in regulatory development. |

---

#### **8. Revocation Note**

- The term **"Minister"** appears in the text but is **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, Section 2**, indicating that the role or authority of the Minister in this context has been superseded or amended by later legislation.

> This suggests that the regulation may now be administered under a different ministerial or regulatory framework, though the content remains valid and enforceable.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Baker Lake Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive and safety-focused framework designed to protect aviation operations at Baker Lake Airport. By defining precise elevation and spatial boundaries — including approach, transitional, and outer surfaces — and strictly limiting construction heights, the regulations ensure that aircraft can safely take off and land without interference from terrain or man-made structures.

These rules are grounded in a formal, transparent process involving public notice and opportunity for comment, and they reflect standard international practices for airport zoning in remote and critical aviation environments.

---

### **Practical Takeaway for Stakeholders**

- **Landowners or developers** near Baker Lake Airport must ensure all structures (including fences, towers, or trees) are **below the defined approach, outer, or transitional surfaces**.
- **Urban planning and development proposals** must be reviewed against the **4,000-meter radius boundary** and the **height restrictions** before approval.
- The regulations remain **binding and enforceable** under Canadian aviation law, with violations potentially leading to enforcement actions by Transport Canada.

> ✅ **Summary in One Sentence:**  
> The Baker Lake Airport Zoning Regulations establish strict height and spatial limits around the airport to ensure aviation safety, based on a 4,000-meter radius and defined approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, with all structures required to remain below these imaginary planes.
