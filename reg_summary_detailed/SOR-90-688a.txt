### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Revocation and Replacement of Tax Court of Canada Rules (Effective January 1, 1991)**

This regulation, issued on **September 7, 1990**, and effective **January 1, 1991**, constitutes a formal **revocation and replacement** of outdated procedural rules governing the **Tax Court of Canada (TCC)**. It was enacted under the authority of the *Tax Court of Canada Act* and approved by the Governor in Council, following a public consultation process. The regulation supersedes two key sets of rules:

---

## **I. Background and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulation is grounded in **section 20** of the *Tax Court of Canada Act* (R.S., c. 51 (4th Supp.), s. 6), which empowers the Rules Committee of the Tax Court to propose changes to its rules, subject to approval by the Governor in Council.

- **Notice of Proposal**:  
  On **April 21, 1990**, the Rules Committee published a notice in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, proposing:
  - The **revocation** of:
    - The *Tax Review Board Rules*, C.R.C., c. 1513;
    - The *Tax Court of Canada Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Award of Costs (Income Tax Act)*, approved by Order in Council P.C. 1985-183 (January 24, 1985).
  - The **introduction** of new rules:
    - *Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure)*;
