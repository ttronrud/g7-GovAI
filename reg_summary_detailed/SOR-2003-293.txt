**Detailed Summary of the Assessor’s Rules of Procedure under the Pesticide Residue Compensation Act**

---

### **Overview**

The *Assessor’s Rules of Procedure* are a set of administrative guidelines issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, pursuant to **Section 18a of the Pesticide Residue Compensation Act** (S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 62; S.C. 2001, c. 4, s. 113). These rules govern the procedures for appeals against compensation decisions made by the Minister of Health under the Act, particularly concerning claims related to pesticide residue exposure.

The rules are designed to ensure **fairness, efficiency, transparency, and accessibility** in the administrative appeal process. They provide clear, structured guidance for all parties involved — including appellants, the Assessor, the Registrar, and the Minister — while allowing flexibility where necessary to avoid procedural unfairness.
