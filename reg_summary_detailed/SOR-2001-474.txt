**Detailed Summary of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Assessment of Financial Institutions Regulations (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Assessment of Financial Institutions Regulations* (S.C. 2001, c. 9) are a set of rules established under **section 32** and **subsection 18(3)** of the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act* (the "Act"). These regulations establish a framework for calculating and applying **annual assessments** to various financial institutions in Canada. The primary purpose is to ensure that financial institutions contribute to the operational costs of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), particularly those related to consumer protection and the administration of financial consumer rights.

The assessments are designed to be **proportional** to the size and activity of each institution, with a base minimum of $1,000 for most types of institutions. The final assessment is determined using a complex formula that takes into account assets, expenses, and peer comparisons, ensuring fairness and consistency across the financial sector.

## **Key Components of the Regulation**

---

### **1. Definitions of Financial Institutions**

The regulations define several types of financial institutions relevant to the assessment:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Bank** | As defined in section 2 of the *Bank Act* |
| **Authorized Foreign Bank** | Same as "bank" under the *Bank Act*, but operating in Canada |
| **Life Company** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Insurance Companies Act* |
| **Foreign Life Company** | As defined in section 571 of the *Insurance Companies Act* |
| **Insurance Company** | Any company or foreign company subject to the *Insurance Companies Act*, or Green Shield Canada |
| **Retail Association** | As defined in section 2 of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* |
| **Trust and Loan Company** | A company subject to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* |

> **Note:** Green Shield Canada is treated as an insurance company for assessment purposes, even though it is not a traditional insurer.

### **2. Annual Assessment Process**

#### **Requirement for the Commissioner**
Each year, before **December 31**, the **Commissioner of FCAC** must determine the following data:

- **Average total assets in Canada** for:
  - Banks and authorized foreign banks (fiscal year ending March 31)
  - Retail associations (immediately preceding calendar year)
- **Total net revenue** received by **Green Shield Canada** from prepayment plans (excluding administrative services only plans)
- **Total net premiums** received in Canada by:
  - All insurance companies (including foreign ones)
  - Life companies and foreign life companies

This data is used to calculate the **base assessment** for each institution.

---

### **3. Base Assessment Formulae**

The base assessment for each type of financial institution is calculated using a **formula-based approach**, with a **minimum of $1,000**. The formula varies by institution type and is designed to ensure that institutions with higher assets or revenue pay more, while smaller institutions pay a flat minimum.

---

#### **A. Banks and Authorized Foreign Banks**

**Base Assessment = $1,000 + (A × B / C)**  
*(If result ≤ $1,000, then $1,000; otherwise, the full amount)*

Where:

- **A** = Average total assets in Canada of the institution (from paragraph 2(a))
- **B** = Total expenses incurred for administering the Act and consumer provisions (attributable to banks/foreign banks)
- **C** = Aggregate average total assets of all banks and foreign banks (excluding those in subsection 3(2))
  
> *Note:* The formula ensures that larger banks pay more relative to their size and the total sector.

---

#### **B. Trust and Loan Companies**

**Base Assessment = $1,000 + (A × B / C)**  
*(If ≤ $1,000, then $1,000; otherwise, the full amount)*

Where:

- **A** = Average total assets in Canada of the trust and loan company
- **B** = Expenses related to administering the Act and consumer provisions (attributable to trust and loan companies)
- **C** = Aggregate average total assets of all trust and loan companies (excluding those in subsection 3(2))
- **Adjustment factor**: If the result is ≤ $1,000, the assessment is $1,000

> *Note:* The formula includes a **peer-based normalization**—larger institutions pay more relative to the sector average.

---

#### **C. Retail Associations**

**Base Assessment = $1,000 + (A × B / C)**  
*(If ≤ $1,000, then $1,000; otherwise, the full amount)*

Where:

- **A** = Average total assets in Canada of the retail association (from paragraph 2(b))
- **B** = Expenses related to administering the Act and consumer provisions (attributable to retail associations)
- **C** = Aggregate average total assets of all retail associations (excluding those in subsection 3(2))
- **Adjustment factor**: If ≤ $1,000, the assessment is $1,000

> *Note:* The formula accounts for the scale of operations and peer comparisons.

---

#### **D. Life Companies and Foreign Life Companies**

**Base Assessment = $1,000 + (A × C / E)**  
*(If ≤ $1,000, then $1,000; otherwise, the full amount)*

Where:

- **A** = Total net premiums received in Canada (from paragraph 2(d))
- **C** = Aggregate of amounts of A for all life companies/foreign life companies (excluding those in subsection 3(2)) where the formula result exceeds $1,000
- **E** = Total expenses related to administering the Act and consumer provisions (attributable to life companies/foreign life companies)

> *Note:* This assessment is based on **premium volume**, not asset size—reflecting the nature of life insurance.

---

#### **E. Insurance Companies (Other Than Green Shield Canada or Those in Section 7)**

**Base Assessment = $1,000 + (A × C / E)**  
*(If ≤ $1,000, then $1,000; otherwise, the full amount)*

Where:

- **A** = Net revenue (for Green Shield Canada) or net premiums (for others) received in Canada
- **C** = Aggregate of A values for all other insurance companies (excluding those in subsection 3(2) and section 7) where the formula result exceeds $1,000
- **E** = Expenses and consumer provisions attributable to these insurance companies

> *Note:* Green Shield Canada is treated as a property and casualty insurer for this purpose, and its assessment is based on **prepayment plan revenue** (excluding administrative services only).

---

### **4. Exemptions from Assessment**

No assessment is payable in any fiscal year if:

- The **Minister has approved** a **voluntary liquidation and dissolution** application **before the fiscal year begins**, or  
- A **winding-up order** has been issued by a court under the *Winding-up and Restructuring Act* before the fiscal year begins.

> This protects financially distressed institutions during restructuring or closure.

---

### **5. Key Principles Underlying the Assessment**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proportionality** | Assessments increase with the size of the institution (assets, premiums, revenue) |
| **Minimum Floor** | All institutions pay at least $1,000, even if small or low-activity |
| **Peer Comparison** | Institutions are compared to the sector average to ensure fairness |
| **Expense Allocation** | Only expenses directly related to the Act and consumer protections are included |
| **Consumer Protection Focus** | The assessment supports enforcement of consumer rights and financial transparency |

---

### **6. Communication of Assessments**

- The **Commissioner must send a written notice** to each financial institution outlining the assessment amount.
- This notice includes the rationale, calculation, and basis for the assessment.

---

### **7. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **section 32 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act** (S.C. 2001, c. 9) comes into effect.
- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2001 (as noted in the SI/2001-102)

---

## **Purpose and Significance**

This regulation establishes a **transparent, equitable, and scalable funding mechanism** for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. By linking assessments to financial performance and consumer protection activities, it ensures that:

- Institutions with greater financial exposure or consumer impact contribute more.
- Smaller or less active institutions are not unfairly burdened.
- The FCAC can maintain operational capacity to protect consumers from financial fraud, unfair practices, and misleading information.

It also promotes **sectoral accountability** and **financial responsibility**, reinforcing the role of the FCAC as a key regulator in safeguarding financial consumers.

---

## **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Complexity**: The formulas are mathematically intricate and require detailed data collection and analysis.
- **Potential for Disputes**: Institutions may challenge assessments if they believe the expense allocations or asset data are inaccurate.
- **Exemption Rules**: While helpful during restructuring, exemptions may reduce overall revenue for FCAC in times of financial instability.
- **
