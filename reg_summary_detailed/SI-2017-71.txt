### **Key Provisions and Functions**

#### 1. **Permit for Specific Activities or Transactions**
- The Minister may issue a **specific permit** to an individual (either in Canada or a Canadian living abroad) to carry out a **particular restricted or prohibited activity or transaction**.
- These activities are defined and restricted under:
  - The *Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*
  - The *Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Regulations*
- The permit is **targeted and limited** — it applies only to the specified activity or transaction.
- This allows for **case-by-case review** and approval, ensuring that only individuals with legitimate, justified reasons can engage in otherwise restricted actions.

> **Example:** A Canadian citizen may be granted a permit to access certain financial records or conduct a specific investigation into corruption involving a foreign official, where such access would otherwise be prohibited.

#### 2. **General Permit for a Class of Activities or Transactions**
- The Minister may issue a **general permit** that allows any person in Canada or any Canadian citizen abroad to carry out a **class of activities or transactions** that are otherwise restricted or prohibited under the Act or Regulations.
- This is a broader authorization, applicable to **all individuals** within the specified class of activities.
- The general permit is issued only when the Minister determines that:
  - The class of activity is of significant public importance
  - There is a legitimate need for broad access
  - The risks to national security or public interest are appropriately managed

> **Example:** A general permit may allow Canadian individuals to conduct due diligence on foreign entities suspected of corruption, or to access certain financial data, provided that the class of activity is clearly defined and justified.

### **Legal Basis**
- The power is derived from **subsection 4(4)** of the *Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**
The regulation serves several key policy goals:
1. **Enabling Canadian individuals and institutions** to respond to corruption involving foreign officials.
2. **Providing flexibility** in enforcement and compliance, without imposing blanket bans.
3. **Protecting victims of corruption** by allowing access to information or actions that would otherwise be blocked.
4. **Balancing national security and foreign policy interests** with the need for accountability and transparency.

  - The **legitimacy and necessity** of the proposed activity
  - The **potential risks** to national security, public order, or foreign relations
  - Whether the activity aligns with the objectives of the Sergei Magnitsky Law

### **Application and Enforcement**

- The regulations are **subject to review and potential amendment** by Parliament or through subsequent regulatory updates.
- There is no public disclosure requirement for individual permits, preserving confidentiality where necessary.
