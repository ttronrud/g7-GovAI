**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
*Order Referring the Assessment of the Northern Fur Seal (Callorhinus ursinus) Back to COSEWIC*  
**Source:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, pursuant to subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2) of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)  
**Date of Issuance:** Not specified in the text, but consistent with the context of the Act and COSEWIC assessments (circa 2006–2020)

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation formally refers the scientific assessment of the **Northern Fur Seal (*Callorhinus ursinus*)** back to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further evaluation and consideration. It also approves the inclusion of a formal statement in the public registry under Section 120 of the *Species at Risk Act* that explains the rationale for this referral.

### **Background on the Northern Fur Seal**

- The Northern Fur Seal is the **smallest pinniped** (seal species) found along the western coast of Canada.
- It is **not known to breed in Canada**; breeding occurs only in three locations:
  - Pribilof Islands (USA and Russia)
  - Bogoslof Island (USA)
  - San Miguel Island (USA)
- Offshore waters of **British Columbia** serve as important habitats for migration, wintering, and feeding.
- Limited knowledge exists regarding the **limiting factors** affecting the population in British Columbia.

### **COSEWIC Assessments and Previous Designations**

- **April 1996**: COSEWIC initially assessed the Northern Fur Seal as **“not at risk”**.
- **April 2006**: Following a reassessment based on updated data, COSEWIC designated the species as **“threatened”**, citing several key threats:
  - Entanglement in marine debris  
  - Human disturbance  
  - Environmental pollution  
  - Decline in prey availability due to commercial fisheries or environmental changes

### **Reasons for Referring the Assessment Back to COSEWIC**

The Minister of the Environment, in consultation with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, has recommended a **reassessment of the Northern Fur Seal’s status** due to **new scientific information** that challenges or requires refinement of previous COSEWIC conclusions. Key reasons include:

#### 1. **Movement Between Rookeries and Population Connectivity**
- New data indicate that Northern Fur Seals **migrate between breeding rookeries**.
- There is **no genetic difference** among individuals from different rookeries.
- This suggests that the populations breeding at different sites (e.g., Pribilof, Bogoslof, and Russian rookeries) are **part of a single, interconnected population**.
- **Critical Gap**: COSEWIC’s 2006 assessment did not fully consider that seals breeding in the **Pribilof and Bogoslof Islands** (in the USA and Russia) also migrate to Canadian waters, implying a broader, more connected population than previously recognized.

#### 2. **Inaccurate Estimation of Population Decline**
- COSEWIC previously estimated population declines based on **pup count declines**.
- This method **overestimates** the actual decline in total or adult population because:
  - Pup production does not directly reflect adult population trends.
  - A decline in pups may be due to seasonal or temporary factors (e.g., weather, food availability), not a long-term population collapse.
- Scientific analysis now supports the conclusion that the **actual rate of population decline is less severe** than previously indicated in the 2006 status report.

#### 3. **Need for Updated Population Modeling**
- The new information necessitates a more accurate estimation of:
  - Total population size
  - Number of mature individuals
  - Population structure and connectivity
- These updated metrics are essential for a proper risk assessment under the *Species at Risk Act*.

### **Actions Taken by the Government**

1. **Referral to COSEWIC**:  
   The Governor in Council has formally referred the assessment of the Northern Fur Seal back to COSEWIC. This allows the committee to:
   - Review the new scientific data
   - Re-evaluate population trends and connectivity
   - Reassess the species’ status (e.g., whether it remains “threatened” or if it should be reclassified)

2. **Public Registry Approval**:  
   The Minister of the Environment has approved the inclusion of a **statement attached as an Annex** to this Order in the public registry under Section 120 of the *Species at Risk Act*.  
   This statement:
   - Outlines the reasons for the referral
   - Provides a summary of the new scientific findings
   - Ensures transparency and public access to the rationale behind the decision

---

### **Implications of the Referral**

- The referral reflects a commitment to **scientific rigor and data-driven decision-making** in species at risk management.
- It acknowledges that **population dynamics are complex**, and that migratory connectivity and data limitations can significantly affect conservation status.
- It ensures that future assessments of the Northern Fur Seal are based on **current, comprehensive, and accurate information**, including movement patterns and population connectivity.
- This step may lead to a **reclassification** of the species—potentially from “threatened” to “not at risk” or a revised risk level—based on updated science.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a critical step in the ongoing management of the Northern Fur Seal under the *Species at Risk Act*. By referring the species back to COSEWIC, the government ensures that conservation decisions are informed by the most up-to-date scientific evidence. The referral addresses key shortcomings in prior assessments—particularly the overestimation of population decline and the failure to account for migratory connectivity—thereby promoting more accurate, reliable, and ecologically sound evaluations of the species’ status.

---

**Key Takeaways:**
- The Northern Fur Seal is not bred in Canada but uses BC waters for feeding and migration.
- COSEWIC previously designated it as “threatened” in 2006.
- New data show that seals from multiple rookeries form a single population, and pup counts do not reflect true population decline.
- The government is seeking updated scientific input to revise the species’ status.
- The public registry will now include a formal statement explaining the referral and its scientific basis.

This action underscores Canada’s commitment to adaptive, science-based wildlife conservation.
