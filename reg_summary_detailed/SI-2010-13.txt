## 📊 Benefit Calculation Rules

### 1. **Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Residence Periods**
- **If a person is subject to CPP or provincial pension plans during residence in Morocco**:
  - That period counts as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (who are not subject to Moroccan legislation due to employment/self-employment).
- **If a person is subject to Moroccan legislation during residence in Canada**:
  - That period **does not count** as residence in Canada for the person or their dependants (unless they are covered under CPP or provincial plans).

> ✅ This ensures that contributions in Morocco can count toward Canadian residence requirements.

---

### 2. **Canada Pension Plan (CPP) – Contribution Periods**
- A calendar year in which a person has **at least 3 months (or 78 days)** of insurance under Moroccan legislation is considered a **year of contributions** under the CPP.

> 📌 This allows Moroccan employment to contribute toward CPP eligibility.

---

### 3. **Moroccan Legislation – Contribution Equivalents**
- A calendar year of CPP contributions counts as **312 days** of contributions under Moroccan law.
- A day of Old Age Security Act (OASA) contributions that is **not part of a CPP period** counts as **one day** of Moroccan contributions.

> 📌 This enables **partial credit** of Canadian contributions toward Moroccan benefits.

---

### 4. **Totalizing of Insurance Periods**
- If a person does **not qualify** due to insufficient insurance periods under one country, their entitlement is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Periods under both Canada and Morocco
  - Periods under a **third country** with which both parties have social security agreements allowing period totalization.

> ✅ This allows individuals to build up benefits across multiple countries.

---

### 5. **Minimum Thresholds (No Benefit if Below)**
- **Canada**: If total insurance periods under Canadian law are **less than one year**, no benefit is payable.
- **Morocco**: If total insurance periods under Moroccan law are **less than 312 days**, no benefit is payable.

> ⚠️ These thresholds prevent benefits from being granted for minimal or non-qualifying contributions.

### 6. **Pension and Allowance Calculations**

#### For individuals entitled to benefits **only through totalizing**:
- **Earnings-related portion** of the benefit is calculated **solely
