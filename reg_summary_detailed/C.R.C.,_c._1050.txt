**Detailed Summary of the *Reserve Forces Training Leave Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Reserve Forces Training Leave Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish the framework for granting leave of absence to certain public servants who are also members of the **Canadian Forces Reserve**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *National Defence Act* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the Canadian Armed Forces, including the reserve component.
- **"Reserves"**: Defined as the component of the Canadian Forces referred to in the *National Defence Act* as the **reserve force**. This includes individuals who serve part-time or in a reserve capacity, such as through annual training, emergency response, or specialized courses.

---

### **3. Eligibility for Leave of Absence**

Any person employed in the **public service of Canada** may be granted leave of absence during the following periods, **provided they are a member of the Reserves**:

#### **(a) Mandatory Absences from Civil Position**
The following situations entitle a public servant to leave of absence from their civil job:

1. **Annual Training**  
   - Required absence during annual training obligations as a reserve member.

2. **Essential Service Parades**  
   - Attendance at mandatory parades or service events deemed essential to the functioning of the reserve force.

3. **Duty Due to Disaster Declaration (Section 34 of the Act)**  
   - Duty required when a disaster has been officially declared under Section 34 of the *National Defence Act*.

4. **Local Emergency Duty (No Formal Disaster Declaration)**  
   - Duty to respond to local emergencies such as floods or fires, even if no formal disaster has been declared.

5. **Call-Out or Order for Duty/Training (Section 33 of the Act)**  
   - Duty or training required when called out or ordered under Section 33 of the Act (e.g., national emergencies, operational needs).

6. **Prescribed Course for Higher Rank Qualification**  
   - Attendance at approved training or courses designed to qualify for promotion to a higher military rank.

7. **Service as Officer or Instructor in Authorized Cadet Organizations**  
   - Service in cadet programs (e.g., Royal Canadian Air Cadets, Sea Cadets, etc.) for the purposes of:
     - (i) Teaching or instructing cadets
     - (ii) Serving as an officer in a cadet unit
     - (vi) Other authorized duties (as specified)

8. **Attendance at Service Association Meetings**  
   - Participation as a delegate in meetings of:
     - Service associations
     - The Conference of Defence Associations

> Note: All of these leave entitlements apply **only to individuals who are members of the Reserves**.

---

### **4. Payment During Leave**

#### **General Rule (Subsection 2)**  
Subject to subsection (2), every person granted leave under subparagraphs (a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or paragraph (b) or (c) shall receive **only one rate of pay**:

- Either **civil pay** (their regular public service salary), **or**
- **Canadian Forces pay and allowances** appropriate to their military rank and status.

> This means that an employee cannot receive both civil and military pay simultaneously during such leave periods.

#### **Exception: During Annual or Vacation Leave**  
Nothing in these regulations **prevents** an employee from receiving **Canadian Forces pay in addition to civil pay** when serving during **annual or vacation leave** (i.e., when the leave is not due to reserve obligations).

> Example: A reserve officer on vacation may be paid both civil and military pay, as long as the vacation is not tied to reserve training or duty.

---

### **5. Leave Without Pay (Non-Paid Leave)**

- Leave granted under **subparagraph (a)(v)** or **(vi)** — i.e., service as an officer/instructor in cadet organizations or attending service association meetings — **requires approval** from:
  - The **deputy head of the department** of government, or
  - The **officer in charge of the branch** of the public service where the employee is employed.

- When such leave is granted, it is **without pay**.

> This reflects the nature of these roles, which are often volunteer or part-time and not considered full-time operational duties requiring compensation.

---

### **6. Certification for Civil Pay Election**

- If an employee **chooses to receive civil pay** (instead of Canadian Forces pay) for service outside of annual or vacation leave, a **formal certificate** must be:
  - Completed
  - Distributed as specified in the form

> This ensures documentation and transparency in pay decisions, particularly for audit or record-keeping purposes.

---

### **7. Sick Leave and Injury During Leave**

- If a public servant is **injured or incapacitated due to illness or injury** while on leave under these regulations:
  - They **cannot receive civil pay in addition to** the pay and allowances provided under regulations made by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., government-established rules for medical leave and hospitalization).
  - **Exception**: If the employee is granted **sick leave with pay** under the *Public Service Terms and Conditions of Employment Regulations* or similar applicable rules, they may receive **a portion of their civil pay** such that the **total** (civil pay + military pay/allowances) equals their full civil pay.

> This ensures that employees are not overcompensated and that military-related leave does not create double payment for medical leave.

---

### **8. Impact on Seniority and Compensation**

#### **Permanent Employees**
- Leave granted under these regulations **does not affect**:
  - Their **seniority** (i.e., length of service in the public service)
  - The **effective date** of any **compensation increase** they may be eligible for

> This protects permanent employees from being disadvantaged due to reserve-related absences.

#### **Temporary Employees**
- Leave does **not affect**:
  - Their **seniority**
  - Their eligibility for **permanent appointment** (i.e., they may still be appointed permanently on the date they would otherwise be eligible)
  - The **effective date** of any **compensation increase**

> This ensures temporary staff are not penalized for taking reserve-related leave.

---

### **9. Exclusion Clause**

- These regulations **do not apply** to personnel who are:
  - Placed on **active service** under **Section 31 of the National Defence Act**

> This means that individuals serving in active duty (e.g., deployed overseas, on full-time operational missions) are not covered by these reserve training leave provisions.

---

The regulations emphasize **fair pay treatment**, **protection of seniority**, and **clarity in leave conditions**, while clearly defining when leave is paid, unpaid, or excluded. They reflect a practical compromise between national defence requirements and the employment rights of public servants.
