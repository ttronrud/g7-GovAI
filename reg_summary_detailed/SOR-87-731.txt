The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-72, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2015-72**, specifically **section 1** of that instrument.
- **Effective Date**: While the exact date of repeal is not explicitly stated in the provided text, Statutory Instruments (SORs) are typically published and come into force shortly after publication. SOR/2015-72 would have been published in 2015, and the repeal would have taken effect upon the coming into force of that instrument.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The original regulation (which is no longer in force) was likely a rule or directive issued under a parent act (not specified here), possibly related to administrative, environmental, occupational safety, or financial regulation—though the specific subject matter is not provided in the given text.
- **Reason for Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred due to:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation was no longer relevant or necessary),
  - Consolidation of laws (to streamline or simplify existing legal frameworks),
  - A more modern or comprehensive regulation replacing it,
  - Legislative review or policy change.

### Important Note:
Because the original regulation is **not described** in the text (e.g., no title, no subject matter, no provisions), the summary cannot provide details about what the regulation originally governed or how it functioned. The only factual content is that it was **repealed** by **SOR/2015-72, s. 1**.

### Conclusion:
The provided information confirms that a specific regulation has been **officially removed from the legal framework** through the repeal provision in **SOR/2015-72, section 1**. However, **no substantive details** about the regulation’s content, purpose, or scope are available in the given text. To fully understand the nature of the repealed regulation, additional context—such as the parent statute or the regulation’s title—is required.
