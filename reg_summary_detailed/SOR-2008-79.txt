Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: E.S. Fox Limited Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- The regulation is issued under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff**.
- It is promulgated by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.
- This indicates that the decision to grant remission is based on a formal recommendation from the federal minister responsible for customs and emergency preparedness, and is ultimately authorized by the Governor General as part of the Canadian government’s legislative process.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- The Order grants a **duty remission** (a reduction or cancellation of customs duties) to **E.S. Fox Limited**, a Canadian business.
- The remission applies specifically to **customs duties paid** on certain **non-alloy steel plates and steel tank heads** that were imported into Canada.

#### **3. Scope of the Remission**
- The remission is limited to the **amount specified in column 3** of an item in the attached schedule.
- This amount represents the **duties that were originally paid** under the Customs Tariff for the specified goods.
- The goods in question are:
  - **Non-alloy steel plates**
  - **Steel tank heads**
- These goods were imported into Canada and **accounted for on a specific date** listed in **column 2** of the schedule.
- The import transaction is identified by a specific **accounting document number** listed in **column 1** of the schedule.

#### **4. Conditions for the Remission**
- A **claim for remission must be made** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.
- The claim must be submitted **within two years** of the date on which this Order comes into force.
- This time limit is a critical procedural requirement and ensures that claims are processed in a timely manner, preventing indefinite or prolonged claims.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the relevant government authority (typically the Department of Finance or the Canada Revenue Agency).
- The registration date is the official date when the Order becomes legally effective and enforceable.

#### **6. Key Implications**
- This is a **specific, targeted remission**—not a general policy change. It applies only to E.S. Fox Limited and only to the specific goods and transactions described.
- The remission is not a refund of money already paid in full; rather, it is a **reduction or cancellation of the duty liability** that was originally assessed and paid.
- The regulation reflects a potential policy of **economic support or relief** for a specific importer, possibly due to factors such as:
  - Market conditions
  - Industrial needs
  - National security or emergency preparedness considerations (given the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness's involvement)
- The inclusion of "emergency preparedness" in the ministerial title suggests the remission may be tied to the need for critical infrastructure components (e.g., steel used in tanks for energy or storage systems).

#### **7. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- This Order is an example of **customs administrative relief** under the Customs Tariff.
- It demonstrates how the government can provide **flexibility in duty obligations** for specific cases, particularly when public interest or economic necessity is involved.
- It also highlights the importance of **timely claims**—failure to meet the two-year deadline will result in the loss of the right to claim remission.
