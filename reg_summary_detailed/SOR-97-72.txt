### **Detailed Summary of the NAFTA and CIFTA Advance Rulings Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations implement a provision of the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)** and are designed to establish a formal process for **advance rulings** on the **origin and tariff treatment** of goods imported from **free trade partners**, particularly under the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** and **CIFTA**.

- The regulations **do not introduce material substantive changes** to existing customs rules.
- As such, they are **not required to be published under subsection 164(3) of the Customs Act** due to paragraphs **164(4)(a.03)a and (d)**, which allow for non-publication of regulations that make no significant change to existing provisions.

- The regulations are issued under **section 43.1c** of the *Customs Act*, along with **paragraphs 164(1)(i)d and (j)** and **subsection 164(1.1)e**, which authorize the Minister of National Revenue to issue advance rulings and related administrative rules.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to provide **clarity, consistency, and predictability** in determining whether goods imported from **free trade partners** (such as NAFTA countries, CIFTA partners, and others) qualify for **preferential tariff treatment** under the applicable free trade agreements. This includes:

- Determining whether goods meet **origin criteria** (e.g., regional value content, production location, use of materials).
- Ensuring compliance with **rules of origin** under NAFTA, CIFTA, and other agreements.
- Protecting importers and producers from uncertainty by allowing them to **seek advance rulings** before importing goods.
