**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Egg Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Prince Edward Island Egg Order* and may be cited as such. This document establishes the regulatory framework governing the marketing of eggs produced in Prince Edward Island (PEI), particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency in its application:

- **"Act"** refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal authority for the Commodity Board to regulate the marketing of natural products, including eggs.  
- **"Commodity Board"** refers to the *Prince Edward Island Egg Commodity Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation in French), a body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of eggs.  
- **"Eggs"** is defined as *eggs of a domestic chicken produced in Prince Edward Island*. This definition limits the scope of the regulation to eggs originating within the province, ensuring that only locally produced eggs are subject to the rules.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted specific powers to regulate the marketing of eggs in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada).  

This authority mirrors the powers it already has for local marketing of eggs within PEI, specifically under **paragraphs 4(q) and (r) of the Act**. These provisions allow the Board to manage pricing, distribution, and market conditions locally.  

Importantly, the Board may, by issuing **orders**, exercise these powers over **persons and property located within Prince Edward Island**. This means that the Board can impose rules, requirements, or conditions on producers, marketers, distributors, and other stakeholders operating within the province, especially in relation to interprovincial and export markets.

**4. Levies and Charges – Key Provision**  
A central component of the Order is the Commodity Board’s power to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals and entities involved in the **production or marketing of eggs** within PEI.  
- **Classify persons into groups** based on their role or type of activity (e.g., small-scale farmers vs. large-scale producers).  
- **Set different levies or charges** for members of different groups. This allows for a tiered or differentiated system that may reflect the scale of operations, market share, or financial capacity of producers.

This classification and differential charging mechanism enables the Board to tailor the financial burden on different types of producers, promoting equity and fairness in the system.

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through levies and charges are not restricted in their use. The Commodity Board may use these funds for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (financial buffers to stabilize markets or manage price fluctuations).  
- **Payment of expenses and losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of eggs (e.g., losses from market downturns, spoilage, or unexpected market shifts).  
- **Equalization or adjustment among egg producers** of the moneys realized from egg sales.  

This equalization function is particularly significant. It allows the Board to redistribute profits or revenues from egg sales to ensure that producers who may have experienced poor market conditions (e.g., low prices or reduced demand) are compensated, thereby stabilizing income and supporting the economic viability of the egg industry across the province.

---

**6. Time Periods and Flexibility**  
The Commodity Board has discretion to determine **the periods of time** over which these levies, adjustments, or equalizations will apply. This flexibility allows the Board to respond dynamically to market conditions, seasonal fluctuations, or economic changes.

---

**7. Revocation Note**  
An important note in the Order states that a prior provision (specifically **SOR/80-90**) has been **revoked**. This indicates that the current Order supersedes an earlier version of the regulation, likely reflecting updates to the regulatory framework, market needs, or policy objectives.

---

**Overall Purpose and Significance**  
The *Prince Edward Island Egg Order* serves as a critical mechanism for:

- Ensuring fair and stable marketing conditions for eggs produced in PEI.  
- Protecting producers from market volatility by enabling the creation of financial reserves and loss compensation.  
- Promoting equitable distribution of market benefits through targeted levies and equalization.  
- Supporting the long-term sustainability of the local egg industry through coordinated, province-wide market management.

---

**Conclusion**  
This Order empowers the Prince Edward Island Egg Commodity Marketing Board to regulate egg marketing beyond provincial borders while maintaining financial and operational fairness among producers. By allowing tiered levies, flexible timeframes, and targeted use of collected funds, the regulation strengthens market stability, supports producer equity, and aligns with broader goals of sustainable agricultural marketing under the *Natural Products Marketing Act*.
