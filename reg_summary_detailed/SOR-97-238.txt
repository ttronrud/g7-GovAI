**Detailed Summary of the *Destruction of Paid Instruments Regulations, 1996***  
*(Pursuant to subsection 36(2)a of the Financial Administration Act)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Destruction of Paid Instruments Regulations, 1996* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 14) are a set of administrative rules established by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, based on the recommendation of the **Receiver General** and with the **approval of the Auditor General of Canada**. These regulations provide specific guidelines on how **paid instruments** — records that have been settled or paid — must be **retained, preserved, and eventually destroyed** in a secure and compliant manner.

These regulations are designed to ensure **financial accountability, transparency, and auditability**, while also protecting sensitive financial data through proper retention and destruction practices.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), which provides the legal framework for financial management and accountability in government institutions.

2. **Medium**  
   Defined as any device designed for storing and archiving information. This includes:
   - Magnetic tape
   - Disk (e.g., hard drive)
   - Diskette (e.g., floppy disk)  
   *This definition ensures that electronic data storage devices are covered under the regulation.*

3. **Paid Instrument**  
   A record that has been finalized after:
   - The specified amounts have been paid, or  
   - A claim has been settled.  
   This includes both physical and electronic forms of financial records.

4. **Record**  
   Includes any of the following:
   - An original instruction for payment or instrument for settlement;
   - A claim for settlement;
   - A medium (e.g., disk, tape) that contains an original instruction or claim, or is used to store such instructions or claims.  
   *This broad definition ensures that all forms of financial records — physical or digital — are included.*

### **Responsibilities of the Receiver General**

- **Care and Custody**:  
  The Receiver General is responsible for receiving and maintaining **any paid instrument provided to them** under subsection 36(1) of the *Financial Administration Act*.  
  The instrument must be **retained until it is destroyed** in accordance with Section 5 of these regulations.

- **Reproduction and Reuse of Media**:  
  If a paid instrument is stored on a medium (e.g., a computer disk), the **data may be reproduced** onto another medium for archival or reference purposes.  
  However, **the original medium may be reused only after the data has been completely erased** — ensuring that no trace of the original information remains.

---

### **Retention Requirements for Paid Instruments**

A paid instrument retained under these regulations must meet the following **minimum standards**:

1. **Accessibility for Reference**  
   The data must remain **accessible and usable** for future reference, such as during audits or inquiries.

2. **For Electronic Media (Mediums)**  
   If the instrument is stored electronically, the data must:
   - Accurately represent the information that was generated, transmitted, or received;
   - Enable the **identification of the origin and destination** of the instruction or claim;
   - Specify the **date and time** of transmission or reception;
   - In the case of an **electronic instruction for payment**, include a **digital signature** to verify authenticity and integrity.

> These requirements ensure that records are not only preserved but also **trustworthy, traceable, and verifiable**.

### **Timeline for Destruction**

- **General Rule**:  
  At any time **during the seventh year after the instrument has been paid**, the **Receiver General** or the **minister who issued the payment or settled the claim** (whichever is applicable) may destroy the paid instrument, **provided the regulations are followed**.

- **Exceptions (Retention for Investigations or Litigation)**:  
  If a paid instrument is **required for any of the following purposes**, destruction must be **delayed** until it is no longer needed:
  - Litigation
  - Claim
  - Inquiry
  - Investigation
  - Other examination

> This provision protects government records during legal or investigative processes, ensuring that evidence is available when needed.

---

### **Methods of Destruction**

Paid instruments must be destroyed using one or more of the following methods:
- Shredding
- Pulping
- Burning
- Crushing
- Erasing (e.g., secure data wiping for electronic media)
- Any other method that **ensures the instrument cannot be reused or reconstructed**

> The key principle is **irreversibility and non-recovery** — the destruction must be such that the original information cannot be accessed or reconstructed.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

This section states that the regulations are **not repealed** by any subsequent legislation — they remain in force as written.

---

### **Effective Date**

These regulations **came into force on April 23, 1997**.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The *Destruction of Paid Instruments Regulations, 1996* serve several critical functions:

1. **Financial Accountability**  
   Ensures that government payments and claims are properly documented and accounted for over time.

2. **Compliance with Legal and Audit Standards**  
   Provides a clear, enforceable process for record retention and destruction, aligning with public sector financial governance principles.

3. **Protection of Sensitive Data**  
   Mandates secure destruction of financial records to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or data breaches.

4. **Balance Between Retention and Privacy**  
   Allows for retention during investigations or legal proceedings while ensuring that records are eventually destroyed to reduce storage costs and protect privacy.

5. **Adaptability to Technology**  
   Explicitly covers electronic records (e.g., digital files on disks or tapes), making the rules relevant in a digital environment.

### **Conclusion**

The *Destruction of Paid Instruments Regulations, 1996* establish a clear, balanced, and legally sound framework for managing government financial records.

These regulations remain a foundational part of Canada’s financial administration system and continue to guide the handling of payment records in both traditional and digital formats.
