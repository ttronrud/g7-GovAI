**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:**  
Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2023-1064 and Designation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development as Minister for the Accessible Canada Act

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under **Section 4 of the Accessible Canada Act (S.C. 2019, c. 10)**. This section empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to make changes to the implementation or administration of the Act, including the repeal of previous orders and the designation of responsible ministers.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2023-1064**  
   - The regulation formally **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2023-1064**, issued on October 27, 2023.  
   - This prior order likely established or modified certain administrative or procedural provisions related to the implementation of the Accessible Canada Act, such as the designation of a minister responsible for accessibility, the establishment of a working group, or the allocation of responsibilities among federal departments.  
   - By repealing this order, the government is effectively **removing its previous administrative structure or directive**, signaling a change in policy or administrative approach.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development**  
   - The regulation **designates the Minister of Employment and Social Development** as the **Minister for the purposes of the Accessible Canada Act**.  
   - This means that, under the Act, the Minister of Employment and Social Development is now the **primary federal minister responsible for overseeing and implementing the Act’s objectives**, including the development and enforcement of accessibility standards, the coordination of federal efforts, and the management of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) and related initiatives.  
   - This designation is significant because it assigns formal accountability and leadership to a specific minister, ensuring that accessibility policy is integrated into broader social and employment programming.

3. **Legal Basis and Process**  
   - The action is taken by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which is consistent with the constitutional process for administrative and policy changes in Canada.  
   - The use of Section 4 of the Accessible Canada Act allows for flexibility in administrative governance, enabling the government to adapt ministerial responsibilities in response to evolving policy priorities or organizational needs.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- The repeal of P.C. 2023-1064 suggests that the previous ministerial designation or administrative structure was either outdated, ineffective, or no longer aligned with current priorities.  
- The new designation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development reflects a strategic decision to **align accessibility policy with existing government priorities**, such as employment equity, social inclusion, and disability rights.  
- This move strengthens the integration of accessibility into key social programs and ensures that federal departments are better coordinated in their efforts to meet the Act’s goals, such as ensuring accessible public services, workplaces, and digital environments.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation marks a shift in the administrative leadership of the Accessible Canada Act by formally removing an earlier directive and assigning responsibility to the Minister of Employment and Social Development. It underscores the government’s commitment to advancing accessibility as a core component of social policy and employment initiatives, and ensures that accountability and oversight are clearly assigned within the federal structure.
