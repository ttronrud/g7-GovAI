**Detailed Summary of the *Related Party Transactions (Insurance Companies) Regulations***  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 1991, c. 47*  
*Made under Sections 533 and 703 of the Insurance Companies Act*  
*Regulations may be cited as: The Related Party Transactions (Insurance Companies) Regulations*

---

### **Overview**

These regulations establish the framework under which an insurance company in Canada may enter into transactions with a **related party**—defined as a person or entity that has a close financial, ownership, or control relationship with the company. The regulations are issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, and are grounded in provisions of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act), specifically **Section 533** (relating to related party transactions) and **Section 703** (relating to disclosure and approval requirements).

The primary objective of these regulations is to ensure that transactions between an insurance company and its related parties are conducted on **arm’s length principles**, are **fair and reasonable**, and do not result in **undue benefit or conflict of interest**—particularly in areas involving financial allocations, tax arrangements, share transactions, or capital changes.

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

- Applies to **insurance companies** registered under the *Insurance Companies Act*.
- Covers **direct or indirect transactions** between the company and any of its **related parties**.
- The regulations define permissible transactions that may occur without requiring additional regulatory approval, provided they meet specific conditions and are properly disclosed.

---

### **Permitted Transactions with Related Parties**

The regulations explicitly list and define the types of transactions that a company may lawfully enter into with a related party. These are categorized into several key types:

---

#### **1. Allocations of Amounts Under Specific Tax Provisions**

A company may allocate amounts to or from a related party under the following provisions of the *Income Tax Act*:

- **Subsection 18(2.3)** – Allocation of amounts under a group tax arrangement (e.g., group-wide income or expense sharing).
- **Subsection 125(3)** – Allocation of amounts in connection with a capital or dividend distribution.
- **Subsection 127(10.3)** – Allocation of amounts related to the taxation of capital gains or losses.
- **Subsection 181.5(2)** – Allocation of amounts in connection with the taxation of certain insurance-related income.
- **Subsection 190.15(2)** – Allocation of amounts in connection with the taxation of insurance premiums or claims.
- **Subsection 190.16(2)** – Allocation of amounts related to reinsurance or insurance operations.
- **Subsection 191.1(3)** – Allocation of amounts in connection with tax credit or refund sharing.

> **Key Point**: These allocations must be consistent with the statutory provisions and must not be used to circumvent tax obligations or create artificial financial advantages.

---

#### **2. Agreements Under Section 191.3(1) of the Income Tax Act**

These are tax-sharing arrangements where one party agrees to pay tax liabilities of the other, with corresponding compensation.

##### **(a) Company Pays Related Party’s Tax, and Related Party Pays Company for Additional Costs**

- The company agrees to **pay all or part of the tax liability** of the related party.
- In return, the **related party agrees to pay the company an amount at least equal to the additional costs incurred** by the company as a result of the agreement.
- Additional costs include:
  - Extra taxes payable under the *Income Tax Act*,
  - Administrative, legal, or compliance costs,
  - Any other direct or indirect expenses resulting from the tax arrangement.

> **Purpose**: To allow for cost-sharing in complex tax structures, ensuring that the company is not unfairly burdened by tax obligations it has assumed for a related party.

> **Requirement**: The compensation must be **at least equal** to the additional costs incurred—no underpayment allowed.

##### **(b) Related Party Pays Company’s Tax**

- The **related party agrees to pay all or part of the tax liability** of the company.
- This may occur in cases where a related party has a financial interest in the company’s tax obligations and wishes to reduce the company’s tax burden.

> **Purpose**: To enable tax relief for the company through arrangements where a related party assumes part of its tax liability.

> **Requirement**: Must be clearly documented and justified as a legitimate business or tax arrangement.

---

#### **3. Issue of Conversion Privileges, Options, or Rights to Acquire Securities**

A company may issue **conversion privileges, options, or rights** to acquire securities (such as shares or bonds) **if such issuance is not otherwise provided for** in the original terms of the security.

- This includes issuing:
  - Conversion rights (e.g., convertible preferred shares),
  - Call or put options,
  - Rights to acquire common or preferred shares.

> **Condition**: The issuance must **not be included in the original terms** of the security being issued. That is, it must be an **additional, new feature** introduced in a separate transaction.

> **Implication**: Prevents companies from using related-party transactions to issue disguised equity or debt instruments without transparency.

---

#### **4. Purchase of Shares or Debt Obligations for Cancellation**

A company may **purchase shares or debt obligations** issued by or to it **for cancellation**, provided such a purchase is not otherwise provided for in the original issuance terms.

- Examples:
  - A company buying back its own shares for cancellation (share buyback),
  - A company purchasing its own bonds or debentures for cancellation.

> **Condition**: The purchase must **not be part of the original terms** of the issuance.

> **Purpose**: Allows for flexibility in capital management, but ensures that such transactions are not used to manipulate capital structure or create artificial profits.

---

#### **5. Redemption of Redeemable Shares or Debt Obligations**

A company may **redeem** (i.e., buy back) redeemable shares or debt obligations **if such redemption is not otherwise provided for** in the original terms.

- Redeemable shares: Shares that can be repurchased by the company at a specified date or price.
- Redeemable debt: Bonds or loans that can be redeemed by the company before maturity.

> **Condition**: Redemption must not be permitted under the original terms of the security.

> **Purpose**: Provides flexibility in managing capital structure, but prevents companies from using related-party transactions to redeem securities in ways that could distort financial reporting or benefit related parties unfairly.

---

#### **6. Payment or Delivery of Money or Property Due to Reduction in Stated Capital**

A company may **pay or deliver money or property** as a result of a **reduction in the stated capital** of the company or its related party.

- A reduction in stated capital may occur through:
  - Share capital write-downs,
  - Capital reductions due to restructuring,
  - Cancellation of shares or debt.

> **Key Point**: This transaction is permitted only when such a reduction occurs, and the payment or delivery is a direct consequence of that reduction.

> **Purpose**: To allow for orderly capital restructuring, particularly in cases where a related party is involved in reducing capital.

---

### **Key Regulatory Principles**

1. **Arm’s Length Principle**: Transactions must be fair and reasonable, as if conducted between unrelated parties.
2. **Transparency and Disclosure**: While not fully detailed in this regulation, the underlying *Insurance Companies Act* requires disclosure of such transactions to regulators and, in some cases, to shareholders.
3. **No Unfair Advantage**: Transactions must not confer an unfair benefit on the related party or distort financial statements.
4. **Compliance with Tax Laws**: All transactions must comply with the *Income Tax Act* and *Corporations Tax Act of Ontario*, and must not be used to evade taxes or avoid reporting obligations.

---

### **Exclusions and Limitations**

- Transactions **not listed** in the above categories are generally **prohibited** unless approved by the appropriate regulatory authority (e.g., the Financial Services Commission of Ontario or the Superintendent of Insurance).
- Any transaction involving **significant financial exposure**, **material changes in ownership**, or **tax avoidance** may require **prior approval** or **disclosure** under broader regulatory frameworks.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Finance** and the **regulatory authority** (e.g., the Superintendent of Insurance) may:
  - Review transactions for fairness,
  - Require additional disclosures,
  - Take enforcement action if a transaction is found to be unfair, improper, or in violation of the *Insurance Companies Act*.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Related Party Transactions (Insurance Companies) Regulations* provide a **clear, structured list of permissible transactions** between insurance companies and their related parties. These are designed to:

- Maintain financial integrity,
- Prevent conflicts of interest,
- Ensure tax compliance,
- Allow for legitimate capital management and restructuring activities.

By limiting the types of transactions that can occur, and by requiring that they be fair, transparent, and supported by sound business or tax rationale, the regulations protect both the company and its stakeholders from potential abuse or mismanagement.

These rules are particularly important in the insurance sector, where complex financial instruments, group structures, and tax arrangements are common—making oversight essential to public trust and financial stability.
