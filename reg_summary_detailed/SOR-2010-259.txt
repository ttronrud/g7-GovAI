### **4. Levy Structure and Obligations**

#### **A. Producer Obligations**
Every producer located in Ontario must pay two levies on all grapes of specific varieties listed in **Column 3 of the Schedule** that are marketed in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales to buyers outside Ontario)
- **Export trade** (sales to foreign buyers)

The levies are:

1. **General Levy** – Set out in **Column 4** of the schedule (per variety)
2. **Research and Industry Development Levy** – Set out in **Column 5** of the schedule (per variety)

> These levies are **paid by the producer** when grapes are marketed outside Ontario. The exact amounts depend on the grape variety (e.g., Concord, Niagara, etc.).

#### **B. Buyer Responsibilities**
Every buyer must:

1. **Deduct the levies** from every payment made to a producer for grapes.
2. **Forward the levies** to the Commodity Board **within 30 days** after the end of the month in which the deduction occurs.

The payment must include a **statement on a form provided by the Commodity Board**, which must contain the following details:

- The **amount and variety** of grapes purchased from the producer  
- The **total amount of levies** being forwarded on the producer’s behalf  
- The **producer’s name**  
- The **producer’s Commodity Board licence number**

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability of levy collection.

### **5. Purpose of the Levies**
The funds collected through these levies are used for:

- **Research** into grape varieties, cultivation methods, disease resistance, and processing technologies  
- **Industry development** (e.g., infrastructure, marketing, training, innovation)  
- **Promotion and market development** of Ontario-grown grapes in domestic and international markets  

These investments aim to improve the competitiveness, sustainability, and profitability of the Ontario grape industry.

### **6. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Variety-Specific Levies** | Different grape varieties (e.g., table grapes, processing grapes) are subject to different levy rates based on their market value and industry needs. |
| **Interprovincial & Export Focus** | The levies apply only to grapes sold outside Ontario or abroad — not to domestic sales or sales within Ontario. |
| **Buyer as Enforcer** | Buyers play a critical role in ensuring levy compliance by deducting and remitting the levies. This creates a shared responsibility between producers and buyers. |
| **Transparency & Recordkeeping** | Mandatory reporting via standardized forms ensures accurate tracking of grape volumes and levy collections. |
| **Legal and Financial Accountability** | The levy system is enforceable under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, with penalties for non-compliance. |

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The *Ontario Grapes-for-Processing Marketing Levies Order* establishes a structured, transparent, and equitable funding mechanism to support the long-term growth and sustainability of Ontario’s grape industry. By requiring both producers and buyers to participate in the levy system, it ensures that industry-wide benefits — particularly in research and development — are funded through market-based contributions.

This regulation reflects a classic model of **cooperative marketing** in agriculture, where stakeholders share responsibility for market development and innovation, ultimately enhancing the value and competitiveness of Ontario-grown grapes in national and global markets.
