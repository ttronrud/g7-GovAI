### **Summary of the Approved Amendments**

The amendments, approved by the Band in the May 25, 2019 referendum, are structured to strengthen democratic participation, clarify governance procedures, and modernize the Band’s constitutional framework. They are categorized into four main areas:

---

#### **1. Amendments to Membership and Voting Rights (Section 3, Definitions, Part I, Division (1))**

- **Objective**: Ensure that **all members of the Band are entitled to vote in Band elections and to run for office**.
- **Key Change**: The definition of "member" is updated to guarantee full voting rights and eligibility to stand for office, regardless of residency status.
- **Significance**: This strengthens democratic inclusion by removing barriers that previously may have excluded certain members from participating in electoral processes.

---

#### **2. Updates to Qualifications for Office-Holders and Voting Rights for Non-Residents (Definitions, Part I, Division (4) and Part II, Division (1))**

- **Objective**: Clarify and modernize the **eligibility requirements** for individuals running for office and voting rights for non-resident members.
- **Key Changes**:
  - **Non-resident members** are now explicitly **entitled to vote** in Band elections.
  - Non-resident members are also **authorized to run for office** in Band elections.
- **Significance**: This expansion of rights promotes inclusivity and ensures that members who live outside the Band’s territory—such as those working or studying elsewhere—can still participate in Band governance. It reflects a more flexible and representative model of self-government.

#### **3. Updates to Referendum and Election Procedures (Division (4))**

- **Objective**: Improve clarity, consistency, and transparency in the processes for **Band referenda, elections, and by-elections**.
- **Key Changes**:
  - A formal **Sechelt Indian Band Election and Referendum Law** is required to be enacted.
    - This law will **detail the procedures** for conducting elections and referenda (e.g., timelines, voting methods, voter registration, counting, and dispute resolution).
    - It will serve as a **living document** that can be updated in the future without requiring constitutional amendments.
  - The constitution now requires that all referenda and elections follow this law, which will be governed by the Band Council (subject to constitutional authority).
- **Significance**:
  - Decouples procedural rules from the constitution itself, allowing for **flexible, responsive governance**.
  - Reduces the need for frequent constitutional amendments to adjust election rules.
  - Enhances accountability and public confidence in the electoral process by establishing clear, standardized procedures.

#### **4. Miscellaneous Editorial Amendments**

- **Objective**: Improve clarity, consistency, and readability of the constitution.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Minor revisions to language, formatting, and structure to enhance understanding and accessibility.
  - Ensure alignment with current legal and administrative standards.
- **Significance**: These edits support effective implementation and interpretation of the constitution by Band Council members, staff, and the public.

### **Overall Impact and Implications**

The amendments represent a significant step toward **democratic empowerment, inclusivity, and institutional sustainability** within the Sechelt Indian Band. Key outcomes include:

- **Expanded civic participation**: All members—especially non-residents—can now vote and run for office.
- **Clearer governance frameworks**: The separation of procedural rules (in a standalone law) from constitutional provisions allows for adaptability and responsiveness to changing circumstances.
- **Enhanced self-governance**: The Band now has a more robust, transparent, and inclusive system for conducting elections and referenda, consistent with its self-government authority under the Act.
- **Future-proofing**: The creation of a dedicated election and referendum law enables future updates to election procedures without requiring constitutional changes, reducing bureaucratic and political friction.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally brings into effect the Band’s democratic will, as expressed in the May 25, 2019 referendum. It modernizes the Sechelt Indian Band’s constitution to reflect contemporary values of equity, participation, and transparency. By ensuring that all members have voting and candidacy rights, clarifying eligibility standards, and establishing a clear, adaptable procedural framework, the amendments reinforce the Band’s capacity for self-determination and effective, inclusive governance. The regulation is a milestone in the evolution of Indigenous self-government in British Columbia.
