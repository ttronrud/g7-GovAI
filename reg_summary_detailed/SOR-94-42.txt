### **3. Scope of Application**

#### **Applicable to Carriers:**
These regulations apply to **all carriers**, **except** the following:

- **Air carriers** that:
  - Serve only air terminals with fewer than 10,000 enplaned/deplaned passengers per year in the last two years,
  - Have gross annual revenue under $500,000 in either of the two preceding years,
  - Operate exclusively to serve **lodge operations** (small air services for resorts).

- **Rail carriers** only in relation to **commuter rail services**.

- **Carriers operating extra-provincial bus undertakings** (interprovincial bus services).

> *Note:* This creates a tiered exemption based on scale and service type — smaller or niche operations are exempt from mandatory training requirements.

#### **Applicable to Terminal Operators:**
Applies to **all terminal operators**, **except**:

- Air terminal operators where terminals had fewer than 10,000 enplaned/deplaned passengers in each of the two prior calendar years.
- Extra-provincial bus terminal operators.

> *Note:* Exemptions are based on passenger volume, indicating that smaller terminals are not required to meet full training obligations.

#### **Exemption from These Regulations:**
Despite Section 3, **these regulations do NOT apply** to any carrier or terminal operator that is already subject to **Part 1 of the Accessible Transportation for Persons with Disabilities Regulations (ATPD Regulations)**.

> This means that entities covered by the broader ATPD Regulations are **not subject to this more specific training regulation**, which may overlap in content but operates under a different framework.
