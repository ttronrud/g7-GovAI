### **Detailed Summary of the Public Accountability Statements (Banks, Insurance Companies, Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Authority**
These regulations are issued under the authority of the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to specific provisions in three key Canadian financial regulatory acts:

- **Section 459.3(4)a of the Bank Act**  
- **Section 489.1(4)c of the Insurance Companies Act**  
- **Section 444.2(4)e of the Trust and Loan Companies Act**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **enhance transparency and accountability** by requiring financial institutions — specifically banks, insurance companies, and trust and loan companies — to publicly disclose information about their **community development activities** and **financial practices**.

This initiative aims to ensure that these institutions contribute meaningfully to the **social, cultural, economic, and environmental enrichment of communities** across Canada.

#### **3. Scope of Affiliates Subject to Reporting**

The regulations define which **affiliates** of a declarant must be included in the public accountability statement:

- **Affiliates included**:
  - Finance entities (as defined in the *Finance Entity Regulations*), **except** those that only lend or provide credit to other affiliates.
  - Financial institutions with equity of **less than $1 billion**, **excluding** foreign institutions that operate exclusively outside Canada.

- **Affiliates excluded from direct reporting**:
  - Entities for which a public accountability statement is already published by **another declarant** during the same period. In such cases, the information is considered to be reported by the parent entity.

> This ensures that reporting does not become redundant or duplicative, and avoids unnecessary disclosure of information already covered by another entity.

- **Privacy Protection – Refusal to Report Specific Data**
