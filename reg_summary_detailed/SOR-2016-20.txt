## **Detailed Summary of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is made under **subsection 6(1)a** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act").
- The **Minister of Natural Resources** consulted the **Provincial Minister of Nova Scotia** regarding the proposed regulations.
- The Provincial Minister **approved** the regulations, thereby enabling their adoption.
- The final decision to make the regulations was taken by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources**, under **subsection 207.01(1)c** of the Act.

> 🔍 *This establishes a collaborative framework between federal and provincial governments in regulating offshore petroleum activities, with Nova Scotia’s consent ensuring regional stakeholder input.*

---

### **2. Definitions and Key Terms**
- **"Act"** refers to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*.
- The regulation defines what constitutes a **violation** under the Act and outlines the types of violations and their associated penalties.

---

### **3. What Constitutes a Violation?**

A violation is any of the following:

| Type of Violation | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Provisional Violation** | Contravention of a provision in **Part III of the Act** or a regulation made under that Part, as listed in **Column 1 of a Part of Schedule 1**. |
| **Direction/Requirement Violation** | Contravention of a direction, requirement, decision, or order issued under Part III of the Act. |
| **License/Approval Violation** | Contravention of a term or condition of an operating licence, authorization, approval, or exemption issued or granted under Part III of the Act. |

> ✅ These violations are all subject to administrative monetary penalties under **Sections 207.01 to 207.93** of the Act.

---

### **4. Classification of Violations: Type A vs. Type B**

| Violation Type | Definition |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Type A Violation** | Contravention of a provision listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 1** (as per the table in the regulation). |
| **Type B Violation** | Contravention of a direction, requirement, decision, or order under Part III of the Act (subsection 2(2)), or of a term/condition of a licence or approval (subsection 2(3)). |

> ⚠️ **Note**: All Type B violations are automatically classified as **Type B**, regardless of the specific provision.

---

### **5. Penalties (Monetary Administrative Penalties)**

- The penalty amount is determined by the **total gravity value** of the violation.
- The **penalty structure** is set out in **Schedule 2**:
  - For a **Type A violation**, the penalty is the amount in **Column 2** of Schedule 2 (corresponding to the total gravity value).
  - For a **Type B violation**, the penalty is the amount in **Column 3** of Schedule 2.

> 💡 *Penalties are not fixed per violation but are calculated based on a "gravity score" derived from specific factors.*

---

### **6. Determining the Total Gravity Value**

The total gravity value is calculated through a three-step process:

1. **Identify Criteria**  
   Each violation is assessed against the criteria listed in **Column 1** of the gravity table (in the regulation).

2. **Assign Gravity Values**  
   For each criterion, a gravity value is assigned from **Column 2** of the table.  
   - Lower values = less severity  
   - Higher values = greater severity  
   - The assignment must consider the **specific circumstances** of the violation.

3. **Sum the Values**  
   The gravity values for all applicable criteria are **added together** to produce the total gravity value.

> 📌 *This creates a risk-based, fact-sensitive penalty system that reflects the seriousness of the breach.*

---

### **7. Service of Documents (Notice and Enforcement Procedures)**

When a violation is found, the regulator must serve a notice (e.g., a compliance notice or penalty notice) on the responsible party. The method of service depends on whether the person is an **individual** or a **corporation/entity**.

#### **For Individuals:**
- Leave a copy with the individual.
- Leave a copy with an adult household member at the individual’s last known address or usual residence.
- Send a copy by **registered mail, courier, fax, or electronic means** to the individual’s address.

#### **For Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, organizations):**
- Leave a copy at the head office or place of business with an officer or individual who appears to manage or control it.
- Send by **registered mail, courier, or fax** to the head office.
- Send by **electronic means (excluding fax)** to an officer or individual who manages or controls the entity.

> 📅 **Service Date Rules:**
- **Left with a household member**: Service is deemed effective on the day it is left.
- **Sent by registered mail or courier**: Service is effective on the **10th day after the date shown on the receipt**.
- **Sent by fax or electronic means**: Service is effective on the **day of transmission**.

> ✅ This ensures enforceability and provides clear timelines for compliance and response.

---

### **8. Effective Date and Enforcement Timeline**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day that **Section 102 of the Energy Safety and Security Act** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered (published) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> 📅 *As of the note at the end: These regulations were in force as of February 27, 2016.*

## **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enforce Compliance** | Establishes a clear, structured, and proportionate penalty system to ensure adherence to offshore petroleum safety, environmental, and operational standards. |
| **Risk-Based Penalties** | Penalties are not one-size-fits-all; they reflect the severity of the violation through a gravity scoring system. |
| **Provincial Collaboration** | Demonstrates the federal-provincial partnership in offshore resource management, with Nova Scotia’s approval ensuring regional legitimacy and accountability. |
| **Clear Enforcement Procedures** | Provides detailed rules for how notices are delivered, reducing ambiguity and ensuring consistency in enforcement. |
