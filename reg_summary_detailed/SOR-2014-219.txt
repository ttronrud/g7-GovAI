**Detailed Summary of the CHFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Source**

These regulations are issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision allows the government to establish rules governing tariff preferences under international trade agreements, specifically the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement (CHFTA).

The regulations are formally enacted under:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** – This refers to the enabling clause in the *Customs Tariff Act* that authorizes the creation of tariff preference regulations.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – Likely a reference to the underlying legislative framework or prior version of the Customs Tariff or related statute.

**2. Key Definition: "Originating Goods"**

In these regulations, the term **"originating"** means that goods qualify as originating in the territory of a **Party (i.e., Canada or Honduras)** under the **rules of origin** established in **Chapter Four (Rules of Origin)** of the **Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement (CHFTA)**.

- This definition is critical because only goods that meet the rules of origin are eligible to benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the CHFTA.
- The rules of origin determine whether a product has been sufficiently transformed or processed in Canada or Honduras to be considered "originating" for the purposes of tariff preference.

**3. Eligibility for Honduras Tariff Preference**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, goods exported from Honduras are entitled to the **Honduras Tariff preference** (i.e., reduced or zero tariffs) in Canada **if** they meet one of the following two conditions:

---

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipment to Canada (No Intermediate Country)**

If the goods are shipped directly from Honduras to Canada **without passing through any other country**, the importer is entitled to tariff preference **if**:

- The shipment is made under a **through bill of lading**, or  
- The shipment is **not** under a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, **upon request by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Clearly indicates the **shipping route** and  
  - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada.

> *Note:* This provision ensures that even in the absence of a through bill of lading, the importer can still demonstrate that the goods were not transshipped through a third country, which would disqualify them from preferential treatment.

---

#### **Condition 2: Shipment Through Another Country**

If the goods are shipped **through another country** (i.e., transshipped), the importer is entitled to the tariff preference **only if**:

1. The importer provides, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** that:
   - Shows the **shipping route** and  
   - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada.

2. **Additionally**, the importer must provide a **copy of the customs control documents** that establish that:
   - The goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the third country (the country through which they passed).

> *Purpose of this requirement:* To ensure that the goods did not enter the customs territory of a third country without proper control or supervision — a safeguard against circumvention of the rules of origin or misuse of preferential treatment.

**4. Effective Date and Registration Requirements**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 43 of the Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014) comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> *Note:* This ensures that the rules are implemented in coordination with the broader legislative framework of the CHFTA and provides a clear timeline for enforcement.

> **Reference:** The regulations were published on **October 1, 2014**, under **SI/2014-74** — this is a statutory instrument (regulation) issued under the authority of the Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act.

**5. Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Promotes Trade**: Facilitates smoother and more cost-effective trade between Canada and Honduras by allowing qualifying goods to enter Canada with reduced or zero tariffs.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Requires detailed documentation to prevent fraud or misuse of preferential treatment, especially in cases involving transshipment.
- **Protects the Integrity of the Agreement**: The rules of origin and documentation requirements ensure that only genuinely "originating" goods (produced or processed in Honduras) benefit from tariff preferences.
- **Supports Economic Growth**: Encourages investment and manufacturing in Honduras by making Canadian markets more accessible for Honduran exports.

---

**Conclusion**

The **CHFTA Tariff Preference Regulations** establish a clear and enforceable framework for when Honduran goods can enjoy preferential tariff treatment when imported into Canada. By defining "originating" goods and setting strict documentation requirements—especially for transshipped goods—the regulations balance the benefits of free trade with the need to maintain compliance and prevent abuse. These rules are designed to support equitable, transparent, and sustainable trade between Canada and Honduras under the CHFTA.
