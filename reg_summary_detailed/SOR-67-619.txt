Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation, structured for clarity and understanding:

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Pay and Allowances Regulations (DSPCA)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Citation**
- The regulation is issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**.
- It is enacted under **Vote 49a of the Appropriation Act No. 7, 1967**.
- The regulation is officially titled: **Pay and Allowances Regulations (DSPCA)**.
- It may be cited as the *Pay and Allowances Regulations (DSPCA)*.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Authorized Pay (solde autorisée)**  
  This refers to the base salary or pay rate assigned to a person based on their **rank** in the Canadian Armed Forces.  
  The exact rate is determined by regulations made under the *National Defence Act* and applies to the specific rank held by the individual at the time.

- **Allowances (indemnités)**  
  These are two types of financial benefits:
  - **Subsistence allowance**: Compensation to cover living expenses (e.g., food, housing) while serving.
  - **Marriage allowance**: A benefit paid to a man upon marriage, to assist with wedding-related expenses.  
  These allowances are set at the rates **in effect on September 30, 1966**, and are governed by regulations under the *National Defence Act*.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulation applies to **men** who:
- Are covered by the **Defence Service Pension Continuation Act (DSPCA)**, and  
- After **September 30, 1966**, served in one of the following capacities:

  a. **Regular Forces** of:
     - The **Canadian Army** or  
     - The **Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)**  
     *AND*  
     held a rank **below Warrant Officer, Class 2**.

  b. **Regular Force of the Canadian Forces** (post-1966 amalgamation of Army, Air Force, and other components)  
     *AND*  
     served on **Continuous or Special Duty** in the **reserve forces** of the Canadian Forces  
     *AND*  
     held a rank **below Master Warrant Officer**.

> *Note:* The regulation specifically excludes individuals holding the rank of Warrant Officer, Class 2 or above, as well as Master Warrant Officer and higher ranks.

#### **4. Purpose and Effect (Under Sections 13 and 14 of the DSPCA)**

For the purposes of **Sections 13 and 14** of the *Defence Service Pension Continuation Act*, the regulation establishes two key provisions:

1. **Deemed Receipt of Allowances**  
   A qualifying service member is **deemed to have received** the allowances applicable to them based on their **rank** during their service period.  
   These allowances are **fixed at the rates in effect on September 30, 1966** — meaning they are not adjusted for inflation or changes after that date.

2. **Deemed Receipt of Pay Equal to the Difference**  
   The individual is also **deemed to have received** a certain amount of pay equal to:
   > **Authorized Pay – Allowances**

   This difference is referred to as the **"excess pay"**.

---

#### **5. Practical Implications**

- This regulation ensures that **pension entitlements** under the Defence Service Pension Continuation Act are calculated fairly and consistently.
- By treating service members as if they received both allowances and the excess pay (i.e., the difference between authorized pay and allowances), the government ensures that pension benefits reflect the actual compensation received during service.
- The use of **September 30, 1966** as the reference date for allowances provides a **stable, fixed benchmark** for historical calculations, especially in cases involving pension continuation or retirement benefits.
- This is particularly important for **long-term service members** who served before the modernization of pay and allowance structures.

---

#### **6. Key Historical and Contextual Notes**

- The regulation was enacted in **1967**, shortly after the **amalgamation of the Canadian Armed Forces** (Canadian Army and RCAF into the Canadian Forces).
- The reference to **September 30, 1966** suggests that this date was a key transition point — possibly when the new structure of the Canadian Forces was being implemented, and pay/allowance structures were being standardized.
- The regulation applies **only to men** — reflecting the gender-based structure of military service and pension systems at the time (a historical limitation that would no longer apply in modern policy).

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Pay and Allowances Regulations (DSPCA)** serve as a critical administrative tool to define how **pension entitlements** are calculated for male service members who served in the Canadian Armed Forces (regular or reserve) between **September 30, 1966, and the date of the regulation’s issuance**.

By establishing that such individuals are **deemed to have received**:
- Allowances (subsistence and marriage) at the 1966 rates, and  
- Pay equal to the difference between their authorized pay and those allowances,

the regulation ensures **fair and consistent pension treatment** under the Defence Service Pension Continuation Act, particularly for those serving below the warrant officer rank threshold.

This provision supports **retirement and pension equity** by recognizing actual compensation received during service, even when direct records or records of allowances may be incomplete or inconsistent.

> **Note:** This regulation is a historical document reflecting the structure and policies of the Canadian Armed Forces in the 1960s–1970s. Modern pension systems have since evolved, and current regulations may differ significantly in scope and application.
