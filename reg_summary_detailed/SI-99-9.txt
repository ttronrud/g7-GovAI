**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of *His Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which provides the legal framework for modifying land grants—specifically, the inclusion of land adjacent to certain parcels based on water-related boundaries.

This provision allows for the inclusion of land lying within a specified distance of the ordinary high water mark, particularly when such land is adjacent to water bodies or inshore areas, thereby ensuring that land rights and grants are appropriately defined in relation to natural water boundaries.

**2. Scope of the Order**  
The order specifies that **any portion of the lands described in the schedule attached to this regulation**—which are located near Fry Inlet at Contwoyto Lake in the Northwest Territories—**shall be included in the grant** of those lands **if such portions lie within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** of two specific parcels of land.

---

**3. Specific Parcels Affected**  
The two parcels in question are:  
- **Lot 1000 in Quad 76E/07** (located on the **east side** of Fry Inlet)  
- **Lot 1000 in Quad 76E/08** (located on the **west side** of Fry Inlet)

These lots are situated at **Contwoyto Lake**, within the **Northwest Territories**, and are the subject of the land grant being expanded.

**4. Definition of "Ordinary High Water Mark"**  
The term *ordinary high water mark* refers to the natural boundary of water that typically rises during normal tidal or seasonal conditions, excluding storm surges or exceptional flooding events. This boundary is used to define the limit of land that is considered subject to water influence and, under certain legal principles, may be included in land grants or subject to specific land use or ownership rules.

The 30.48 metre (100 feet) buffer zone is a standard measurement used in land surveying and land management to define land adjacent to water bodies, particularly in northern or remote areas where water levels can fluctuate seasonally.

**5. Visual Representation and Record Location**  
The affected areas are clearly marked on a **sketch plan** titled **File 33-1-10**, which is held in the **Land Management Division** of the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)** in Ottawa.  
- The parcels and the areas within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark are **outlined in yellow** on this plan.  
- This visual aid serves as a reference for land officials, surveyors, and stakeholders to identify the exact areas being included in the grant.

**6. Purpose and Implications**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to:  
- Clarify and finalize the boundaries of land grants by incorporating land adjacent to water bodies.  
- Ensure that land rights are properly defined, especially in areas subject to seasonal flooding or water level changes.  
- Provide legal certainty for land users, Indigenous communities, or government agencies involved in land management, development, or conservation.  

This inclusion may have implications for:  
- Land use planning  
- Resource management (e.g., fishing, hunting, conservation)  
- Indigenous land rights and traditional use  
- Environmental protection or flood mitigation

**7. Jurisdiction and Enforcement**  
The regulation applies to the **Northwest Territories**, and its enforcement is carried out through the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, which maintains jurisdiction over land management and Indigenous land rights in the region.

All land transactions, surveys, or administrative decisions involving these parcels must now reflect the inclusion of the 100-foot buffer zone adjacent to the ordinary high water mark.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation formally expands the grant of land at Contwoyto Lake by including any land within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark of two specific lots (Lot 1000 in Quads 76E/07 and 76E/08) located on either side of Fry Inlet. It is a legally binding order issued under the Territorial Lands Act, supported by a visual record (File 33-1-10), and serves to clarify land boundaries in a region with seasonal water fluctuations. The decision reflects both administrative precision and the importance of aligning land grants with natural hydrological boundaries.
