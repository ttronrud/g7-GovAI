**Detailed Summary of the Quebec-South Maple Products Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Quebec-South Maple Products Order* and may be cited as such. This Order establishes a regulatory framework governing the marketing of maple sugar and syrup in specific markets, particularly in interprovincial and export trade.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **Commodity Board**:  
  Refers to the *Quebec-South Maple Products Producers’ Marketing Board* (known in French as *Office de commercialisation*). This body is established under the *Plan* and is responsible for overseeing the marketing of maple products. It operates as a producer-led marketing organization with regulatory authority over the sale and distribution of maple sugar and syrup.

- **Maple Sugar and Syrup**:  
  Specifically defined as maple sugar and maple syrup produced on farms operated by producers who are bound by the *Plan*. These producers must:  
  - Be located within designated counties and parishes in the Province of Quebec.  
  - Sell their products to non-cooperative traders (i.e., traders not part of the producer cooperative or marketing board).  
  The definition excludes sales to cooperative buyers or within the cooperative framework, focusing instead on independent or third-party distribution.

- **Plan**:  
  Refers to the *Quebec-South Maple Products Producers’ Plan*, which was officially sanctioned and declared effective by the *Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board* on March 22, 1958, under the authority of the *Agricultural Marketing Act of Quebec*. This Plan serves as the foundational legal and operational document outlining the structure, functions, and powers of the Commodity Board and the marketing system for maple products.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**  

The Commodity Board is granted specific powers to regulate the marketing of maple sugar and syrup in the following markets:  
- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces of Canada)  
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada)  

This regulatory authority is derived from the powers granted to the Board under Chapter “Powers and attributions” of the *Plan*, with a critical exception.

---

**4. Scope of Powers – With Exceptions**  

The Commodity Board may exercise **all or any of the powers** it has under the *Plan* regarding the local marketing of maple sugar and syrup **within the Province of Quebec**, **provided that** it is **not** authorized to exercise the powers specified in:  

- Paragraph **(j)**  
- Paragraph **(p)**  
- Paragraph **(q)**  

of the subsection titled “And particularly” in the *Powers and attributions* chapter of the Plan.

> **Interpretation of the Exception**:  
> These three specific paragraphs likely relate to powers that involve direct control over pricing, pricing mechanisms, or internal cooperative arrangements (e.g., setting minimum prices, controlling distribution channels, or managing cooperative sales). The exclusion means that in interprovincial and export markets, the Board cannot impose price controls, manage cooperative sales, or otherwise interfere in ways that would restrict market freedom or competition in those specific areas.  
>  
> This limitation ensures that while the Board can regulate marketing and distribution in export and interprovincial contexts, it does not have the same level of control over pricing or cooperative operations as it does in domestic, local markets.

**5. Geographical Scope**  

The regulation applies only to:  
- Producers located in the counties and parishes of the Province of Quebec as listed in the attached schedule.  
- Sales to non-cooperative traders (i.e., traders outside the cooperative or marketing board structure).  

This ensures that the regulatory framework is geographically and commercially targeted, protecting the interests of producers in a defined region while excluding broader or unregulated markets.

---

**6. Purpose and Context**  

This Order is part of a broader system designed to:  
- Stabilize market conditions for maple products  
- Prevent unfair competition in interprovincial and export markets  
- Ensure fair pricing and distribution  
- Protect the interests of producers by creating a structured marketing framework  

By limiting certain powers in export and interprovincial trade, the Order balances producer protection with market openness and competition.

---

**Conclusion**  

The *Quebec-South Maple Products Order* empowers the Quebec-South Maple Products Producers’ Marketing Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of maple sugar and syrup, with clear boundaries on its authority. While it can exercise most of the powers granted under the 1958 Plan for local marketing, it is explicitly prohibited from exercising the powers related to pricing, cooperative control, or specific internal trade mechanisms (paragraphs j, p, and q). This reflects a regulatory approach that supports producer interests while maintaining market flexibility and preventing monopolistic or restrictive practices in broader markets.

---

**Key Takeaway**:  
This Order creates a targeted, producer-focused marketing regime for maple products in Quebec, with a clear delineation between domestic control and market-based regulation in interprovincial and export trade.
