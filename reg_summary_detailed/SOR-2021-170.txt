## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Minor Works Order (S.C. 2019, c. 28, ss. 61(4) and (5))**

### 📌 **Overview**
This regulation establishes a legal framework for the **installation, modification, removal, or maintenance of "minor works"** in Canada’s navigable waters. It was issued by the **Minister of Transport** on **June 28, 2021**, pursuant to **subsection 28(2)(a)** of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act (CNWA)*.

The primary objective is to **minimize interference with navigation** while allowing necessary infrastructure development — such as power lines, pipelines, docks, and erosion protection — to proceed with appropriate safety and regulatory oversight.

> ⚠️ Key Principle: A "minor work" is defined as any structure or installation that is **not likely to interfere with navigation** and meets strict dimensional, location, and functional criteria.

## 🏷️ Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (CNWA) |
| **Aerial Cables** | Cables suspended in the air, including towers and poles |
| **Charted Navigable Water** | A navigable water with official nautical charts from the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) or U.S. NOAA |
| **Erosion-Protection Work** | Stones, rocks, concrete, logs, or living plants placed to prevent bank erosion |
| **Navigation Channel** | A marked channel on a nautical chart or designated by a government/port authority |

## ✅ What Constitutes a "Minor Work"?

A work qualifies as a **minor work** if it meets **all** of the following criteria:

1. **Purpose**: Installed **exclusively** for the construction, placement, alteration, rebuilding, removal, decommissioning, repair, or maintenance of another minor work.
2. **Location**:
   - Not situated **in, on, over, under, through, or across** a **navigation channel**.
   - If no navigation channel exists, must not be in or across a **navigation route**.
3. **Size Limit**:
   - Does **not occupy more than one-third of the width** of the navigable water.

> ⚠️ If a minor work disturbs the bed contours to the point of interfering with navigation, the owner must **restore the original bed** upon completion.

## 📚 Categories of Minor Works & Their Specific Criteria

### 1. **Erosion-Protection Works**
- Must be **integrated with and follow the natural bank slope**.
- Submerged part may extend into water only if it follows the bed slope.
- Maximum horizontal extension: **5 meters** into the water.
- Must not exceed **one-third of the water’s width**.
- **Excluded**: Groynes (structures built transversely to deflect current).

> *Purpose*: Prevent erosion without obstructing navigation.

---

### 2. **Docks and Boathouses**
Designated as minor works if:
- Located **≥5 meters** from adjacent property lines.
- Located **>10 meters** from any other work in the water (unless owned by same entity).
- Located **≥30 meters** from any navigation channel (or not in a navigation route).
- Horizontal extension:
  - No more than the length of a **similar dock** within **100 meters** on the same bank (max **50 meters**).
  - Or no more than **30 meters** in any other case.
- Does **not occupy more than one-third of the water width**.
- Not associated with non-minor works.
- Not used for float planes or aircraft with floats.

> *Note*: "Similar" means same use (commercial/recreational) and ownership (public/private).

---

### 3. **Slipways / Boat-Launching Ramps**
Designated as minor works if:
- Does **not include a marine railway**.
- Located **≥5 meters** from property boundaries.
- The portion **below OHWM lies on the bed** of the water.
- Not associated with non-minor works.

---

### 4. **Aerial Cables**
Designated as minor works if:
- Used **only for power or telecommunications**.
- Not over or across:
  - Charted navigable waters or navigation channels.
  - Canadian heritage rivers, harbors, or historic canals (per *Historic Canals Regulations*).
- Towers and poles **not located between OHWMs** on either side of the water.
- Meets **CAN/CSA C22.3 No. 1, Section 5.3.3** standards (safety and design).

> ⚠️ Amendments to one language version of the standard are not effective until the other version is updated.

---

### 5. **Submarine Cables**
Designated as minor works if:
- Used only for power or telecom.
- Lies **on or buried under** the bed of the water.
- Does **not extend vertically above the bed** beyond:
  - **5% of water depth** (if water <15 m deep).
  - **1 meter** (in all other cases).
- Not located at or under **port entrances** (including marinas).
- Not in areas of **routine dredging**.
- Not in **anchorage areas** (marked on CHS or NOAA charts).

> 🚨 If the cable is no longer on or buried, the owner must **re-bury or remove it as soon as feasible**.

---

### 6. **Buried Pipelines**
Designated as minor works if:
- Buried **under the bed** of the water.
- Not in areas of **routine dredging**.
- Not in **anchorage areas**.

> 🔧 **Special Rule for Water Width >50 m**:
- Must use **horizontal directional drilling (HDD)** method during installation.
- If HDD uses guiding cables:
  - Only **cables and necessary equipment** may be placed in the water.
  - Equipment must not extend vertically above the bed beyond:
    - **5% of water depth** (if <15 m).
    - **1 meter** (otherwise).

> 🚨 If burial disturbs bed contours to interfere with navigation, the owner must **restore the bed**.

---

### 7. **Attached Pipelines or Cables**
Designated as minor works if:
- Attached to an **existing approved work** (validly constructed under the Act).
