**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Prescribing Circumstances for Granting Waivers Pursuant to Section 147 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under **Section 145 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999**, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to adopt regulations that define the circumstances under which waivers may be granted under **Section 147 of CEPA**.

- **Section 147 of CEPA** allows the Minister of the Environment to grant waivers from certain environmental requirements when there is a **justifiable and compelling reason**, such as a national emergency or critical shortage of fuel.
- The regulation was initially proposed on **November 14, 2009**, and published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, giving stakeholders a period to submit comments or file a notice of objection. This public consultation process is a key component of Canada’s regulatory transparency and accountability framework.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear, objective, and legally defined criteria** under which the federal government may grant waivers from environmental requirements — specifically those imposed under CEPA — when an **actual or anticipated shortage of fuel** occurs and poses a direct threat to national interests, public safety, or emergency response capabilities.

This ensures that environmental protections are not unnecessarily applied during times of crisis, while still maintaining a balance between environmental responsibility and national security or emergency preparedness.

### **3. Eligible Circumstances for Granting a Waiver**

A waiver may be granted under Section 147 of CEPA **only if one of the following conditions is met**:

#### **Condition 1: Fuel Shortage and a Government-Declared Emergency or Order**

An actual or anticipated shortage of fuel exists **and** one of the following actions has been taken by a federal or provincial authority:

- A **proclamation by the Governor in Council** under any of the following provisions of the *Emergencies Act*:
  - Subsection 6(1)
  - Subsection 17(1)
  - Subsection 28(1)
  - Subsection 38(1)

> These provisions allow the federal government to declare a state of emergency in response to threats such as natural disasters, public safety risks, or national security incidents.

- An **order issued by the Governor in Council** under **subsection 15(1) of the Energy Supplies Emergency Act**.

> This Act specifically addresses fuel and energy supply emergencies and enables the government to take emergency measures to ensure energy availability during critical shortages.

- A **declaration of emergency in a province**, issued by a **responsible provincial authority** that is duly authorized by the applicable provincial emergency legislation.

> This recognizes that provincial governments may also face fuel shortages and can act in emergency situations within their jurisdiction, provided they have legal authority under provincial law.

#### **Condition 2: Fuel Shortage Affecting National Security**

An actual or anticipated shortage of fuel exists **and** the **Minister of National Defence** has advised the Minister of the Environment in writing that the shortage:

- Affects or could affect the **Government of Canada’s ability to**:
  - Protect **national security**,
  - Support **humanitarian relief efforts**,
  - Participate in **multilateral military or peacekeeping activities** under the auspices of international organizations, or
  - Defend a **member state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**.

> This condition underscores the importance of national defense and international obligations, ensuring that fuel availability is critical to Canada’s ability to fulfill its security and diplomatic commitments.

### **4. Key Provisions and Interpretation**

- **"Actual or anticipated shortage of fuel"** is a central criterion. It includes both confirmed shortages and situations where a significant risk of shortage is evident (e.g., due to supply chain disruptions, extreme weather, or geopolitical events).
- The regulation does **not** allow waivers based on general economic hardship or routine operational challenges. The trigger must be a **specific, severe, and immediate** fuel shortage with direct consequences.
- The **advice from the Minister of National Defence** must be **in writing**, ensuring formal documentation and accountability.
- The regulation **repeals a previous provision** (SOR/2018-246, s. 1), which had previously been used to define similar circumstances. This reflects an update to ensure the current criteria are aligned with current emergency frameworks and policy priorities.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This ensures immediate applicability upon formal adoption, allowing for prompt action in emergency scenarios.

---

### **6. Implications and Significance**

- **Balances Environmental Protection and National Interests**: The regulation allows for flexibility in environmental compliance during emergencies without undermining CEPA’s core environmental safeguards.
- **Enhances Crisis Response Capacity**: It enables the federal government to respond quickly to fuel shortages that threaten public safety, national security, or international obligations.
- **Provides Legal Clarity**: By clearly defining the conditions for waivers, the regulation reduces ambiguity and ensures consistent application across different situations.
- **Stakeholder Accountability**: The prior public consultation process ensures that the regulation reflects input from affected parties and maintains democratic oversight.

---

### **7. Limitations and Considerations**

- Waivers are **not automatic** and must be justified based on the specific circumstances outlined.
- The regulation does **not cover all types of environmental requirements** — it applies only to those under CEPA that may be impacted by fuel shortages.
- Environmental assessments or mitigation measures may still be required, even after a waiver is granted, depending on the nature of the activity.

### **Conclusion**

These Regulations Prescribing Circumstances for Granting Waivers Pursuant to Section 147 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, provide a **clear, legally grounded, and timely framework** for granting environmental waivers during fuel-related emergencies. By linking such waivers to specific, high-stakes events — including national security threats and formal emergency declarations — the regulation ensures that environmental protection is maintained while allowing for necessary flexibility in times of crisis. It represents a critical tool for managing the intersection of environmental policy and national emergency management in Canada.
