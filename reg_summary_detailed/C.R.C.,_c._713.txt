2. **Applicability to Requestors:**  
   Any individual or organization that requests and receives a microfilm copy of geological, geophysical, or well-history data is required to pay the fee as prescribed in the Minister’s order. This includes both government and private parties accessing such data for research, exploration, or other legitimate purposes.

3. **Regulatory Context:**
