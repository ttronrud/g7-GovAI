### **3. Request Process for Indemnification or Advance**

A request for indemnification or advance must be submitted **in writing** to the **Secretary of the Treasury Board** as soon as feasible after:
- The individual becomes a party to an action or proceeding, or
- The individual incurs a cost, charge, or expense.

#### **Required Elements of the Request:**
1. **Capacity and Service Period**  
   - Specifies the director/officer’s role and tenure in the Crown corporation.

2. **Nature of the Action or Proceeding**  
   - A clear description of the legal or administrative matter.

3. **Amount Requested and Previously Approved Amounts**  
   - Total amount sought, plus any prior approvals for the same proceeding.

4. **Court or Document Records**  
   - Copy of court documents or exchanged correspondence that include:
     - Material facts relied upon
     - Relief claimed (e.g., damages, injunctions)

5. **Legal Counsel Details**  
   - Name of retained or intended legal counsel.

6. **Detailed Accounting of Costs**  
   - Full breakdown of all incurred costs, charges, and expenses, including:
     - Amounts paid to settle the matter or satisfy judgments
     - Estimated future costs

7. **Supporting Invoices and Documentation**  
   - Copies of invoices and other financial records reflecting payments or obligations.

8. **Information to Rebut Presumptions**  
   - Any information that may counter a presumption of non-entitlement under section 3 of the FAA.

---

### **4. Presumption of Non-Entitlement**

A director or officer is **presumed not to have fulfilled** the condition in **paragraph 119(1)(a)** of the FAA if:
- The individual **initiated** the action or proceeding (unless it is part of a legitimate defense to a claim); or  
- The **Crown corporation initiated** the action or proceeding against the director/officer.

This presumption can be rebutted with evidence showing that the action was not initiated unreasonably or in bad faith.

---

### **5. Decision-Making Authority and Timelines**

The decision on a request is made based on the **total amount** requested (plus any previously approved amounts):

| Total Amount | Decision-Making Body | Notification Timeline |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| ≤ $100,000 | Secretary of the Treasury Board | Within **30 days** |
| > $100,000 but ≤ $250,000 | President of the Treasury Board | Within **30 days** |
| > $250,000 | Treasury Board | Within **90 days** |

> All decisions must be made in writing and communicated to the applicant.

#### **If a Request is Rejected:**
- The notice must **include clear reasons** for the rejection.

---

### **6. Criteria for Assessing Reasonableness of Costs**

When evaluating whether incurred costs are reasonable, the decision-maker (Secretary, President, or Treasury Board) considers:
- Whether legal counsel was **necessary** before the action began.
- **Skill, experience, and expertise** of the legal counsel.
- **Complexity and novelty** of the matter.
- **Value or monetary stakes** involved (e.g., assets, financial exposure).
- **Time spent** by legal counsel.
- **Number of documents prepared**.
- **Location and circumstances** of service (e.g., remote work, urgent matters).

> These factors help ensure that reimbursements are justified and not excessive.

---

### **7. Key Principles – No Automatic Rejection**

Requests **shall not be denied** solely because:
- The director or officer **acted negligently**; or  
- The individual **agreed to a settlement** of the action or proceeding.

> This protects individuals from being penalized for errors or decisions made in good faith during investigations or disputes.

---

### **8. Conditions for Approval (Obligations of the Individual)**

Any approval of indemnification or advance is **conditional** upon the individual providing the following:

1. **Written Undertaking to Reimburse**  
   - A formal agreement to repay any amounts to which they are **not entitled**.

2. **Authorization to Pay to Her Majesty**  
   - Written consent to pay any **costs, awards, or settlements** received or awarded to the individual directly to Her Majesty (i.e., the Crown).

3. **Notification of Substantial Changes**  
   - Written notification of any significant changes to the information provided under subsection 2(2), including:
     - Settlements or changes in liability
     - Changes in scope or outcome

4. **Progress Reports (if approval is given prior to conclusion)**  
   - Monthly submission of invoices and supporting documents reflecting costs incurred.

5. **Final Accounting at Conclusion**  
   - At the end of the action or proceeding, a final accounting of all amounts advanced must be submitted.  
   - The individual must **reimburse any unspent or improperly advanced funds**.

> These conditions ensure accountability and prevent misuse of funds.

---

### **9. Repayment of Indemnified or Advanced Amounts**

Amounts may be repaid if any of the following occur:
- The conditions in **section 10** (above) are not met;
- The approval was based on **misrepresentation** or **concealment of a material fact**;
- The payment resulted from an **administrative error**.

> Repayment is not automatic but triggered only when specific grounds are established.

---

### **10. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day they are **registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized under the laws of Canada).

### **Summary of Key Principles**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|

### **Conclusion**

The *Indemnification and Advances Regulations* provide a **structured, fair, and accountable framework** for supporting Crown corporation executives facing legal challenges. They balance the need to protect public servants from undue financial risk with the requirement to maintain fiscal responsibility and transparency.
