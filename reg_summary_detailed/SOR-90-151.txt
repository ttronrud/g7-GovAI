**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of the Order:**  
*Corporation de chauffage urbain de Montréal (CCUM) Incorporation and Sale Authorization Order*

**Legal Basis:**  
This Order is issued under the authority granted by **subsection 91(6)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), which allows the Governor in Council (the federal government) to approve or revoke orders related to the financial and corporate activities of federal institutions or entities, particularly when such activities are deemed to be within the scope of federal powers.

The authorization is specifically grounded in **paragraphs 91(1)(a)** and **91(1)(d)** of the Financial Administration Act:

- **Paragraph 91(1)(a)**: Grants the federal government the power to authorize the undertaking of transactions by entities that are "corporations established under the laws of Canada" or "corporations established under the laws of a province" for the purpose of carrying out federal policy objectives.
- **Paragraph 91(1)(d)**: Provides authority for the federal government to authorize transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of shares in corporations, particularly where such actions serve public interest or national policy goals.

This Order is issued **on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board**, indicating that it is a policy decision supported by both transportation and financial oversight bodies.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

1. **Authorize the Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail)** to:
   - **Procure the incorporation** of the *Corporation de chauffage urbain de Montréal (CCUM)* under the laws of the Province of Quebec.
   - **Subsequently sell 70% of the issued and outstanding shares** of CCUM to *Compagnie internationale financière et industrielle du Québec (CIFIQ Inc.)*.

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Incorporation of CCUM:**
   - CN Rail is authorized to establish CCUM as a corporation under the laws of Quebec.
   - Upon incorporation, **all shares of CCUM will be held by CN Rail**.
   - This step ensures that CN Rail has full control over the new entity at the outset.

2. **Share Sale to CIFIQ Inc.:**
   - CN Rail is authorized to **sell 70% of CCUM’s issued and outstanding shares** to CIFIQ Inc., a Quebec-based financial and industrial company.
   - The sale must be completed **on or before December 31, 1990**.
   - The remaining 30% of the shares will remain with CN Rail, preserving its continued interest in the entity.

3. **Scope and Limitations:**
   - The Order is limited in time and scope — it only authorizes the incorporation and the sale of 70% of shares.
   - It does not authorize ongoing operations, management, or financial obligations of CCUM beyond the initial incorporation and the sale transaction.

**Background and Context:**
- This Order **revokes** the prior Order in Council **P.C. 1988-2254**, dated September 29, 1988, which had originally authorized a similar transaction involving CCUM.
- The revocation suggests a **change in policy or strategic direction** by the federal government, possibly due to revised economic assessments, regulatory considerations, or shifts in transportation or energy policy.
- The transaction reflects a broader trend in the 1980s and 1990s of **public-private partnerships** in urban infrastructure, where rail companies or state-owned entities would partner with private investors to develop energy or municipal services.

---

**Significance of CCUM:**
- CCUM (Corporation de chauffage urbain de Montréal) is a **municipal heating utility** responsible for providing heating services in Montreal.
- By involving CN Rail — a major national transportation company — in the creation and partial sale of CCUM, the federal government may have been aiming to:
  - Leverage CN Rail’s financial and operational expertise.
  - Promote regional economic development in Quebec.
  - Encourage private investment in public infrastructure.
  - Support energy infrastructure development in a major urban center.

---

**Legal and Policy Implications:**

- **Federal Oversight:** The Order underscores the federal government’s role in overseeing and authorizing corporate actions by private entities, even when those entities are incorporated in a province.
- **Public Interest Justification:** The use of federal authority to approve a private share sale suggests that the transaction was deemed to serve a broader public interest, such as energy security or economic development.
- **Limited Duration:** The deadline of December 31, 1990, implies a time-bound strategic initiative, possibly tied to a specific economic or policy window.

---

**Citation and Publication:**
- The Order is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **October 21, 1988**, under **SOR/88-513**, page 4268.
- It may be cited as:  
  *Corporation de chauffage urbain de Montréal (CCUM) Incorporation and Sale Authorization Order*.

---

**Conclusion:**
This regulation authorizes the Canadian National Railway Company to establish a new municipal heating corporation in Montreal and to sell a majority (70%) of its shares to a Quebec-based industrial and financial company by December 31, 1990. It reflects a strategic federal intervention in private corporate activity to promote public infrastructure development and regional economic growth, while operating within the legal framework of the *Financial Administration Act*. The revocation of a prior order indicates a shift in policy direction, likely based on updated economic or strategic assessments.
