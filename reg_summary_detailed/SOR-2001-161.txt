**Detailed Summary of the Iodinated Contrast Media Anti-Dumping Duty Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, made under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff** and on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, establishes a **remission (reduction or waiver)** of anti-dumping duties for certain **iodinated contrast media products** imported into Canada from the **United States**. The order applies specifically to products used in **radiographic imaging** (e.g., X-rays), with **low osmolality** (less than 900 mOsm/kg H₂O), and is based on a detailed methodology tied to price comparisons, cost analysis, and specific manufacturer-importer relationships.

The remission is granted to **mitigate the impact of anti-dumping duties** on certain products where a **compensatory arrangement** or **market pricing dynamics** suggest that the actual cost to Canadian importers is not reflective of dumping, especially when products are sold under similar conditions.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Comparable Iodinated Contrast Media Product** | A product identified as a "close equivalent" based on active ingredient, strength, packaging, and sales format. Used to benchmark pricing and determine duty remission. |
| **Compensatory Arrangement** | Any agreement (direct or indirect) affecting price, net return to exporter, net cost to importer, or payment of duties—such as rebates, volume-based incentives, or price adjustments. |
| **Cost and Profit Amount** | A calculated figure representing total costs (import, distribution, marketing) plus a profit margin, derived using specific methodologies in the schedule. |
| **Import Value** | The value of the product after deducting cost and profit; used to compare against the reference value. |
| **Iodinated Contrast Media** | Low-osmolality (≤900 mOsm/kg H₂O) contrast agents used in radiographic imaging, originating or exported from the United States. |
| **Period of Investigation** | July 1, 1998 – June 30, 1999. This was the timeframe used in the final dumping determination under the *Special Import Measures Act*. |
| **Reference Value** | A benchmark price per millilitre, derived from export prices adjusted by a percentage (e.g., +11.72% or +22.51%), used to determine if dumping occurred. |
| **Resale Price** | The delivered price to a Canadian end-user, minus all discounts, rebates, incentives, and compensatory arrangements (including duty payments), regardless of timing or volume. |

## **Purpose and Scope of the Remission**

The primary purpose is to **remit anti-dumping duties** on iodinated contrast media products **originating in or exported from the U.S.**, where:

- The product was **imported on or after December 31, 1999**, and
- The duties paid were **higher than those calculated using a specific methodology** tied to the reference value.

The remission is **not automatic** and is **conditional** and **limited to specific product lines and companies**.

## **Eligible Product Groups and Remission Rules**

### **1. Products from Searle Ltd. → Nycomed Amersham Canada Ltd. (1999 portion of investigation)**
- Applies to products **identical** to those exported by Searle Ltd. and imported by Nycomed Amersham Canada Ltd. during **January 1, 1999 – June 30, 1999**.
- **Reference Value Calculation**:
  - Start with the export price per ml (from the 1999 final determination under section 25 of the *Special Import Measures Act*).
  - Increase it by **11.72%**.
- **Cost and Profit Amount**:
  - Calculate a weighted average of:
    - Export prices (Searle Ltd.)
    - Resale prices (Nycomed Amersham Canada Ltd.)
  - Subtract weighted average export price from weighted average resale price → express as a percentage of export price.
  - Multiply reference value by that percentage.
- **Import Value**:
  - Resale price minus cost and profit amount.
- **Duty Remission Amount**:
  - The difference between the **reference value** and the **import value**.
  - If import value is below reference value, remission is **reduced by the difference**.

> ✅ This group benefits from a **price-based benchmark** tied to actual resale and export data.

---

### **2. Products from Bristol-Myers Squibb → Bracco Diagnostics Canada Inc. (Full Period of Investigation)**
- Applies to all identical products exported by Bristol-Myers Squibb and imported by Bracco Diagnostics Canada Inc. during the **entire period of investigation** (July 1, 1998 – June 30, 1999).
- **Reference Value Calculation**:
  - Increase export price per ml by **22.51%**.
- **Cost and Profit Amount**:
  - Establish a weighted average reference value for the company.
  - Subtract that from **28.5¢ per ml**.
- **Import Value**:
  - Resale price minus cost and profit amount.
- **Duty Remission Amount**:
  - Reference value minus import value.

> ⚠️ This group has a **higher reference value increase** (22.51%), suggesting a more significant adjustment to account for market conditions.

---

### **3. Other Searle or Bristol-Myers Products (Not Covered in 1 or 2)**
- Applies to **other** products exported by Searle or Bristol-Myers and imported by Nycomed or Bracco, **excluding** those covered in (a) or (b).
- **Reference Value**:
  - Equal to the reference value of the **comparable product** (same active ingredient, strength, packaging, sales unit).
- **Import Value**:
  - Resale price minus cost and profit amount of the comparable product.
- **Duty Remission**:
  - Reference value minus import value.

> 🔍 Uses **comparability** to ensure fair pricing across similar products.

---

### **4. All Other Products (Non-Searle/Non-BMS)**
- Applies to any iodinated contrast media product imported by **any other entity** not listed in (a), (b), or (c).
- **Reference Value**:
  - Derived from **public interest prices** of comparable products.
    - Public interest price = reference value + cost and profit amount of comparable product.
    - Weighted average of these public interest prices across comparable products.
- **Cost and Profit Amount**:
  - Includes:
    - Taxes and duties (excluding anti-dumping duties)
    - Post-importation costs and expenses
    - Profit margin (as per sections 20–22 of the *Special Import Measures Regulations*)
    - Additional shipping/preparation costs beyond normal export sales
    - All other export/shipment-related costs
- **Reference Value**:
  - Public interest price minus cost and profit amount.
- **Import Value**:
  - Resale price minus cost and profit amount.
- **Duty Remission**:
  - Reference value minus import value.

> 📌 This is the most **broad and complex** category, using **public interest pricing** to reflect what would be a fair market price, adjusted for cost and profit.

---

## **Adjustments Over Time**

- The **reference value** and **cost and profit amount** are **reindexed annually** on **September 1**.
- Indexing is based on the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** for the **previous one-year period ending June 30**.
- This ensures that the remission remains **realistic and inflation-adjusted** over time.
