**Detailed Summary of the Withdrawal from Disposal Order (Contwoyto Lake, N.W.T.)**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

This regulation, known as the *Withdrawal from Disposal Order (Contwoyto Lake, N.W.T.)*, was issued by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. It is grounded in **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the federal government to withdraw certain lands from disposal for specific purposes, particularly those related to **Indigenous land claims**.

The **primary purpose** of this Order is to **withdraw specific parcels of land in the Northwest Territories** from being available for disposal (i.e., sale, lease, or other forms of commercial development) so that they can be used to facilitate the **settlement of native land claims**, particularly those involving the Inuit and other First Nations communities in the Contwoyto Lake region.

### **2. Scope of the Withdrawal**

The lands described in **Schedule A** (not explicitly detailed in your text but referenced) are being withdrawn from disposal. Specifically, the Order identifies two key parcels:

#### **Parcel (a): 01/76E**
- **Location**: West side of Fry Inlet, Contwoyto Lake
- **Area**: Approximately **406 square kilometers** (about 157 square miles)
- **Includes**: All lands within a **300-meter buffer zone** along the boundary of the parcel

#### **Parcel (b): 02/76E**
- **Location**: East side of Fry Inlet, Contwoyto Lake
- **Area**: Approximately **166 square kilometers** (about 64 square miles)
- **Includes**: All lands within a **300-meter buffer zone** along the boundary of the parcel

> These parcels are referenced on the **National Topographic Series Map 76E**, which is officially on file at the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development’s Land Resources Division in Yellowknife. The map is titled *"Inuit Fee Simple Lands at Contwoyto Lake"* and was signed on August 21, 1992, by:
> - The Tungavik Federation of Nunavut  
> - The Government of the Northwest Territories  
> - The Government of Canada  

This map serves as the official geographic and legal basis for the withdrawal.

### **3. Duration of Withdrawal**

The withdrawal from disposal is effective **for a period ending on May 31, 1995**, **or** when:
- The **survey plan** is officially registered in the **Land Titles Office**, **and**
- **Certificates of Title** are issued

The withdrawal will **terminate first** on the earlier of these two events. This means that the land remains protected from disposal until either the survey is completed and titles are issued, or the deadline of May 31, 1995 is reached — whichever occurs sooner.

### **4. Exclusions from the Withdrawal**

Importantly, the Order **does not apply** to certain existing rights, interests, or permits that are already in place or in good standing. These are explicitly excluded from the withdrawal:

- **Located or recorded mineral claims or prospecting permits** under the *Canada Mining Regulations*  
- **Surface lease rights** on mineral claims, as governed by the *Territorial Lands Regulations*  
- **Rights in good standing** under:
  - Section 8 of the *Territorial Lands Act* or
  - The *Territorial Lands Regulations*  
- **Permits, special renewal permits, and leases** in good standing under:
  - The *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations*  
- **Permits in good standing** under the *Territorial Quarrying Regulations*  
- **Existing rights and interests** granted under:
  - The *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*  
  - The *Territorial Coal Regulations*  
  - The *Territorial Dredging Regulations*  
- **Interests in lands described in "Exhibit 2"** to the *Acquisition Agreement dated May 5, 1988* among:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada  
  - The Northern Canada Power Commission  
  - The Government of the Northwest Territories  
  - The Northwest Territories Power Corporation  

> This means that existing commercial or energy-related interests in these lands are **not affected** by the withdrawal and may continue to operate under their existing legal frameworks.

### **5. Inclusion of Mineral and Hydrocarbon Rights**

The Order explicitly includes **all mines and minerals**, including:
- Solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons (oil, gas, etc.)
- Any rights to work such minerals

This indicates that while the land itself is withdrawn from general disposal, **mining rights** are not automatically extinguished — they remain subject to the existing regulatory regime, provided they are in good standing.

---

### **6. Legal and Policy Significance**

- **Indigenous Rights and Land Claims Settlement**: This Order is a critical step in fulfilling commitments to Indigenous peoples, particularly the Inuit, to settle land claims through formal agreements. By protecting these lands from development or sale, it supports the implementation of negotiated land rights and self-governance.
  
- **Land Use Planning**: The 300-meter buffer zones suggest a need to preserve ecological, cultural, or community access areas around the core parcels, possibly to protect traditional use areas, waterways, or infrastructure.

- **Inter-Governmental Cooperation**: The involvement of Tungavik, the NW Territories government, and the federal government reflects a collaborative approach to land governance and Indigenous self-determination.

- **Temporal Limitation**: The May 31, 1995 deadline reflects a historical policy framework where land settlement and title registration were to be completed within a defined timeframe. While this date is now long past, the Order’s structure may have been intended to ensure timely resolution of land claims during the 1990s.

### **Conclusion**

The *Withdrawal from Disposal Order (Contwoyto Lake, N.W.T.)* is a legally binding instrument designed to protect specific lands in the Contwoyto Lake area from commercial development and disposal in order to support the resolution of Indigenous land claims. It reflects a commitment to Indigenous rights, land stewardship, and intergovernmental cooperation. While the original deadline of May 31, 1995, has long passed, the Order remains a foundational document in the legal and historical framework of land claims settlement in the Northwest Territories, particularly in relation to Inuit land rights and the broader process of self-determination.
