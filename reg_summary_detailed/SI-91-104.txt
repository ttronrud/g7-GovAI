**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization to Prescribe a Fee on Guaranteed Student Loans (Post-July 31, 1991)

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **paragraph 19.1(b)** of the **Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada and the Treasury Board) the authority to authorize the prescription of fees by order, specifically in relation to government loans.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authority to Prescribe a Fee:**  
   The Secretary of State of Canada is authorized to issue an order that establishes a **fee based on a percentage of the amount of the loan**. This fee is to be applied to **full-time students** who receive **guaranteed student loans** under the **Canada Student Loans Act**.

2. **Applicability Date:**  
   The fee applies **only to students to whom guaranteed student loans are made after July 31, 1991**. This means that the regulation does not affect loans issued prior to or on July 31, 1991. It is a new mechanism introduced to address financial administration and recovery issues in the post-1991 student loan framework.

3. **Nature of the Fee:**  
   The fee is **a percentage-based charge** calculated on the **total amount of the loan**. It is not a fixed fee but is proportional to the loan amount, which allows for a more equitable and scalable approach to fee collection depending on the size of the loan.

4. **Purpose of the Fee:**  
   While the regulation does not explicitly state the purpose, such fees are typically intended to:
   - Cover administrative and operational costs associated with the management and servicing of student loans.
   - Generate revenue to support the sustainability of the student loan program.
   - Provide a mechanism for the government to recover costs or ensure long-term funding for loan guarantees.

5. **Legal Process and Governance:**  
   The authority to issue such an order is exercised through a formal process:
   - The Secretary of State of Canada and the Treasury Board recommend the fee.
   - The Governor General in Council (as the formal head of the federal government) approves and issues the order.
   - This ensures that the decision is made with proper governmental oversight and accountability.

6. **Scope of Application:**  
   The fee applies only to **full-time students** receiving guaranteed student loans. This implies that part-time students or other categories of borrowers may not be subject to this fee, unless otherwise specified in a subsequent order.

**Significance and Context:**

This regulation reflects a shift in the Canadian government’s approach to student loan administration. By introducing a percentage-based fee after July 31, 1991, the government aimed to:
- Improve financial accountability and transparency.
- Ensure that the cost of providing and managing student loans is more directly linked to the scale of the loans issued.
- Provide a mechanism to fund loan administration without relying solely on general taxation or direct government appropriations.

It is important to note that this regulation is **not a change to the eligibility or availability of student loans**, but rather a procedural and financial adjustment related to the cost of administering those loans.

**Conclusion:**

The regulation authorizes the Canadian government to impose a **percentage-based fee on guaranteed student loans** issued to full-time students **after July 31, 1991**, under the Canada Student Loans Act. This fee is established through a formal order under the Financial Administration Act and is designed to cover administrative and operational costs. The regulation enhances financial sustainability and accountability in the student loan system while maintaining eligibility and access for eligible students.
