The primary objective is to support trade between Canada and Chile by reducing the cost of importing specific textile and apparel products, thereby promoting economic integration and competitiveness in the textile sector.

The remission applies only to the **difference in duty** between the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff rate** and the **applicable Chilean tariff rate** that would otherwise be payable.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is enacted under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which authorizes duty remissions for goods under free trade agreements.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Apparel** | Goods in Chapters 61 and 62 of the List of Tariff Provisions that are cut or knit to shape and sewn or assembled in Chile using fabric or yarn produced or obtained outside the free trade area (i.e., outside Canada and Chile). |

| **Spun Yarn** | Cotton or man-made fibre yarns produced in Chile from fibre (cotton or man-made) originating outside the free trade area. Yarns must fall under headings 52.05–52.07 or 55.09–55.11. |

### **4. Scope of Duty Remission**

- **Eligible Goods**: Apparel, fabric and made-up goods, and spun yarn.
- **Eligible Importers**: Importers or owners of goods imported from Chile.
- **Effective Date**: Imports are eligible **on or after January 1, 1998**.
- **Remission Amount**: The duty remitted equals the **difference** between:
  - The customs duty payable under the **MFN tariff rate**, and  
  - The customs duty that would have been payable under the **Chilean tariff rate** (i.e., the preferential rate under the C–CFTA).

> Example: If a garment has an MFN duty of $10 and a Chilean tariff of $2, the remission is $8.

### **5. Annual Quantitative Limits**

- The remission is **not unlimited** and is subject to **annual quantitative caps** per product type.
- These limits are specified in **Schedules 5.B.1, 5.B.2, and 5.B.3** of **Appendix 5.1 to Chapter C** of the Canada–Chile Free Trade Agreement.
- These schedules define the maximum quantities (in tonnes or units) of each eligible product that can qualify for duty remission per year.

> This ensures that the benefit is shared fairly and does not distort trade or overwhelm Canadian customs systems.

### **6. Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for duty remission, importers must meet **three key conditions**:

#### **(a) Certificate Requirement**
At the time the goods are **accounted for** under subsections 32(1), (3), or (5) of the *Customs Act* (i.e., when goods are cleared or when a refund is applied for), the importer must provide:
- A **certificate issued under the Export and Import Permits Act and Import Certificate Regulations**, which confirms:
  - The quantity of goods available for remission or refund under Chapter C of the C–CFTA.

#### **(b) Written Declaration**
The importer must submit a **written declaration in English or French** stating:
- That the certification required under (a) is in the importer’s possession.

#### **(c) Exporter Certification**
At the time of **release of goods** or **at any time after** the declaration in (b) is provided, the importer must submit:
- A **certification from the exporter** (in English, French, or Spanish), in the form specified in the schedule.
- A **copy of the applicable invoice or sales agreement**.
- If the certification is in **Spanish**, an **English or French translation** must accompany it.

> This ensures **traceability, authenticity, and compliance** with the C–CFTA requirements.
