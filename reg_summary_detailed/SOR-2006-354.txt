**Detailed Summary of the Musquash Estuary Marine Protected Area Regulations**  
*S.C. 1996, c. 31*  
*Made under subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act*

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
The Musquash Estuary Marine Protected Area (MPA) Regulations were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, pursuant to **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. This provision allows the federal government to designate marine protected areas to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **protect and conserve the ecological integrity** of the Musquash Estuary, a sensitive coastal ecosystem in Nova Scotia, by restricting harmful activities and permitting only those that are compatible with environmental sustainability.

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Area**: Refers to the designated Musquash Estuary Marine Protected Area, comprising specific zones defined in the schedule.
- **Vessel**: Defined as per Section 2 of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* — includes any boat, ship, or floating structure used for navigation or transport.
- **Waters**: Includes not only surface waters but also the **seabed and subsoil** beneath the water to a depth of **two meters**. This ensures protection extends below the surface.

> All geographical coordinates are referenced using the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)** geodetic system for accuracy and consistency.

> In the schedule, **lines connecting points are rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing), which are used for mapping and boundary definition.

### **3. Designated Zones of the Musquash Estuary MPA**

The protected area is divided into **four distinct management zones** (Zone 1 through Zone 3), each with specific boundaries defined by rhumb lines and natural or man-made features. These zones are bounded by the **low-water line** of the estuary (the line marking the lowest natural water level during the year), and specific rhumb lines connecting designated points.

#### **Zone 1**
- Located generally **northwest** of a rhumb line connecting:
  - 45°11′19.63″ N, 66°15′37.35″ W  
  - 45°11′23.96″ N, 66°15′33.38″ W
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line** of the estuary
  - The **northeasterly limit of Highway 790** where it crosses the **southwestern arm** of the West Branch Musquash River
  - The **southeasterly limit of the abandoned Canadian Pacific Railway right-of-way** where it crosses the **northeastern arm** of the West Branch Musquash River
  - The **southerly limit of Route 1** where it crosses the **East Branch Musquash River**

> This zone includes the western and central parts of the estuary, adjacent to major transportation corridors.

#### **Zone 2A**
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line** of the estuary
  - Two rhumb lines:
    1. Between 45°11′19.63″ N, 66°15′37.35″ W and 45°11′23.96″ N, 66°15′33.38″ W  
    2. Between 45°08′47.00″ N, 66°15′11.00″ W and 45°09′08.91″ N, 66°13′55.87″ W

> This zone lies in the central portion of the estuary, near the junction of the West and East Branches.

#### **Zone 2B**
- Known as **Gooseberry Cove**
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line** of Gooseberry Cove
  - A rhumb line connecting:
    - 45°08′28.46″ N, 66°15′12.23″ W  
    - 45°08′14.39″ N, 66°15′35.50″ W

> This is a smaller, sheltered cove area within the estuary, offering unique habitat for intertidal species.

#### **Zone 3**
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line** of the estuary
  - Three rhumb lines:
    1. Between 45°08′47.00″ N, 66°15′11.00″ W and 45°09′08.91″ N, 66°13′55.87″ W  
    2. Between 45°08′28.46″ N, 66°15′12.23″ W and 45°08′14.39″ N, 66°15′35.50″ W  
    3. Between 45°08′14.39″ N, 66°15′35.50″ W and 45°08′35.60″ N, 66°14′16.77″ W

> This zone covers the easternmost part of the estuary and includes areas with high ecological value and tidal influence.

### **4. Prohibited Activities in the Area**

No person may:
- **Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove** any living marine organism or part of its habitat.
- **Deposit, discharge, or dump** any substance (including waste, chemicals, or debris) in a way that could result in such disturbance or damage.

> This includes activities that could degrade water quality, sediment integrity, or biological communities.

---

### **5. Exceptions to Prohibited Activities**

Despite the general prohibition, the following activities are **permitted** under specific conditions:

#### **Fishing Activities**
- **Aboriginal Communal Fishing**:
  - Permitted under the *Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations*.

- **Recreational Fishing** (under *Atlantic Fishery Regulations, 1985* or *Maritime Provinces Fishery Regulations*):
  - Manual fishing for **scallops or clams**
  - Angling or dip netting for any other species

- **Commercial Fishing**:
  - **Zone 1**: Fishing for **elvers or eels** using hand-deployed fyke nets or dip nets
  - **Zone 2A, 2B, 3**:

  - **Zone 3**: Fishing for **scallops**
  - **All Zones**: Manual fishing for **clams**

#### **Harvesting of Dulse**

#### **Vessel Operations**
- Speed limits:
  - **Zone 2A or 2B**: Maximum speed of **5 knots**
