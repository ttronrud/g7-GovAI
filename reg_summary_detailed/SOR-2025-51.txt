**Detailed Summary of the Cost Recovery (Online News Act) Regulations**

**Regulatory Framework and Authority**  
The *Cost Recovery (Online News Act) Regulations* are made by the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** under **Section 81 of the Online News Act (ONA)**, which was enacted as **S.C. 2023, c. 23**. These regulations establish a cost recovery mechanism to ensure that digital news operators contribute financially to the operations and responsibilities of the CRTC in fulfilling its duties under the ONA. The regulations were approved by the **Treasury Board** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**, and were formally issued on **February 20, 2025**.

### **1. Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Online News Act*.
- **"Operator"**: A digital news intermediary (e.g., a news website or app) that offers news content online and is subject to the regulations.
- **"News revenue"**: The gross Canadian revenue generated by an operator from making news content available through its digital news intermediary, **excluding** any revenue received from another operator that is also subject to these regulations.

---

### **2. Determination of News Revenue**
The news revenue of an operator for a calendar year is defined as:
- The **gross Canadian revenue** directly or indirectly earned from distributing news content via a digital news intermediary it operates.
- **Exclusions**: Revenue received from other operators (i.e., inter-operator payments) is not included.

#### **Sources for Revenue Determination**:
- **Primary Source**: The annual return filed by the operator.
- **Alternative Source (if no return or return is inaccurate/incomplete)**: The CRTC may estimate news revenue using:
  - Information provided by the operator,
  - Market trends in the relevant digital news sector,
  - The operator’s prior financial performance, and
  - The operator’s business plan.

This ensures transparency and fairness in revenue assessment, even when full financial disclosures are not available.

---

### **3. Annual Return Submission Requirements**
- Operators must file an **annual return** with the CRTC **by April 30** of each year.
- The return must be in a **form prescribed by the CRTC** and include:
  - Details of the operator’s news revenue for each digital news intermediary it operates.
- **Deadline for 2024 Revenue Reporting**: Operators must report their 2024 news revenue within **60 days** of the regulations coming into force.

> **Note**: The regulations come into force on **April 1, 2025**, but if registered later, they will take effect on the day of registration.

### **4. Cost Recovery Charge Structure**
The total cost recovery charge for an operator in a fiscal year is the **sum of two components**:

#### **(a) Base Assessment Amount**
Calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Base Assessment} = \left( \frac{\text{Operator's News Revenue}}{\text{Aggregate News Revenue of All Operators}} \right) \times \text{Estimated Commission Costs for the Fiscal Year}
\]

Where:
- **Operator's News Revenue** = Revenue from news content distribution in the immediately preceding calendar year.
- **Aggregate News Revenue** = Total news revenue of all operators in that calendar year.
- **Estimated Commission Costs** = The CRTC’s estimated costs (not recoverable under other provisions) for exercising powers and carrying out duties under the ONA.

> This component is based on a proportional share of the CRTC’s estimated operational costs, ensuring that larger operators contribute more relative to their revenue.

#### **(b) Annual Adjustment Amount**
Calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Annual Adjustment} = \left( \frac{\text{Operator's News Revenue}}{\text{Aggregate News Revenue of All Operators}} \right) \times \left( \text{Actual Commission Costs Incurred} - \text{Estimated Costs (from base assessment)} \right)
\]

Where:
- **Actual Commission Costs** = Real costs incurred by the CRTC in the fiscal year, as reported in the **Government of Canada’s Estimates** (specifically in **Part III**).
- **Estimated Costs** = The amount used in the base assessment for that fiscal year.

> This adjustment accounts for actual expenditures versus initial estimates, allowing for real-world cost tracking and accountability.

---

### **5. Negative Cost Recovery Charges**
- If the total cost recovery charge for a fiscal year is **negative** (i.e., the operator pays less than it owes), the amount is **not refunded**.
- Instead, the negative amount is **deducted from the recovery charge due in the following fiscal year**.
- This prevents operators from receiving refunds and ensures consistent funding for CRTC operations over time.

---

### **6. Public Disclosure of Estimated Costs**
- The CRTC must publish a **notice in the Canada Gazette, Part I** each fiscal year, outlining:
  - The **estimated costs** the Commission will incur in that fiscal year.
  - These costs are specifically those attributable to:
    - Exercising powers and carrying out duties under the ONA,
    - That are **not recoverable** under other regulations (e.g., those under subsection 79(1) of the ONA).

> This transparency allows operators to understand how their share of the cost recovery is calculated and builds public trust in the regulatory process.

---

### **7. Payment Obligations**
- Operators must pay the cost recovery charge **within 30 days** of receiving the invoice from the CRTC.
- This creates a clear, time-bound payment deadline to ensure timely financial contributions.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**
1. **Funding the CRTC’s ONA Responsibilities**:  
   The regulations ensure that the CRTC has a sustainable revenue stream to carry out its mandate under the ONA, such as monitoring digital news platforms, enforcing fair competition, and promoting the sustainability of Canadian news media.

2. **Proportional Cost Sharing**:  
   The base assessment ensures that operators contribute in proportion to their revenue, preventing disproportionate burdens on smaller or newer platforms.

3. **Accountability and Transparency**:  
   The use of actual cost data from government estimates and public disclosure in the *Canada Gazette* enhances accountability and allows for independent review.

4. **Market Responsiveness**:  
   The inclusion of market trends and business plans in revenue estimation helps adapt to changing digital news landscapes.

5. **Stability and Predictability**:  
   The structure of the charge (base + adjustment) provides operators with a predictable cost model, aiding in financial planning.

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **April 1, 2025** | Regulations come into force (or later, if registered after this date) |
| **April 30, 2025** | Operators must file their 2024 annual return |
| **Ongoing** | Annual returns filed by April 30 each year |

### **Conclusion**
The *Cost Recovery (Online News Act) Regulations* establish a fair, transparent, and accountable system for funding the CRTC’s oversight of digital news platforms in Canada. By linking cost recovery to actual and estimated operational expenses, and by requiring proportional contributions based on news revenue, the regulations support the long-term sustainability of Canadian journalism while ensuring that the regulatory body is adequately resourced to fulfill its mandate. The framework balances financial responsibility with operational realism, and includes mechanisms for error correction, market adaptation, and public transparency.
