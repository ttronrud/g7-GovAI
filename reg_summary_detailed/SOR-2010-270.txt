**Detailed Summary of the Pacific Aquaculture Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 1, s. 12; R.S., c. F-14)**

---

### **1. Introduction and Authority**
The *Pacific Aquaculture Regulations* were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **section 43a of the Fisheries Act**. These regulations establish the legal framework governing aquaculture and related activities in specific Canadian waters off the coast of **British Columbia**.

These regulations are part of Canada’s broader effort to manage and regulate aquaculture in a way that balances economic development with the conservation of fish populations, protection of marine ecosystems, and public safety.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Fisheries Act*, which provides the legal foundation for these regulations.
- **Aquaculture**: Defined as the *cultivation of fish* (not including shellfish, which are separately defined).
- **Nuisance Fish**: Fish that pose an *imminent danger* to:
  - Equipment used in aquaculture operations,
  - The safety of personnel working at the facility,
  - Or the fish being cultivated.
- **Prescribed Activities**: Specific fishing-related actions authorized under aquaculture licences, including:
  - Catching fish for cultivation,
  - Incidental catches during operations,
  - Catching fish to comply with monitoring conditions,
  - Catching escaped fish to return them or dispose of them,
  - Catching nuisance fish.
- **Shellfish**: Includes *Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Crustacea* (e.g., oysters, clams, mussels, crabs).

---

### **3. Geographic Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:
- The **territorial sea of Canada** off the coast of British Columbia;
- The **internal waters of Canada** off the coast of British Columbia that are **not within the province of British Columbia**;
- The **internal waters of Canada within British Columbia**;
- Any **aquaculture facility in British Columbia** from which fish may escape into Canadian fisheries waters.

> This ensures that all aquaculture operations in the region—especially those near or impacting wild fish populations—are subject to regulation.

---

### **4. Licensing Requirements**

#### **a) Issuance of Aquaculture Licences**
The Minister may issue an aquaculture licence to authorize a person to engage in aquaculture and prescribed activities, provided they pay:
- A **flat fee** (one-time application fee),
- An **annual fee** (recurring fee for the duration of the licence).

---

#### **b) Flat Fee Structure**
- **Non-commercial aquaculture** (e.g., personal or hobbyist farming): **$0**
- **All other aquaculture licences** (commercial or otherwise): **$100**

> This fee is payable upon application and applies regardless of scale or species.

---

#### **c) Annual Fee Structure**
The annual fee is determined based on the type of operation and the scale of activity:

| Type of Licence | Fee Calculation |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Commercial fish cultivation in marine environment (excluding certain species)** | $2.50 per tonne of fish authorized |
| **Commercial shellfish cultivation in marine environment** | $5.00 per hectare authorized |
| **Commercial fish cultivation in freshwater or land-based facilities** | **$0** |
| **Non-commercial fish cultivation** | **$0** |

> *Note: The fee is adjusted annually using an "annual adjustment factor" (determined by the Minister) based on inflation or other economic factors.*

> **Example**: If a licence authorizes 100 tonnes of marine fish cultivation, the annual fee would be 100 × $2.50 = $250.

> **Important**: If a condition in the licence is changed during the year (e.g., increased fish volume or expanded area), the annual fee must be **recalculated** and the licence must be amended to reflect the new fee.

---

#### **d) Fee Payment Conditions**
- An applicant **must pay all outstanding flat and annual fees** for previously issued licences before receiving a new one.
- The **annual licence fee must be paid in full** at the designated place and time, as specified in the licence.

---

### **5. Conditions in Aquaculture Licences**

The Minister may impose **additional conditions** in an aquaculture licence beyond those in the general *Fishery (General) Regulations*, including:

#### **a) Species and Quantity Restrictions**
- Limits on species, quantities, and origin of fish to be cultivated.

#### **b) Fish Characteristics**
- Restrictions on age, sex, stage of development, or size of fish to be cultivated.

#### **c) Location Restrictions**
- Specifies which waters are permitted for aquaculture operations.

#### **d) Feed Management**
- Rules about types of fish feed and storage practices within the facility.

#### **e) Harvesting Practices**
- Procedures for harvesting fish from the facility.

#### **f) Pathogen and Pest Control**
- Required measures to:
  - Prevent and monitor pathogens and pests within the facility,
  - Monitor wild fish populations in adjacent waters for signs of disease or contamination.

#### **g) Fish Escape Prevention and Response**
- Measures to:
  - Minimize escapes of fish from the facility,
  - Catch escaped fish promptly and humanely.

#### **h) Environmental Impact Mitigation**
- Requirements to:
  - Minimize harm to wild fish and their habitats,
  - Monitor and report environmental impacts of operations.

#### **i) Equipment Use**
- Restrictions on types and uses of equipment in the facility.

#### **j) Pre-Activity Notifications**
- Mandatory notification to the Minister before:
  - Using substances to treat fish for pathogens or pests,
  - Transferring fish into the facility,
  - Harvesting fish.

#### **k) Observer Verification**
- Requirement to have an observer present during certain operations to verify compliance.

#### **l) Recordkeeping Obligations**
- Detailed records must be maintained and retained, including:
  - Species, quantity, age, sex, and date of fish transferred and harvested,
  - Any fish found in the facility not transferred under licence,
  - Diagnoses or treatments of diseases/pests (including impact),
  - Substances used for treatment (type, quantity, date, method),
  - Number and species of fish dying before harvest and cause of death,
  - Number and species of nuisance fish dying due to operations,
  - Equipment inspections and maintenance,
  - Major containment failures and fish escapes,
  - Environmental and fish health monitoring data.

> Records must be:
> - Kept in a specific format,
> - Produced upon request by a fishery officer or guardian,
> - Retained for a defined period (not specified in the text but implied by standard fishery regulations).

### **6. Incidental Catch Rules**

- **Unless expressly authorized**, any fish caught incidentally during aquaculture operations must be:
  - **Immediately returned** to the water,
  - In a way that **causes the least harm** to the fish,
  - **Outside** the aquaculture facility.

> This rule protects wild fish populations from unintentional depletion and promotes sustainable practices.

---

### **7. General Prohibitions**

- **No person may engage in aquaculture or prescribed activities without a valid aquaculture licence.**

> This establishes a strict legal requirement for authorization, ensuring that all operations are subject to oversight and regulation.

---

### **8. Amendments and Enforcement**

- The regulations may be amended by the Minister to reflect changing conditions or scientific findings.
- The Minister has broad discretion to set conditions in licences to ensure the **proper management of fisheries**, **conservation of fish**, and **protection of fish habitat**.

### **Summary of Key Objectives**

| Objective | How Achieved |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sustainable Aquaculture** | Through species limits, feed controls, and environmental monitoring |
| **Fish Conservation** | By restricting incidental catch and requiring escape monitoring |
| **Public and Environmental Safety** | Through nuisance fish rules, equipment standards, and safety protocols |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Via detailed recordkeeping and inspection requirements |
| **Economic Regulation** | Through tiered fee structures based on scale and type of operation |

### **Conclusion**

The *Pacific Aquaculture Regulations* provide a comprehensive, science-based, and enforceable regulatory framework for aquaculture in British Columbia’s coastal waters. They ensure that aquaculture development is balanced with environmental protection, public safety, and the long-term sustainability of fish populations. By requiring detailed licensing, monitoring, and reporting, the regulations empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to manage risks, prevent overexploitation, and maintain the integrity of Canada’s marine ecosystems.

These regulations remain a critical tool in Canada’s national fisheries policy, particularly in the Pacific region where aquaculture is a growing industry and environmental concerns are significant.
