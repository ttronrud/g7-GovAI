## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations (1999 Version – Repealed in 2020/2023)**

### 📌 **1. Legal Authority and Procedural Background**

- The regulation was issued under **section 27 of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act (TDGA), 1992** ("Act").
- A **proposed version** of the regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **August 7, 1999**, pursuant to **section 30(1)** of the Act.
- The government provided a **reasonable opportunity for public comment** (i.e., representations from interested parties) before finalizing the regulations.
- After considering public feedback, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, formally enacted the regulations.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This regulation has since been **repealed**:
> - **SOR/2020-23, s. 1** (repealed in 2020)
> - **SOR/2023-155, s. 2** (fully repealed in 2023)

👉 This means the 1999 version is **no longer in force** and has been replaced by updated regulations (likely under the current *TDGA* framework, possibly incorporating modern standards and international alignment).

### 📌 **2. Interpretive Rules and Key Definitions**

These rules clarify how terms are used throughout the regulations, ensuring consistency and legal precision.

#### ✅ Interpretive Principles:
| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **"must" vs "may"** | "Must" indicates an **imperative requirement**; "may" indicates a **permissive option**. |
| **"on", "in", "by" with transport modes** | These terms are **synonymous** when used with *road vehicle, railway vehicle, vessel, or aircraft*. E.g., "on a road vehicle" = "in a road vehicle" = "by a road vehicle". |
| **Pressure units** | Pressure is expressed in **kPa (gauge)** unless specified as **absolute**. **Vapour pressure is always absolute**. |
| **Shipping Names (Schedule 1)** | May be: <br>• Written in singular/plural, upper/lower case<br>• In English only<br>• With altered word order (as long as full name is used and is a common phrase)<br>• For solutions/mixtures: followed by "SOLUTION" or "MIXTURE" and may include concentration<br>• For waste: preceded or followed by "WASTE" or "DÉCHET" (French) |
| **Placards** | Refers to a **specific placard** in the Appendix to Part 4 (Dangerous Goods Safety Marks).<br>• "Placard" includes the plural (multiple placards)<br>• Number required is based on the applicable hazard class and quantity. |
| **"or" usage** | Used in an **inclusive sense** unless clearly stated otherwise (e.g., "A or B" means either A, B, or both). |
| **Shipping documents** | Refers to either:<br>• The **original** document, or<br>• A **copy** of the document. |
| **Conversion: Articles vs. Net Explosives Quantity** | <br>• 1 kg net explosives quantity = **100 articles**<br>• 100 articles = 1 kg net explosives quantity<br>→ Used to standardize quantification for explosives (Class 1). |
| **"Means of Containment"** | Refers to the **minimum required containment** unless otherwise specified.<br>• It must be sufficient such that:<br>  (a) When all other containments are removed, the dangerous goods remain compliant with the Act and Regulations for transport/handling.<br>  (b) When all other containments are removed, **some** of the goods would no longer be in a compliant containment. |
| **"Gross mass of all dangerous goods"** | Applies only to dangerous goods that require a shipping document or are intended to be transported under sections 1.15, 1.16, 1.21, and 1.22. |
