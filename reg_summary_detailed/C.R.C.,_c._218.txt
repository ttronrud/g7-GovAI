**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Onion Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Ontario Onion Order* and may be cited as such. This document establishes the legal framework governing the marketing of onions produced in Ontario, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (French: *Loi*). This is the foundational legislation under which the regulatory bodies operate. It grants the Board and Commodity Board authority to regulate the marketing of farm products, including onions.

- **Board**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (French: *Régie*). This is the overarching regulatory body responsible for overseeing the marketing of various farm products across Ontario. It has broad powers under the Act to regulate interprovincial and export trade.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Ontario Onion Producers’ Marketing Board* (French: *Office de commercialisation*). This is a specialized board established under the Farm Products Marketing Act specifically to manage the marketing of onions produced in Ontario. It operates under the broader authority of the Board but has focused jurisdiction over onions.

- **Onions**: Defined as onions *produced in Ontario*. This term is crucial as it limits the scope of the regulation to onions grown within the province, ensuring that only Ontario-grown onions are subject to the rules set out in this Order.

- **Provincial Regulations**: Refers to *Ontario Regulation 129/66*, as amended by *Regulations 111/67, 238/67, and 279/69*, made by the Board under the authority of the Farm Products Marketing Act. These regulations contain the detailed rules governing the marketing, pricing, quality standards, and trade practices for onions. The "Provincial Regulations" serve as the operational framework for this Order.

**3. Regulatory Authority and Powers**  

The Order outlines the division of powers between the **Board** and the **Commodity Board**:

- **Board's Authority**:  
  The Board is authorized to regulate the marketing of onions in **interprovincial trade** and **export trade**. For these purposes, it may exercise all or any powers that are:
  - Not specifically delegated to the Commodity Board, and  
  - Exercisable by the Board under *Section 3 of the Provincial Regulations*.

  This means the Board retains general regulatory powers over the broader marketing of onions outside Ontario (e.g., selling to other provinces or abroad), including powers related to pricing, quality control, quotas, and market access.

- **Commodity Board's Authority**:  
  The Commodity Board has specific powers to regulate the **local marketing of onions within Ontario**. These powers are derived from *Sections 4, 5, 6, and 11 of the Provincial Regulations*. These sections typically cover:
  - Setting minimum prices or price supports for local onion sales,
  - Establishing quality standards,
  - Regulating sales to consumers or local distributors,
  - Managing local supply and demand through marketing agreements or cooperatives.

- **Shared or Overlapping Powers**:  
  The Order clarifies that the Board and Commodity Board may both act within Ontario, but their powers are divided based on scope:
  - The Board handles **interprovincial and export** marketing.
  - The Commodity Board handles **domestic (local)** marketing within Ontario.

  Importantly, where powers are not delegated to the Commodity Board (as per Section 3 of the Provincial Regulations), the Board may exercise them in both interprovincial and export contexts.

**4. Purpose and Scope**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Ensure orderly and fair marketing of Ontario-grown onions,
- Protect producers from price volatility and market manipulation,
- Promote stable supply and demand in both domestic and export markets,
- Provide a structured system of regulation that supports farmers and the agricultural economy.

The regulation applies only to onions produced in Ontario and does not extend to other crops or produce.

---

**5. Legal Basis**  
The Order is enacted under the authority of *The Farm Products Marketing Act*, which empowers the Board and Commodity Board to regulate marketing activities. The specific powers are further defined and detailed in the *Provincial Regulations*, which provide practical rules for implementation.

---

**6. Significance**  
This Order establishes a clear and structured governance model for the onion market in Ontario. It:
- Separates responsibilities between provincial and specialized marketing bodies,
- Ensures that local producers are protected through domestic price controls and quality standards,
- Enables Ontario to maintain control over its onion exports and interprovincial sales through a legally sound regulatory framework.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Ontario Onion Order* is a key piece of agricultural regulation that defines the roles, powers, and responsibilities of the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Onion Producers’ Marketing Board. It ensures that the marketing of Ontario-grown onions is conducted in a fair, transparent, and sustainable manner—balancing the interests of producers, distributors, and consumers both within the province and beyond. By referencing and operating within the framework of the Provincial Regulations, the Order provides a stable and legally enforceable system for managing the onion market in Ontario.
