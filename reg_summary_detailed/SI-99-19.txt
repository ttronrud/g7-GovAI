## 📜 **Core Amendments to the Canada–France Tax Convention**

The protocol replaces several key articles and paragraphs with revised provisions, enhancing clarity, scope, and fairness in the tax treatment of individuals and businesses. Below is a breakdown of the major amendments:

---

### 1. **Article 2 – Definition of "Existing Taxes"**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To clearly define which taxes are subject to the Convention and to clarify exceptions.

#### ✅ Key Changes:
- **Canada**: The Convention applies to taxes under the *Income Tax Act* (Canadian tax).
- **France**: Applies to:
  - Income tax
  - Corporation tax
  - Tax on wages and salaries (applies to business profits or independent personal services)
  - Solidarity tax on net wealth
  - Withholding taxes, prepayments, or advance payments related to the above taxes (French tax)

> 🚩 **Exception**:  
> Inheritance tax is included **only** for the application of **Articles 4, 23, 25, and 26** — not broadly.

#### ✅ Additional Provision:
- The Convention applies to **any new or substantially similar taxes** introduced after May 2, 1975 (the original signing date).
- **Notification Requirement**:  
  Competent authorities in both countries must **notify each other** of significant changes in domestic tax laws.

> 💡 This ensures the Convention remains relevant as tax regimes evolve.

---

### 2. **Article 3 – Definition of "Competent Authority"**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To clarify which government bodies are responsible for administering the Convention.

#### ✅ Changes:
- **Canada**: The Minister of National Revenue or their authorized representative.
- **France**: The Minister in charge of the Budget or their authorized representative.

> ✅ This provides clear administrative accountability and avoids ambiguity in enforcement.

---

### 3. **Article 4 – Definition of "Resident"**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To define who qualifies as a resident in either country, which determines tax liability and eligibility for benefits.

#### ✅ Key Provisions:
- A person is a resident if they are liable to tax due to:
  - Domicile, residence, place of management, or similar criteria.
  - **Exclusion**: A person is **not** a resident if taxed **only** on income from sources in that country.

#### ✅ Residency Determination Rules (for individuals):
1. **Permanent home** → resident of the State where it is available.
2. If available in both countries → resident of the **State with closer personal and economic ties** ("centre of vital interests").
3. If centre of vital interests cannot be determined → resident of the **state of habitual abode**.
4. If habitual abode in both or neither → resident of the **nationality**.
5. If national of both or neither → **mutual agreement** between authorities.

#### ✅ For non-individuals (e.g., companies, partnerships):
- If a person (e.g., a partnership) is a resident of both countries → **mutual agreement** required.
- In absence of agreement → **not considered a resident** for Convention benefits.

> 📌 This is a critical rule for cross-border business and investment structures.

---

### 4. **Article 5 – Definition of "Permanent Establishment"**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To determine when a foreign enterprise is considered to have a physical presence in a country, triggering tax obligations.

#### ✅ Key Elements:
- A permanent establishment (PE) is a **fixed place of business** through which business is carried on.
- Includes:
  - Place of management
  - Branch
  - Office
  - Factory
  - Workshop
  - Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or natural resource extraction site
  - **Note**: Exploration sites are included if they constitute a fixed place of business.

> ⚠️ **Exclusions**:
- Storage, display, or delivery of goods
- Stock maintenance for storage/display
- Stock for processing by another enterprise
- Fixed place used only for purchasing or collecting information
- Fixed place used only for preparatory or auxiliary activities

> ✅ Special Rule:
- A person acting **on behalf of an enterprise** with authority to conclude contracts is deemed to have a PE **unless** their activities are limited to the above auxiliary functions.

> ❌ **No PE** exists simply because:
- A company operates through a **broker, agent, or independent agent** (in ordinary course of business).

> ⚖️ **No PE** arises from:
- A company being controlled by another company in the other country — **no automatic tax implication**.

> 💡 This prevents tax avoidance through mere ownership or control.

---

### 5. **Article 6 – Definition of "Immovable Property"**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To clarify when ownership of shares gives rise to taxation on immovable property.

#### ✅ Changes:
- "Immovable property" means the legal definition under the law of the country where the property is located.
- **Includes options and similar rights**.

#### ✅ New Paragraph 5:
> If ownership of shares gives the owner **rights to use or let immovable property** in a Contracting State (e.g., through "jouissance" rights), then **income from direct use, letting, or enjoyment** may be taxed in that State.

> ⚠️ This applies **even if Articles 7 and 14 do not cover it** — a significant expansion of tax exposure.

> 💡 Example: A Canadian investor holding shares in a French company with rights to use a French building may be taxed in France on rental income derived from that building.

---

### 6. **Article 9 – Transfer Pricing and Related Party Transactions**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To prevent tax avoidance through artificial pricing or financial arrangements between related enterprises.

#### ✅ Key Provision:
- If:
  - One company controls or is controlled by another across borders, **or**
  - The same individuals control both companies
  - And **commercial or financial terms differ** from those of independent enterprises
- Then any profits that would have accrued to one company **but did not due to those artificial conditions** may be **reallocated** and taxed in the company that received them.

> 💡 This is a classic anti-avoidance mechanism to ensure fairness in cross-border business dealings.

---

### 7. **Article 10 – Dividends and Taxation**
#### 🔍 Purpose:
To regulate taxation of dividends paid by French companies to Canadian residents and vice versa.

#### ✅ Key Provisions:

##### A. **Dividend Taxation Rules**:
- Dividends paid by a French company to a Canadian resident **may be taxed in Canada**.
- However, **tax on such dividends in Canada is capped**:
  - **5%** of gross amount if:
    - The beneficial owner is a **Canadian company** that:
      - Controls ≥10% of voting power in the French company (Canada)
      - Holds ≥10% of capital in the French company (France)
  - **10%** if:
    - The dividend is paid by a **non-resident Canadian investment corporation** to a **French company** that controls ≥10% of voting power
  - **15%** in all other cases

> 🚫 **Exception**:  
> The rules **do not apply** if:
> - The beneficial owner is not liable to Canadian tax on the dividend
> - The beneficial owner cannot prove ownership of the shares
> - The holding is primarily to **allow another person** (resident or non-resident) to benefit from the tax credit

##### B. **French Tax Credit ("avoir fiscal") Refund**:
- A Canadian resident who receives dividends from a French company **and would have been entitled to a tax credit in France** is entitled to a **refund from the French Treasury** equal to that credit.
- However, this refund is **reduced by the Canadian tax** paid (as per subparagraph (c) of paragraph 2).

> ✅ This ensures that Canadian residents do not pay double tax on dividends.

##### C. **Prepayment Refund**:
- Canadian residents who receive dividends may be entitled to a **refund of prepayments** made by the company (e.g
