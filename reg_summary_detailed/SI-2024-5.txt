#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Treasury Board** and the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**.
- It is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**, which empowers the government to adjust fees in certain circumstances—particularly when the collection of such fees is deemed **unreasonable**.
- The specific legal authority for the fee adjustments is derived from **sections 4 to 10 of the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations (SOR/2012-253)**.

#### **2. Scope of the Adjustment**
- The regulation pertains to the **fees for passport and other travel document services**.
- It specifically addresses the **adjustment of fees** listed in **column 2** of the following regulatory provisions:
  - Subparagraphs **1(a)(i) and (ii)**, **(b)(i) and (ii)**  
  - Paragraphs **2(a) and (b)**  
  - Items **3 to 6** of the Schedule to the Regulations

> These items typically correspond to specific services, such as:
> - Standard passport applications
> - Expedited passport services
> - Replacement passports
> - Biometric passport fees
> - Renewals and other document-related services

#### **3. Nature of the Adjustment**
- The regulation **remits (i.e., waives or reduces)** the amount of the fee adjustment that would otherwise have been applied during the specified period.
- The term *“remits”* in this context means that the government **does not impose** the fee increase or adjustment that might otherwise be required under the regulations.
- This action is taken because the **collection of the fees in question is considered unreasonable**—a determination made by the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, based on factors such as:
  - Public interest
  - Financial impact on individuals or organizations
  - Fairness and affordability of fees
  - Economic or administrative circumstances (e.g., pandemic-related disruptions)

#### **4. Temporal Period**
- The adjustment (or remission) applies **during the period beginning April 1, 2020, and ending March 31, 2023**.
- This timeframe covers a period of three years, including the early stages of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which may have influenced the government’s decision to avoid imposing fee increases during a time of public hardship.

#### **5. Regulatory Context and Legislative Reference**
- The regulation is **based on S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**, which provides the general framework for fee adjustments under the Financial Administration Act.
- The specific fee regulations are **SOR/2012-253**, which sets out the current fee structure for passport and travel document services.

#### **6. Purpose and Policy Rationale**
- The primary purpose of this remission is to **protect the public interest** by ensuring that individuals and organizations are not burdened with unreasonable fees during a period of economic or social stress.
- It reflects a **cost-of-living or accessibility concern**, particularly during a global health crisis when travel and immigration processes were disrupted.
- The decision demonstrates a balance between **government revenue needs** and **public service accessibility**, aligning with broader principles of fairness and equity in service delivery.

#### **7. Implications**
- During the 2020–2023 period, individuals applying for or renewing passports or other travel documents **did not have to pay the adjusted fees** as outlined in the schedule.
- This provided **financial relief** to applicants, especially those with limited income or those relying on travel for essential purposes (e.g., medical treatment, family reunification).
- The remission may have also supported **increased access to travel documents**, which is critical for immigration, international mobility, and national security.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **temporary, policy-driven waiver of fee adjustments** for passport and travel document services, justified on the grounds that collecting the fees during the 2020–2023 period would be unreasonable.
