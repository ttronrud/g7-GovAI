| **Rights under Territorial Lands Act (Section 8)** | Existing rights in good standing created under section 8 of the Territorial Lands Act or under Territorial Lands Regulations. |
| **Surface Lease Rights** | Rights to obtain a surface lease on existing mineral claims under section 8 of the Territorial Lands Act or Territorial Lands Regulations. |
| **Oil and Gas Permits** | Existing permits, special renewal permits, and leases in good standing under the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations*. |

### **5. Specific Reservations and Exclusions**

The Order includes **specific reservations** of certain parcels and rights, which are **saved and reserved** despite the withdrawal:

#### **A. Inuit Owned Lands Parcels**
- Parcels **RE31/56H, RE32/56H, and RE87/56I, J** (surface title only) are **exempted** from the withdrawal.
- These parcels were **jointly delivered to the Registrar of Land Titles on April 15, 1993**.
- **Exception**: If the description on the original Inuit Owned Lands Ownership Map No. 133 (Series 1–237) is **replaced** by a more accurate descriptive map plan or survey under the **Agreement Between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and Her Majesty the Queen (signed May 25, 1993)**, then the updated plan governs the boundary.

> This reflects a commitment to **Indigenous land rights** and the recognition of Inuit ownership and self-determination in land governance.

#### **B. Existing Leases and Reserves**
- **Lease 56H/14-2-2 (Sila Lodge)**  
- **Lease 56H/14-1-2**  
- **Government of N.W.T. Reserve 56H/10-1**  
- **Environment Canada Reserve 56J/4-1**  
All of these are **saved and reserved** and remain in force.

> These reserves may serve for conservation, research, or administrative purposes.

#### **C. Agreements for Lease or Sale**
- Any tract of territorial land subject to an **agreement for lease or sale** under the **Territorial Lands Act or Territorial Lands Regulations** is **exempted** from the withdrawal.

> This ensures that existing negotiated land transactions are not invalidated by the park designation.

### **6. Inclusions of Resources and Rights**

The Order explicitly includes the following resources and rights within the protected area:

- **All mines and minerals**, including:
  - Solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons (oil, gas, coal, etc.)
  - Other mineral resources
- **Rights to work** such minerals and mines (i.e., exploration, extraction, development rights)
- **Substances or materials** that may be disposed of under the *Territorial Quarrying Regulations*
- **Timber** that may be disposed of under the *Forest Management Act of the Northwest Territories*

> This is a critical point: although the land is withdrawn from **disposal**, the **rights to extract minerals, quarry, or harvest timber** are preserved — indicating that the Order protects the **environment** but does not eliminate **resource-based economic rights** for existing holders.

### **7. Key Implications and Significance**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Conservation Focus** | Establishes Wager Bay as a protected national park, preserving biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural landscapes. |
| **Environmental Protection** | Prevents industrial development (e.g., mining, logging, drilling) in a sensitive coastal and Arctic environment. |
| **Indigenous Rights Recognition** | Explicitly protects Inuit-owned lands and honors land title agreements, reinforcing reconciliation and Indigenous sovereignty. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Provides clear boundaries and exemptions, reducing ambiguity for stakeholders (miners, landowners, government agencies). |
| **Temporal Limitation** | The Order expires on **October 1, 2004**, meaning that after this date, the lands could potentially be re-opened to disposal — unless extended by future legislation. |
