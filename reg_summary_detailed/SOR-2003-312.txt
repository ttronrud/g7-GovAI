### **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation: Application of the Government Corporations Operation Act to Canada Lands Company Limited**

#### **1. Legal Context and Purpose**
This document is an **official Proclamation** issued by the Government of Canada under the authority of the **Government Corporations Operation Act (GCOA)**. Its primary purpose is to formally declare that the **Government Corporations Operation Act applies to Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC)** from a specific date.

The proclamation serves as a legal mechanism to bring a Crown corporation under the regulatory framework of the GCOA, which governs the operations, governance, financial accountability, and reporting obligations of government-owned corporations in Canada.

---

#### **2. Key Legal Provisions Invoked**
- **Section 6 of the Government Corporations Operation Act** states that the Act applies to a corporation only *after* the Governor in Council issues a proclamation declaring its applicability.
- This means that without such a proclamation, the GCOA does not automatically govern the corporation. The proclamation is the **trigger** for the Act’s application.

---

#### **3. Subject of the Proclamation**
- **Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC)**  
  - A corporation incorporated under the **Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)**.
  - Its issued shares are held in **trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada**, indicating that it is a Crown corporation — owned and operated by the federal government.

> This establishes that CLC is a government entity with public accountability, not a private company.

---

#### **4. Basis for the Proclamation**
- The proclamation is issued pursuant to **Order in Council P.C. 2003-1305**, dated **September 3, 2003**.

---

#### **5. Date of Application**
- The Government Corporations Operation Act becomes applicable to Canada Lands Company Limited **from the date of the issue of this Proclamation**, which is:

1. **Regulatory Integration**:  
   CLC is now subject to the same governance and financial accountability standards as other federal government corporations (e.g., Natural Resources Canada, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation).

2. **Transparency and Accountability**:  
   The application of the GCOA enhances transparency in CLC’s operations, particularly in land management, leasing, and revenue generation.

3. **Legal Continuity**:  
   While CLC was incorporated under the CBCA, this proclamation ensures it operates under a consistent, centralized regulatory regime for government-owned entities.
