**Regulation Title:**  
*Indian Bands Revenue Moneys Regulations*  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Indian Bands Revenue Moneys Regulations*.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Account"**  
   Refers to the financial account established by a Band in accordance with Section 5 of the *Indian Act*. This account is the official record of the Band’s revenue moneys and is essential for managing and tracking financial transactions.

2. **"Band"**  
   A Band is defined in two ways:
   - A Band listed in the *Schedule* to the *Indian Band Revenue Moneys Order*, or  
   - Any other Band that has been permitted by law (under subsection 69(1) of the *Indian Act*) to manage, control, or expend its revenue moneys in part.  
   This definition ensures that only Bands with formal recognition or specific authorization under the *Indian Act* are subject to these financial regulations.

> *Note:* Section 2 of the regulation, which was revoked by SOR/93-244, is no longer in effect and has been removed from the current version.

### **Core Provisions and Requirements**

#### **1. Compliance with the Indian Act**
- All expenditures made by a Band from its revenue moneys are subject to the *Indian Act*.  
  This means that any financial decisions involving the use of revenue moneys must comply with the legal framework established in the *Indian Act*, including rules on accountability, transparency, and governance.

#### **2. Establishment of a Financial Account**
- Every Band must establish a financial account with one of the following institutions:
  - A **chartered bank**  
  - A **trust or loan company**  
  - A **credit union**  
  - A **caisse populaire** (a type of cooperative financial institution common in Quebec and other regions of Canada)  
- This requirement ensures that Band finances are managed through reputable, regulated financial institutions, promoting accountability, security, and access to financial services.

#### **3. Authorization of Cheque Signatories**
- Every Band must authorize **three persons** to sign cheques or payment orders drawn on its account.
- **At least two of these three persons must be members of the Band**.  
  This provision promotes internal accountability and ensures that financial decisions are made by individuals who are part of the Band community, reinforcing democratic oversight and reducing the risk of misuse of funds.

#### **4. Requirement for Dual Signature on Payments**
- Any cheque or order for payment drawn on a Band’s account must be signed by **at least two of the authorized persons**.  
  This dual-signature requirement acts as a safeguard against unauthorized or fraudulent expenditures, ensuring that no single individual can make large financial decisions without oversight.

#### **5. Ministerial Authorization of Expenditure**
- If the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (through Section 66 of the *Indian Act*) authorizes or directs the expenditure of a Band’s revenue moneys:
  - The amount authorized must be paid directly **into the Band’s designated account**.
  - The funds are sourced from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** (a central government fund), and not from the Band’s own revenue moneys.
- This provision allows for government oversight and intervention in specific cases (e.g., emergency funding, infrastructure projects), while ensuring that such expenditures are properly tracked and accounted for.

#### **6. Annual Auditing and Reporting**
- Every Band must **engage an independent auditor** to:
  - Audit the financial records of the Band’s account
  - Prepare an **annual financial report** detailing the Band’s financial activities
- The auditor’s report must be:
  - **Posted in conspicuous places** on the Band Reserve (the land reserved for the Band)  
    → This ensures that all Band members can access and review the financial information.
  - **Supplied to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** within **seven days** of the report’s completion  
    → This provides government oversight and ensures transparency in financial operations.

### **Purpose and Significance**

These Regulations establish a **clear, transparent, and accountable financial framework** for Indian Bands, ensuring that:
- Revenue moneys are managed responsibly and in accordance with federal law.
- Financial decisions are made with community input and oversight.
- Funds are protected from misuse through dual-signature controls and independent audits.
- Both Band members and the federal government have access to financial information for accountability and oversight.

They reflect a balance between **autonomy** (allowing Bands to manage their own finances) and **regulation** (ensuring accountability and compliance with the *Indian Act* and broader financial standards).
