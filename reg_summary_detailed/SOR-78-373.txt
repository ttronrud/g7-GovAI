### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes the rules under which **Canadian manufacturers or producers** may claim a **drawback**—that is, a refund or credit—of **customs duties, sales taxes, and excise taxes** paid on imported parts, materials, or domestic substitutes used in the **manufacture or production of goods exported from Canada**.

It replaces the earlier *Canadian Manufactured Goods Exported Drawback Regulations* made by Order in Council P.C. 1973-120, as amended.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Key Parties**

- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of National Revenue**, responsible for administering the rules and authorizing drawback payments.

---

### **3. Eligible Claims for Drawback**

The Minister may authorize payment of a drawback for the following types of inputs used in Canadian-manufactured goods exported abroad:

#### **(a) Imported Parts and Materials Used in Manufacturing**
- Parts or materials imported into Canada that are:
  - Wrought into, or
  - Attached to, or
  - Used in the production of goods that are subsequently exported from Canada.

#### **(b) Imported Materials Directly Consumed in Manufacturing**
- Any imported material (excluding fuel or plant equipment) that is **directly consumed** in the production of exported goods.

#### **(c) Imported Parts/Materials Used to Produce Exported Goods**
- Imported parts or materials in sufficient quantity to produce the exported goods, **used during the 12-month period immediately preceding** the manufacture or production of the goods.

#### **(d) Domestic Parts/Materials Substituting for Imported Ones**
- Domestic parts or materials of the **same class** as imported ones, which are:
  - So similar that they could be used **interchangeably** in production, and
  - Are used in the final product or directly consumed in production.

> **Note**: This provision supports the use of domestic alternatives to imported components, promoting local industry and reducing reliance on foreign inputs.

---

### **4. Adjustment for By-Products and Scrap/Waste**

To prevent overpayment, the drawback is adjusted when manufacturing results in by-products or waste:

#### **(a) By-Products**
- If imported parts/materials are processed and result in a **by-product** (e.g., a usable side product), the drawback is **reduced proportionally**.
- Reduction formula:  
  **(Value of by-product / Total value of all production from the input)**  
  → This proportion is subtracted from the original drawback amount.

#### **(b) Merchantable Scrap or Waste**
- If **merchantable scrap or waste** is produced, the drawback is reduced by:
  - Applying the **prevailing customs duty rate** on such scrap/waste (when imported as such) to the **Canadian sales value** of the scrap.
- Example: If scrap is worth $100 and the duty rate on such scrap is 5%, then $5 is deducted from the drawback.

#### **(c) Limitation on Duty Rate**
- The reduction must not be based on a **higher customs duty rate** than the one originally paid on the imported input.
- Ensures that the drawback is not inflated due to changes in duty rates after the original import.

> **Purpose**: Prevents double recovery of duties and ensures that the tax benefit is only for the actual value of the input used in the final product.

---

### **5. Requirements for Filing a Drawback Claim**

A claim must:

- Be submitted in **form prescribed by the Minister**.
- Include **waivers** from any other party who might be entitled to a drawback under the same regulations (to avoid overlapping claims).
- Include the following supporting documents (unless waived or unavailable):
  - Copy of **bill of lading**
  - Copy of **sales invoice**
  - Any **Certificate of Importation, Sale, or Transfer**
  - Any **Certificate of Sale for Exportation**
  - A **list of import entries** related to the claim

> **Exception**:  
> If a document is **not available**, the claim may still be filed **if equivalent information** is provided (e.g., a detailed description or summary of the transaction).

> **Filing Deadline**:  
> Claims must be filed at a **customs office after the goods have been exported**.

---

### **6. Time Limit for Tax Payment**

- **No drawback payment will be made** unless the customs duty and sales/excise taxes on the relevant imported parts or materials were **paid within the four years immediately before the claim is filed**.

> This ensures that claims are only made for taxes that were actually paid and not for hypothetical or future obligations.

---

### **7. Application Date for Subsection (1)**

- Subsection (1) (the general rules for drawback) **applies only to customs duties and sales/excise taxes paid on or after April 1, 1981**.

> This means that claims for taxes paid before April 1, 1981, are governed by older rules or may not qualify under this regulation.

---

### **8. Deduction of Anti-Dumping Duties**

- A **deduction** will be made from the drawback amount if:
  - The goods in question are subject to **anti-dumping duties**.
  - The amount of anti-dumping duty is **paid or payable** in respect of those goods.

> This ensures that the drawback does not compensate for duties that were imposed due to unfair trade practices.

---

### **9. Conditions for Applying Anti-Dumping Duty Deduction**

The deduction applies **only if** the initial documents for entry for consumption were delivered to the customs collector on or after:

| Goods Description | Required Date |
|------------------|---------------|
| Single-row tapered roller bearings (outside diameter ≤ 6.625 inches) originating in Japan | **October 13, 1976** |
| Fabrics woven from slit-film tapes of polyethylene resin (uncoated or coated/laminated) originating in Japan | **April 22, 1977** |
| Mold steel originating in or exported from the Federal Republic of Germany | **April 1, 1984** |

> This creates a **phased-in application** of the anti-dumping deduction based on when the entry documents were submitted.

---

### **10. Prohibition on Use of Goods After Export**

- **No drawback payment** will be made if the goods:
  - Were manufactured or produced,
  - Then **used for any purpose after manufacture and before export**, such as for internal use, testing, or resale.

> This ensures that the goods are **exclusively exported** and not diverted or used domestically.

---

### **11. Schedule of Goods Covered**

The regulation applies specifically to the following three types of goods:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Single-row tapered roller bearings (outside diameter ≤ 6.625 inches) and parts thereof, **originating in Japan** |
| 2 | Fabrics woven from slit-film tapes of polyethylene resin, **uncoated or coated/laminated on one or both sides with polyethylene film**, **originating in Japan** |
| 3 | **Mold steel** originating in or exported from the **Federal Republic of Germany** |

> These goods were selected due to their **import dependency**, **high value**, and **potential for unfair trade practices** (especially in the context of anti-dumping measures).

---

### **12. Important Notes on Obsolescence**

- This regulation was **revoked** by **SOR/85-299, section 1**, on **June 19, 1985**.
- The revocation means that **this version of the Canadian Manufactured Goods Exported Drawback Regulations is no longer in force**.
- It has been **replaced** by more modern and comprehensive rules, likely under the current **Customs Act**, **Excise Tax Act**, and **drawback frameworks** administered by the Minister of National Revenue.

> **Practical Implication**:  
> Any claim filed under this regulation after June 19, 1985, would not be valid. Modern claims must follow updated rules, possibly under the **Drawback of Customs Duties and Excise Taxes Regulations** or other current legislation.
