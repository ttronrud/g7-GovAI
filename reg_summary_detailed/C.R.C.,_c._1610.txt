**Regulatory Summary:**

**1. Legal Basis:**  
The declaration is made pursuant to **subsection 17(3) of the Yukon Act**, which empowers the Government of Yukon to declare certain wildlife species as "game in danger of becoming extinct." This provision allows the territorial government to take protective measures to conserve and manage species at risk of extinction due to natural, human, or environmental factors.

**2. Species Declared at Risk:**  
The following native wildlife species are formally declared to be "game in danger of becoming extinct":

- **Bison (buffalo)**  
- **Black-tailed deer**  
- **Elk**  
- **Musk-oxen**

These species are recognized as being under significant threat to their survival in the Yukon territory, either due to population decline, habitat loss, climate change, overharvesting, or other ecological pressures.

**3. Purpose of the Declaration:**  
The primary purpose of this declaration is to initiate protective and conservation actions to prevent the extinction of these species. This may include:

- Implementing or strengthening population monitoring and management programs  
- Restricting or regulating hunting, trapping, or other human activities that could further endanger the species  
- Designating critical habitats for protection  
- Coordinating with Indigenous communities and scientific experts to develop recovery plans  
- Enhancing public awareness and education about the ecological and cultural importance of these species  

**4. Implications for Management and Policy:**  
Once declared as "game in danger of becoming extinct," these species will likely be subject to more stringent conservation measures than typical game species. This may result in:

- Prohibitions or moratoriums on commercial or recreational hunting  
- Requirements for special permits or licenses for any permitted harvesting  
- Increased funding and oversight for conservation efforts  
- Integration into broader environmental and biodiversity strategies of the Yukon government  

**5. Context and Significance:**  
This declaration underscores the Yukon government’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the protection of native species. These animals are not only ecologically vital components of the region’s ecosystems but also hold cultural and historical significance for Indigenous peoples in the territory. The inclusion of species like the musk-oxen and bison—some of which are rare or have limited ranges—highlights the fragility of Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems in the face of environmental change.

**6. Limitations and Clarifications:**  
- The declaration does not automatically lead to a complete ban on hunting or use of the species. Instead, it triggers a framework for managing and conserving the species.  
- The specific actions taken will be determined by the Yukon government in consultation with scientific advisors, Indigenous groups, and stakeholders.  
- The status of these species may be reviewed periodically to assess population recovery and changes in threats.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally identifies four key native game species in the Yukon as being at risk of extinction under the Yukon Act. By invoking subsection 17(3), the government initiates a formal conservation process aimed at preserving biodiversity, protecting ecological balance, and ensuring the long-term survival of these species within the Yukon’s natural heritage.
