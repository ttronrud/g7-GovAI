**Detailed Summary of the Remission Order on Fees for Services Related to an Assessment from the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

This remission order is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**, and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendations of:

- The **Treasury Board**  
- The **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**  
- The **Minister of Employment and Social Development**

This provision allows for the **remission (i.e., waiver or cancellation)** of certain fees paid under the **Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)**, specifically **section 315.2**, which governs fees for the provision of services related to an assessment conducted by the **Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)**.

---

**Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this remission order is to **provide financial relief to employers or groups of employers** who have incurred fees for DESD assessments related to work permit applications — but who are now unable to proceed with those applications due to the **impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)**.

The order recognizes that the pandemic caused significant disruptions in employment markets, job availability, and business operations, leading to the withdrawal of job offers and, consequently, the need to cancel or withdraw work permit applications that were previously initiated.

**Eligibility Criteria for Fee Remission:**

A fee paid under section 315.2 of the IRPR may be remitted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **The fee was paid in respect of an assessment requested before April 4, 2020**  
   - This establishes a temporal boundary: the assessment must have been initiated prior to the onset of widespread pandemic-related disruptions.  
   - The cutoff date (April 4, 2020) aligns with the global escalation of the pandemic and the beginning of significant public health and economic responses.

2. **The employer or group of employers no longer requires the assessment, or if the assessment has already been made, it cannot be used**  
   - This condition ensures that the remission applies only when the assessment is no longer relevant or useful.  
   - It prevents the use of the assessment for future purposes and confirms that the employer has effectively abandoned the need for it.

3. **The employer or group of employers has withdrawn the offer of employment due to the impact of COVID-19**  
   - The withdrawal must be directly attributable to the pandemic’s effects (e.g., business closures, reduced hiring, workforce shortages, health restrictions).  
   - This establishes a causal link between the pandemic and the employer’s decision to withdraw the job offer.

4. **No work permit has been issued under section 200 or 201 of the IRPR, and no application for such a work permit is being processed**  
   - This ensures that the remission does not apply if a work permit has already been granted or if a new application is currently in progress.  
   - The condition prevents misuse of the remission for ongoing or successful immigration processes.

**Scope of the Remission:**

- The remission applies specifically to **fees paid for services related to an assessment conducted by the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)**.  
- These assessments are typically part of the process to determine whether a foreign worker qualifies for a work permit under the Canadian immigration system.  
- The fee in question is governed under **section 315.2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)**.

---

**Effective Date:**

The remission order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette).  
This means that employers must apply for remission within the timeframe allowed by the registration date, and the relief will be available from that date forward.

---

**Key Implications and Intent:**

- **Support for Employers During Crisis**: The order provides targeted relief to employers who faced sudden, unforeseen disruptions due to the pandemic, allowing them to avoid financial penalties for fees that were no longer needed.
- **Proportionality and Fairness**: The conditions ensure that the remission is not broadly applied but is limited to cases where the pandemic directly caused the withdrawal of employment offers and the loss of the need for a DESD assessment.
- **Prevention of Abuse**: By requiring that no work permit has been issued or is being processed, the order prevents employers from using the remission to circumvent legitimate immigration processes or to reapply for permits after withdrawing offers.
- **Public Interest Justification**: The Governor General in Council made the decision on the basis of **public interest**, recognizing that the financial burden on employers during a national crisis could have disproportionate effects on economic stability and employment outcomes.

---

**Conclusion:**

This remission order is a **temporary, pandemic-responsive measure** designed to support employers who were unable to proceed with work permit applications due to the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a clear, conditional pathway for the cancellation of fees related to DESD assessments, ensuring that the relief is both equitable and aligned with the broader public interest. The order reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and compassion in times of national emergency.
