**Detailed Summary of the Cost Recovery Regulations (SOR/2012-146)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Cost Recovery Regulations* (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 52; registered as SOR/2012-146) are a set of administrative rules established under **section 83 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (the "Act")**. These regulations provide a framework for the **recovery of reasonable and necessary costs** incurred by the federal government’s environmental assessment (EA) Agency — specifically, the **Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA)** — when it performs its duties under the Act.

The regulations define **what services are eligible for cost recovery**, **how much can be recovered**, and **who is exempt from cost recovery obligations**, ensuring transparency, fairness, and financial accountability in the environmental assessment process.

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### **1. Exemption from Section 59(1) of the Act**

Section 59(1) of the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012* generally **prohibits cost recovery** from proponents (i.e., project developers or applicants) for certain types of services provided by the Agency. However, **this section does not apply** to the following entities:

- **Federal authorities** (e.g., departments or agencies of the federal government);
- The **Commissioner in Council of the Northwest Territories**, the **Legislature of Yukon**, and **any agency or body** operating within those territories;
- The **council of a First Nation band**, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*;
- **Provincial governments**, **except** in the case of a **provincial Crown corporation**.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: This exemption ensures that Indigenous communities, federal institutions, and provincial governments (especially those not acting through Crown corporations) are not burdened with cost recovery for services related to environmental assessments. It promotes equity and recognizes the distinct governance and funding structures of these entities.

#### **2. Prescribed Services for Cost Recovery (Part 1 of Schedule)**

The regulations list specific **third-party services** that are eligible for cost recovery under paragraph 59(1)(b) of the Act. These services are **prescribed** and include:

| Service Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Travel** | - Regular travel services (e.g., transportation for staff or consultants)<br>- Chartered services (e.g., flights, specialized transport) |
| **Distribution Services** | - Regular mail<br>- Courier services |
| **Public Meeting & Hearing Facilities** | Includes: <br>• Hospitality (meals, accommodation)<br>• Simultaneous interpretation (for multilingual hearings)<br>• Audio systems (microphones, sound equipment)<br>• Transcription services (for hearing records)<br>• Computer equipment (for data capture and reporting) |

> ✅ These services are explicitly recognized as **necessary and reasonable** for conducting public consultations and hearings during environmental assessments.

#### **3. Prescribed Cost Amounts (Parts 2 and 3 of Schedule)**

The regulations prescribe **specific monetary amounts** for various expenses, based on the type of service and the responsible party.

##### **Part 2: Costs for Agency Staff (Exercise of Agency Responsibilities)**

- The amounts in **column 2** of Part 2 are prescribed for the **expenses in column 1** (e.g., travel, distribution, meeting facilities).
- These amounts are set to cover **reasonable and necessary costs** incurred by the **Agency** in carrying out its EA responsibilities.
- The costs are **not** subject to negotiation or discretion; they are fixed and prescribed by regulation.

##### **Part 3: Costs for Review Panel Members**

- The amounts in **column 2** of Part 3 are prescribed for expenses related to **panel members** (e.g., travel, accommodation, meals) during public hearings or review processes.
- These costs are **not** for the Agency itself but for the **review panel members** who participate in the assessment process.

##### **Salary Per Diem Rates for Panel Members**

- **Panel Chairperson**: $650 per day  
- **Panel Member**: $500 per day  

> ⚠️ These rates are based on:
> - A **productivity rate of 220 days per year** (a standard work year in government budgeting);
> - An **EBP (Effective Base Pay) of 20%** of total chargeable salaries (to account for overhead and productivity);
> - For **employees in bargaining units**: The rates are based on the **highest increment** of collective agreements between the Treasury Board and the union (ensuring fair pay);
> - For **excluded or unrepresented employees**: The rates are based on the **Treasury Board’s published rates** under section 11.1 of the *Financial Administration Act*, again using the **highest increment** for all classifications.

> 💡 This ensures that panel members are compensated fairly, with respect to both union and non-union employees, and that compensation is aligned with prevailing wage standards.

#### **4. Effective Date and Legal Authority**

- The regulations **come into force on the day section 52 of the *Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act* (S.C. 2012, c. 19) comes into force**.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The *Cost Recovery Regulations* serve several critical functions:

3. **Accountability**: Establishes fixed, reasonable, and equitable rates for services, reducing disputes over cost claims.
4. **Efficiency**: Streamlines the environmental assessment process by providing clear guidelines for cost recovery, enabling timely and effective public consultations and reviews.

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- **No cost recovery applies** to federal, territorial, or Indigenous band councils.
- **Provincial governments** are exempt unless they operate through a **Crown corporation**.
- **Costs are not recoverable** for services not listed in the schedule.
- **Rates are fixed** and not subject to negotiation — they represent the maximum reasonable cost for the specified services.
