**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Salish Sucker (Catostomus catostomus ssp.) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation, formally titled the *Critical Habitat of the Salish Sucker (Catostomus catostomus ssp.) Order*, was issued by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** on **July 12, 2019**, under the authority of the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk.

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The Order is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29). These provisions empower the Minister to designate and define the *critical habitat* of a species listed as endangered, based on scientific evidence and recovery strategies.

- **Relevant Provisions of SARA**:
  - **Section 58(1)**: Applies to the critical habitat of species listed under SARA. This means that the identified critical habitat for the Salish Sucker is legally recognized and protected under the Act.
  - **Section 58(2)(b)**: Excludes any critical habitat that lies in a place designated as a "prohibited area" or subject to certain land-use restrictions. This clause is referenced to confirm that **no portion of the designated critical habitat falls within a prohibited area** under SARA.

**2. Species at Risk Status**

- The **Salish Sucker** (*Catostomus catostomus ssp.*) is a distinct subspecies of the common sucker fish.
- It is officially listed as an **endangered species** in **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the Species at Risk Act.
- This listing means the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild and is subject to legal protections under SARA.

---

**3. Recovery Strategy and Public Registry**

- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Salish Sucker was developed and adopted by the government.
- This strategy includes a detailed scientific assessment of the species’ ecological needs and identifies the **specific areas essential for its survival and recovery**—these areas are known as *critical habitat*.
- The recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database that documents all species at risk and their associated recovery plans and designations.

This inclusion ensures transparency and public access to the scientific basis for the critical habitat designation.

---

**4. Key Legal Determination**

- The Order explicitly confirms that **no portion of the critical habitat** designated in this regulation falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.
- This is a crucial legal safeguard: it ensures that the designation of critical habitat does not conflict with existing land-use or conservation restrictions (e.g., areas reserved for Indigenous use, protected lands, or areas subject to federal or provincial prohibitions).
- By confirming this exclusion, the Minister affirms that the critical habitat is both scientifically valid and legally permissible to designate.

---

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally designate and legally define the critical habitat** of the Salish Sucker.
- This designation triggers specific legal obligations under SARA, including:
  - **Protection of the habitat from harmful activities** (e.g., development, pollution, or physical alteration).
  - **Mandatory consultation** with federal, provincial, and Indigenous stakeholders before any project that may impact the critical habitat.
  - **Prohibition of actions** that could degrade or destroy the habitat, unless such actions are justified and approved through a compliance process.

- The critical habitat is defined in an **annexed document** (not included in this summary) that outlines the specific geographic areas, water bodies, and ecological features essential for the Salish Sucker’s survival (e.g., spawning grounds, feeding areas, water quality parameters, and connectivity to migration routes).

---

**6. Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal laws).
- This ensures that the legal protections are immediately enforceable upon formal notification.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- This Order represents a key step in the **conservation and recovery** of the Salish Sucker, one of Canada’s most vulnerable freshwater fish species.
- It reflects a commitment to **science-based conservation**, grounded in the species’ ecological requirements.
- It also underscores the importance of **intergovernmental and Indigenous collaboration**, as all activities affecting critical habitat must be assessed for potential impacts and approved accordingly.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Salish Sucker (Catostomus catostomus ssp.) Order* is a legally binding instrument that formally protects the essential areas required for the survival and recovery of an endangered fish species. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, complies with all relevant provisions of SARA, and ensures that no designated habitat falls within prohibited zones. By establishing and enforcing these protections, the Canadian government is fulfilling its legal and environmental responsibilities to preserve biodiversity and support species recovery in Canada.
