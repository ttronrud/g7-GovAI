### **Overview**
The *Gros Morne National Park of Canada Timber Harvesting Regulations*, made under **section 17 of the Canada National Parks Act**, establish a comprehensive framework for the **limited, traditional, and environmentally responsible harvesting of timber** within **Gros Morne National Park of Canada** in Newfoundland and Labrador. These regulations are designed to balance the need for sustainable resource use — particularly for traditional communities — with the imperative to **protect the ecological integrity** of the park.

The regulations apply exclusively to **Gros Morne National Park**, and they supersede any conflicting provisions in other regulations. They are particularly focused on **traditional harvesting practices** by long-standing residents of specific communities, with strict environmental safeguards and permit controls.
