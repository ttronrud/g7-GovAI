Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, which is a **Proclamation** issued by the Government of Canada under the authority of the Governor in Council, announcing the entry into force of the **Canada-Austria Income Tax Convention**.

### **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The proclamation is issued under **Section 6 of the Canada-Austria Income Tax Convention Act, 1980** (Part II of Chapter 44 of the Statutes of Canada, 1980–81).
- This section mandates that the Governor in Council must issue a **proclamation in the Canada Gazette** to officially notify the public of when the income tax treaty between Canada and Austria comes into force.
- The proclamation is legally binding and serves as formal notification to all persons, entities, and jurisdictions affected by the treaty.

#### **2. Purpose of the Proclamation**
- To **officially announce** the date on which the **Canada-Austria Income Tax Convention** (also known as the "Double Taxation Avoidance Convention" or DTAC) will **come into force**.
- The treaty aims to:
  - Avoid **double taxation** of income and capital gains.
  - Prevent **fiscal evasion** (tax avoidance or fraud) related to income and capital taxes.
- This ensures that individuals and businesses with income derived from either Canada or Austria are not taxed twice on the same income in both jurisdictions.

---

#### **3. Key Procedural Background**
- **Entry into Force Clause**: Article XXIX of the Convention specifies that the treaty will enter into force **60 days after the exchange of instruments of ratification**.
- **Date of Exchange of Instruments of Ratification**:  
  The instruments of ratification were exchanged in **Ottawa on December 19, 1980**.
- **Calculation of Entry into Force Date**:  
  Adding 60 days to December 19, 1980:
  - December 19 + 60 days = **February 17, 1981**.
- Therefore, the treaty officially becomes effective on **February 17, 1981**.

---

#### **4. Content of the Proclamation**
- The Governor in Council (acting on the advice of the Privy Council) formally **declares and publishes** that:
  > "The Convention between Canada and the Republic of Austria for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital will come into force on February 17, 1981."
- This declaration is made **public** through the **Canada Gazette**, which is the official government publication for legal notices and proclamations.

#### **5. Legal and Practical Implications**
- **For Taxpayers and Tax Authorities**:  
  After February 17, 1981, Canadian and Austrian tax authorities may apply the treaty provisions to resolve tax issues related to:
  - Income earned in one country but sourced from the other.
  - Capital gains (e.g., property or investment income).
  - Tax credits or exemptions (e.g., foreign tax credits, residence rules, tax residency).
- **For Individuals and Businesses**:  
  Taxpayers must now consider treaty rules when filing tax returns, especially if they have income from Austria or reside in Austria but earn income in Canada, or vice versa.
- **For the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA)**:  
  The CRA will begin enforcing the treaty’s provisions, including applying rules on tax credits, tax residence, and the avoidance of double taxation.
