### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **What Does "Repealed" Mean?**
"Repealed" means that the provision in question is no longer in force. It was previously part of a legal framework or regulation but has been formally removed by a subsequent law or amendment. This typically occurs when a law is updated, restructured, or replaced by a more current or relevant provision.

#### 2. **Statutory Instrument SI/2013-125**
- SI/2013-125 refers to a **Statutory Instrument** (SI) from the year 2013, numbered 125.
- Statutory Instruments are a form of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (or other jurisdictions using such a system), used to implement or amend primary legislation (such as Acts of Parliament).
- The specific SI/2013-125 is not named in your input, but based on common UK legislative history, such instruments often relate to areas like environmental regulation, transport, health, or administrative procedures.

#### 3. **Section 5 of SI/2013-125**
- Section 5 of that instrument contained a specific rule or requirement (e.g., a procedural rule, licensing condition, or administrative directive).
- The fact that it is marked as "repealed" means that this section is no longer applicable or enforceable under current law.

#### 4. **Reason for Repeal**
While the exact reason is not provided in the input, common reasons for repealing a section include:
- The provision was outdated or no longer relevant.
- A new, more effective, or comprehensive regulation has been introduced.
- A change in policy or public interest.
- The section was redundant or inconsistent with other laws.

#### 5. **Legal Consequence**
- Any legal obligation, duty, or rule previously derived from section 5 of SI/2013-125 is now **void**.
- Legal or regulatory bodies must no longer refer to or apply that section.
- Any enforcement or compliance action based on it would be invalid.
