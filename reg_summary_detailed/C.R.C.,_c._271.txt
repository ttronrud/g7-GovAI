**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Hog Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Saskatchewan Hog Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal instrument under the *Agri-Food Act of Saskatchewan* (Loi), governing the regulation of hog marketing in both interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes specific definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act of Saskatchewan*, which provides the legal framework under which the regulation operates. This Act grants the Agency authority over the marketing of agricultural products, including hogs.

- **Agency**: Refers to *SPI Marketing Group*, the organization designated by the government to manage and regulate hog marketing activities. The Agency is the central body responsible for implementing and enforcing the provisions of this Order.

- **Commission** (Repealed): Previously existed as a governing body but was officially repealed by *SOR/95-557, section 1*. It is no longer part of the regulatory structure.

- **Hog**: Defined as any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) that is produced within the Province of Saskatchewan. This definition ensures clarity in identifying the subject of regulation.

- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan for hogs established and amended over time in accordance with the *Agri-Food Act*. The Plan outlines how hogs are marketed, priced, and distributed, and forms the basis for the Agency’s regulatory decisions.

**3. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Trade**  
The Agency is explicitly authorized to regulate the marketing of hogs in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada). This authority extends beyond local marketing and allows the Agency to manage the broader market dynamics involving hogs moving beyond Saskatchewan’s borders.

Importantly, the Agency may **exercise the same powers** it has over local hog marketing within the province — including administrative, financial, and operational powers — when dealing with interprovincial and export markets. This means the Agency can apply consistent rules, oversight, and enforcement mechanisms across all levels of hog marketing.

**4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**  
A central provision of the Order grants the Agency the power to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals and businesses operating within Saskatchewan who are involved in either the **production or marketing of hogs**.

- **Classify producers into groups** based on factors such as size of operation, type of activity (e.g., farm vs. processor), or market participation. These groupings allow for differentiated levies or charges depending on the producer’s role or capacity.

- **Set different amounts of levies or charges** for members of different groups. For example, a small-scale farmer may pay a lower levy than a large commercial producer.

This classification system ensures fairness and equity in the distribution of costs and responsibilities among producers.

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The levies or charges collected are not merely administrative fees; they are designated for specific, legitimate purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves**: Funds may be set aside for future use, such as stabilizing prices or preparing for market downturns.

- **Payment of expenses and losses**: The Agency may use the funds to cover operational costs, losses incurred due to the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., due to market collapse or price drops), and administrative expenditures.

- **Equalization and adjustment of revenues among producers**: A key objective is to **balance the financial outcomes** of hog producers. This means that if some producers receive higher returns from hog sales during a particular period, the Agency may use levy revenues to redistribute funds to others who may have suffered lower returns. This helps mitigate economic disparities and supports market stability.

The equalization mechanism is especially important in ensuring that no single producer bears an undue burden during periods of fluctuating market conditions.

---

**6. Repealed Provisions**  
- The provision previously authorizing the Agency to exercise powers under *section 3* of the Act (in relation to interprovincial and export trade) was **repealed by SOR/80-90**. This means that the original version of that section is no longer in force, and the current authority is derived from the updated framework in this Order.
- The *Commission* was also repealed by *SOR/95-557, section 1*, indicating a shift in governance from a separate commission to direct regulation by SPI Marketing Group.

---

**7. Purpose and Significance**  
The Saskatchewan Hog Order is designed to:

- Provide a stable and fair system for hog marketing in both domestic and international markets.
- Ensure equitable financial outcomes for producers, especially during volatile market conditions.
- Allow the Agency to act as a market stabilizer through financial tools such as levies and equalization funds.
- Maintain consistency between local and external marketing practices, preventing market distortions.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Saskatchewan Hog Order* empowers the **SPI Marketing Group** to regulate hog marketing in interprovincial and export markets with the same authority it has over local sales. It enables the Agency to classify hog producers into groups, impose tiered levies or charges, and use collected funds for critical purposes such as reserve creation, loss recovery, and financial equalization among producers. This framework supports market stability, protects producer interests, and ensures that the hog industry remains resilient in the face of price fluctuations and economic uncertainty. The repeal of older provisions reflects a modernization of the regulatory structure, aligning it with current administrative and economic needs.
