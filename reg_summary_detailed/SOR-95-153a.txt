**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Title of the Regulation**  
*Statistics Canada 1996 Census of Population Terms Exclusion Approval Order*

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation was enacted in response to the unique staffing needs arising from the **1996 Census of Population** conducted by **Statistics Canada**. The primary objective was to facilitate the timely and efficient deployment of temporary personnel to support data collection and data processing operations across key administrative and clerical functions.

The **Public Service Commission (PSC)** assessed that applying the full scope of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to individuals hired on a temporary basis for this specific census would be:

- **Not practicable**, due to the urgency and scale of the census work;
- **Not in the best interests of the Public Service**, as it would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and procedural delays on a time-sensitive operation.

Therefore, the PSC concluded that a **temporary exclusion** from the PSEA was both appropriate and necessary for the successful execution of the 1996 census.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Basis**

1. **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**  
   - The PSC has determined that **all persons appointed for a specified period on or after April 1, 1995**, and employed by **Statistics Canada** in the following groups:
     - Clerical and Regulatory  
     - Programme Administration  
     - Administrative Services  
     - Information Services  
     - General Services  
   - **For the purpose of data collection and data processing** in connection with the **1996 Census of Population**  
   - **During the period from April 1, 1995, to March 31, 1997**  
   - Shall be **excluded from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act**.

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   - The exclusion is authorized under **subsection 41(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*, which allows the Public Service Commission to exclude certain temporary appointments from the Act when it is not practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service.
   - The **Regulations** themselves are made under **subsection 37(1)** of the PSEA, which empowers the Governor in Council to establish rules governing the employment of such temporary staff.

3. **Governor in Council Approval:**  
   - The Order is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendations of the Minister of Communications** (the federal minister responsible for Statistics Canada at the time) and the **Public Service Commission**.

### **Scope of the Exclusion**

- **Who is excluded?**  
  Individuals hired on a **fixed-term basis** (for a specified period) starting on or after **April 1, 1995**, specifically for roles related to census operations.

- **Where are they employed?**  
  Within Statistics Canada’s departments and units in the following service groups:
  - Clerical and Regulatory
  - Programme Administration
  - Administrative Services
  - Information Services
  - General Services

- **What is the purpose?**  
  To assist in **data collection and data processing** activities directly tied to the **1996 Census of Population**.

- **Timeframe:**  
  From **April 1, 1995**, to **March 31, 1997** — a two-year period covering the planning, execution, and post-census processing phases.

---

### **Significance of the Exclusion**

- **Removes Application of Standard Public Service Rules:**  
  These temporary employees are **not subject** to standard employment protections and procedures under the PSEA, such as:
  - Mandatory promotion processes
  - Equal opportunity and grievance procedures
  - Job classification and seniority rules
  - Certain rights related to tenure, pensions, or benefits

- **Enables Flexibility and Speed:**  
  The exclusion allows Statistics Canada to:
  - Hire skilled workers quickly without lengthy hiring processes
  - Adjust staffing levels based on census needs
  - Avoid delays that might arise from applying full employment regulations

- **Temporary Nature:**  
  The exclusion is **time-bound and purpose-specific** — it does not apply to permanent staff or to future censuses unless similarly justified.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

While the core of the Order is the **exclusion**, the **annexed Regulations** (not included in the text provided) would contain specific details such as:
- Definitions of "specified period" and "appointed for a specified period"
- Procedures for appointment and termination
- Requirements for record-keeping
- Compliance obligations
- Reporting duties to the Public Service Commission

These regulations ensure that, despite the exclusion from the PSEA, employment remains lawful, transparent, and accountable within the constraints of the temporary nature of the work.

---

### **Citation and Legal Status**

- The Order is formally cited as:  
  **Statistics Canada 1996 Census of Population Terms Exclusion Approval Order**

- It is binding and enforceable under the authority of the *Public Service Employment Act*.
