### **Detailed Summary of the Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports in Canada. The proposed regulations were first published in two successive issues of *The Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 20 and 27, 1993**, and in two issues of *News of the North* on **March 22 and 29, 1993**. This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for stakeholders** (e.g., local communities, developers, aviation authorities) to submit written representations or objections to the proposed rules.

Following this public consultation period, the regulations were officially adopted and are now formally enacted.

#### **2. Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: These Regulations may be cited as the *Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations*.

#### **3. Definitions of Key Terms**

The regulations define several critical geographical and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Rankin Inlet Airport, located near Rankin Inlet, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise location on the airport used as a reference for all measurements. It is situated on the centerline of runway 129–309, 914.4 meters from the threshold of runway 309. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 129–309). These surfaces ensure safe aircraft approach by defining clear zones where structures cannot exceed height limits. Each surface has a **1:50 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 50 meters horizontal distance). They rise to a horizontal line 15,000 meters away from the runway end, 2,400 meters offset from the runway centerline, and 300 meters above the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP elevation** (26.19 m above sea level). However, if this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent excessive height restrictions in low-lying areas. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, consisting of a **300-meter-wide** rectangular zone (150 meters on each side of the runway centerline) and **1,948.8 meters long**. It includes the runway and is associated with runway 129–309. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal distance), extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces upward and outward until they intersect with the outer surface. These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

> **Elevation Reference**: The ARP is at **26.19 meters above sea level**. All height limits are measured relative to this point.

#### **4. Scope of Application**

These zoning regulations apply to **all land** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, including public road allowances, as defined by the following:

- **Land within the outer limit** (a circular boundary described in Part VI of the schedule);  
- **Land directly under portions of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limit.

> The outer limit is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered at the airport reference point.

This means that any structure or development within this zone—whether on private land, public land, or road rights-of-way—is subject to the height restrictions.

---

#### **5. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:

- Erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing ones),  
- Where the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of:

  1. **Approach Surfaces**,  
  2. **Outer Surface**, or  
  3. **Transitional Surfaces**.

This restriction ensures that aircraft can safely approach and land without interference from tall structures that could cause turbulence, signal obstruction, or visibility issues.

> The restrictions are based on **geometric and aerodynamic safety standards** designed to protect aviation operations.

---

#### **6. Basis of Design and Reference Plans**

All spatial elements in these regulations are derived from the **Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2847**, dated **October 16, 1990**. This plan serves as the authoritative source for:

- Location of the airport reference point  
- Dimensions and positioning of the strip  
- Configuration of approach and transitional surfaces  
- Definition of the outer limit  

This plan provides a consistent, legally binding framework for land use and development around the airport.

---

#### **7. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear flight paths and approach corridors.  
- **Prevent obstruction** of aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.  
- **Protect critical flight zones** from tall structures that could interfere with visibility, navigation systems, or air traffic control.  
- Provide a **clear, enforceable, and transparent framework** for land use planning in the vicinity of the airport.

The height restrictions are designed to balance **air safety** with **local development needs**, ensuring that communities near the airport can grow sustainably without compromising aviation operations.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, enforcement of these regulations would typically involve:

- Local municipal authorities or land-use planning bodies  
- The Canadian Transportation Agency or Department of Transport (as responsible for aviation safety)  
- Penalties for non-compliance, including fines or orders to remove or modify structures  

Compliance is mandatory for all construction or development activities within the defined zones.

### **Summary in One Paragraph**

The *Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations* establish strict height limitations on all land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point (located 914.4 meters from the threshold of runway 309) to ensure aviation safety. The regulations define key zones—approach surfaces (1:50 slope rising to 300 meters above the runway end), transitional surfaces (1:7 slope extending to outer surface), and an outer surface at 45 meters above the airport reference point (or 9 meters above ground if lower)—that restrict any building or structure from exceeding these elevations. These rules are based on the official zoning plan (E.2847, 1990) and were developed after public consultation under the Aeronautics Act. The regulations apply to all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, including public road allowances, and are intended to protect aircraft operations by preventing obstructions during takeoff, landing, and approach.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Implication |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Local Developers** | Must ensure all new or expanded structures remain below the defined height limits. Planning applications must include height compliance assessments. |
| **Indigenous Communities** | May need to adjust traditional land use or infrastructure projects to comply with aviation safety zones. |
| **Government Agencies** | Responsible for monitoring compliance and enforcing the rules. |
| **Aviation Operators** | These regulations directly support safe flight operations at Rankin Inlet Airport. |

### **Conclusion**

The Rankin Inlet Airport Zoning Regulations represent a well-structured, safety-focused land-use framework designed to protect aviation operations in a remote Arctic environment. By clearly defining spatial boundaries and height restrictions, the regulations balance community development with the critical need for safe air access and navigation. Their foundation in a formal, publicly reviewed plan ensures transparency and accountability in land management near a key transportation hub.
