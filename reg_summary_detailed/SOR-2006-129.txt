### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The regulation in question has been **repealed** and is **no longer in force**.

**Repeal Mechanism**:  
It was repealed under **Section 15 of SOR/2011-237**, which is a Statutory Rules Order issued by the Government of Canada. SOR/2011-237 is a collection of regulatory amendments and repeals that came into effect on a specified date (typically published in the Canada Gazette).

**What "Repealed" Means**:  
- The regulation was previously in force and applied to certain legal or administrative matters.
- It has now been formally canceled and is **no longer applicable**.
- Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously set out in the regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the current, active regulations that replaced or superseded it (if any), or to other applicable laws.

**Why Was It Repealed?**  
While the specific content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your input, common reasons for repeal include:
- Obsolescence (e.g., outdated or no longer relevant to current practices),
- Redundancy (e.g., overlapping with other regulations),
- Inconsistency with newer legislation,
- Better governance through a more modern or streamlined regulatory framework,
- A decision by the government to consolidate or simplify regulations.

**Implications**:
- Entities (e.g., businesses, government agencies) that previously relied on this regulation must adjust their operations, compliance procedures, or reporting requirements accordingly.
- Legal challenges or enforcement actions based on this regulation would no longer be valid.
- The repeal is typically published in the *Canada Gazette* and is accessible through official government databases like the *Regulations and Orders* section of the Canadian government’s website (e.g., [canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca)).

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the repeated entries is **fully repealed** and **no longer active**. Its removal was formalized under **Section 15 of SOR/2011-237**, a government order that revoked the regulation. As such, it should not be cited or applied in current legal, administrative, or compliance contexts. For current regulatory requirements, one must consult the updated and active regulations in force as of the date of the repeal.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Without the original text of the regulation, a detailed analysis of its content, scope, or purpose cannot be provided. To understand the full context, the original regulation would need to be retrieved from the official database of Canadian regulations (e.g., the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Orders* database).

If you can provide the original regulation’s title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of food establishments"), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
