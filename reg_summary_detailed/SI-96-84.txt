**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board**. This reflects a formal, high-level governmental decision, with the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board providing policy and administrative input. The power to issue such designations is derived from **subsection 2(2) of the Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act** (S.C. 1992, c. 5), which grants the Governor General the authority to designate airport authorities and establish transfer dates for airport operations.

**2. Designation of a Designated Airport Authority**  
The regulation officially **designates the Winnipeg Airports Authority Inc. (WAAI)** as a **designated airport authority** under the Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act. This designation is significant because it legally recognizes WAAI as a body with the authority, responsibility, and regulatory standing to manage, operate, and oversee the Winnipeg International Airport. As a designated authority, WAAI is empowered to carry out functions such as infrastructure management, aviation services, revenue collection, and compliance with federal and provincial aviation regulations.

**3. Transfer Date for the Winnipeg International Airport**  
The regulation establishes the **transfer date** for the Winnipeg International Airport as **the day immediately following the closing date** as defined in the **Agreement to Transfer** entered into under **Order in Council P.C. 1996-1387**, dated August 28, 1996.  

- The **Agreement to Transfer** was a formal, legally binding document negotiated and approved by the federal government to facilitate the transfer of operational control of the airport from the federal government (specifically, the Department of Transport) to a private, non-profit corporation — the Winnipeg Airports Authority Inc.  
- The **closing date** in that agreement refers to the final day of the transition period during which the federal government retained operational control, and the transfer of assets, responsibilities, and liabilities was being finalized.  
- The **transfer date** is therefore set as the day **after** that closing date, ensuring a clear, legally defined point at which full operational and administrative responsibility for the airport passes to WAAI.

**4. Purpose and Significance**  
This regulation serves several key purposes:  
- It provides **legal clarity** and formal recognition of the transfer of airport management from public to a newly established, independent authority.  
- It ensures **continuity of operations** by clearly defining the effective date of transfer, minimizing disruption to airport services.  
- It supports **efficiency and accountability** by enabling WAAI to operate the airport with greater autonomy, potentially leading to improved service delivery, financial management, and long-term planning.  
- It aligns with broader federal policy goals of **privatizing or corporatizing airport operations** to improve performance and responsiveness.

**5. Legal and Regulatory Context**  
The regulation operates within the framework of the **Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act (S.C. 1992, c. 5)**, which was enacted to facilitate the transfer of airport operations to private authorities. This Act provides the legal foundation for:  
- Designating airport authorities;  
- Establishing transfer dates;  
- Defining the rights and responsibilities of both the transferring government and the receiving authority.  

The reference to **Order in Council P.C. 1996-1387** underscores that this transfer was a formal, government-approved process, subject to parliamentary oversight and legal scrutiny.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation formally designates the **Winnipeg Airports Authority Inc.** as the official managing body of the **Winnipeg International Airport** and establishes the **transfer date** as the day after the closing date in the 1996 Agreement to Transfer. It marks a pivotal moment in the airport’s governance, transitioning from direct federal control to a more autonomous, professionally managed entity. The regulation is legally binding, grounded in existing statutes, and serves as a critical step in ensuring the long-term sustainability and operational efficiency of the airport.
