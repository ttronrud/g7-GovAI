### **Detailed Summary of the Quebec Family Allowances Income Tax Remission Order, 1992**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The Order is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.
- It is authorized under **subsection 23(2)** of the **Financial Administration Act**, which permits the government to make tax remissions in the public interest.
- The Order is made pursuant to the **public interest** in providing relief to individuals receiving family allowances in Quebec.

#### **2. Title of the Order**
- The Order is officially titled:  
  **"Quebec Family Allowances Income Tax Remission Order, 1992"**  
  (It may be cited as such in legal or administrative references.)

#### **3. Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the **Income Tax Act** (the primary legislation governing income taxation in Canada).
- **Family allowances**: Payments received in 1992 under the **An Act Respecting Family Assistance Allowances of the Province of Quebec** (a provincial program providing financial support to families with children).

#### **4. Purpose of the Order**
- To **remit (i.e., cancel or forgive)** income tax liability for individuals who received family allowances in 1992.
- The remission is **not a general tax exemption**, but a targeted relief based on specific calculations involving tax payable and deemed payments under the Income Tax Act.

### **5. Conditions for Tax Remission**

A taxpayer is entitled to a remission of income tax **only if** the following conditions are met:

The remission is granted to the **amount by which** the following **excess amounts** are calculated:

---

#### **First Component: Excess of Tax Payable Over Deemed Tax Paid (Under Part I of the Act)**

> The amount by which:
> - The **total amount of taxes, interest, and penalties** payable by the individual under **Parts I, I.1, and I.2** of the Income Tax Act for the 1992 taxation year  
> **exceeds**  
> - The **amount deemed under subsection 120(2)** of the Act to have been paid by the individual on account of their tax under **Part I** of the Act for 1992.

**Explanation**:
- This measures the **actual tax burden** the individual faced in 1992, including taxes, interest, and penalties.
- It compares that total to the amount that would have been considered "paid" under the law (subsection 120(2)) — which is typically a deemed payment when income is included in taxable income.
- The **difference** (if positive) is the basis for remission.

---

#### **Second Component: Excess of Deemed Payments Over Actual Payments (Under Subsections 122.2(1) or 122.5(3))**

> The amount by which:
> - The **total of all amounts** that would be **deemed under subsections 122.2(1) or 122.5(3)** to have been paid by the individual on account of their tax under Part I of the Act for 1992  
> (if **no family allowance** were included in computing taxable income)  
> **exceeds**  
> - The **total of all actual amounts** deemed under those same subsections to have been paid by the individual on account of their tax in 1992.

**Explanation**:
- Subsections 122.2(1) and 122.5(3) deal with **deemed payments** — that is, amounts that are treated as having been paid to the government, even if not actually paid, because the individual’s income is included in taxable income.
- This component compares:
  - What the individual would have been deemed to have paid **if family allowances had not been included** in income (i.e., a "hypothetical" scenario).
  - What the individual actually was deemed to have paid (based on the real inclusion of family allowances).
- The **difference** (if positive) represents a **reduction in the tax burden** caused by the inclusion of family allowances in income — and this excess is also eligible for remission.

### **6. Final Remission Amount**

The total amount of income tax remitted to the individual is the **sum of the two excess amounts**:
1. The excess of actual tax liability over the deemed tax paid (under 120(2)).
2. The excess of the hypothetical deemed payments (without family allowance inclusion) over actual deemed payments (under 122.2(1) or 122.5(3)).

> **Remission = (Excess 1) + (Excess 2)**

This means that the remission is **not a flat refund**, but a **calculated relief** based on how much the inclusion of family allowances artificially increased the tax liability.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Intent**

- **Targeted Relief**: The Order specifically benefits individuals who received family allowances under Quebec’s family assistance program in 1992.
- **Tax Fairness**: It recognizes that family allowances are not income and should not increase a family’s taxable income — thus, the government is correcting the over-taxed outcome caused by including them in income calculations.
- **Corrects Double Burden**: By removing the tax burden that results from treating family allowances as income, the Order provides a form of **tax relief** to low- and middle-income families.
- **Public Interest**: The Governor General acts in the public interest — reflecting a policy goal of supporting families and reducing financial hardship.

---

### **8. Legal and Practical Notes**

- The Order applies **only to the 1992 taxation year**.
- It does **not** extend to other years or to individuals who did not receive family allowances in 1992.
- The calculation must be performed based on the **actual tax return** and the **provisions of the Income Tax Act** as they applied in 1992.
- The remission is **not a refund** in the traditional sense — it is a **direct cancellation** of tax liability, not a return of money to the taxpayer.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Quebec Family Allowances Income Tax Remission Order, 1992** is a targeted fiscal measure designed to correct an unintended tax consequence: the inclusion of family allowances in taxable income, which led to higher tax liabilities for qualifying families. By remitting income tax based on specific, legally defined excesses, the government ensures that families receiving support under Quebec’s family assistance program are not unfairly burdened by the tax system. It reflects a balance between administrative compliance and social policy objectives, promoting fairness and financial relief for low-income families.

This Order is a notable example of how **provincial family support programs** can be integrated with **federal tax policy** to provide equitable outcomes, even in the face of complex tax rules.
