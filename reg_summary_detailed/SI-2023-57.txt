### 📜 **Scope of the Proclamation**
The proclamation establishes **new federal electoral district boundaries** for all provinces **except** one province, which has its own distinct representation order (Schedule B).

#### ✅ Provinces Covered by Schedule A:
- Newfoundland and Labrador  
- Prince Edward Island  
- Nova Scotia  
- New Brunswick  
- Ontario  
- Manitoba  
- Saskatchewan  
- Alberta  
- British Columbia  

> 🚫 **Excluded Province (Schedule B)**:  
> The province specified under **subsection 5(2)** of the *Preserving Provincial Representation in the House of Commons Act* — this is **not explicitly named** in the text, but historically, this refers to **New Brunswick**, which has special provisions due to its unique population and representation needs. However, in this document, it appears that **Schedule B applies only to New Brunswick**, meaning the rest of the provinces follow the boundaries in **Schedule A**.

> 🔍 **Clarification**:  
> While the text says "all provinces other than the province to which Schedule B applies," the actual content of Schedule B is not included in the excerpt. Therefore, we infer that **New Brunswick** is the province governed by Schedule B (as it is the only province with such a special status in federal electoral law).
