This indicates that a particular regulation (or set of regulations) has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2008-102, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally **repealed** (cancelled or abolished) by legislation enacted through Statutory Instrument 2008-102, specifically under **Section 5** of that instrument.

- **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2008-102**: This is a secondary piece of legislation (a statutory instrument) passed in the year 2008. It typically amends, consolidates, or repeals existing laws or regulations. The fact that it includes a repeal of a regulation under section 5 suggests that the instrument was designed to remove outdated, redundant, or superseded provisions.

- **Section 5 of SI 2008-102**: This section contains the specific legal provision that identifies and repeals the targeted regulation. The repetition of the same line six times in the original text likely reflects a formatting or data entry error—possibly from a database or legal document where multiple entries were mistakenly duplicated. It does not imply that the regulation was repealed multiple times or that there were multiple distinct provisions repealed.

- **Implications**: 
  - Any legal obligations, duties, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
  - Legal entities, individuals, or government bodies must now refer to the **current version of the law** (or any successor regulation) that may have been introduced in its place.
  - The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or modernization effort to streamline or update the legal framework.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced is **repealed** and therefore **no longer exists as active law**. Its removal was enacted by **Statutory Instrument 2008-102, section 5**, which formally abolished the provision. The repeated entries in the original text are likely a technical or formatting error and do not reflect distinct legal actions. 

To understand the full context, one would need to consult the actual text of SI 2008-102, particularly section 5, to identify the original regulation that was repealed and to determine what legal or policy changes were intended by the repeal. Without that, the summary remains limited to the factual status of repeal.
