The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-169, s. 5]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (section 5 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2016-169) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by another legislative instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The Statutory Instrument **SOR/2016-169**, which was issued on May 10, 2016, under the authority of the Government of Canada.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 5 of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect as of the date the SOR/2016-169 was published, which is May 10, 2016 (or shortly thereafter, depending on the publication schedule).
- **Legal Effect**: The repeal means that the content of section 5 of SOR/2016-169 is no longer in force. Any legal obligations, definitions, or rules previously established by that section are no longer applicable.
- **Context**: SOR/2016-169 is a Statutory Instrument (a type of secondary legislation) that typically implements or amends rules under a primary act (e.g., a federal statute). The fact that section 5 was repealed suggests that the government either:
  - Found the provision outdated or unnecessary,
  - Identified errors or inconsistencies,
  - Made a policy change that rendered the section obsolete,
  - Or replaced it with a more effective or current provision.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest a possible formatting or data entry error in the original source. In a real regulatory database, such repetition would be redundant and likely a technical glitch.
- Since the regulation is **repealed**, it is **no longer enforceable** or relevant for legal or administrative purposes.
- Any references to this section in legal documents, compliance checks, or policy analyses should be updated to reflect its repeal.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** in this entry. The section of SOR/2016-169, section 5, has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. Legal practitioners, compliance officers, or policy analysts should consult current legislation or updated regulatory databases to ensure they are referencing valid and enforceable rules.
