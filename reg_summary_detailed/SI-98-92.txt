### **Key Provisions and Purpose**

1. **Legal Authority**:
   - The order is issued pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which allows for the inclusion of certain land parcels adjacent to water bodies—specifically those within a defined distance of the ordinary high water mark—into a land grant, particularly when such inclusion is necessary for land use, access, or Indigenous land rights purposes.

2. **Scope of the Land Included**:
   - The regulation designates a specific parcel of land located within **Lot 1047 of the Town of Norman Wells**, in **Quad 96 E/07**, Northwest Territories.
   - This parcel lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark** of **Seepage Lake**.
   - The inclusion is not of the entire lot, but only of that portion of the land that falls within the specified distance from the lake’s waterline.

3. **Geographic and Legal Description**:
   - The land is precisely described as:
     > "All that parcel of land, within Lot 1047 in Quad 96 E/07 in the Town of Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories, lying within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark around Seepage Lake."
   - This parcel is visually identified on a **sketch plan** referenced as **file 33-1-10**, held in the **Land Management Division** of the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)** in Ottawa.
   - The pink-shaded area on this sketch plan indicates the exact boundaries of the included land.

4. **Significance of the Ordinary High Water Mark**:
   - The "ordinary high water mark" is a legally recognized boundary used in land tenure and land use planning. It typically marks the highest point reached by water during normal seasonal conditions (not during floods or exceptional events).
   - By including land within this 100-foot buffer, the regulation ensures that the area is legally recognized as part of the grant, which may have implications for:
     - Access to the water body,
     - Use rights (e.g., fishing, hunting, cultural practices),
     - Environmental protection,
     - Land tenure clarity, or
     - Indigenous rights and title (especially if the land is held under Indigenous agreements or land claims).

5. **Administrative Context**:
   - The regulation reflects a procedural step in land management and land grant administration, often used to clarify or expand the boundaries of land rights, especially in areas where water bodies are central to traditional use or land access.
   - The involvement of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development suggests that this may be part of a broader effort to recognize or support Indigenous land use, access, or cultural practices in the NWT.

### **Implications**

- **Legal Effect**: Once enacted, the land within 30.48 metres of Seepage Lake is formally included in the grant of land described in the schedule, making it part of the legally defined property.
- **Stakeholder Impact**:
  - Indigenous communities or land users who rely on access to Seepage Lake may benefit from clearer land rights or usage permissions.
  - Land management authorities will now have a legally defined boundary for planning, environmental assessments, or infrastructure development.
- **Clarity and Record-Keeping**: The reference to a specific sketch plan (file 33-1-10) ensures that the boundary is documented and accessible for future reference by government departments, legal professionals, and Indigenous groups.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, legally binding directive that expands the boundaries of a land grant to include a strip of land adjacent to Seepage Lake in the Town of Norman Wells. By applying paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act, it formally recognizes the significance of the 100-foot buffer zone around the lake’s high water mark. The decision is grounded in administrative procedure and is supported by a clear, documented map. It serves both practical land management purposes and may reflect broader efforts to uphold Indigenous rights and land use in northern Canada.
