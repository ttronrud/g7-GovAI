**Detailed Summary of the Banc-des-Américains Marine Protected Area Regulations**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 1996, c. 31*  
*Made under subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act*

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
These regulations establish the **Banc-des-Américains Marine Protected Area (MPA)** in Canadian waters, pursuant to the *Oceans Act*. The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, designates this area as a protected zone to conserve marine biodiversity, habitats, and ecosystem functions. The regulations are grounded in the principles of environmental protection and sustainable use of marine resources.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Marine Protected Area (MPA):**  
  Refers to the specific area of sea designated under Section 2 of the *Oceans Act*. This includes:
  - The **seabed**
  - The **subsoil to a depth of 5 meters**
  - The **water column above the seabed**

- **Vessel:**  
  Defined in accordance with Section 2 of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, meaning any ship, boat, or other floating structure used for navigation or transport.

> All geographical coordinates in the schedule are referenced using the **North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)** system, ensuring consistency and accuracy in spatial mapping.

---

### **3. Geographic Boundaries of the MPA**
The MPA is defined geometrically using **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing) connecting specific points:

- **Overall MPA Boundary:**  
  A polygon formed by connecting:
  - Point 1 to Point 4, then back to Point 1  
  → This forms the outer boundary of the entire protected area.

- **Management Zones (Subdivisions):**
  1. **Zone 1:**  
     Bounded by rhumb lines from Point 1 → Point 5 → Points 6 to 16 → back to Point 1  
     → This zone is **restricted for anchoring** and has strict environmental protections.

  2. **Zone 2a:**  
     Bounded by rhumb lines from Point 5 → Point 2 → Point 3 → Point 11 → Point 10 → Point 9 → Point 8 → Point 7 → Point 6 → back to Point 5  
     → Allows limited commercial and recreational fishing (with restrictions).

  3. **Zone 2b:**  
     Bounded by rhumb lines from Point 16 → Point 15 → Point 14 → Point 13 → Point 12 → Point 4 → back to Point 16  
     → Also allows limited commercial and recreational fishing (with restrictions).

> The full geographic details are provided in the **Schedule** to the regulations.

### **4. Prohibited Activities**
Without exception, **any activity that disturbs, damages, destroys, or removes** any living marine organism or part of its habitat is **prohibited** in the MPA. This includes:
- Physical interference with marine life
- Habitat degradation (e.g., trawling, dredging)
- Introduction of foreign materials or pollutants

> This prohibition applies to all activities unless explicitly authorized.

---

### **5. Permitted Activities**
Certain activities are allowed **only if** they comply with:
- The *Fisheries Act*
- The *Coastal Fisheries Protection Act*
- Their respective regulations

#### a) **Fishing Activities**
- **Aboriginal Communal Fishing:**

- **Commercial Fishing in Zones 2a and 2b:**  
  Permitted **only for species NOT including**:
  - Capelin
  - Herring
  - Mackerel
  - Sand lace
  - Krill
  - Copepods  
  → Other species may be fished using:
  - Traps
  - Longlines
  - Handlines
  - Angling

- **Recreational Fishing in Zones 2a and 2b:**  
  Permitted using:
  - Handlines
  - Angling

> *Note:* No commercial fishing is allowed in Zone 1.

#### b) **Navigation**
Navigation is permitted under the following conditions:
- **No anchoring** is allowed in **Zone 1**
- Vessels of **400 gross tonnage or more** or certified to carry **15 or more persons** must:
  - Not discharge **sewage** (as defined in *Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemicals Regulations*, subsection 1(1))
  - Not release **greywater** (as defined in subsection 131.1(1) of the same regulations)

> These rules aim to prevent pollution and protect sensitive marine environments.

---

### **6. Exceptions to Prohibitions**
The following activities are **exempt** from the general prohibitions:
- Activities for **public safety**, **national defence**, **national security**, **law enforcement**, or **emergency response**
- Activities that are part of an **approved activity plan** submitted to and approved by the Minister

---

### **7. Activity Plans: Submission and Approval Process**
Any individual or organization may submit a detailed **activity plan** to the Minister for:
- Scientific research
- Habitat restoration
- Educational programs
- Commercial marine tourism

#### Required Information in the Plan:
1. **Contact details** of the applicant (and responsible individual if an institution)
2. **Vessel details**:
   - Name, registration, number, call sign
   - Owner, master, and operator information
3. **Activity description**:
   - Purpose, methods, data to be collected
4. **Location**:
   - Geographical coordinates and map showing location within the MPA
5. **Dates**:
   - Proposed dates and alternative dates
