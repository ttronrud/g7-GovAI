### **Detailed Summary of the New Motor Vehicles Exported Drawback Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose**
The **New Motor Vehicles Exported Drawback Regulations** (SOR/79-540) were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, pursuant to **sections 275 and 276 of the Customs Act** and **subsection 44(8) of the Excise Tax Act**. These regulations replace the outdated **Motor Vehicles Exported Drawback Regulations** made by Order in Council P.C. 1979-1937 (19 July 1979).

**Objective**:  
To provide a modern, transparent, and equitable framework for granting **drawbacks**—that is, refunds or reductions of customs duty, sales tax, and excise tax—on **new motor vehicles** that are **purchased and used temporarily in Canada before being exported**, provided they meet specific conditions.

This reform aims to:
- Encourage temporary use of foreign-made or domestically produced vehicles for legitimate export purposes.
- Prevent misuse (e.g., commercial use or resale) that could lead to tax evasion.
- Ensure that only eligible vehicles and components are eligible for tax refunds.

#### **3. Eligibility for Drawback (Section 3)**

The Minister may authorize a drawback of **customs duty, sales tax, and excise tax** paid on or in respect of:

##### **(a) The Motor Vehicle Itself**
- Whether the vehicle was **imported into Canada** or **manufactured in Canada**.
- Applies to new motor vehicles used temporarily in Canada prior to export.

##### **(b) Imported Parts and Materials Used in Manufacturing or Assembly**
- **Used in, wrought into, or attached to** the motor vehicle.
- Eligible if:
  - The vehicle was **manufactured or produced in Canada**.
  - The imported parts/materials were used in the **same plant** where the vehicle was made, during the **12-month period immediately before** its production.
  - **Two scenarios apply**:
    1. **Interchangeable domestic equivalents** were used:  
       Domestic parts/materials of the **same class and similarity** as imported ones could have been used interchangeably.
    2. **Direct consumption** of domestic materials (excluding fuel and plant equipment) in production, where imported materials were used in the manufacturing process.

##### **(c) Imported Materials Consumed in Manufacturing**
- Materials directly consumed in manufacturing or production of the vehicle (excluding fuel and plant equipment).
- Must be used in the Canadian manufacturing facility.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The drawback applies only to **new motor vehicles** that were not previously used or sold in Canada.

---

#### **4. Temporary Use Periods (Section 4)**

A new motor vehicle may be used in Canada before exportation for a **maximum period** depending on the purchaser’s residency status:

| Purchaser Status | Maximum Use Period |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Canadian resident** | Up to **30 days** from delivery date |
| **Non-resident** | Up to **12 months** from delivery date |

> ❗ **Important**: The vehicle must be exported **within** this period. Any extension beyond the allowed time disqualifies the claim.

---

#### **5. Conditions Preventing Drawback (Section 5)**

No drawback will be granted if any of the following conditions apply:

- The vehicle was **used by anyone other than the purchaser** before exportation.
- The vehicle was **sold or otherwise disposed of** (e.g., transferred) to another party in Canada before exportation.
- The vehicle was used for:
  - **Transportation of persons or goods for hire or reward** (commercial use).
  - **Transportation of goods for sale**.
  - **Soliciting sales or subscriptions** on behalf of a Canadian company.
- The vehicle was **re-imported into Canada** after exportation, **without compliance** with the Customs Act, Customs Tariff, or related regulations.

> These restrictions prevent misuse of the system for commercial gain or tax avoidance.

#### **6. Claim Submission Requirements (Section 6)**

A claim for drawback must be submitted in **duplicate**, in the form prescribed by the Minister, and filed **after exportation** at a customs office.

##### **Who Files the Claim?**
- **Imported vehicle**: The **importer** or **vendor**.
- **Domestically manufactured vehicle**: The **manufacturer** exporting the vehicle.

##### **Required Documentation (Must Be Attached):**
1. Copy of the **offer to purchase** the vehicle.
2. Copies of **invoices** related to the sale or transfer of the vehicle.
3. **Certificates** in duplicate:
   - Certificate of importation, sale, or transfer.
   - Certificate of sale for exportation.
4. **Customs-certified copy** of the **Identification of Goods Exported or Destroyed** form (proving exportation).
5. **Additional Documents by Destination**:
   - If exported to a **North American country**:
     - Copy of the **foreign consumption entry**.
     - Copy of the **foreign vehicle registration** obtained in the destination country.
6. **For non-resident purchasers** (using vehicle under paragraph 4(1)(b)):
   - Copy of a **permit issued by the Department of Employment and Immigration** confirming non-resident status.

> ✅ **If any document is missing**, the claim may still proceed if **equivalent information** is provided (e.g., a letter explaining the absence with supporting evidence).

---

#### **7. Time Limit for Tax Payment (Section 7)**

No payment will be made for a drawback claim unless:
- The **customs duty, sales tax, and excise taxes** were actually paid **within the four-year period** immediately before the claim was filed.

> This ensures that claims are only processed for taxes that have been legitimately and recently paid.

---

#### **8. Application Date (Section 8)**

- These regulations apply to **all customs duty, sales, and excise taxes paid on or after April 1, 1981**.
- Prior tax payments (before April 1, 1981) are not covered under this revised framework.

---

#### **9. Reduction of Drawback for By-Products and Scrap/Waste (Section 9)**

When imported parts or materials are used in manufacturing and result in **by-products** or **merchantable scrap/waste**, the drawback amount is reduced:

##### **(a) For By-Products**
- Drawback is reduced **proportionally** to the value of the by-product relative to the total value of all production from the imported materials.

> Example: If a batch of imported parts produces $100,000 in value and $10,000 in by-product, the drawback is reduced by 10%.

##### **(b) For Merchantable Scrap or Waste**
- Drawback is reduced by an amount calculated as:
  > (Canadian sales value of scrap/waste) × (prevailing customs duty rate on merchantable scrap/waste of the same kind when imported as such)

> Example: If scrap has a $5,000 market value and the customs duty on similar scrap is 10%, the reduction is $500.

##### **(c) Limitation on Duty Rate**
- The reduction **cannot be based on a higher customs duty rate** than the one originally paid on the imported parts or materials.

> This prevents manipulation or over-reduction based on inflated duty rates.

### **Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Implication |

| **Strict Compliance with Export Documentation** | Exportation must be formally documented and verified. |
| **Prevention of Tax Evasion** | Clear prohibitions against resale, commercial use, or re-importation. |
| **Fairness in Component Refunds** | Drawback is adjusted for manufacturing by-products and waste, ensuring tax fairness. |
| **Modernization of Rules** | Replaces outdated 1979 rules with clearer, more enforceable standards. |
