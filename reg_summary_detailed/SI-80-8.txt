Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation, which is a **Proclamation declaring public harbours in Canada** under the *Canada Shipping Act*.

### **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation Declaring Public Harbours**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The proclamation is issued under **Section 590 of the Canada Shipping Act**, as amended, which is part of the *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970* (Chapter S-9). This section grants the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister and relevant ministers) the authority to, by **proclamation**, declare any area of water within Canada’s jurisdiction as a **public harbour**.

Key elements of the legal authority:
- The declaration must define the **geographic limits** of the proclaimed harbour.
- The proclamation is **binding and enforceable** once issued and comes into effect on the specified date.
- It applies to all persons and entities operating within or near the declared areas.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Proclamation**
The primary purpose of this proclamation is to **formally designate specific maritime areas as public harbours**. These designations have significant implications for:
- **Maritime navigation and safety**
- **Regulation of shipping and vessel movements**
- **Jurisdiction over port activities and enforcement**
- **Legal responsibility for infrastructure, maintenance, and access**

By declaring these areas as public harbours, the federal government establishes clear legal boundaries and regulatory oversight, ensuring that vessels, mariners, and port authorities operate under established rules and protections.

---

#### **3. Effective Date**
The proclamation takes effect on **January 1, 1980**. This date marks the beginning of the legal status of the designated areas as public harbours, with all associated rights, responsibilities, and regulatory obligations applying from that point forward.

---

#### **4. Designated Public Harbours and Their Boundaries**

The proclamation declares **four distinct areas** as public harbours. Each is defined with precise geographic coordinates, directional lines, and referenced chart data to ensure clarity and enforceability.

---

##### **(1) Burnt Bay and Lewisporte Harbour**
- **Area**: All waters of Burnt Bay and Lewisporte Harbour within Canadian jurisdiction.
- **Boundary Definition**:
  - A line is drawn from a point located at:
    - **Latitude 49° 17′ 42.5″ N, Longitude 55° 00′ 51″ W** (in Jobs Cove)
  - On an **azimuth of 086° true (northward)**, extending to **St. Michael’s Island**.
  - Then continuing **northwards** to the **opposite shore**.
- **Chart Reference**: *Chart No. 4599 (Bay of Exploits), First Edition, January 2, 1959*  
  → This reference ensures the boundary is based on a historically verified and officially published nautical chart.

> **Significance**: This area likely supports regional maritime commerce, fishing, and emergency response in the northern part of Newfoundland and Labrador.

---

##### **(2) Mortier Bay**
- **Area**: All waters of Mortier Bay within Canadian jurisdiction.
- **Boundary Definition**:
  - A line starts at:
    - **Skiffsail Point** at:
      - Latitude 47° 08′ 43.5″ N, Longitude 55° 03′ 40.7″ W
  - Proceeds on an **azimuth of 217° true** (south-southeast direction) to a point **south of Blow Me Down** on the opposite shore.
- **Chart Reference**: *Chart No. 4587 (Mortier Bay), New Edition, December 25, 1970*  
  → Indicates the boundary is based on a more recent, updated nautical chart, reflecting current topography and navigation.

> **Significance**: Mortier Bay is a coastal area in Newfoundland, likely used for fishing and small vessel traffic. The boundary ensures that maritime activities are governed under federal shipping laws.

---

##### **(3) Portland Canal**
- **Area**: All waters of the Portland Canal within Canadian jurisdiction.
- **Boundary Definition**:
  - A line starts at:
    - **Glacier Point** at:
      - Latitude 55° 49′ 08″ N, Longitude 130° 06′ 38″ W
  - Proceeds on an **azimuth of 172° true** (north-northwest direction) to **Engineers Point** on the opposite shore.
- **Chart Reference**: *Chart No. 3933 (Portland Canal and Observatory Inlet), New Edition, June 3, 1977*  
  → This is a relatively modern reference, indicating updated navigational data and possible infrastructure developments.

> **Note**: The Portland Canal is a man-made waterway in British Columbia, likely connecting to larger inland water systems. This designation enhances federal oversight of inland water navigation and port access.

> **Significance**: The canal supports transportation, potential industrial activity, and emergency access in a remote region. Public harbour status enables federal regulation of traffic, safety, and environmental protection.

---

##### **(4) Lake Erie (Canadian Section)**
- **Area**: All waters of Lake Erie within Canadian jurisdiction.
- **Boundary Definition**:
  - Begins at **Peacock Point**:
    - Latitude 42° 47′ 27″ N, Longitude 79° 58′ 58.5″ W
  - Proceeds **due south** for a distance of **3.3 nautical miles**.
  - Then turns **due west** to **longitude 80° 10′ 00″ W**.
  - Finally, connects to the **shoreline**.
- **Chart Reference**: *Chart No. 2110 (Long Point Bay), New Edition, December 19, 1975*  
  → This chart supports the boundary's accuracy, particularly for navigation near the southern end of Lake Erie.

> **Significance**: This is a major transboundary water body. The Canadian section of Lake Erie is vital for commercial shipping, fishing, and environmental protection. Declaring it a public harbour ensures that:
> - Vessel traffic is regulated under federal shipping laws.
> - Safety, pollution control, and navigation aids are maintained.
> - The Canadian government can enforce environmental and safety standards across the waterway.

#### **5. Legal and Administrative Implications**
- **Jurisdiction**: Once declared a public harbour, the area falls under the **federal jurisdiction** of the Department of Transport (or its successor agency), particularly in matters of:
  - Vessel registration
  - Navigation safety
  - Port operations
  - Environmental compliance
- **Enforcement**: The Canadian Coast Guard and other maritime authorities are empowered to enforce rules, conduct inspections, and respond to emergencies.
- **Public Access**: The designation ensures that the public (e.g., fishermen, recreational boaters) has legal rights to access and use the waters, provided they comply with applicable regulations.
- **Exclusivity**: The declaration does **not** imply exclusive ownership or control, but rather establishes a legal framework for **regulated access and use**.

---

#### **6. Proclamation Issuance and Authentication**
- **Issued by**: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, by and with the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**.
- **Signed by**: **Edward Richard Schreyer**, who held the following titles at the time:
  - Governor General of Canada (Head of State)
  - Chancellor of the Order of Canada
  - Commander of the Order of Military Merit
  - Recipient of the Canadian Forces’ Decoration
- **Date Signed**: December 19, 1979
- **Place**: Government House, Ottawa
- **Legal Form**: The proclamation is made "Patent" and bears the **Great Seal of Canada**, giving it full legal force and validity under Canadian law.

---

#### **7. Historical and Geopolitical Context**
- This proclamation was issued in **1979**, just before the start of the 1980s, a period of increased federal focus on maritime safety, environmental protection, and infrastructure development.
- The inclusion of **remote and inland waterways** (e.g., Portland Canal) reflects Canada’s commitment to regulating all navigable waters, even in sparsely populated or geographically challenging regions.
- The use of **precise coordinates and azimuths** demonstrates a commitment to accuracy and legal clarity, reducing ambiguity in maritime boundaries.
