The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-120, s. 2]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Regulation SOR/2017-120, section 2**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed**. This means it is no longer in force and has been formally removed from the legal framework.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2017-120**, which is a *Supplemental Order Respecting Regulations* issued by the Government of Canada in 2017.
- **Section Repealed**: Specifically, **Section 2** of SOR/2017-120 contains the provision that repeals the referenced regulation.
- **Legal Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation no longer apply. Legal entities, individuals, or institutions that relied on it must now refer to current, active regulations.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because:
  - The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It was superseded by a more modern, comprehensive, or better-suited regulation.
  - It created inconsistencies or conflicts with other laws.
  - It was found to be redundant or ineffective in practice.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest a possible formatting or data entry error, as the same repeal notice is listed multiple times. However, each instance confirms the same outcome: **the regulation is no longer valid**.
- Since the regulation is **repealed**, there is **no active legal text** to summarize in terms of content, scope, or requirements — as it no longer exists in force.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2017-120, section 2**. As such, it is **no longer enforceable or applicable** under Canadian law. Any prior interpretation or application of the regulation is now invalid, and legal or regulatory activity must be based on current, active legislation.
