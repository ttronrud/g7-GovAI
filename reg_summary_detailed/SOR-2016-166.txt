**Detailed Summary of the *Carbonated Beverage Glass Containers Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Carbonated Beverage Glass Containers Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, establish specific safety standards for **carbonated beverage glass containers** with a capacity of **1.5 liters or more** that contain **non-alcoholic carbonated beverages**. These regulations were introduced to prevent injury risks associated with glass containers that may shatter under pressure, particularly during handling or impact, and to ensure consumer safety.

The regulations came into force upon registration and are designed to be enforced through rigorous testing, clear labeling, and accountability in manufacturing and importation processes.

### **Key Definitions and Scope**

- **Carbonated Beverage Glass Container**:  
  A glass container with a **capacity of 1.5 L or greater**, containing a **non-alcoholic carbonated beverage**.

> This definition excludes alcoholic beverages and containers below 1.5 L in volume.

---

### **Core Safety Requirements**

#### **1. Shatter Resistance Test (Perforation Prevention – Schedule 1)**
A carbonated beverage glass container must **not shatter in a way that perforates plastic sheets** used in a standardized test setup.

- **Test Method (as described in Schedule 1)**:
  - A **test apparatus** is constructed with:
    - A **10 cm diameter flat support surface**.
    - A **square frame (80 cm x 80 cm)** made of four 16 mm diameter rods, mounted vertically, 80 cm above the support surface.
    - A **drill probe** (adjustable height) with a **4.5 mm sharp "MM Glazemaster Glass Drill, Type A"** affixed to it.
    - The probe advances at **0.254 mm per second** and rotates at **0.2 revolutions per second**.
    - Adjustable support points to hold the container upright.

  - **Plastic sheet protection system**:
    - Clear polyethylene sheets (0.035 ± 0.005 mm thick) are suspended:
      - One **80 cm wide sheet** across the top and two side walls.
      - Two **33 cm wide sheets** on the side facing the drill, with a **14 cm gap** symmetrically placed around the drill centerline.
    - The lower edges of all sheets extend below the support surface and are subjected to a **uniform downward force of 39 N/m of width** via weight rods.

  - **Pre-test conditions**:
    - Remove any **packaging or labels** that do not remain on the container after sale or use.
    - Equilibrate the unopened container:
      - Store in a **22°C water bath for 4 hours**.
      - Subject to **ultrasonic agitation** to equilibrate internal pressure.
    - Ensure plastic sheets are **free of pre-existing perforations**.
    - Position the container **upright and centered** on the support surface.
    - Adjust the drill probe and support points to the **mid-height** of the container.
    - Advance the drill until it pierces the container.

  - **Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    - The container **must not cause any piece or part to perforate** any of the plastic sheets above the support surface.

> This test simulates a scenario where a container might be struck or punctured during handling, ensuring that even if it breaks, fragments do not penetrate protective plastic barriers.

---

#### **2. Weight Retention Test (Dry Weight Retention – Schedule 2)**
When tested under specific conditions, **at least 95% of the dry weight** of the container must remain **inside the cylinder** after shattering.

- **Test Method (as described in Schedule 2)**:
  - A **drop test** is conducted using:
    - A **concrete block (50 cm × 40 cm × 20 cm)** with a smooth, flat surface.
    - A **rigid vertical cylinder (2 m in diameter, 20 cm high)** centered over the block, so its top edge aligns with the impact surface.
    - A **drop mechanism** consisting of two horizontal bars (6 mm diameter), 4 cm apart, positioned symmetrically over the centerline of the impact surface, at **75 cm above** the surface.

  - **Pre-test conditions**:
    - Remove non-removable packaging and labels.
    - Equilibrate the container:
      - Store in a **25°C water bath for 4 hours**.
      - Agitate with **ultrasonic energy** to equalize internal pressure.
    - Clean the cylinder and surrounding area.

  - **Test procedure**:
    - Place the container **horizontally and centered** on the support bars.
    - Allow it to **fall freely** via a snap-action withdrawal of the support bars.
    - Upon shattering:
      - Collect and weigh all container fragments that:
        - **Travel beyond the outside diameter** of the cylinder (external fragments).
        - **Remain within the inside diameter** of the cylinder (internal fragments).
      - Calculate the **total dry weight** of the container by summing the weights of both sets of fragments.

- **Pass/Fail Criteria**:
  - The **total dry weight** of the container must be **at least 95%** of the original dry weight.

> This ensures that the container does not disintegrate into very small or lost pieces, which could pose a choking or ingestion hazard. It also verifies structural integrity under impact.

---

### **Labeling Requirements**

- Every carbonated beverage glass container must have the following **warning printed or affixed** in **boldface letters**:
  - **"CONTENTS UNDER PRESSURE. HANDLE WITH CARE."** (in English)
  - **"CONTENU SOUS PRESSION. MANIPULER AVEC SOIN."** (in French)

- The text must be:
  - Clearly legible.
  - At least **3 mm in height**.
  - Prominently displayed.

> This warning alerts consumers to the internal pressure and potential for sudden breakage, especially when handling or dropping the container.

---

### **Manufacturing and Importation Accountability**

Every person who **manufactures or imports** a carbonated beverage glass container must:

1. **Establish and maintain a system of control and inspection** to ensure compliance with:
   - The shatter resistance requirement (Schedule 1).
   - The dry weight retention requirement (Schedule 2).

2. **Prepare and maintain detailed documentation** of:
   - All tests conducted on the containers.
   - The results of those tests (including test dates, conditions, equipment used, and outcomes).

3. **Retain records for two years**:
   - The documents must be **available for inspection by a government inspector at all reasonable times** during that period.

> This ensures traceability, accountability, and the ability to verify compliance during audits or investigations.

---

### **Repeal Clause**
The regulation includes a **"Repeal" clause**, indicating that these rules are intended to replace or supersede any prior regulations on similar topics, though the specific prior rule is not named here.

---

### **Effective Date**
These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

---

### **Purpose and Public Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To prevent injury** from glass container shattering due to internal pressure.
2. **To reduce the risk of fragmentation** that could lead to cuts, punctures, or ingestion hazards.
3. **To ensure product integrity** under normal handling and accidental impact conditions.
4. **To provide clear consumer warnings** and enforce traceability in the supply chain.

### **Key Safety Principles Applied**

| Principle | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Structural Integrity** | Ensures containers resist puncture and shatter in a way that does not release dangerous fragments. |
| **Impact Resistance** | Tests simulate real-world drop scenarios to assess container durability. |
| **Consumer Awareness** | Mandatory bold warnings inform users of the internal pressure risk. |
| **Supply Chain Accountability** | Manufacturers and importers are required to prove compliance through testing and recordkeeping. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Carbonated Beverage Glass Containers Regulations* represent a comprehensive and science-based approach to ensuring the **safety of consumers** when using glass bottles of carbonated non-alcoholic beverages. By setting strict standards for **shatter resistance**, **weight retention**, **labeling**, and **recordkeeping**, the regulations provide a robust framework to minimize injury risks associated with glass container failure.

These rules reflect Canada’s commitment to consumer protection under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act*, and they serve as a model for future product safety regulations involving pressurized glass containers.
