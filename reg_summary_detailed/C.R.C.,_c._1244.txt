**Detailed Summary of the C.N.R. Company Exemption Order**

**Title:**  
*Canadian National Railway Company Exemption Order*  
This regulation is formally titled the *C.N.R. Company Exemption Order* and may be cited accordingly.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to grant a specific exemption from certain provisions of the *Official Languages Act* (OLA) to the Canadian National Railway Company (CNR), with respect to certain of its services and operations.

**Scope of the Exemption:**  
The exemption applies specifically to **subsection 10(2) of the Official Languages Act**, which generally requires that government services and those provided by federally regulated entities be delivered in both official languages—English and French—when provided to the public.

The exemption allows the Canadian National Railway Company to **be relieved from the requirement to provide services or communications in both official languages** under subsection 10(2) of the OLA, **in the following circumstances**:

1. **Services provided or made available to the public** — The exemption covers services delivered to the public, but only in specific contexts.

2. **Exclusion of the "travelling public"** — The exemption **does not apply** to services provided to the travelling public (i.e., passengers using CNR’s rail services). This means that when CNR offers transportation services to individuals travelling by rail, those services must still comply with the Official Languages Act, including providing information and services in both English and French.

3. **Services provided or made available at places elsewhere than in Canada** — The exemption applies only when services are provided **outside of Canada**. This includes international operations or services delivered to recipients in foreign jurisdictions.

**Key Limitations and Conditions:**  
- The exemption is **not broad or general**. It is narrowly tailored and applies only to services delivered to the public (not to employees, contractors, or internal operations).  
- The exemption is **conditional** and limited to services provided **outside Canada**. It does not extend to services delivered within Canada or to the travelling public.  
- The exemption does **not apply to services involving government functions or those involving federal regulatory obligations** that require bilingualism.  
- The exemption is limited to **non-travelling public** services — for example, administrative services, customer support, or business operations that are not directly related to passenger travel.

**Legal Basis:**  
The exemption is authorized under the authority of the federal government to allow for reasonable exceptions to the Official Languages Act when the application of bilingual requirements would be impractical or contrary to the objectives of the service, particularly in international or specialized contexts.

**Implications:**  
- This Order enables CNR to operate more efficiently in international markets where bilingual requirements may be administratively burdensome or not applicable.  
- It reflects a recognition that certain railway operations (such as international freight, logistics, or export-related services) may serve a public audience in non-Canadian jurisdictions where the official language requirements of the OLA are not relevant or feasible.  
- It ensures that CNR remains compliant with the OLA in all domestic and passenger-facing services, preserving the Act’s mandate for linguistic equality in public service delivery.

**Conclusion:**  
The *C.N.R. Company Exemption Order* provides a targeted and limited exemption from the bilingual requirements of subsection 10(2) of the Official Languages Act. It allows the Canadian National Railway Company to deliver certain non-travelling public services abroad without being required to provide them in both English and French. However, this exemption does not extend to domestic operations or to services provided to the travelling public, ensuring that the core principles of the Official Languages Act are upheld in critical areas of public service.  

This exemption underscores a balance between regulatory compliance and operational practicality, particularly in international business contexts.
