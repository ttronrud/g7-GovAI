## **Section 3: Government Loans to Consolidated Computer Inc.**

### **Authority to Lend**
- The **Minister** may provide loans to **Consolidated Computer Inc.** under **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote L35 of Appropriation Act No. 2, 1981–82**.
- This power is limited to **CCI only** and does not extend to Financeco or Finecomp.

### **Application Process**
- CCI must submit a formal application to the Minister.
- The application must include all information the Minister deems necessary to assess the loan request.

### **Interest Rate**
- The interest rate on any loan is set by the Minister **on the date the application is approved**.
- The rate must be **at least equal to** the interest rate in effect on that date for **similar-term loans made by the Government of Canada to Crown corporations**.
- This ensures that government loans are not offered at unfairly low rates, maintaining fiscal accountability and market comparability.

### **Loan Term**
- The term of the loan is determined by the Minister and may vary based on the circumstances of the loan.

### **Early Repayment**
- The full or partial repayment of a loan may be made **before the due date**, without:
  - Notice,
  - Bonus,
  - Penalty.
- This provides flexibility for CCI in managing its cash flow.

### **Security for Repayment**
- If the Minister determines it is advisable, they may:
  - Obtain and hold security (collateral) to secure repayment of the loan.
  - Surrender, retransfer, or reconvey such security in exchange for other security.
  - Vary any terms of the security (e.g., extend or modify conditions).

### **Appointment of Trustee or Receiver**
- The Minister may designate any **trustee, receiver, receiver-manager, or other person** required under the security agreement.

> These provisions give the Minister significant control over risk management and enforcement of loan obligations.

## **Section 8: Insurance of Private Lender Loans**

### **Authority to Provide Insurance**
- The Minister may provide **insurance for the full amount of any loan** made by a **private lender** to:
  - Consolidated Computer Inc.
  - Financeco Limited
  - Finecomp Inc.

- This insurance is available under **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1a of Appropriation Act No. 1, 1980–81**.

### **Application for Insurance**
- A private lender must apply directly to the Minister.
- The application must include all information the Minister requires to evaluate the risk.

### **Insurance Fee**
- Once insurance is granted, the private lender must pay an **annual fee of 1%** of the total amount of insurance in force.
- The fee is due in **advance** and paid in **semi-annual instalments**.

> This fee structure ensures a steady revenue stream for the government and helps cover administrative and risk-mitigation costs.

### **Limitation on Insurance Amount**
- When a private lender demands repayment of a loan for which insurance has been provided:
  - The amount payable to the lender **shall not exceed** the amount of insurance in effect on the **date of demand**.
- This prevents overpayment and ensures that insurance is not used to cover losses beyond the insured value at the time of repayment.

## **Financial Limits (Aggregate Caps)**

These caps are critical to prevent excessive exposure and require **Treasury Board approval** for any breach:

### **For Loans to Consolidated Computer Inc. (CCI)**
- The **total amount of loans** the Minister may provide to CCI (under Section 3) **cannot exceed $11.3 million at any time**.
- This cap applies to **all loans** made to CCI under this regulation.
- **Treasury Board approval is required** if this limit is exceeded.

### **For Insurance on Loans to CCI, FCL, or FCI**
- The **total amount of insurance** that may be provided by the Minister in respect of:
  - Loans to **CCI**
  - Loans to **Financeco Limited (FCL)**
  - Loans to **Finecomp Inc. (FCI)**
- **Cannot exceed $43.5 million at any time**.
- **Treasury Board approval is required** if this limit is exceeded.

> This cap applies to **all private lender loans** covered under Section 8, regardless of the borrower.
