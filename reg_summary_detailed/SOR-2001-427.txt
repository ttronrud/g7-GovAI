## 🔍 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. |
| **Balance Sheet Value** | The value of shares or ownership interests reported on an **unconsolidated basis** in a company’s balance sheet. This is the key metric used to assess financial exposure. |
| **Book Value** | *Repealed* by SOR/2008-168, s. 9 — no longer used. |
| **Specialized Financing Entity (SFE)** of the association | An entity that: <br>• Acquires or holds shares/ownership interests in entities that a **retail association** may acquire control of under subsection 388(4) of the Act. <br>• Is **controlled by** the association or has a **substantial investment** from it. |
| **Subsidiary** | In this context, a subsidiary **does not include** a specialized financing entity of the association. This excludes SFEs from being counted as subsidiaries for regulatory purposes. |

> ⚠️ Important: The definition of SFE is **narrowly tailored** to prevent CCAs from engaging in risky or unrelated financial activities through third-party entities.

---

## 🎯 Scope of the Regulations

These regulations apply specifically to:
- The **ownership by a cooperative credit association (other than a retail association)** of shares or ownership interests in a **specialized financing entity (SFE)** under **paragraph 390(2)(b)** of the CCA.

> 🔍 This means the rules are **not applicable to retail cooperatives** in the same way — they are designed for **non-retail associations** (e.g., larger, diversified cooperatives) that may engage in more complex financial structures.

## ⚠️ Prohibitions and Restrictions on Ownership of SFEs

An association **shall not** acquire or hold control of, or increase a substantial investment in, a specialized financing entity **if any of the following conditions are met**:

---

### 🔹 Condition 1: Debt-to-Asset Ratio Exceeds Threshold

> The **total outstanding debt** (excluding debt owed to the association or its controlled entities) of:
> - The SFE, and
> - Any SFEs controlled by it,
>  
> **must not exceed twice** the value of the following:
> - The **excess of assets over liabilities** of the SFE (on an unconsolidated balance sheet), **plus**
> - The **non-controlling interests** (i.e., equity held by third parties) in the SFE, **on a consolidated basis**.

📌 **Implication:** This limits how much debt a specialized financing entity can carry relative to its net worth and minority stake value. It acts as a **financial leverage cap**.

---

### 🔹 Condition 2: Control of Prohibited Entities

The SFE **must not control or hold ownership interests in** any entity that falls into one of these categories:
1. An entity that provides **leasing of motor vehicles** in Canada for credit extension or vehicle financing.
2. An entity that provides **temporary possession** of personal property (including vehicles) for purposes **other than financing** the acquisition.
3. An entity that acts as an **insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

📌 **Rationale:** These activities are considered **non-core or high-risk**, and their integration into a cooperative’s structure could expose the association to regulatory, operational, or consumer protection risks.

---

### 🔹 Condition 3: Aggregate Balance Sheet Value Exceeds $250 Million

> The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests (excluding those held by the SFE in another SFE it controls) that the association, its subsidiaries, or other SFEs hold in an entity **controlled by the SFE** must **not exceed $250 million**.

📌 This prevents **over-concentration of capital** in a single SFE or its controlled group. It serves as a **capital concentration limit**.

---

### 🔹 Condition 4: Regulatory Capital Thresholds

The **sum of the following** must **not exceed 10% of the association’s regulatory capital**:
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/interests the association and its subsidiaries would acquire in the SFE.
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/interests held by the association and its subsidiaries in **other SFEs** of the association.
- The aggregate value of **loans made by the association and its subsidiaries** to the SFEs.

📌 This ensures that the association does **not overexpose itself** to risk through investments in SFEs — even indirectly.

---

### 🔹 Condition 5: Aggregate Regulatory Capital Threshold (25%)

The **sum of the following** must **not exceed 25% of the association’s regulatory capital**:
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/interests held by the association and its subsidiaries in:
  - The SFE,
  - Entities controlled by the SFE,
  - Entities in which the SFE holds a **substantial investment**.
- The aggregate value of **loans** made by the association and its subsidiaries to:
  - The SFE,
  - Entities controlled by the SFE,
  - Entities in which the SFE holds a substantial investment.

📌 This is a **stronger capital exposure cap**, designed to protect the association from systemic risk if multiple entities within the SFE network are over-leveraged.

---

## ⏳ Duration of Ownership Restrictions (Anti-Over-Exposure Clause)

> An association **shall not** hold control of or a substantial investment in a specialized financing entity **if either**:
> - The SFE itself, or
> - The SFE and **one or more** of the following entities (in sequence), have held control of or a substantial investment in an entity (other than those listed in Condition 2) for **more than 13 consecutive years**:
>   - The association,
>   - Any other specialized financing entity of the association.

📌 **Purpose:** Prevents **long-term, entrenched exposure** to non-core activities that could become outdated or risky over time.

> ✅ **Exception:** If a SFE previously held control of or invested in an entity **before becoming** a SFE, that period **does not count** toward the 13-year limit.

📌 This allows for **restructuring or divestment** without being penalized for historical exposure.

## 🚫 Exclusions from Other Provisions of the Act

These regulations **exclude certain provisions** of the CCA from applying in specific cases:

| Excluded Provision | Applies to |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Subsection 390(4)** | Does **not apply** when an association acquires or increases a substantial investment in an entity **via a specialized financing entity**. |
| **Subsections 390(5) and (6)** | Do **not apply** when an association acquires control or increases investment in an entity **through a specialized financing entity**. |

📌 This means that **investments made via SFEs are treated as exempt** from certain standard control and reporting requirements under the CCA — which simplifies compliance for such transactions.

## 📌 Key Objectives and Policy Rationale

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Mitigation** | Limits exposure to non-core, high-risk activities (e.g., leasing, temporary possession, insurance brokering). |
| **Capital Protection** | Sets clear thresholds (10% and 25% of regulatory capital) to prevent over-leveraging or capital erosion. |
| **Financial Stability** | Prevents concentration of risk through a chain of specialized entities. |
| **Transparency & Accountability** | Uses balance sheet values and clear thresholds to ensure measurable, auditable compliance. |
| **Flexibility for Innovation**
