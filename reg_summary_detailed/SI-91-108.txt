**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The document is a formal **government notice** issued by the Government of Canada, dated **August 2, 1991**, and published under the authority of **Section 6 of the Canada-Luxembourg Income Tax Convention Act, 1989** (S.C. 1989, c. 20, Part I).

### Key Content and Purpose:

- **Purpose of the Notice**:  
  The notice serves to officially announce that the **Canada-Luxembourg Income Tax Convention** has entered into force. This means that the treaty between Canada and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg—specifically designed to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital—has become legally effective and enforceable between the two countries.

- **Effective Date of the Convention**:  
  The Convention came into force on **July 8, 1991**. This date marks the beginning of the treaty’s application, meaning that from this point onward, provisions of the agreement begin to govern tax matters involving individuals and entities from Canada and Luxembourg.

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The notice is issued pursuant to **Section 6 of the Canada-Luxembourg Income Tax Convention Act, 1989**, which empowers the Canadian government to publish formal notices confirming the entry into force of international tax treaties. This section ensures transparency and provides notice to taxpayers, tax professionals, and other stakeholders about the operational status of the treaty.

- **Scope of the Convention**:  
  The treaty addresses two primary areas:
  1. **Taxes on Income** – including income from employment, business profits, interest, dividends, and royalties.
  2. **Taxes on Capital** – such as capital gains, property transfers, and other capital-related gains.

  The treaty aims to:
  - Prevent double taxation by allowing taxpayers to claim tax credits or exemptions in one country for taxes paid in the other.
  - Prevent fiscal evasion by establishing rules on the proper attribution of income and capital gains, ensuring that tax obligations are not circumvented through artificial arrangements.

- **Significance for Taxpayers**:  
  For individuals and businesses with income or capital gains sourced in either Canada or Luxembourg, the entry into force of the treaty provides clarity and certainty regarding:
  - How income will be taxed in each country.
  - Whether a tax credit or exemption may be available in one country for taxes paid in the other.
  - The rules governing the taxation of specific types of income (e.g., dividends, capital gains, rental income).

- **Geographic and Jurisdictional Context**:  
  The treaty applies to residents of Canada and Luxembourg, regardless of where the income is earned or capital is held. It is particularly relevant for:
  - Canadian residents with income from Luxembourg (e.g., from a Luxembourg-based business or investment).
  - Luxembourg residents with income from Canada (e.g., from Canadian investments or employment).

### Conclusion:

This notice is a formal, legally binding announcement that the Canada-Luxembourg Income Tax Convention has become active and operational. It marks a key step in strengthening bilateral tax cooperation between Canada and Luxembourg, ensuring that individuals and entities operating across both jurisdictions are treated fairly and consistently under international tax rules. It also establishes a framework for resolving tax disputes and avoiding double taxation, thereby promoting cross-border investment and economic activity.

**Note**: The notice does not contain detailed treaty provisions or interpretative guidance, but rather serves as a public announcement of the treaty’s effective date and legal status. For specific tax implications, individuals and businesses should consult the full text of the Convention or seek advice from a tax professional.
