Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, presented in clear, accessible language while preserving all legal and substantive elements.

### **Detailed Summary of the CCFTA Remission Order, 2003**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is made under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which authorizes the government to grant remission (i.e., refund or reduction) of customs duties under specific conditions.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary objective is to **provide a duty remission** for certain goods imported into Canada during a specified period (January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2004).
- This remission is intended to **compensate importers** for the loss of preferential tariff treatment that previously existed under the **Chilean Tariff Rate of Duty (Chile Tariff Rate)**, which was **no longer available** for goods imported on or after January 1, 2003.

---

#### **3. Definition of "Goods"**
- The term **"goods"** is specifically defined as:
  > Goods that would have been eligible for the **Chile Tariff rate of duty as of December 31, 1997**, had they been imported on that date, **but are not eligible** for that rate of duty if imported on or after **January 1, 2003**.

- In simpler terms:
  - These are goods that **benefited from a lower duty rate under Chilean preferential terms** in the year 1997.
  - After January 1, 2003, Canada no longer applied the Chile Tariff rate to such goods, and instead applied higher duty rates (such as Most-Favoured-Nation or General Preferential rates).

---

#### **4. Scope of Duty Remission**
- A **customs duty remission** is granted for goods imported between:
  - **January 1, 2003**, and  
  - **December 31, 2004**.

- The amount of remission is calculated as the **difference between two duty amounts**:
  1. **The customs duties payable at the time of import** under:
     - The **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Tariff Rate**, or  
     - The **General Preferential Tariff Rate**,  
     *as applicable*, based on the **Customs Tariff and its regulations as they existed on January 1, 2003**.

  2. **The customs duties that would have been payable** if the goods had qualified for the **Chile Tariff Rate of Duty** under the same tariff and regulations as of **January 1, 2003**.

- **Formula for Remission Amount**:
  > Remission =  
  > (Duty payable under MFN or General Preferential Rate on Jan 1, 2003)  
  > −  
  > (Duty that would have been payable under Chile Tariff Rate on Jan 1, 2003)

- This means the remission effectively **reduces the importer’s customs duty burden** by the difference between the new higher duty rate and the previously available Chilean preferential rate.

---

#### **5. Conditions for Claiming Remission**
- A claim for remission **must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue** within **four years** of the date the goods were imported.
- This four-year deadline is a critical administrative requirement and must be strictly observed.
- Failure to file a claim within this period will result in **no entitlement to remission**, regardless of the eligibility of the goods.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette or other official register).
- This ensures that the remission is available from the moment it is legally recognized, allowing importers to act accordingly.

---

### **Key Implications and Context**
- This regulation is part of a broader **trade policy adjustment** related to the **Chile-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)**.
- It reflects a transitional measure to **mitigate the impact** of the termination of Chilean preferential tariff treatment on Canadian imports.
- The remission is not a blanket refund but a **targeted, calculated reduction** based on the difference in duty rates at the time of import and the historical Chilean rate.
- It serves as a **form of fiscal compensation** to maintain trade competitiveness and support importers who were previously benefiting from preferential access.

---

### **Summary in One Sentence**
> The CCFTA Remission Order, 2003 grants a refund of customs duties for certain goods imported between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004, by reducing the duty paid to the difference between the duty that would have applied under the Chile Tariff Rate (as of January 1, 2003) and the duty actually paid under the MFN or General Preferential Tariff rates, provided a claim is filed with the Minister of National Revenue within four years of import.

---

### **Important Notes**
- This order is **not retroactive** — it applies only to goods imported from January 1, 2003, onward.
- The calculation is based on **tariff rates as they existed on January 1, 2003**, not current rates.
- The remission is **not available for goods that did not qualify for the Chile Tariff Rate** in 1997.
- Importers must maintain accurate records and file claims promptly to qualify.

This regulation is a key example of how governments use **tariff adjustments and remission mechanisms** to manage the transition of trade preferences under evolving international agreements.
