**Detailed Summary of the Australia and New Zealand Tariff Preference Maintenance Order**

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation, officially titled the *Australia and New Zealand Tariff Preference Maintenance Order*, establishes and maintains preferential customs duty rates for goods imported from **Australia and New Zealand** into Canada. It is a statutory instrument enacted under the authority of the *Customs Tariff* and specifically designed to preserve and extend existing trade preferences previously granted to Canada by Australia and New Zealand.

The primary objective is to **extend tariff advantages** (i.e., reduced or zero customs duties) for specific Canadian tariff items (classified by HS Code) originating in Australia or New Zealand, effective from specified dates, with gradual reductions over time.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under:
- **Section 12.1** and **subsection 62(1)** of the *Customs Tariff*.
- It is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, reflecting the federal government's power to administer trade policy and customs duties.

This legislative basis ensures that the Order is both legally sound and aligned with Canada’s international trade obligations.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

The Order modifies **Schedule I and Schedule II** of the *Customs Tariff*, which contain the official duty schedules for imported goods. The changes are structured around **tariff item numbers (HS codes)** and apply different duty rates depending on the **date of import**.

#### **General Structure of Amendments**

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Part I** | Adds new preferential duty rates under the "Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff" (MFN) heading for goods from Australia and New Zealand. |
| **Part II** | Replaces existing MFN rates for Australia or New Zealand with new, preferential rates. |
| **Part III** | Adds preferential rates after the MFN rates in Schedule II, particularly for goods that were previously subject to higher duties. |

> Note: The term "MFN" refers to the standard rate applied to most countries. By assigning preferential rates to Australia and New Zealand, Canada provides them with a more favorable treatment than other nations.
