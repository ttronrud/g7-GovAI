**Detailed Summary of the Romania Claims Fund Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Romania Claims Fund Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, under two key legal authorities:

1. **The Treaties of Peace (Italy, Romania, Hungary and Finland) Act, 1948** – which provides the legal basis for managing claims arising from World War II peace treaties.
2. **Vote 57a of the Appropriation Act No. 5, 1963** – which authorizes funding for specific claims settlement activities.

These regulations establish a **special fund** within Canada’s Consolidated Revenue Fund to manage and disburse payments related to claims arising from the **Treaty of Peace with Romania** (signed after World War II). The fund is designed to compensate individuals or entities who held property or financial instruments (particularly bonds) from Romania that were seized or confiscated during or after the war, and to provide a structured mechanism for their settlement.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Custodian**:  
  Refers to the official designated by the *Revised Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1943)* to hold and manage property confiscated from enemy nations during World War II. This role ensures that assets seized during wartime are properly accounted for and transferred to the Canadian government.

- **Foreign Claims Commission (FCC)**:  
  A government body established by **Order in Council P.C. 1970-2077** on December 8, 1970. It is responsible for evaluating and processing claims from Canadian citizens or entities against Romania, particularly those involving property or financial obligations during or after WWII.

- **Minister**:  
  Refers to the **Minister of Finance**, who has administrative authority over the Fund and its disbursements.

### **Establishment of the Treaty of Peace (Romania) Claims Fund**

- A **special account** is created within the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada and is named the **Treaty of Peace (Romania) Claims Fund** (commonly referred to as the "Fund").
- This Fund serves as a financial repository for proceeds and earnings derived from **Romanian property** that was:
  - Seized during World War II,
  - Remains in the possession of the **Custodian**, and
  - Has been **transferred by the Custodian to the Minister of Finance**.

Thus, the Fund is funded by the liquidation and income generated from these wartime assets.

### **Payment Authority of the Minister**

The **Minister of Finance** has the power to make payments from the Fund under the following conditions:

#### **1. Payments to Individuals Recommended by the Foreign Claims Commission**
- The Minister may pay **up to a total of $40,000** (in aggregate) to individuals or entities.
- These payments are only made if the **Foreign Claims Commission**, under the *Foreign Claims (Romania) Settlement Regulations*, **recommends** the claim.
- The payments are governed by **Sections 5, 8, 10, and 11** of the *Foreign Claims (Romania) Settlement Regulations*, with adjustments made as necessary based on the specific circumstances of each case.

> *Note:* These sections typically cover eligibility criteria, claim validation, documentation requirements, and dispute resolution procedures.

#### **2. Pro-Rata Payments to Bond Holders (Special Provision)**
- A unique provision allows for **pro-rata payments** to individuals who:
  - Notified the Government of Canada **on or before December 14, 1971**,  
  - Disclosed holdings of **bonds** that were part of Romania’s **external debt**,  
  - Were acknowledged by the **Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania** as being part of that debt.
- The payment is the **difference between**:
  - The total amount credited to the Fund (from the proceeds of Romanian property), and  
  - The fixed cap of **$40,000**.
- For example, if the Fund has $50,000 available, and there are 10 eligible bond holders, each may receive a share of the remaining $10,000 (after the $40,000 limit is reached), distributed pro-rata.

> *This mechanism ensures that those who formally reported their claims receive compensation proportional to their share of the available fund.*

#### **3. Currency Conversion for Bond Valuation**
- The value of bonds issued in currencies listed in **Column I of the Table** in subsection (1) must be converted into **Canadian currency** using the exchange rate specified in **Column II** of the same table.
- This ensures that all payments are made in Canadian dollars and reflects fair market value at the time of valuation.

#### **4. Surrender Requirement for Bond Claims**
- To qualify for payment under Section 6 (pro-rata bond payments), the **bondholder must surrender**:
  - The original bond, and  
  - Any attached coupons (interest payments)
- This surrender must occur **on or before December 31, 1972**.
- Failure to surrender the bond or coupons results in **ineligibility** for payment from the Fund.

> *This requirement ensures that the government can verify ownership and prevent claims from being made without tangible evidence.*

#### **5. Transfer of Commission Expenses**
- The Minister may transfer **half of the estimated expenses** incurred by the **Foreign Claims Commission** in processing claims (as defined in paragraph (b) of the definition of "claim" in the *Foreign Claims (Romania) Settlement Regulations*) to the **Foreign Claims Fund**.
- This fund supports ongoing administrative and legal costs associated with claim processing.

> *This provision ensures that the Commission is financially supported, enabling it to operate efficiently and fairly.*

### **Legal and Historical Context**

- The regulations reflect Canada’s post-World War II policy of **settling claims** against former enemy nations, particularly those that had lost property or financial assets due to occupation or confiscation.
- Romania, as a former Axis-aligned country (though not a full Axis power), was included in the peace treaties, and its wartime assets were subject to similar recovery and redistribution mechanisms.
- The use of a **special fund** allows for transparent, accountable, and legally grounded compensation, while respecting budgetary constraints.

### **Conclusion**

The *Romania Claims Fund Regulations* establish a **structured, fair, and limited** framework for compensating individuals and entities who held Romanian property or bonds during or after World War II. The regulations emphasize:

- **Transparency** through formal notification and documentation,
- **Accountability** via bond surrender and audit requirements,
- **Fiscal responsibility** through the $40,000 cap and expense-sharing mechanisms,
- **Efficiency** through the support of the Foreign Claims Commission.

These regulations are a key component of Canada’s post-war reconciliation efforts and represent a balanced approach to addressing historical claims while maintaining fiscal discipline and legal integrity.
