### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **designate specific provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994** as being enforceable under **paragraph 13(1)(c)** of the MBCA.  

This means that these designated sections are now subject to enforcement actions, including:

- Fines  
- Penalties  
- Prosecution  
- Administrative sanctions  

by federal authorities (such as the Canadian Wildlife Service or Environment and Climate Change Canada) when violations occur.

The designation ensures that the enforcement powers of the Act are clearly defined and that those responsible for protecting migratory bird species and their habitats have clear legal tools to act against illegal activities.

3. **Habitat and Nest Protection**: Provisions such as subsections 39(1) and 8.1 emphasize the protection of nesting areas and habitats, which are critical for species recovery.

4. **Modern Enforcement Tools**: The inclusion of subsection 55(1) (prohibiting use of devices like drones) reflects evolving threats to migratory birds, such as the use of modern technology in illegal hunting or trapping.

5. **Penalty Framework**: The designation of Section 73 and Subsection 76(4) ensures that authorities have clear mechanisms for imposing penalties, including seizure and prosecution.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a key enforcement tool under the *Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994*. By formally designating specific sections of the Act as enforceable, it strengthens the legal framework for protecting migratory birds and their habitats. It provides clear, actionable provisions for federal enforcement agencies to prevent illegal activities such as poaching, trade in bird parts, and habitat destruction. The regulation ensures that Canada fulfills its international obligations under the Convention on Migratory Species and supports the long-term conservation of migratory bird populations.

This designation is not merely administrative—it has real-world consequences, enabling effective prosecution, deterrence, and compliance with environmental protection standards across Canada.
