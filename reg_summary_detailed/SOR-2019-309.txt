**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Kidneyshell (Ptychobranchus fasciolaris) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is a formal **Critical Habitat Designation Order** under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically enacted pursuant to **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the Act. The order designates specific geographic areas as **critical habitat** for the **Kidneyshell** (*Ptychobranchus fasciolaris*), a species listed as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA.

SARA is a federal law in Canada that aims to prevent species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery by identifying and protecting critical habitat — the specific areas required for a species’ survival and recovery.

### **2. Key Provisions and Reasons for the Order**

#### **a. Endangered Status of the Kidneyshell**
- The Kidneyshell is a freshwater bivalve mollusk (a type of clam) native to Canada, primarily found in the Great Lakes region and associated river systems.
- It is officially listed as **endangered** under SARA, meaning it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild due to habitat loss, degradation, pollution, and other threats.

#### **b. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**
- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Kidneyshell was developed and approved by the government.
- This strategy identifies the **specific geographic areas** essential for the species’ survival and recovery — these are known as **critical habitat**.
- The critical habitat identified in the recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database of species at risk and their designated critical habitats.

#### **c. Compliance with Section 58(2)b of SARA**
- Section 58(2)b of SARA prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are **designated as reserves or lands set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation (band)**.
- The Order explicitly states that **no portion of the critical habitat specified in this Order falls within a reserve or other lands set apart for the use and benefit of a band**.
- This ensures that the Order does **not infringe upon Indigenous lands or rights**, and thus avoids triggering additional legal or procedural requirements under SARA.

#### **d. Consultation with Indigenous Communities**
- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) determined that the proposed critical habitat designation would **affect reserve or other lands set apart for the use and benefit of a band**.
- In response, the MFO conducted **consultation under subsection 58(7)** of SARA with:
  - The **Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs (MINA)**, and
  - The **specific band** in question.
- This consultation process is a required step under SARA to ensure that Indigenous rights, interests, and traditional knowledge are respected and considered in the designation of critical habitat.

> **Note**: Despite the initial concern about potential overlap with Indigenous lands, the final determination is that **no actual overlap exists**, and therefore no formal consultation was required beyond the initial assessment.

### **3. Legal Authority and Applicability**

- **Subsection 58(1) of SARA** applies to the Kidneyshell’s critical habitat, meaning that the designated areas are legally protected under the Act.
- The designation is **not a blanket protection** but rather a recognition that these specific areas are essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- The Order is **not retroactive**; it only applies to the areas specified in the annexed document and comes into force upon **registration** with the federal government.

---

### **4. Purpose and Objectives of the Order**

- To **formally recognize and protect** the specific areas essential for the Kidneyshell’s survival and recovery.
- To ensure that **federal actions** (such as development, mining, or infrastructure projects) that may impact these areas are subject to **environmental assessment and mitigation requirements** under SARA.
- To support the **long-term recovery** of the Kidneyshell by safeguarding its habitat from degradation or destruction.

---

### **5. Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).
- Once in force, the designated critical habitat becomes legally protected under SARA.
- Any **federal projects or activities** that may affect the critical habitat must comply with the requirements of SARA, including:
  - Environmental assessments,
  - Mitigation measures,
  - Avoidance of harm,
  - Consultation with Indigenous communities (where applicable).

---

### **6. Significance and Broader Implications**

- This Order is part of Canada’s broader effort to **protect biodiversity** and recover endangered species through science-based, legally binding conservation measures.
- It reflects a commitment to **cooperative governance**, particularly through the consultation process with Indigenous authorities, even when no direct overlap is found.
- The designation of critical habitat for a species like the Kidneyshell — which is a relatively obscure but ecologically significant indicator species — highlights the importance of protecting **freshwater ecosystems** and the biodiversity they support.

### **Conclusion**

This Order formally designates the critical habitat of the endangered Kidneyshell (*Ptychobranchus fasciolaris*) under the Species at Risk Act. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, complies with legal and procedural requirements, and respects Indigenous rights through prior consultation. While no portion of the designated habitat lies within a First Nation reserve, the process underscores Canada’s commitment to **science-based conservation**, **legal accountability**, and **Indigenous partnership** in species recovery efforts.

The Order serves as a vital step toward the long-term survival of the Kidneyshell and contributes to the broader goal of restoring ecological balance in Canada’s freshwater ecosystems.
