### **4. Conditions for Remission**

The duty remission is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

#### **Condition 1: Timeframe of Importation**
- The goods must be **imported during the period beginning on the coming into force of this Order and ending on December 31, 1997**.
- This sets a **strict deadline** for when the goods can be brought into Canada to qualify for the remission.
- The Order is time-bound and does not apply retroactively or beyond this window.

#### **Condition 2: Timely Claim Submission**
- A **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years after the date of importation** of the goods.
- This means that importers have a **2-year window** from the date of entry into Canada to formally request the duty remission.
- Failure to submit a claim within this period will result in the **loss of entitlement** to remission.

---

### **5. Legal Basis and Interpretation**

- The remission is granted under **section 2** of the Order, which provides the mechanism for duty relief.
- The Order is **subject to section 3**, which likely outlines limitations or exceptions (e.g., exclusions, procedural requirements, or administrative discretion). However, the specific content of section 3 is not provided in the excerpt, so its full scope cannot be detailed here.
- The regulation is **temporary** in nature and was specifically designed for a defined period (1993–1997), reflecting a policy-driven intervention rather than a permanent change to tariff rules.

### **6. Key Implications and Effects**

### **7. Conclusion**

The **Canadian Retailers Duty Remission Order, 1993** is a targeted, time-limited policy measure designed to reduce the customs duty burden on specific consumer and hobby-related goods. It enhances affordability and availability of products such as electronic audio devices, sporting equipment, and home appliances.
