**Detailed Summary of the Form of Proxy (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations, 2023**

---

### **Overview**

The *Form of Proxy (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations, 2023* are a set of regulatory rules made under **Section 156.071a of the Bank Act** (S.C. 2019, c. 29, s. 90; S.C. 1991, c. 46), by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. These regulations establish the **required format and content** for **management proxy circulars** and **dissident’s proxy circulars** issued by banks and bank holding companies in Canada.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **ensure transparency, consistency, and fairness** in shareholder communications during proxy solicitations—particularly in matters involving governance, director elections, and shareholder proposals—while also providing **flexibility for certain exempted or non-distributing institutions**.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

### 1. **Definitions in the Regulations**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Bank Act*.
- **Management Proxy Circular**: A formal communication sent by the bank’s management (e.g., board or officers) to shareholders to propose certain matters for vote at a shareholders’ meeting (e.g., director elections, mergers).
- **Dissident’s Proxy Circular**: A communication sent by a shareholder (or group) opposing management’s proposals, seeking to solicit proxies to vote against or in favor of specific actions (e.g., alternative transactions, dissenting views).
- **NI 51-102**: Refers to *National Instrument 51-102 – Takeover Bids and Proxy Solicitations*, which governs proxy solicitation practices. The applicable version is determined based on provincial jurisdiction as outlined in a table referenced in the regulation.

> **Note**: All references to "form of proxy" in NI 51-102 are interpreted under the *Bank Act* definition of "form of proxy" (Section 2), and "securityholder" is interpreted as "shareholder" (Section 7).

## **Core Provisions**

### **1. Form and Compliance Requirements**

> **Section 1**: A management or dissident proxy circular must comply with the **form and content requirements** set out in **Form NI 51-102F5 – Information Circular**, as prescribed under the *National Instrument 51-102*.

#### Exceptions to Full Compliance:
- **Exemption from Items 8–10 and Item 16** of Form NI 51-102F5 applies if:
  - The bank or bank holding company is **not a "distributing bank" or "distributing bank holding company"** as defined in the *Distributing Bank and Distributing Bank Holding Company Regulations*; or
  - The institution is **exempted** under **subsection 2.4(2) or (3)** of the *Bank Act*.

> This provides **practical flexibility** for smaller or non-distributing institutions that do not have the same level of public disclosure obligations.

### **4. Mandatory Content in Dissident’s Proxy Circulars**

A dissident’s proxy circular must include:
- A **signed statement** by the dissident (or an authorized representative) confirming that they have approved the content and sending of the circular.

> **Exception**: If the dissident lacks access to required information and cannot reasonably obtain it, the circular must include a **clear explanation** of why the information is unavailable.

> This protects dissident shareholders from being misled or unfairly disadvantaged due to information gaps.

### **5. Exclusions from “Prescribed Circumstances” (Solicitation Exemption)**

Under **paragraph (1)(a)**, certain communications **do not count as "solicitations"** under the *Bank Act*, and therefore **do not require a formal proxy circular**—provided they meet specific criteria.

These include:

| Type of Communication | Conditions |
|------------------------|----------|
| **Public Forum Speeches** | A speech in a public forum (e.g., conference, lecture) does not constitute solicitation. |
| **Press Releases / Broadcasts** | Opinions, statements, or ads published via broadcast, phone, electronic media, or general publications (e.g., newspapers) are not solicitation if made to the public. |
| **Advisory Communications** | Communications from a person giving **proxy voting advice** in the ordinary course of business are exempt if:<br>• The advisor discloses significant relationships with the bank, its affiliates, or shareholders with proposals under Section 143(1);<br>• The advisor receives **special commission/remuneration only from the shareholder** receiving advice;<br>• The advice is **not given on behalf of a solicitor or nominee** for director election. |
| **Non-Seeking Entities** | Communications from a person who does **not seek to act as proxy** for any shareholder are exempt. |

> **Important Exception**: These exemptions **do not apply** if:
- The shareholder is an **officer or director** of the bank and the communication is **financed by the bank**;
- The shareholder is a **nominee** or proposes a nominee for director election;
- The communication is in **opposition to a board-approved transaction** and proposes an alternative involving the shareholder or their affiliate;
- The shareholder has a **material interest** in the vote outcome that would not be shared pro rata with other shareholders (except for employment-related benefits).

> This ensures **protection against self-dealing or conflicts of interest** in proxy solicitations.

## **Repeal of Previous Regulations**

> The **Form of Proxy (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations, 2001 (SOR/2001-390)** are **repealed** by this 2023 regulation.

This marks a **modernization and consolidation** of proxy rules, aligning them with updated governance standards and the current version of NI 51-102.
