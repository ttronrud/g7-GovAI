The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> [Repealed, SOR/2009-296, s. 22]

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2009-296, section 22**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Supplemental Regulation 2009-296**, which was published in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* (SOR) series.
- **Section Repealed**: Specifically, **Section 22** of SOR/2009-296 contains the provision that formally repeals the prior regulation.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2009-296, which is typically published in the Canada Gazette or the official government notice. While the exact date is not provided in the text, SOR/2009-296 was issued in 2009 and would have come into force accordingly.

### Implications:
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established under the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the current version of the regulation (if any) or to other applicable laws that have replaced or superseded the repealed provision.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory reform, modernization, or consolidation effort to streamline or update the legal framework.

### Note:
Since the original regulation is not included in the provided text, the summary is based solely on the repealing notice. To understand the substance of the original regulation, one would need to consult historical records or the full text of the prior regulation that was repealed by SOR/2009-296, section 22.

### Conclusion:
The statement "[Repealed, SOR/2009-296, s. 22]" means that a specific regulation (not identified here) has been officially canceled and is no longer valid. It was repealed by section 22 of the Supplemental Orders and Regulations 2009-296, issued in 2009. This repeal removes the legal authority of the prior provision, and its content is now obsolete. For further context, access to the original regulation or the full text of SOR/2009-296 is required.
