**Detailed Summary of the World Meteorological Organization Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *World Meteorological Organization Privileges and Immunities Order* is a statutory instrument made under the authority of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act*. It grants specific legal privileges and immunities to the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** and its associated personnel when operating in Canada. The Order was issued on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs and approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.

This Order is formally cited as **S.C. 1974–75–76, c. 69, s. 2** and is part of a broader framework designed to ensure that international organizations and their representatives can carry out their duties effectively without undue interference from national laws.

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is enacted under **Section 3** of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council to make orders granting privileges and immunities to international organizations operating in Canada. These privileges are derived from the **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations (the "Convention")**, which serves as the foundational legal instrument.

While the WMO is not a United Nations agency, it is treated under this Order as a "specialized international organization" entitled to certain rights and protections similar to those of the UN, provided they are necessary for the effective performance of its functions.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

- **"Convention"**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, which establishes the legal framework for the privileges and immunities of UN bodies, representatives, officials, and experts.
  
- **"Organization"**: Refers to the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**, an intergovernmental organization established in 1951 to coordinate meteorological observations and services globally.

- This status enables the WMO to operate independently and formally within the Canadian legal system, facilitating its work in areas such as meteorological data collection, research, and international cooperation.

By granting the organization and its personnel specific legal rights and immunities — derived from the UN Convention — the Order ensures that the WMO can carry out its essential meteorological and scientific functions without obstruction. These protections are carefully balanced with Canadian legal principles, ensuring that they serve international cooperation while respecting national sovereignty and the rule of law.

This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to international cooperation and the peaceful, effective functioning of global scientific institutions. It remains a key example of how Canada implements international legal instruments in domestic law.
