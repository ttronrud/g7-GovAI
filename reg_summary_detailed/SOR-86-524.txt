### **Detailed Summary of the Atlantic Enterprise Loan Insurance Regulations**

---

#### **Overview**

The *Atlantic Enterprise Loan Insurance Regulations* (S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 3 and c. 90) were enacted by Her Excellency the General Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and the Treasury Board, under provisions of the Appropriation Acts for the fiscal years 1980–81 and 1981–82. These regulations establish a framework for providing **loan insurance to lenders** in Atlantic Canada to support the development of commercial enterprises in designated sectors and regions.

The primary objective is to **stimulate economic development** in Atlantic Canada—specifically in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland—by enabling businesses to access financing that might otherwise be unattainable due to risk or lack of collateral.

These regulations are now **historically significant**, as they were largely superseded by later federal policies and modernized programs such as those administered by the **Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA)**. However, they remain a foundational document in understanding the historical approach to regional economic development financing.
