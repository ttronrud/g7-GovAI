#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- To **designate a specific area** within **Lancaster Sound**, located in the **Northwest Territories**, as a **Designated Area** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*.

#### **3. Scope and Geographic Description**
- The designated area is **defined by a table** (not included in the provided text) that outlines the **geographic boundaries** of the area.  
- The boundaries are described **using a grid system** established under **Sections 4 to 9 of the Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations**.  
  - This grid system is a standardized method used across Canada to precisely define land areas, especially in remote or sparsely populated regions like the Arctic.  
  - The coordinates are typically based on a **grid reference system** (e.g., using a grid of 100 km squares or smaller units) that allows for accurate mapping and legal demarcation.

> **Geographic Context**:  
> Lancaster Sound is a body of water located between Ellesmere Island and Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is part of the Northwest Territories and is a region of strategic interest due to its potential for offshore oil and gas exploration, as well as its environmental and Indigenous significance.

> **Note**: While the original text does not include the actual table of boundaries, the regulation relies on the grid system defined in Sections 4–9 of the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* for precise geographic identification. For full implementation, the table would be required to determine the exact spatial extent of the designated area.
