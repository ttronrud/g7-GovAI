### **Detailed Summary of the Microbeads in Toiletries Regulations (Canada)**

The **Microbeads in Toiletries Regulations** are a set of federal regulations under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, enacted to protect human health and the environment by banning the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products. These regulations were finalized and came into force on **January 1, 2018**, with specific provisions for implementation and compliance.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Process**

- **Authority**: The regulations were made under **subsection 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*, which allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) to adopt regulations to control substances that pose a risk to the environment or human health.
  
- **Proposal and Public Consultation**:
  - On **November 5, 2016**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed version** of the Microbeads in Toiletries Regulations in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, initiating a public comment period.
  - Stakeholders (including industry, environmental groups, and the public) were given the opportunity to:
    - Submit written comments on the proposed regulations, or
    - File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** to assess the regulation's validity, including reasons for objection.

- **Advisory Input**:
  - The **National Advisory Committee on Chemicals** (NAC) was consulted under **subsection 93(3)** of CEPA 1999 to provide expert advice on the scientific and environmental implications of regulating microbeads.

- **No Conflict with Other Legislation**:
  - The Governor in Council concluded, under **subsection 93(4)**, that the proposed regulations **do not duplicate or conflict** with existing environmental or health regulations. They provide **sufficient protection** to human health and the environment, thus justifying their adoption.

## **2. Definitions**

Two key terms are defined in the regulations:

- **Microbeads**:
  - Defined as the plastic microbeads listed in **Item 133 of Schedule 1 to CEPA 1999**, under the *List of Toxic Substances*.
  - These are typically **plastic particles smaller than 1 millimeter** (i.e., 1 mm or less), commonly used in exfoliating products like facial scrubs or toothpaste.
  - The term "microbilles" is the French equivalent used in the regulation.

- **Toiletries**:
  - Refers to any **personal care product** used for cleansing or hygiene, including:
    - Hair care (e.g., shampoos, conditioners)
    - Skin care (e.g., face washes, lotions)
    - Oral care (e.g., toothpaste, mouthwash)
    - Exfoliants (e.g., scrubs)
  - This definition explicitly includes products that contain exfoliating agents.

> ⚠️ **Exclusion**: The regulations **do not apply to prescription drugs**, as defined under **section A.01.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations**.

## **3. Key Prohibitions and Compliance Timeline**

### **Manufacturing and Importation**
- **Prohibition**: No person may **manufacture or import** toiletries containing microbeads.
- **Exception**: The ban applies **only to products that are not natural health products or non-prescription drugs**.
- **Effective Date for Exceptions**:
  - For **natural health products** or **non-prescription drugs**, the prohibition on microbeads:
    - Applies to **manufacturing and importation on or after July 1, 2018**.

### **Sale and Distribution**
- **Prohibition**: No person may **sell** toiletries containing microbeads.
- **Exception**: For natural health products or non-prescription drugs:
  - The ban on sale applies **on or after July 1, 2019**.

> 📌 **Important Note**: The prohibition applies **only to products sold or distributed within Canada**. It does not apply to products **in transit** through Canada between foreign locations.

### **Exemption for Transit**
- **No contravention** occurs if toiletries containing microbeads are **in transit through Canada**, from a place **outside Canada to another place outside Canada**.
- This exemption supports international trade and prevents penalties for temporary movement of goods.

## **4. Laboratory Requirements for Testing**

To ensure scientific integrity and consistency in enforcement, the regulations specify requirements for **laboratory testing** to detect microbeads:

### **Accredited Laboratories Only**
- Any analysis to determine the presence of microbeads must be conducted by a laboratory that:
  1. Is **accredited** under:
     - The **ISO/IEC 17025** standard (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories), **provided** that:
       - The accrediting body is a **signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement** (a global recognition framework for lab accreditation), OR
     - The **Quebec Environmental Quality Act (CQLR, c. Q-2)** (a provincial standard applicable in Quebec).
  2. Has a **scope of accreditation** that specifically includes the analysis of microbeads.

> ✅ This ensures that testing is conducted by laboratories with proven scientific competence and reliability.

### **Fallback Standard (if no recognized method exists)**
- If:
  - No **recognized analytical method** exists from a standards development organization (e.g., ASTM, ISO), and
  - The laboratory’s accreditation scope does **not include** microbead analysis,
  - Then the analysis must still be performed according to **"standards of good scientific practice"** that are **generally accepted at the time of testing**.

> 🔍 This ensures that even in the absence of a formal standard, testing remains scientifically valid and consistent.

---

## **5. Effective Date and Registration**

- The regulations **come into force on January 1, 2018**.
- However, if the regulations are **registered (officially published) after January 1, 2018**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provision provides flexibility in the legislative process, allowing for delays due to administrative or legal review without undermining the original timeline.

## **6. Purpose and Environmental & Health Rationale**

- **Environmental Risk**: Microbeads, when washed down the drain, do not break down easily and can enter waterways, where they are ingested by aquatic organisms, leading to bioaccumulation and ecosystem disruption.
- **Human Health Risk**: While direct human exposure is low, microbeads can contribute to **microplastic pollution**, which may have long-term health impacts, especially through ingestion or inhalation.
- The regulation aims to **eliminate a significant source of plastic pollution** and promote more sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives (e.g., biodegradable or natural exfoliants).

## **Conclusion**

The **Microbeads in Toiletries Regulations** represent a significant step in Canada’s efforts to reduce plastic pollution and protect ecosystems and public health. By banning microbeads in personal care products—especially in products sold or imported into Canada—the regulations align with global environmental trends and international best practices. The inclusion of scientific testing standards ensures transparency and credibility in enforcement, while the phased implementation allows industry time to adapt and innovate with safer, sustainable alternatives.

These regulations reflect a balanced approach: protecting the environment and human health without unduly burdening legitimate industries, particularly those producing natural health or non-prescription products.
