### 📌 **1. Definitions and Key Terms**

The regulations begin by defining key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Remote Sensing Space Systems Act* (RSSSA). |

#### 🔗 Control and Affiliation
- An **entity is controlled** by a person if they have factual control—directly via ownership or indirectly through trusts, agreements, or ownership of other bodies.
- Two entities are **affiliated** if one controls the other or both are controlled by the same person.

### 🎯 **3. Licence Approval Criteria (Section 8 – Prescribed Factors)**

The Minister evaluates applications based on:

#### For **Initial Licence Approval**:
- The **applicant’s ability** to comply with the Act and these Regulations.
- The **enhancement of competitiveness** of Canada’s remote sensing space industry (national and international).

#### For **Renewal Applications** (additional factors):
- Any **unpaid fees, fines, penalties** due under the Act.
- **Environmental, public health, or safety risks** from failure to dispose of the system according to the system disposal plan.
- **Data continuity** for recipients of raw data or remote sensing products.

### ⚖️ **4. Licence Conditions (Mandatory Requirements)**

Licensees must comply with the following **conditions**:

| Condition | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Contact Person with Security Clearance** | Must appoint an individual with appropriate government security clearance (per Treasury Board Secretariat policy) to communicate with the Government of Canada. |

### 📂 **5. Data Processing and Transformation Rules**

Determines what constitutes "transformation" of raw data:

- **Not considered transformation**:
  - Any process that retains phase information (e.g., producing **Single Look Complex (SLC)** output).
  
- **Considered transformation**:
  - Any process that **rectifies errors, distortions, or artifacts** via pixel aggregation, averaging, or resampling **if** it:
    - Radiometrically calibrates the data; **or**
    - Geocodes the data (resamples to Earth features).

> This distinction is critical for regulatory compliance and data classification.

---

### 💰 **6. Fees and Services for Ministers**

When a minister provides a service to a licensee (e.g., priority access to data or support), the fee must not exceed:

- The amount agreed upon in a **prior agreement** between the minister and licensee; **or**
- If no agreement exists: an amount **proportional** to what the licensee would have received for a **comparable service** provided on a **priority basis** to any other entity in the previous 12 months.

> Ensures fairness and prevents overcharging.

### 🚨 **7. Emergency Notifications and Reporting Obligations**

A licensee must notify the Minister **without delay** in writing if it has reasonable grounds to believe:
