**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Kwets’ootł’àà (North Arm of Great Slave Lake)) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer) in order to **facilitate the establishment of a National Wildlife Area (NWA)**.

This action ensures that the land remains protected for ecological, conservation, and environmental purposes, consistent with federal and territorial goals for wildlife habitat preservation and biodiversity.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**
- **Geographic Location:**  
  The withdrawal applies specifically to the **North Arm of Great Slave Lake** in the Northwest Territories.

- **Land Description:**  
  The parcel is precisely defined by a detailed boundary description using geographic coordinates based on the **North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83)** and referenced to the **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)** projection system.  
  The boundary follows a series of straight-line segments connecting specific points, beginning and ending at the same point (a closed loop), forming a closed tract.

- **Area Size:**  
  The total area of the withdrawn tract is approximately **594 square kilometers (km²)**.

- **Rights Withdrawn:**  
  The withdrawal includes **both surface and subsurface rights** to the land. This means that no disposition (sale, lease, or transfer) of the land or its underlying minerals can occur during the specified period, unless explicitly exempted.

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**
- The withdrawal from disposal is effective for a period of **two years**, beginning on the date the Order is officially made and published.

---

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal Provisions (Section 2 Exemptions)**

Despite the general withdrawal, **Section 2 of the Order does not apply** to the following specific activities involving mineral rights or claims:

1. **Mineral Claims by Prospecting Permit Holders:**  
   - A person who obtained a prospecting permit **before** the date of the Order may locate a mineral claim — this action is not affected by the withdrawal.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims:**  
   - Any mineral claim that was located or recorded **before** the Order comes into force remains unaffected.

3. **Leases for Recorded Claims:**  
   - A lease issued under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person holding a recorded mineral claim (even if the claim was established before the Order) is exempt if it covers land within that recorded claim.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (under Canada Petroleum Resources Act):**  
   - If a significant discovery licence is issued to a holder of an exploration licence that was issued **before** the Order, and the licence covers land subject to that exploration licence, it is exempt.

5. **Production Licences (under Canada Petroleum Resources Act):**  
   - Production licences issued to holders of exploration or significant discovery licences that were issued **before** the Order and cover land subject to those prior licences are exempt.

6. **Surface Leases for Claim Holders:**  
   - Surface leases issued to holders of recorded mineral claims (under the Mining Regulations) or to holders of interests under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act — **only if required to allow exercise of rights under the claim or interest** — are exempt.

7. **Renewals of Interests:**  
   - Renewals of existing mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not affected by the withdrawal.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** These exclusions ensure that existing mineral exploration and development activities — particularly those already underway or legally established prior to the Order — are not disrupted by the withdrawal. This maintains continuity in the mineral sector while protecting the land for conservation.

### **Key Clarifications and Legal Precision**
- The use of **"straight lines"** in the boundary description means that each segment connects two points directly on the UTM projected plane, ensuring precise legal demarcation.
- All geographic references are tied to the **NAD 83 datum**, which is the standard for modern land surveying in Canada, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
- The boundary references specific **land survey records** (e.g., Canada Lands Surveys Records under numbers 98087 and 98145 C.L.S.R.), providing a legal and verifiable basis for the land description.

---

### **Implications and Significance**
1. **Conservation Focus:**  
   The withdrawal supports the creation of a **National Wildlife Area**, which is a federal designation under the *Canadian Wildlife Act* designed to protect wildlife habitats, migratory routes, and ecosystems.

2. **Environmental Protection:**  
   By removing the land from disposal, the government prevents potential development or commercial exploitation that could harm sensitive ecosystems, especially in a region like the North Arm of Great Slave Lake, which is ecologically rich and home to diverse flora and fauna.

3. **Indigenous and Community Considerations:**  
   The area lies within or near the **Tlicho lands** and the **Behchoko community**, suggesting potential Indigenous land-use and cultural connections. While not explicitly stated, such withdrawals may reflect broader efforts to balance conservation with Indigenous rights and land stewardship.

4. **Mineral Sector Stability:**  
   The exemptions protect existing mineral exploration and development rights, preventing abrupt disruption to ongoing projects and ensuring legal certainty for investors and operators.

### **Conclusion**
This Order is a targeted, legally precise instrument that:
- Withdraws approximately **594 km² of land** in the **North Arm of Great Slave Lake** from disposal,
- Establishes a **two-year period** of protection for the establishment of a **National Wildlife Area**,
- Maintains legal continuity for existing mineral rights and claims through specific exemptions,
- Demonstrates a balance between **environmental conservation** and **economic and regulatory stability** in the mineral sector.

It reflects a strategic decision by the federal government to prioritize ecological preservation in a key natural region while respecting existing rights and operational realities in the mining sector.
