- Must have **total residence periods (including totalized periods)** equal to or exceeding the **minimum required residence in Canada** to qualify for a pension outside Canada.
- **Allowances and Guaranteed Income Supplements (GIS)** are paid only to the extent permitted by OASA.

#### 2. **Totalizing Benefits (Chapter 1)**
- If eligibility is based **only on totalizing provisions**, the amount is calculated as follows:

> **Earnings-related portion**:
> - Based on **pensionable earnings under CPP** only.

> **Flat-rate portion**:
> - Flat-rate amount (as per CPP) ×  
>   (Ratio of CPP contributions to minimum qualifying period)  
>   — but **no more than 100%**.

> ✅ This ensures a fair, proportional benefit based on actual contributions.

#### 3. **Lithuanian Pension Calculation**
- For persons eligible **only via totalizing**, Lithuania calculates the pension **solely on Lithuanian creditable periods**.

#### 4. **Disability Pension**
- The number of years until pensionable age is calculated based on:
