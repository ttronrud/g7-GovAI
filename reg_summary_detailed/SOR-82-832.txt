The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of a regulation under **SOR/2017-135, section 1**. Specifically, the notation:

> [Repealed, SOR/2017-135, s. 1]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2017-135, s. 1]  
> ... (repeated five times)

indicates that a particular regulation was officially repealed by **Regulation SOR/2017-135, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) as of the date specified in the statutory order.

**Repealing Instrument**:  
- **SOR/2017-135** is the *Statutory Instrument of 2017, No. 135*, issued by the Government of Canada.  
- **Section 1** of this instrument specifically contains the provision that repeals the previously existing regulation.

**Nature of the Repeal**:  
The repeated references suggest that the regulation being repealed was likely a minor or outdated rule, possibly related to administrative, procedural, or technical matters (such as licensing, reporting, or compliance). However, due to the lack of specific details in the original text, the exact subject matter of the repealed regulation cannot be determined from this summary alone.

**Implications of Repeal**:  
- The regulation no longer applies or is enforceable.  
- Any obligations, duties, or requirements previously established under that regulation are now null and void.  
- Legal or administrative entities that were previously bound by it must adjust their practices accordingly.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader effort to simplify, modernize, or consolidate regulations.

**Note on Information Limitation**:  
Since the original regulation itself is not provided, and only the repeal notice is given, a detailed summary of *what the regulation actually did*—such as its scope, purpose, or key provisions—cannot be offered. To fully understand the content of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the original version of the regulation prior to its repeal, which may be archived in the *Canada Gazette* or through the *Regulations and Codes* database maintained by the Government of Canada.

### Conclusion:  
The provided text confirms that a specific regulation has been **repealed by SOR/2017-135, section 1**. However, without access to the original regulation, a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or impact cannot be provided. The repeal indicates that the regulation is no longer in force and should not be referenced in current legal or administrative practice.
