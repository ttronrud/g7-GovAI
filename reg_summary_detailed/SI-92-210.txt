**Detailed Summary of the "Visiting Forces (Part IX of the Excise Tax Act) Remission Order"**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Minister of Finance**.  
This provision allows the government to make orders for the remission (i.e., exemption or refund) of taxes when it is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

The Order is formally titled:  
> **The Visiting Forces (Part IX of the Excise Tax Act) Remission Order**  
> S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **remit (exempt)** the excise tax imposed under **Part IX, Division II** of the *Excise Tax Act* on certain supplies made to **visiting forces** for **official use**.

This means that when a visiting force (such as a foreign military or government entity) purchases:
- Tangible personal property (e.g., vehicles, equipment),
- Real property (e.g., leased buildings or facilities), or
- Services (e.g., maintenance, utilities, transportation),

...for official military or governmental purposes, the tax that would otherwise be due under the Excise Tax Act is **forgiven or waived**.

### **4. Scope of Remission**

- **Effective Date**: Remission applies to **all supplies made on or after January 1, 1991**.
- **Applicable Supplies**: Includes:
  - Tangible personal property (e.g., vehicles, tools),
  - Real property (e.g., leased premises),

  - Made **to a visiting force** for **official use**.

> This remission applies only to **official use** — not personal or commercial use.

---

### **5. Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions depending on the supplier and the nature of the supply.

#### **Condition A: General Requirement (All Cases)**
A visiting force must **submit a written claim** to the **Minister of National Revenue** to qualify for remission.

The claim must be submitted within specific timeframes:

| Type of Supplier | Time Limit for Claim Submission |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Not the Department of National Defence (DND)** or **Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)** | **Within two years** of the date the supply was made |
| **DND or CCC** | **Within four years** of the date the supply was made |

> *Note:* This time limit is crucial — failure to submit a claim within the deadline results in the loss of eligibility.

---

#### **Condition B: Documentation Requirement**

For claims submitted under Condition A (non-DND/CCC suppliers), the visiting force must provide:
- The **original invoice** or a **certified true copy** of the invoice at the time of submission.
- This invoice must **substantiate the amount of tax paid** in respect of the supply.

> This ensures transparency and verifiability of the tax liability.

---

#### **Condition C: Annual Reporting Requirement**

The visiting force must submit a **complete report** to the Minister of National Revenue detailing:
- The **total amount of tax remitted** to the force during the **preceding fiscal year**.

> This report must be submitted **by April 30** of the year following the fiscal year in question.

> *Example*: For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, the report must be submitted by **April 30, 2024**.

> This requirement enables the government to monitor and verify the volume and pattern of tax remissions.

### **6. Key Implications and Public Interest Rationale**

- **Public Interest Justification**: The government asserts that allowing tax remission for supplies to visiting forces is in the public interest. This may include:
  - Facilitating international cooperation and defense diplomacy.
  - Supporting peacekeeping and security operations.
  - Ensuring that foreign forces can operate efficiently in Canada without financial barriers.
- **Fairness and Accountability**: The conditions (timely claims, documentation, reporting) ensure that the remission is not abused and that the government maintains oversight.

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excludes individual members** of visiting forces or **civilian personnel** designated as part of the civilian component.
- **Excludes personal or non-official use** of supplies.
- **Does not apply to supplies made before January 1, 1991**.
- The remission is **not retroactive** — only applies to supplies made on or after January 1, 1991.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for:
  - Receiving and reviewing claims,
  - Verifying invoices and reports,
  - Deciding whether remission is granted,
  - Ensuring compliance with deadlines and documentation standards.
- Failure to meet submission deadlines or provide required documentation results in **denial of remission**.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **structured, time-bound, and transparent process** for exempting the excise tax on supplies made to visiting forces for official purposes. It balances the **public interest in international military and diplomatic engagement** with the need for **financial accountability and administrative integrity**.

It is a practical tool to support Canada’s international relationships while ensuring that tax revenues are not unfairly diverted or misused through unverified or untimely claims.

**In essence**:  
> *Foreign military forces stationed in Canada can be exempt from excise tax on official supplies made on or after January 1, 1991 — but only if they submit a timely, properly documented claim and annual report to the Minister of National Revenue.*
