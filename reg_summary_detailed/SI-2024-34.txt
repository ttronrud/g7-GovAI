**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 4 of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act (CSJA)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) to designate a specific Minister of the Crown to serve as the "Minister" for the purposes of administering and implementing the Act. This designation is a procedural and administrative step required to ensure that the Act has a clear point of responsibility and accountability within the federal government.

**2. Key Provision – Designation of the Minister**  
The regulation formally designates the **Minister of Natural Resources** as the designated Minister under the CSJA. This means that:

- The Minister of Natural Resources is legally recognized as the principal government official responsible for overseeing the implementation, coordination, and enforcement of the provisions of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act.
- The Minister has the authority to issue directions, make policy decisions, and ensure compliance with the Act within their jurisdiction, particularly in areas related to natural resource management, environmental sustainability, and job creation in sustainable sectors.

---

**3. Purpose and Significance**  
The designation serves several key purposes:

- **Accountability:** It establishes clear governmental accountability by assigning responsibility for the Act to a specific minister, ensuring transparency and effective oversight.
- **Policy Implementation:** It enables the Minister to lead the development and execution of policies aligned with the Act’s goals—such as promoting green jobs, supporting sustainable natural resource development, and advancing environmental stewardship.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination:** The Minister of Natural Resources is well-positioned to coordinate with other departments (e.g., Environment and Climate Change, Infrastructure, Employment and Social Development) to ensure that sustainable job creation initiatives are integrated across federal policy areas.
- **Legal Clarity:** The designation removes ambiguity about who holds the legal and administrative responsibility for the Act, which is essential for legal compliance and intergovernmental cooperation.

**4. Scope of Authority**  
While the Minister of Natural Resources is designated as the "Minister for the purposes of the Act," the scope of their responsibilities is defined by the substantive provisions of the *Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act*. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Promoting sustainable employment opportunities in sectors such as clean energy, forestry, mining, agriculture, and transportation.
- Supporting investments in green infrastructure and technologies.
- Ensuring that natural resource development is conducted in an environmentally sound and socially responsible manner.
- Monitoring and reporting on the creation and sustainability of jobs in key sectors.

Note: The designation does not grant the Minister new legislative powers, but rather assigns them a central role in policy execution and coordination under the Act.

**5. Legal Basis and Process**  
- The Governor General in Council acts on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, reflecting the constitutional convention that executive appointments and designations are made by the Crown on the advice of the head of government.
- The authority to designate a Minister is explicitly provided under **section 4 of the CSJA**, which allows for flexibility in assigning responsibility depending on the nature of the Act and the expertise of the relevant minister.
- This regulation is published in the *Statutes of Canada, 2024, Chapter 13*, confirming its official status and legal validity.

**6. Implications for Stakeholders**  
- **Government Agencies:** Must align their operations and reporting with the Minister’s directives under the Act.
- **Industries and Communities:** Can expect more targeted support and policy development in sustainable job creation, especially in natural resource-dependent regions.
- **Public and Civil Society:** Will benefit from clearer policy pathways and accountability mechanisms in the delivery of sustainable economic development.
