**Detailed Summary of the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations* (the "Regulations") were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, pursuant to **sections 160 and 162 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**. These regulations were introduced to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new passenger automobiles and light trucks in Canada by aligning with U.S. federal standards and establishing a clear, phased pathway toward **zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)** by **model year 2035**.

The regulations were first proposed in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **April 17, 2010**, allowing stakeholders to submit comments or file objections before final adoption. This public consultation process ensured transparency and stakeholder engagement in shaping Canada’s climate strategy for transportation.

## **Key Objectives**

1. **Reduce GHG Emissions**: Establish emission standards that are aligned with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards under the *Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)*.
2. **Phased Transition to Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs)**:
   - Begin in **model year 2026** with incremental increases in ZEV requirements.
   - Achieve **100% zero-emission passenger automobiles and light trucks by model year 2035**.
3. **Ensure Market Alignment**: Align Canadian vehicle emissions standards with those of the United States to facilitate trade, market access, and consumer confidence.
4. **Support Innovation**: Encourage the development and adoption of advanced clean technologies such as electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles.

## **Scope and Applicability**

### **1. Covered Vehicle Classes**
The Regulations apply to two main classes of vehicles:
- **Passenger automobiles** (vehicles designed to transport up to 10 persons)
- **Light trucks** (vehicles with specific functional or structural characteristics)

#### **Exclusions**
- Vehicles being **exported** and accompanied by written evidence that they will **not be sold or used in Canada**.
- **Work trucks** (vehicles with GVWR > 3,856 kg and ≤ 4,536 kg) are excluded from the scope of these emissions standards, though they are defined for clarity.
- Vehicles manufactured in stages by multiple manufacturers, where no single manufacturer produces more than 10,000 units annually, are also excluded.

> Note: The definitions of "passenger automobile" and "light truck" include detailed technical and functional criteria (e.g., seating capacity, cargo volume, towing capability).

## **Core Definitions (Key Terms)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Passenger Automobile** | Any four-wheeled self-propelled vehicle designed for highway use, with GVWR < 4,536 kg (10,000 lbs), excluding light trucks and work trucks. Designed to carry ≤10 passengers. |
| **Light Truck** | A vehicle that either: <br> - Has four-wheel drive or GVWR > 2,722 kg (6,000 lbs) and meets at least four of the following: approach angle ≥28°, break-over angle ≥14°, departure angle ≥20°, running clearance ≥20 cm, axle clearance ≥18 cm; <br> OR is designed to perform functions like transporting more than 10 people, providing temporary living quarters, or carrying cargo beyond passenger volume. |
| **Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV)** | Includes electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). |
| **Advanced Technology Vehicle** | EV, PHEV, or FCV. |
| **Hybrid Electric Vehicle** | Powered by both an internal combustion engine and an on-board electric motor. |
| **Mild Hybrid** | Features automatic start/stop and regenerative braking, recovering at least 15% but less than 65% of total braking energy. |
| **Strong Hybrid** | Recovering at least 65% of total braking energy. |
| **Curb Weight** | Weight of vehicle at operational status with standard equipment, fuel at nominal capacity, and optional equipment. |
| **GVWR** | Maximum design loaded weight of a single vehicle. |
| **GCWR** | Maximum combined weight of towing vehicle, passengers, cargo, and trailer. |
| **Payload Capability** | GVWR minus curb weight. |
| **Towing Capability** | GCWR minus GVWR. |
| **Useful Life** | Emission standards apply for: <br> - Passenger vehicles/light trucks (non-medium duty): 10 years or 120,000 miles (whichever comes first); <br> - Medium-duty light trucks: 11 years or 120,000 miles. |
| **Footprint** | Calculated as (average lateral width × longitudinal distance between front and rear wheel centers) ÷ 144, rounded to nearest 0.1 sq ft. Used in emissions modeling. |

> **Note**: Several definitions have been repealed (e.g., "car line," "transmission class") as of SOR/2014-207, s.1, reflecting modernization of vehicle classification.

## **Standards and Compliance**

### **1. Emission Standards Based on U.S. CFR**
- The Regulations incorporate **federal emission standards from the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**, specifically:
  - **Title 40, Chapter I, Part 600, Subpart F** (energy efficiency and fuel economy)
  - **Title 49, Chapter V, Part 538** (minimum driving range for alternative fuel vehicles)

> **Important Exclusions in Canadian Interpretation**:
- References to **EPA discretion**, **Secretary of Transportation discretion**, **fleet averaging**, **emission credits**, **small-volume manufacturers**, or **financial hardship** are **excluded**.
- Only **EPA standards** are valid; conformity must be verified by the EPA.
- Any alternative standards from other authorities are **not recognized**.

### **2. Conformity Requirements**
- Vehicles must meet **GHG emission standards** for their model year and class.
- Compliance is assessed using **test procedures** identical to those in the U.S. CFR.
- Vehicles must pass **real-world driving conditions** and **standardized test cycles** to determine emissions.

### **3. Fleet-Level Requirements**
- Applies to **fleets** of passenger automobiles and light trucks.
- Requires fleets to meet **aggregate emission standards**.
- Includes requirements for **fleet-level compliance**, especially for vehicles with high emissions or those operated under shared ownership.

### **4. Credit System (Under Section 162 of CEPA)**
- A **credit system** allows manufacturers to:
  - Offset emissions from high-emission vehicles by producing or selling **low-emission or zero-emission vehicles**.
  - Earn **emission credits** for producing ZEVs or meeting emission targets.
- Credits can be used to meet compliance obligations for non-compliant vehicles.
- Credits are **non-transferable** and must be used within a defined period.

### **5. Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Compliance System**
- Begins in **model year 2026** with increasing ZEV mandates.
- By **model year 2035**, **all new passenger automobiles and light trucks** must be **zero-emission vehicles**.
- A **compliance unit system** is established to track progress toward ZEV adoption.
- **Combined fleets** (e.g., fleets of manufacturers or operators) must meet ZEV targets based on their total sales.

## **Model Year and Production Rules**

- A model year is defined as the calendar year in which a vehicle is produced, **if production includes January 1**.
- If production spans across calendar years, the model year corresponds to the **calendar year during which the production period falls**.
- The **period of production must include only one January 1**.

> This ensures consistency in tracking vehicle emissions over time and prevents manipulation of model years.

---

## **Concurrent Sale Rule (Canada–U.S. Market Alignment)**

A vehicle of a specific model year sold in Canada is considered to be **sold concurrently** in Canada and the United States **if**:
- A vehicle of the **same test group** is offered for sale in the U.S. within **365 days** before:
  - For **imported vehicles**: the day of import into Canada.
  - For **Canadian-manufactured vehicles**: the day the **national emissions mark** is applied, or if unknown, the day the **main assembly** was completed.

> This rule ensures that Canadian standards reflect U.S. market availability and enables manufacturers to comply with both jurisdictions simultaneously.

---

## **Application and Authorization**

- Any company wishing to apply the **national emissions mark** (as set out in Schedule 2 of the *On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations*) to a vehicle must:
  - Submit an **application to the Minister of the Environment**.
  - Receive **authorization** under subsection 7(2) of those Regulations.

> This ensures that only compliant vehicles receive the official emissions certification.
