### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically **Section 58**, which empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and define the **critical habitat** of a listed wildlife species.

- The **Misty Lake Lentic Threespine Stickleback** (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) is a distinct population segment of the threespine stickleback fish.
- It is legally recognized as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29).
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this species was developed and has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring public access and transparency.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **a. Designation of Critical Habitat**
The Order formally **designates specific areas** as the **critical habitat** for the Misty Lake Lentic Threespine Stickleback. This designation is based on the recovery strategy, which identifies the ecological conditions essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

- The critical habitat is defined in the **annexed map or description** (not included in this summary, but referenced in the document).
- This habitat includes the specific physical and biological features (e.g., water quality, depth, vegetation, temperature, substrate type) that are necessary for the species to survive and reproduce.

#### **b. Exclusion from Prohibited Areas**
The regulation explicitly states that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.

- Subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA prohibits the **designation of critical habitat** in areas that are:
  - Already protected by a federal or provincial law (e.g., national parks, wildlife reserves, or protected areas),
  - Or where designation would conflict with existing land-use or conservation policies.

- By confirming that the critical habitat is **not located in such a prohibited zone**, the Order ensures that the designation is both legally valid and consistent with existing protections.

### **3. Legal Authority**

The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issues this Order under:
- **Section 58(4)**: Authority to designate critical habitat based on scientific recovery strategies.
- **Section 58(5)**: Authority to define the boundaries and features of critical habitat in a formal, legally binding manner.

This means that once the critical habitat is designated, it becomes a **legally protected area** under SARA, and any activities that could result in **significant harm or destruction** of that habitat are subject to regulatory review and potential prohibition.

---

### **4. Application of Subsection 58(1)**

- **Section 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Misty Lake Lentic Threespine Stickleback.
- This means that **any development, infrastructure project, or human activity** that may affect or degrade the critical habitat must be assessed for its impact under the Act.
- The designation triggers **procedural requirements**, including:
  - Environmental assessments,
  - Consultation with Indigenous communities,
  - Mitigation measures if harm is likely.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.
- This ensures timely legal effect upon publication, allowing regulatory bodies, developers, and stakeholders to begin compliance and planning accordingly.

---

### **6. Purpose and Significance**

- This Order is a key step in the **recovery of the endangered Misty Lake Lentic Threespine Stickleback**.
- It provides a **clear, legally enforceable definition** of where the species depends on for survival.
- It ensures that **future development, land-use planning, and conservation efforts** take into account the ecological needs of this rare fish population.
- It supports **long-term conservation goals** by protecting the specific environmental conditions necessary for the species to persist.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally establishes the **critical habitat** of the Misty Lake Lentic Threespine Stickleback under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, legally sound, and consistent with existing environmental protections. By defining and protecting the essential environment for this endangered species, the Order strengthens Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and species recovery.

---

**Key Takeaways:**
- The species is endangered and legally protected.
- Its critical habitat has been scientifically identified and legally defined.
- No part of this habitat falls within a prohibited zone under SARA.
- The designation triggers legal obligations for all activities that may impact the habitat.
- The Order is enforceable and effective upon registration.

This is a foundational step in the recovery of a rare and localized fish species in Canada.
