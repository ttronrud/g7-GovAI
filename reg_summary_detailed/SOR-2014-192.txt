## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Regulations on Operational Terms for Rail Level of Services Arbitration**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Authority**
- These regulations were made by the **Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)** under **subsection 169.31(1.1)b** of the *Canada Transportation Act (CTA)*.
- The CTA provided notice to the **Minister of Transport** under **subsection 36(2)** of the CTA.
- The **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, approved the regulations under **subsection 36(1)** of the CTA.

> This means the regulations are legally binding and enforceable, grounded in federal transportation law, and apply to rail service agreements between railway companies and shippers.

---

### 🔹 **Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary purpose is to **define what constitutes an “operational term”** in rail service contracts — particularly those related to the **performance of services** involving the **receiving, loading, carrying, unloading, and delivery of freight**.

These operational terms are central to **level of services arbitration**, a mechanism that allows shippers and railway companies to resolve disputes about service quality through an independent, neutral process.

## 🔍 Key Definitions and Criteria for "Operational Terms"

An **operational term** is defined as a clause in a rail service agreement that sets out an obligation — either by the **railway company**, the **shipper**, or both — regarding the performance of actions directly tied to the movement of freight.

### ✅ 1. Operational Terms of the Railway Company (Paragraph 169.31(1)(a))
These are obligations the **railway company** must fulfill in relation to the shipper.

#### Included Matters:
| Matter | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Furnishing of Cars** | Includes: quantity, schedule, location, condition, type/specifications, and procedures for processing the shipper’s order and delivery. |
| **Handling of Shipped Cars** | Includes cycle time (e.g., time between pickup and delivery) for cars furnished by the shipper. |
| **Furnishing of Locomotives/Equipment/Crews** | Obligations to provide motive power, equipment, or personnel. |
| **Pick-up of Cars** | Schedule and location where the railway company picks up cars from the shipper. |
| **Number and Scheduling of Switches** | How many times cars are switched during transit and when. |
| **Transit Time and Route** | Required delivery time and the specific rail route to be used. |
| **Performance Standards** | Quantitative or qualitative metrics (e.g., % of on-time deliveries, frequency of service) used to measure compliance. These may also require the railway to collect and report data. |
| **Force Majeure Circumstances** | Situations where the railway cannot comply with an operational term, including: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Natural disasters (floods, fires) | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• War, insurrection, riots, strikes, lock-outs | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Derailments, rail blockages (accidents, protests, natural causes) | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Loading-related issues | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Shipper failure to meet conditions under Section 113 of the CTA | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Inability to access terminals or delays in access | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Inability to transfer traffic to another railway or delays in transfer | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Breakdowns in railway components (e.g., signaling, track systems) | |

> ⚠️ Note: These circumstances may excuse non-compliance, but only if they are clearly documented and meet the criteria.

### ✅ 2. Obligations of Recovery (Paragraph 169.31(1)(b))
When a railway fails to meet an operational term, it must take **specific steps to minimize harm** to the shipper.

#### Required Steps:
- **Prepare a Recovery Plan**: A documented plan outlining how the railway will address the failure.
- **Take Reasonable Steps to Secure Assistance**: Such as contacting third parties, using emergency resources, or seeking financial support.
- **Limit Prejudicial Consequences**: Minimize financial, logistical, or operational damage to the shipper.
- **Implement the Recovery Plan**: Actively carry out the plan and report progress.

> This ensures accountability and provides a structured response to service failures, protecting the interests of shippers.

---

### ✅ 3. Obligations of the Shipper (Paragraph 169.31(1)(c))
These are responsibilities the **shipper** must fulfill to support the railway’s performance.

#### Included Matters:
| Matter | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Furnishing of Cars** | Providing cars to the railway company as required. |
| **Handling of Cars** | Managing the handling of cars received from the railway (e.g., loading/unloading). |
| **Loading and Unloading** | Scheduling and procedures for releasing cars for loading/unloading. |
| **Number and Scheduling of Switches** | Cooperating with the railway on switch operations. |
| **Access to Facilities** | Providing timely and reliable access to the shipper’s facilities (e.g., yards, terminals). |

> These obligations are critical to ensuring smooth operations and mutual accountability.

---

### ✅ 4. Obligations of the Shipper Regarding Recovery (Paragraph 169.31(1)(c))
The shipper must also comply with **its own responsibilities** in the event of a recovery plan being implemented by the railway.

This includes:
- Cooperating with the railway’s recovery efforts.
- Providing necessary information or access.
- Ensuring timely responses to recovery requests.

> This prevents shippers from being passive or obstructive during service disruptions.

---

### ✅ 5. Communication Protocols (Paragraph 169.31(1)(a)–(c))
Both parties must use a **clear, standardized communication protocol** to share information about compliance and performance.

#### Required Communications Include:
| Information | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Shipped Traffic Status** | Real-time updates on the location, condition, and expected delivery time of freight. |
| **Force Majeure Events** | Notification of any event that could prevent compliance (e.g., strike, flood). |
| **Obligations of Recovery** | Reporting on recovery plan implementation and progress. |
| **Failures to Comply** | Reporting when either party fails to meet an operational term. |
| **Billing for Services** | Transparent billing related to operational term performance (e.g., charges for late delivery). |
| **Authorization of Terminals** | Notification of changes in terminal access or usage. |

> This promotes transparency, enables early detection of issues, and supports effective dispute resolution.

## 🔁 Key Features and Implications

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clarity of Operational Terms** | Helps define what is and isn’t part of a service obligation, reducing ambiguity in contracts. |
| **Performance Metrics** | Enables measurable, objective evaluation of service quality. |
| **Force Majeure Clarity** | Defines when non-compliance is excused, reducing disputes over unforeseen events. |
| **Recovery Mechanism** | Provides a structured, fair process to mitigate harm when service fails. |
| **Mutual Accountability** | Shifts responsibility from one party to both — shippers and railways must cooperate. |
| **Transparency & Data Sharing** | Encourages real-time data exchange to improve service and reduce delays. |
