### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

#### ✅ What is a "Related Party"?
The regulations define "related parties" broadly, including:
- A **foreign bank that controls** a foreign bank subsidiary.
- A **financial institution controlled** by that foreign bank.
- Other entities that have a controlling or significant ownership interest in the bank or its affiliates.

---

### **3. Approved Transactions Between a Foreign Bank Subsidiary and Its Controlling Foreign Bank or Controlled Financial Institution**

Under **Section 500 of the Bank Act**, a foreign bank subsidiary may enter into the following transactions **only if** they meet specific conditions:

#### ✔️ (a) Transactions Forming Part of Banking Services
These are transactions that are **integral to banking services** provided to customers of:
- The foreign bank subsidiary,
- The foreign bank itself, or
- A financial institution controlled by the foreign bank.

**Examples include**:
- Interest rate swaps
- Currency swaps
- Equity and commodity swaps
- Foreign exchange forwards, options, and spot transactions
- Forward rate agreements
- Options on interest rates, futures, commodities, equity indices, shares, and ownership interests
- Futures on interest rates, currencies, and commodities
- Money market instrument transactions
- Loan syndications and asset sales
- Commodity forwards
- Repurchase agreements (repos) and other securities transactions
- Any derivative transaction derived from the above

> **Note**: This class of transactions is considered "core" to banking operations and is permitted as long as they are directly tied to customer services.

#### ✔️ (b) Deposit Limitations
The foreign bank subsidiary may deposit funds with the foreign bank or its controlled financial institution **only if**:
1. **Term ≤ 30 days** – for short-term liquidity management purposes.
2. **Total deposit amount** (including all other deposits with related parties) **does not exceed 50% of the regulatory capital** of the foreign bank subsidiary.

> This cap ensures that such deposits do not create excessive exposure or systemic risk.

### **4. General Provisions on Transactions with Any Related Party**

A bank (domestic or foreign) may enter into the following types of transactions with a related party **directly or indirectly**, provided they are consistent with the Bank Act and sound financial practices.

#### ✔️ (1) Allocation of Amounts under Income Tax Act Subsections
The bank may allocate amounts pursuant to the following provisions of the *Income Tax Act*:
- Subsections 18(2.3), 125(3), 127(10.3), 137(2), (4.1), (4.2), (5.1)
- 181.5(2)
- 190.15(2)
- 191.1(3)

> These relate to tax-sharing arrangements, such as intercompany allocations of income or expenses for tax purposes.

#### ✔️ (2) Tax Payment Agreements under Section 191.3(1) of the Income Tax Act
Two types of agreements are permitted:

**A. Bank Pays Tax for Related Party**
- The bank agrees to pay **all or part of the tax** owed by the related party.
- In return, the related party agrees to pay the bank an amount **at least equal to the additional costs** incurred by the bank due to the agreement (including additional taxes under the Income Tax Act).

**B. Related Party Pays Tax for Bank**
- The related party agrees to pay **all or part of the tax** owed by the bank.
- This allows for tax cost-sharing where the related party bears a portion of the tax burden.

> These arrangements must be structured to avoid tax avoidance and must be transparent and reasonable.

#### ✔️ (3) Issuance of Conversion Privileges, Options, or Rights
The bank may issue:
- Conversion privileges
- Options
- Rights to acquire securities or membership shares  
**only if** such issuance is **not otherwise provided for** in the terms and conditions of the original issuance.

> This prevents abuse of rights and ensures that new rights are not granted without clear justification.

#### ✔️ (4) Purchase for Cancellation of Shares or Debt Obligations
The bank may purchase:
- Shares
- Membership shares
- Debt obligations  
**for cancellation** (i.e., to retire them from circulation)  
**only if** such purchase is **not otherwise provided for** in the original issuance terms.

> Prevents arbitrary or opportunistic cancellation of equity or debt instruments.

#### ✔️ (5) Redemption of Redeemable Securities
The bank may redeem:
- Redeemable shares
- Membership shares
- Debt obligations  
**only if** such redemption is **not otherwise provided for** in the original terms.

> Ensures that redemption is not done in a way that could distort capital structure or create financial instability.

#### ✔️ (6) Payment or Delivery of Money or Property upon Capital Reduction
If the bank or related party reduces its **stated capital**, the bank may:
- Receive or deliver money or property  
as a result of that reduction.

> This covers scenarios where capital is reduced through share buybacks or write-offs, with clear accountability.

- The 50% deposit cap applies **cumulatively** across all related parties — not just the controlling foreign bank.

---

- The **Minister of Finance** and **Banking regulators** (e.g., the Bank of Canada) are responsible for:
  - Monitoring compliance
  - Ensuring adherence to capital and liquidity thresholds

---

## ✅ Summary in One Paragraph

The *Related Party Transactions (Banks) Regulations* (effective June 1, 1992) establish clear, risk-based guidelines for transactions between banks and their related parties. Foreign bank subsidiaries may enter into banking-related services and short-term deposits (up to 30 days and not exceeding 50% of regulatory capital) with their controlling foreign banks or controlled financial institutions. Banks may also engage in tax-sharing agreements, issuance of conversion rights, redemption or cancellation of securities, and capital reduction transactions with related parties — but only if these activities are transparent, compliant with statutory provisions, and not contrary to sound financial practices. The regulations aim to protect financial stability, prevent conflicts of interest, and ensure accountability in intercompany dealings.
