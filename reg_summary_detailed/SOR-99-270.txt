## **Permitted Activities by Authorized Foreign Banks**

### 1. **Administration of Insurance Products**
An authorized foreign bank may:
- Administer **authorized types of insurance** and **personal accident insurance**.

> This means they can offer and manage these policies directly on behalf of customers, including group policies.

---

### 2. **Group Insurance for Employees**
Authorized foreign banks may administer group insurance policies for:
- Their **own employees** or employees of entities they **control or have a substantial investment in** (under sections 522.07, 522.08, or 522.32(1) or (3) of the Bank Act);
- Employees of entities **controlled or substantially invested in by an affiliate** of the bank;
- Employees in Canada of an **affiliate** that is covered under sections 522.17 or 522.18 of the Bank Act and operates in one of the specified business categories.

    - A specific risk,
    - A proposal for life insurance, an insurance policy, or a service,
    - A particular insurance company, agent, or broker.
  - The bank does **not refer** any individual to a specific insurer, agent, or broker.

> This protects consumers from being directed to specific insurers, which could lead to conflicts of interest or misleading sales.

## **Promotion Restrictions**

### 1. **Prohibited Promotion of Insurance Companies, Agents, or Brokers**
An authorized foreign bank **shall not promote** an insurance company, agent, or broker **in Canada** unless:

- The promotion occurs **outside a branch** and is directed to one of the following groups:
  - All holders of credit or charge cards who regularly receive statements,
  - All natural-person customers who regularly receive statements, or

An authorized foreign bank **shall not promote**:
- A policy or service **not of an authorized type**;
- A policy from a **corporation with share capital** (except mutual insurance companies or fraternal benefit societies) that offers insurance to a natural person for travel risks;
- A personal accident insurance policy **within a branch**;
- A policy or service not meeting the above criteria.

> Exceptions exist only when:
> - The promotion occurs **outside a branch** and targets the cardholders, statement-receiving customers, or the public.

### 3. **Exclusion of Certain Individuals from Promotions**
Despite the general rules, an authorized foreign bank may **exclude** individuals from promotions if:
- The promotion would **contravene a provincial or federal law**;
- The individual has **writtenly declined** to receive promotional material; or
- The individual holds a **credit or charge card** with an account **not in good standing**.

> This respects consumer autonomy and financial responsibility.

### 1. **Permitted Use of Bank Web Pages**
- Promotions under paragraph 4(b) (authorized types of insurance) or 5(1)(c) (authorized insurance) **may appear on a bank web page**.

  - Leads to or provides access to a page promoting:
    - An insurance company, agent, or broker that **does not deal only in authorized types of insurance**, or
    - An insurance policy or service that is **not of an authorized type**.

> This ensures that the bank’s website remains a safe, transparent space for authorized insurance offerings and prevents misleading or inappropriate content.
