#### **Condition 2: Availability to Government Officers**
- Exporters must be able to **provide the required documents upon request** to an officer of the **Export Controls Division (ECD)** of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFIT).

- This ensures that the origin and nature of the export are clearly identified in official customs records, facilitating transparency and international coordination.
