Personal property of the following individuals may be accepted for laundering, dry cleaning, or pressing at Department-operated laundries **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Availability of Civilian Facilities**:  
   The service is permitted only when civilian laundry facilities are **not available in the area**.

2. **Capacity Constraints**:  
   The laundry’s capacity must allow for the processing of the personal property without overburdening operations.

3. **No Interference with Public Property Services**:  
   The use of laundries for personal property must **not interfere** with the laundering or dry cleaning of public property (e.g., military equipment, uniforms, or official items).

### **Acceptance and Pricing of Personal Property**

Personal property belonging to the following groups may be accepted for laundering, dry cleaning, or pressing:

- Canadian Forces personnel and their dependents  
- Civilians employed by the Department of National Defence  
- Civilian employees of contractors performing work for the Department  

**Pricing and Conditions**:

- The rates and conditions under which personal property is accepted are **prescribed from time to time by the Minister**.
- For **pressing services**, the rate is set at **one-half the price** of the full dry cleaning service for similar items, rounded **up to the nearest five cents**.

> Example: If the full dry cleaning of a garment costs $12.75, the pressing service would cost $6.35 (half of $12.75, rounded up to the nearest 5 cents).

### **Claims for Loss or Damage**

This section outlines how claims for loss or damage to personal property submitted to the laundries are to be handled, based on the **value of the claim** and whether negligence was involved.

| Claim Value | Settlement Criteria |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Up to $15** | Settled as prescribed by the Minister. |
| **Over $15 but not over $200**, and **involving negligence** of an officer or servant acting within the scope of their duties or employment | Settled according to the *National Defence Claims Order, 1970*. This implies claims involving fault or misconduct are treated under a formal claims process with potential compensation based on liability. |
| **Over $15 but not over $200**, and **not involving negligence** | Settled as prescribed by the Minister. |
| **Over $200**, and **not involving negligence** | Settled as authorized by the *Treasury Board* — indicating a higher-level, centralized financial authority with broader discretion to approve settlements. |

> This tiered structure ensures that:
> - Small claims are handled efficiently by the Minister.
> - Claims involving negligence are governed by a specific, established legal framework (the 1970 Claims Order).
> - Large claims (over $200) are subject to Treasury Board oversight, ensuring financial accountability and consistency across the federal government.

### **Key Principles and Implications**

1. **Operational Efficiency**: The Order ensures that laundries are used only when necessary and when they do not disrupt essential public property services.
2. **Cost Control**: Pricing is strictly regulated and tied to standard rates, with pressing services being significantly discounted.
3. **Fairness and Accountability**: The claim settlement process is tiered to balance prompt resolution of minor issues with rigorous oversight for larger or more serious incidents.
4. **Legal Compliance**: The reference to the *National Defence Claims Order, 1970* ensures that claims involving employee negligence are handled under a formal, legally recognized framework, preserving accountability and consistency.
5. **Centralized Authority**: The Minister and Treasury Board hold significant authority, ensuring uniformity in policy and financial decisions.

It emphasizes **practicality, cost-effectiveness, and operational integrity**, while ensuring that claims for loss or damage are managed fairly and in accordance with established legal and financial protocols.
