**Detailed Summary of the Postage Meter Regulations, 2010**

---

### **Overview**

The *Postage Meter Regulations, 2010* are a set of administrative rules established under the *Canada Post Corporation Act* (R.S., c. C-10) to regulate the use, installation, operation, and maintenance of postage meters in Canada. These regulations were approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, following a public consultation period during which interested parties were given the opportunity to submit comments.

The regulations came into force upon registration and are designed to ensure the integrity, security, and proper use of postage meters—machines that print postage on mail items through digital and mechanical means—while maintaining compliance with Canada Post’s operational standards and postal service integrity.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Definitions**
The regulations define key terms used throughout the document:

- **Ascending Register**: A device that records the total accumulated value of postage printed by the meter.  
  *(French: totalisateur)*

- **Descending Register**: A device that tracks the remaining postage value after printing.  
  *(French: soustracteur)*

- **Item**: Any mailable matter (e.g., letter, envelope, package).  
  *(French: version anglaise seulement – only English version applies)*

- **Lessee**: A person who leases a postage meter from a supplier.  
  *(French: locataire)*

- **Postage Meter**: A machine containing both ascending and descending registers, capable of remote connection to a supplier’s system for setting the descending register and exchanging data, used to print a postage meter impression and may also print other words/symbols.  
  *(French: machine à affranchir)*

- **Postage Meter Impression**: A printed impression showing:
  - A barcode or data matrix code,
  - The amount of postage,
  - The meter’s serial number,
  - The supplier’s identifying mark.  
  *(French: empreinte de machine à affranchir)*

- **Supplier**: A company that has entered into an agreement with Canada Post to install and supply postage meters in Canada.  
  *(French: fournisseur)*

#### **2. Installation Requirements**
No individual or entity may install a postage meter in Canada unless:

1. They are a **supplier**;
2. They have obtained **written approval from Canada Post** for the specific model of meter;
3. They have entered into a **lease agreement** with the person in control of the premises where the meter will be installed.

> This ensures only authorized suppliers can introduce postage meters into the Canadian postal system and that all installations are properly vetted and documented.

---

#### **3. Register Setting Restrictions**
- **Only suppliers** may set the descending register (i.e., the remaining postage balance).
- No other person (including lessees or end users) may alter or set the descending register.

> This prevents unauthorized manipulation of postage values, which could lead to fraud or underpayment of postage.

---

#### **4. Usage Restrictions and Requirements**
- Only **suppliers or lessees** may use a postage meter.
- Use must be authorized directly by the supplier or lessee.
- A postage meter impression must be printed in **fluorescent red ink** and placed in one of the following ways:
  - Directly on the **mailing cover** of the item;
  - On a **postage meter tape** affixed to the item;
  - On a **label approved by Canada Post** and attached to the item.

> The fluorescent red ink is a key security feature to prevent tampering and ensure the impression is authentic and visible under UV light.

---

#### **5. Special Permitted Use: “RETURN POSTAGE — PREPAID”**
- A person may print the phrase **“RETURN POSTAGE — PREPAID / PORT DE RETOUR PAYÉ”** on an item **only if**:
  - It is a **pre-addressed reply card, label, or envelope**;
  - It is intended to be mailed by someone else.

> This allows for prepaid return mail services, ensuring clarity and preventing misuse.

---

#### **6. Printing Additional Words or Symbols**
- Users may print additional content (e.g., advertisements, slogans, return addresses) on items **provided that**:
  - The content does **not encroach upon the area reserved for the postage meter impression**.

> This protects the integrity of the postage impression, which is critical for automated scanning and verification by postal systems.

---

#### **7. Posting Date Requirements**
- An item must be posted on the **date shown in the postage meter impression**.
- **Exception**: If the item cannot be posted on the original date, a second impression may be printed:
  - With a **different date**;
  - With a **zero-dollar postage value**;
  - And the item may then be posted on that new date.

> However, the second impression **must not overlap or interfere with the original impression**.

> This provision allows flexibility in mailing schedules while maintaining accountability and traceability.

---

#### **8. Postal Code Restrictions**
- If a postage meter impression includes a **postal code**, the item **cannot be posted from a location outside the municipality** to which that code applies—unless:
  - The **new location has been written consent** from Canada Post.

> This prevents misuse of postal codes for mail routing fraud or unauthorized delivery.

---

#### **9. Fraud Prevention: Altered Postage Amounts**
- If the amount of postage shown in the impression appears to have been **altered or tampered with**, the item shall be treated as **undeliverable mail** and processed according to the *Undeliverable and Redirected Mail Regulations*.

> This is a critical safeguard against fraudulent or counterfeit postage, which could compromise postal revenue and system integrity.

---

#### **10. Meter Movement and Malfunction Reporting**
- A **lessee** who intends to move a meter must:
  - Notify the supplier of the **new address** and the **date of relocation**.

- If a lessee discovers:
  - A **malfunction** in the meter, or
  - Suspicion of **tampering**,  
  they must:
  - Immediately inform the supplier,
  - Cease using the meter,
  - Make the meter available for inspection.

- If a meter is **lost or stolen**, the lessee must **immediately notify the supplier**.

> These reporting requirements enhance accountability and enable swift investigation and recovery of compromised or misused equipment.

---

#### **11. Inspection Rights**
- Upon receiving **reasonable notice**, Canada Post or a designated representative may:
  - Inspect any postage meter in the possession of a supplier or lessee.

> This gives Canada Post the authority to verify compliance, detect fraud, or assess equipment condition.

---

#### **12. Return of Meter at Lease Termination**
- When a lease ends or is terminated, the **lessee must immediately return the meter to the supplier**.

> Ensures that all equipment remains under supplier control and is available for proper maintenance or redistribution.

---

#### **13. Possession and Repossession Powers**
- Canada Post (or a designated person) may **require a supplier to immediately repossess** a postage meter if:
  - There are **reasonable grounds to believe** the meter has a malfunction or has been tampered with.

> This empowers Canada Post to take immediate action to protect the integrity of the postal system and prevent fraud.

---

#### **14. Repeal Clause**
- The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that any prior conflicting provisions are superseded by these 2010 regulations.

> Ensures legal clarity and up-to-date compliance standards.

---

#### **15. Effective Date**

### **Conclusion**

The *Postage Meter Regulations, 2010* represent a comprehensive and well-structured regulatory framework designed to govern the use of postage meters in Canada. By defining clear roles, setting technical standards, and establishing strict accountability measures, the regulations ensure that postage meters remain secure, reliable, and integral to the integrity of Canada’s postal system.

Key features such as the fluorescent red ink requirement, restrictions on register manipulation, and mandatory reporting of malfunctions or loss serve as strong deterrents against fraud and misuse. At the same time, the regulations provide flexibility (e.g., for second impressions or return mail) to support legitimate business needs without compromising postal security.

These rules reflect a balance between operational efficiency and regulatory control, ensuring that postage meters continue to serve as a modern, efficient tool for mailers while protecting Canada Post from financial and logistical risks.
