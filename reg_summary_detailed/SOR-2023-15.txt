## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Prohibition of the Manufacture and Importation of Wheel Weights Containing Lead Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Basis and Background**

The regulation is made under **subsection 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), following a formal process outlined in the Act:

- On **July 3, 2021**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed regulation** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, under **subsection 332(1)a** of CEPA 1999.
- The proposed regulation aimed to **prohibit the manufacture and importation of wheel weights containing lead** in Canada, except under specific conditions.
- Public consultation was opened, allowing stakeholders to:
  - Submit comments on the proposed rules, or
  - File a **notice of objection**, requesting a **board of review** to assess the regulation’s environmental and health implications.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was also consulted under **subsection 93(3)** of CEPA 1999 to provide expert advice.
- The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Ministers of Environment and Health) concluded that:
  - The proposed regulation **does not conflict** with other federal environmental or health legislation.
  - It provides **adequate protection** to human health and the environment, particularly due to the known toxicity of lead.
- Therefore, the regulation was **finalized and enacted**.

### 🚗 **Definition of Key Term**

- **"Vehicle"** is defined in the same way as under **Section 2 of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act**. This includes cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other motorized vehicles used on public roads.

---

### ✅ **Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- **Wheel weights designed to balance the wheels of a vehicle**.
- **Manufacturing or importing** wheel weights that contain **more than 0.1% lead by weight**.

> ⚠️ **Exemptions**:
> - **Wheel weights in transit** through Canada (from outside Canada to outside Canada) are **not subject** to the regulation.
> - **Manufacture for export only** of wheel weights containing lead is **exempt**.
> - **Importation of wheel weights that are already installed on vehicles** is **exempt**.

---

### 🚫 **Prohibition on Lead Content**

- **No person may manufacture or import wheel weights containing more than 0.1% lead by weight**.
- This means that any wheel weight with **lead content above 0.1%** (e.g., 0.11%, 0.2%, etc.) is **prohibited** in Canada.

> 💡 *Note:* This is a significant reduction from older standards where lead was commonly used in wheel weights. The 0.1% threshold reflects a balance between environmental protection and practical industrial needs.

### 📝 **Permit System (Exception for Specific Cases)**

Despite the general prohibition, a **permit system** allows limited exceptions where lead-containing wheel weights are necessary.

#### 📌 **Conditions for Permit Issuance**

A permit may be issued **only if**:
1. The applicant can demonstrate that:
   - There is **no technically or economically feasible alternative** to using lead-containing wheel weights, **or**
   - There is an alternative, but it is **not feasible** for the applicant due to technical, economic, or operational constraints.
2. The **requested permit term** does not exceed the period necessary for the activity (i.e., the time required to complete the manufacturing or importation).

> 🔍 *This ensures that the exemption is not granted arbitrarily or for long-term use without justification.*

#### 📅 **Permit Duration**

- Maximum term: **24 months**.
- A permit may be **renewed once** (for another 24 months), provided the same conditions are met.

#### 📝 **Application Requirements**

An application for a permit must include:
- **Information specified in the Schedule** (as detailed below).
- A **certification**, signed and dated by the applicant or their authorized representative, confirming that all information provided is **accurate and complete**.

> 📌 *Applications must be submitted to the Minister no later than **90 days before** the intended date of manufacture or importation.*

#### 🔁 **Renewal Process**

- Renewal applications must be submitted **90 days before the expiry** of the current permit.
- Must include:
  - Same information as initial application.
  - Additional data on:
    - Number of wheel weights manufactured or imported under the original permit.
    - Total quantity of lead (in kilograms) involved.
- Must include a certification of accuracy and completeness.

#### 🚫 **Refusal or Revocation of Permits**

- The Minister may **refuse** a permit if:
  - There is **reasonable ground to believe** the applicant provided **false or misleading information**.
- The Minister may **revoke** a permit if:
  - The applicant has submitted false or misleading information, or
  - The applicant has failed to comply with the permit conditions.

> ⚖️ **Due Process Requirements**:
> - The permit holder must be **notified in writing** of the revocation.
> - The holder must be given a **written opportunity to respond** (make representations).
> - Revocation is **not effective until 20 days after notification**.

### 📂 **Recordkeeping Requirements**

All persons manufacturing or importing lead-containing wheel weights must:

#### 📋 **Maintain Records That Include**:
1. **Date of manufacture or importation**.
2. **Date of export or intended export**.
3. **Total number of wheel weights** manufactured or imported.

> ✅ These records must be retained for **at least five years** after the date of manufacture or import.

#### 📍 **Location of Records**
- Records must be kept at the **principal place of business** in Canada.
- If moved, the person must **notify the Minister in writing within 30 days** of the move.
- The new location must be a **civic address in Canada**.
