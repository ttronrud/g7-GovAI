**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Order* and may be cited as such. This Order establishes the legal framework governing the marketing of flue-cured tobacco in Quebec, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **Commodity Board**:  
  Refers to the *Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Producers’ Board* (known in French as *Office de commercialisation*). This body is established under the *Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Producers’ Plan* (the "Plan") and is responsible for overseeing the marketing and commercialization of flue-cured tobacco. It acts as the central regulatory and administrative body for the sector.

- **Flue-Cured Tobacco**:  
  Specifically denotes flue-cured tobacco that is grown and produced within the Province of Quebec. This distinguishes it from tobacco produced elsewhere in Canada or internationally. The term is used in both English and French within the Order: *tabac jaune* in French.

- **Plan**:  
  Refers to the *Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Producers’ Plan*, which was officially sanctioned and declared in force by the *Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board* on June 21, 1958, and published in the *Quebec Official Gazette*. This Plan was enacted under the authority of the *Agricultural Marketing Act of Quebec*. The Plan sets out the rules, obligations, powers, and responsibilities of the Commodity Board in relation to the local marketing of flue-cured tobacco.

**3. Authority and Powers of the Commodity Board**  

The Commodity Board is granted specific regulatory authority over the **marketing of flue-cured tobacco in interprovincial and export trade**. This means it has the power to regulate how flue-cured tobacco is sold, distributed, and exported outside of Quebec.

Importantly, the Board is authorized to exercise **all or any powers** related to the marketing of flue-cured tobacco that are currently available to it in the **local (intra-provincial) market**, as outlined in the Plan under the section titled *"Obligations, powers and attributions."*

However, **a critical limitation** is stated:  
> The Board is **excluded from exercising the powers** specified in **paragraphs (g) and (o)** under the subsection *"And particularly"* of the said heading in the Plan.

This means that while the Board can regulate most aspects of marketing (such as pricing, quality standards, grading, and distribution), it **does not have authority** over the specific provisions listed in paragraphs (g) and (o) of that section. These excluded powers may relate to areas such as:
- (g) Possibly involving **price controls or fixed pricing mechanisms** (e.g., minimum or maximum prices for tobacco);
- (o) Possibly involving **direct control over production quotas or farm-level decisions** (e.g., limits on acreage or output).

The exact nature of these paragraphs would need to be referenced in the original Plan to determine their precise scope, but their exclusion signals a deliberate limitation in the Board’s authority in interprovincial and export markets.

**4. Scope of Application**  
The powers granted under this Order apply **only to persons and property located within the Province of Quebec**. This means:
- The Board's authority to regulate interprovincial and export trade is limited to actions involving entities or assets situated in Quebec.
- It does not extend to regulating the operations of producers or traders outside of Quebec, nor does it impose obligations on out-of-province buyers or exporters directly.

---

**5. Legal Basis and Enforcement**  
The Order derives its authority from:
- The *Agricultural Marketing Act of Quebec*, which empowers the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board to sanction and enforce plans related to agricultural products.
- The *Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Producers’ Plan*, which serves as the foundational document outlining the structure and functions of the Commodity Board.

The regulation is thus a legal instrument designed to ensure fair, orderly, and sustainable marketing of a key agricultural product—flue-cured tobacco—within Quebec’s economy, particularly in national and international markets.

---

**6. Significance and Purpose**  
This Order:
- Provides a clear legal basis for the Commodity Board to manage the marketing of flue-cured tobacco beyond Quebec’s borders.
- Maintains a balance between market regulation and producer interests by excluding certain powers (g and o) that may affect farm-level decisions or pricing mechanisms.
- Supports the economic stability of Quebec’s tobacco industry by ensuring consistent standards and fair trade practices.

**Conclusion**  
The *Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Order* establishes the regulatory framework for the interprovincial and export marketing of flue-cured tobacco produced in Quebec. It grants the Quebec Flue-Cured Tobacco Producers’ Board (Commodity Board) broad powers similar to those it holds locally, with a key exception: it cannot exercise the powers specified in paragraphs (g) and (o) of the Plan’s "Obligations, powers and attributions" section. This restriction preserves producer autonomy in certain areas while enabling effective market oversight in broader trade contexts. The Order is grounded in the 1958 Plan and operates under the authority of Quebec’s Agricultural Marketing Act.
