Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation you provided:

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Public Service Functions from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to the Department of Transport**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, specifically **paragraph 2(a)** of that Act. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer control and supervision of certain public service units between federal departments.

---

#### **2. Key Transfers: Control and Supervision**

The following public service units and divisions are **transferred from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to the Department of Transport (DOT)**:

- **Office of Boating Safety**  
  - Responsibility for enforcing boating safety standards, including safety education, inspections, and compliance with boating regulations.  
  - This transfer consolidates boating safety oversight under the Department of Transport, aligning it with broader transportation safety initiatives.

- **Canada Shipping Act 2001 Regulatory Reform Team**  
  - A specialized unit responsible for reviewing, modernizing, and reforming regulations under the *Canada Shipping Act 2001*.  
  - This transfer ensures that regulatory reform efforts related to shipping operations, safety, and environmental protection are integrated into the DOT’s regulatory framework.

- **Navigable Waters Protection Division**  
  - Responsible for protecting navigable waters from harmful activities, including pollution, unauthorized development, and encroachments.  
  - This unit will now operate under the DOT, strengthening coordination between waterway protection and transportation infrastructure management.

> **Exception**: The portion of the Environmental Response Division responsible for carrying out the **powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans under Section 678 of the Canada Shipping Act** is **excluded** from this transfer.  
> - Section 678 of the Canada Shipping Act empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to take emergency action in response to pollution incidents involving navigable waters.  
> - This specific function remains under the jurisdiction of DFO to preserve its unique role in environmental emergency response.

#### **3. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**

In addition to the transfer of units, the regulation explicitly transfers **certain powers, duties, and functions** from the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** to the **Minister of Transport (MOT)** under the *Canada Shipping Act 2001*. These include:

- **Paragraph 519(a)**: Powers related to the regulation of shipping and navigation, including licensing and oversight of vessels.
- **Paragraph 519(b)**: Authority over the establishment and enforcement of rules concerning the safe operation of vessels in navigable waters.
- **Paragraph 519(d)**: Powers related to the inspection and certification of vessels and their equipment.
- **Section 562.15**: Authority to issue orders or directives to vessels or operators to prevent or mitigate risks to navigation.
- **Section 562.16**: Powers to take enforcement action, including penalties, in cases of non-compliance with shipping regulations.

> This transfer effectively shifts key regulatory and enforcement responsibilities related to maritime safety and navigation from DFO to DOT, aligning them with the DOT’s broader mandate over transportation systems.

---

#### **4. Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**

- **Improved Coordination**: By centralizing maritime safety, navigation, and shipping regulation under the Department of Transport, the government aims to enhance coordination across transportation sectors.
- **Streamlined Regulation**: Consolidating regulatory reform and enforcement under DOT supports a more unified and efficient approach to shipping governance.
- **Clearer Jurisdictional Boundaries**: The exclusion of emergency environmental response under Section 678 preserves DFO’s critical role in environmental protection and ecological emergencies, ensuring that environmental safeguards are not compromised.

---

#### **5. Implications**

- **Operational Impact**: Staff, programs, and reporting lines for the transferred units will now fall under the DOT’s administrative and policy framework.
- **Policy Alignment**: DOT will now lead on issues such as vessel safety, navigation rules, and waterway protection, while DFO retains focus on fishery resources, environmental conservation, and emergency environmental response.
- **Interdepartmental Collaboration**: While responsibilities are transferred, ongoing cooperation between DFO and DOT will likely continue—especially in areas like pollution response, habitat protection, and joint enforcement.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant restructuring of federal maritime governance. It transfers key operational and regulatory responsibilities related to **boating safety, shipping regulation, and navigable waters protection** from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to the Department of Transport. However, it preserves DFO’s essential environmental emergency response mandate under Section 678 of the Canada Shipping Act. The move reflects a strategic shift toward integrating transportation safety and maritime oversight under a single, cohesive department, enhancing efficiency and accountability in the management of Canada’s waterways.
