**Detailed Summary of the Provincial Child Support Service Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 16, s. 27(2); R.S., c. 3 (2nd Supp.))**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Divorce Act* (the "Act") by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, implement specific procedural and substantive provisions related to **child support obligations** in provincial jurisdictions. They are designed to clarify and operationalize key timelines and calculations for when child support becomes enforceable, how recalculation of support is triggered, and the timeframes within which legal action can be taken.

The regulations are **not standalone legislation** but rather a set of administrative rules that interpret and apply provisions of the *Divorce Act*, particularly those concerning child support obligations, liability, and enforcement.

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### **1. Liability for Child Support (Subsection 25.01(4) of the Divorce Act)**

> *"A spouse becomes liable to pay the amount of child support 31 days after the day on which they were notified of the decision in accordance with the law of the province."*

- **Purpose**: This provision establishes the **effective date of liability** for child support payments.
- **Mechanism**: Once a court or family law authority issues a decision (e.g., a child support order), the spouse who is responsible for paying child support is **legally obligated to begin making payments 31 days after receiving notification** of that decision.
- **Key Point**: The 31-day delay is a **practical administrative measure** to allow time for spouses to review the decision, possibly seek appeal, or understand their obligations before payment begins.
- **Jurisdictional Basis**: The notification is governed by the laws of the province in which the decision is made.

> ⚠️ *Note*: This applies only to the initial determination of child support under subsection 25.01(4).

#### **2. Time Limit to Apply to Court for an Order (Subsection 25.01(5) of the Act)**

> *"The prescribed period for applying to a court for an order is 30 days after the day on which both spouses were notified of the decision in accordance with the law of the province."*

- **Purpose**: This sets a **strict deadline** for any spouse who disagrees with the child support decision to initiate legal proceedings in court to challenge or modify the order.
- **Mechanism**: If a spouse wishes to appeal or request a court review of the child support amount or decision, they must file an application **within 30 days** of being notified by both spouses (i.e., both parties receive the decision).
- **Implication**: This creates a **time-sensitive procedural right**, ensuring that disputes are resolved promptly and preventing indefinite delays in enforcement or review.
- **Significance**: It balances fairness with efficiency—providing a clear window for legal recourse while preventing prolonged uncertainty.

#### **3. Deemed Income for Recalculation of Child Support (Subsection 25.1(1.2) of the Act)**

> *"The deemed income is the income used to determine the amount of the last child support order plus:*
> - *10% of that income, if fewer than two years have elapsed since that order;*
> - *15% of that income, if two years or more but fewer than five years have elapsed since that order;*
> - *20% of that income, if five years or more but fewer than 10 years have elapsed since that order; or*
> - *30% of that income, if 10 years or more have elapsed since that order."*

- **Purpose**: This provision establishes a **method for recalculating child support amounts** when there is a change in circumstances—particularly when one or both parents’ incomes have changed significantly over time.
- **Mechanism**:
  - The "deemed income" is not the actual income but a **hypothetical or adjusted income** used to recalculate the support obligation.
  - It is based on the **original income used in the last child support order**, adjusted upward by a percentage depending on how long ago that order was issued.
- **Rationale**:
  - The adjustment accounts for **inflation, changes in economic conditions, and the natural progression of time**.
  - It prevents support from being set too low after a long period due to the passage of time and inflation.
  - It ensures that child support remains **proportional and fair** over time, even if the original income figures are no longer current.
- **Example**:
  - If a child support order was issued 3 years ago based on a parent's income of $60,000, the deemed income would be:
    - $60,000 + (15% of $60,000) = $69,000
    - This $69,000 is then used to recalculate the new support amount.

> ✅ This rule is critical in ensuring that child support obligations are **adjusted for time and economic change**, rather than remaining static.

#### **4. Liability for Recalculated Child Support (Subsection 25.1(3) of the Act)**

> *"A spouse becomes liable to pay the recalculated amount 31 days after the day on which they were notified of the recalculated amount in accordance with the law of the province."*

- **Purpose**: To define when the **new child support obligation takes effect** after a recalculation.
- **Mechanism**: After a court or authority determines a new support amount (e.g., due to a change in income or time), the spouse responsible for payment becomes **legally liable 31 days after being notified** of the recalculated amount.
- **Consistency**: This mirrors the timeline for the initial order (31 days), reinforcing a **predictable and uniform process** for both initial and revised support obligations.

---

#### **5. Time Limit to Apply to Court for a Recalculated Order (Subsection 25.1(4) of the Act)**

> *"The prescribed period for applying to a court for an order is 30 days after the day on which both spouses were notified of the recalculated amount in accordance with the law of the province."*

- **Purpose**: To establish a **time limit for challenging a recalculated child support amount**.
- **Mechanism**: If a spouse believes the recalculated amount is incorrect or unfair, they must file a court application within **30 days** of being notified of the new amount.
- **Importance**: This ensures **timely resolution** of disputes over recalculated support and prevents prolonged uncertainty or potential abuse of the system.

> ⚠️ This is **parallel to the original 30-day rule** for initial orders—ensuring procedural consistency.

### **Effective Date and Registration Provisions**

> *"These Regulations come into force on the day on which section 24 of An Act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act and the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act, chapter 16 of the Statutes of Canada, 2019, comes into force, but if they are registered after that day, they come into force on the day on which they are registered."*

- **Effective Date**: The regulations are activated when **Section 24 of the 2019 Statutes of Canada, Chapter 16** (the amending Act) comes into force.
- **Registration Delay**: If the regulations are **registered (published) after the effective date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.
- **Purpose**: This allows for a **smooth transition** and ensures that the regulations are not applied retroactively or prematurely.

> 🔍 As of March 1, 2021, these regulations were in force (see SI/2019-82), indicating that the effective date was finalized and implemented by that time.

|-------|-------------|
| **Predictability** | Clear timelines (30 and 31 days) ensure that both parties know when obligations begin and when legal action is possible. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Provincial Child Support Service Regulations** provide a **clear, consistent, and fair framework** for determining when child support becomes enforceable, how support amounts are recalculated over time, and when legal challenges can be initiated. By introducing a time-based adjustment mechanism (deemed income) and standardized timelines (30 and 31 days), the regulations enhance **accessibility, fairness, and administrative efficiency** in child support enforcement across Canadian provinces.

These rules are a critical component of the broader *Divorce Act* framework, ensuring that child support obligations remain **responsive to changing economic conditions** and **protect the financial well-being of children** while respecting the rights of parents.
