### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Chicken Anti-Dumping Regulations (SOR/2002-1)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Canadian Chicken Anti-Dumping Regulations**, published in *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on December 20, 2001 (SOR/2002-1), are a set of rules designed to prevent **dumping**—selling chicken at prices below fair market value—in interprovincial trade within Canada. These regulations were established under the **Farm Products Agencies Act (FPA Act)** and specifically through the authority granted to **Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC)**.

Key legal foundations include:

- **Chicken Farmers of Canada Proclamation (SOR/79-158; SOR/98-244)**  
  - The Governor in Council established Chicken Farmers of Canada under **subsection 16(1)b** of the FPA Act.  
  - This proclamation gives CFC a statutory role in managing and implementing a **marketing plan** for the Canadian chicken industry.

- **Section 7(1)(d) of the FPA Act**  
  - Grants the authority to make regulations of a "class" that are necessary for implementing a marketing plan.  
  - These regulations fall within this category because they relate directly to price controls and market stability in the chicken sector.

- **Section 2 of the Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order (C.R.C., c. 648)**  
  - Confirms that regulations under paragraph 7(1)(d) of the FPA Act are subject to review and approval by the **National Farm Products Council (NFPC)**.

- **Paragraph 22(1)(f) of the FPA Act**  
  - Provides the legal basis for Chicken Farmers of Canada to adopt regulations once approved by the NFPC.

#### **2. Approval Process**

The proposed regulations were:

- Submitted to the **National Farm Products Council (NFPC)** under **paragraph 22(1)(f)** of the FPA Act.
- Reviewed and **approved by the NFPC**, which determined that the regulations were necessary for the successful implementation of Chicken Farmers of Canada’s authorized marketing plan.

This approval step ensures that the regulations are not arbitrary or contrary to broader industry interests and align with the goals of price stability and fair competition.

#### **3. Core Provisions of the Regulations**

The regulations prohibit **dumping** of chicken in interprovincial trade (non-export) under the following conditions:

> **No person may sell chicken in a province other than the province of production at a price that is less than:**
> 
> 1. The price charged at or about the same time by the trade for similar sales of chicken of an equivalent variety, class, or grade in the **province where the chicken is produced**, **plus**
> 2. Any **reasonable transportation charges** required to ship the chicken to the place of sale.

##### **Key Elements:**
- **Scope**: Applies only to **interprovincial trade** (not export).
- **Exclusions**: Does **not apply** when chicken is shipped from a non-signatory territory to a signatory province.
- **Definition of "Dumping"**: Selling below "fair market value" — defined as the price charged in the **province of origin** for similar chicken products.
- **Similarity Criteria**: Chicken must be of the **same variety, class, or grade** to be considered comparable.
- **Price Benchmark**: The price must be compared to the **market price** in the province of origin, adjusted for **reasonable transportation costs**.

---

#### **4. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **prevent unfair competition** by protecting domestic producers from being undercut by cheaper chicken sold from other provinces.
- To **maintain stable prices** and ensure fair returns for Canadian chicken farmers.
- To support the **implementation of a marketing plan** by ensuring that chicken prices reflect true market conditions in the region of origin.
- To promote **market integrity** and prevent price distortion that could harm the long-term viability of the Canadian chicken industry.

---

#### **5. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations came into force on the day of registration in the Canada Gazette (December 20, 2001).
- **Enforcement**: The rules are enforceable by provincial authorities and regulatory bodies, with penalties for violations (though specific penalties are not detailed in the text provided).

---

#### **6. Repeal and Current Status**

- **Repealed**: These regulations were **repealed** on **April 28, 2015**, by **SOR/2015-230, section 1**.
- **Reason for Repeal**: The repeal reflects a shift in policy or regulatory framework, likely due to changes in market dynamics, trade agreements, or the introduction of new regulations (e.g., under the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement or other trade modernization efforts).
- **Current Status**: **No longer in force** as of April 28, 2015.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: While these regulations were historically significant in protecting Canadian chicken producers, they are **no longer active**. Their repeal indicates that current policy may rely on different mechanisms—such as price monitoring, trade agreements, or industry self-regulation—to manage market competition.

### **Conclusion**

The **Canadian Chicken Anti-Dumping Regulations (SOR/2002-1)** were a targeted regulatory measure designed to protect Canadian chicken producers from price dumping in interprovincial markets. They operated under a clear legal framework established by the Farm Products Agencies Act and were approved by the National Farm Products Council as essential to implementing a national marketing plan.

However, the regulations were **repealed in 2015**, indicating a policy shift toward a more flexible or market-driven approach to price and competition in the chicken sector. As such, while historically significant, they are **no longer in effect** and should not be applied in current regulatory practice.

> 🔍 **Recommendation for Users**: When assessing current chicken market policies, consult more recent regulations or industry reports, as the anti-dumping rules from 2001–2015 are obsolete. Current oversight may involve different mechanisms such as voluntary pricing agreements, export controls, or industry standards.
