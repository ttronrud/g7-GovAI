**Detailed Summary of the Fishery (General) Regulations, 1993 (C.R.C., c. 814)**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

The *Fishery (General) Regulations, 1993* (C.R.C., c. 814) were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, under specific provisions of the *Fisheries Act* — namely **sections 8, 43*, 79.7**, and **subsection 87(2)**.

These regulations **repeal and replace** two earlier sets of rules:
- *Fishways Obstructions Removal Regulations, C.R.C., c. 814*
- *Penalties and Forfeitures Proceeds Regulations, C.R.C., c. 827*

They are effective **February 24, 1993**, and serve as a **comprehensive, unified regulatory framework** governing fishing activities, fish habitat protection, and the enforcement of penalties and forfeiture proceeds in Canadian fisheries.

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To establish **uniform standards** for fishing and fish habitat protection across Canada.
- To ensure **conservation and sustainable management** of fish stocks.
- To provide **clear administrative procedures** for licensing, vessel registration, document compliance, and enforcement.
- To allow **flexibility in management** through the ability to vary fishing conditions in response to ecological, economic, or operational needs.
