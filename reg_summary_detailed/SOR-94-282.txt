**Detailed Summary of the Ocean Data and Services Fees Order, 1993**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**
The *Ocean Data and Services Fees Order, 1993* (cited as SI/88-41, 1988 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 2010) was issued by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** under the authority of **Order in Council P.C. 1988-440**, dated March 10, 1988. This Order establishes a formal framework for charging fees to individuals or organizations that request or receive specific **ocean data, analyses, and related services** from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO).

Although the Order was issued in 1988, it was formally published and came into force on **April 13, 1994**, and is cited as the *Ocean Data and Services Fees Order, 1993*, likely due to a typographical or administrative correction in the publication date or citation.

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to:
- Ensure that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans can **sustainably provide oceanographic data and services**.
- Establish a **transparent, standardized fee structure** for access to ocean data and services.
- Provide a mechanism for **reimbursement of operational costs** associated with data processing, analysis, and service delivery.

The fees are not intended to restrict access to essential data but rather to cover the **costs of production, processing, and delivery** of such services.

---

### **Key Definitions**
The Order includes two key definitions used throughout:
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Refers to computer processing resources used in data analysis or processing.
- **TWL (Tides and Water Levels):** Refers to data related to tidal patterns and water level measurements.

These definitions are used to categorize and identify specific data or services subject to fees.

---

### **Fee Structure and Application**

The Order divides fees into three main categories based on the type of service provided. Each category applies to different types of data or services and is governed by specific provisions.

---

#### **1. Fees for Ocean Data or Analyses (Part I of the Schedule)**
- **Applicable when:** DFO provides a person with **ocean data or analyses** listed in **Column I** of an item in *Part I* of the Schedule.
- **Fee requirement:** The recipient must pay:
  - The fee specified in **Column II** (base fee).
  - The fee specified in **Column III** (additional fee, if applicable).
- **Additional note:** These fees are in addition to any fees required under subsection (3) of the Order (which may relate to other charges, such as access fees or administrative costs).

> **Example:** If a user requests a specific tidal analysis or water temperature dataset, they must pay both the base fee and an additional fee depending on the volume or complexity of the data.

---

#### **2. Fees for Services Required to Provide Data Not Listed in Part I (Part II of the Schedule)**
- **Applicable when:** DFO provides a **service** (not a direct data product) listed in **Column I** of an item in *Part II* of the Schedule.
- **Purpose of the service:** The service is necessary to generate **data or analyses not directly available** in Part I (e.g., custom processing, modeling, or interpretation).
- **Fee requirement:** The recipient must pay only the fee specified in **Column II** of that item.
- **Note:** This fee is also in addition to any fees required under subsection (3).

> **Example:** A user requests a custom hydrodynamic model to simulate water flow in a specific region. The DFO provides the modeling service, and the user pays the fee set out in the relevant Part II item.

---

#### **3. Fees for Processing or Materials (Part III of the Schedule)**
- **Applicable when:** DFO provides a person with **processing or materials** listed in **Column I** of an item in *Part III* of the Schedule.
- **Purpose:** These are associated with the **technical processing** of data (e.g., software use, computational resources, or physical materials like maps or printouts).
- **Fee requirement:** The recipient must pay the fee specified in **Column II** of that item.
- **Note:** This fee is in addition to any fees required under subsection (1) or (2).

> **Example:** A user requests a processed dataset that requires CPU time or specialized software. The fee for CPU usage is charged under this category.

---

### **Key Principles and Features**
1. **Tiered and Transparent Fees:** The fee structure is clearly laid out in a schedule with columns specifying the type of service, base fee, and additional fees where applicable.
2. **Cost Recovery:** Fees are designed to cover the actual cost of data processing, analysis, and service delivery, ensuring financial sustainability for DFO.
3. **Non-Exclusive Access:** The Order does not restrict access to data or services—only establishes a fee structure for their provision.
4. **Add-On Fees:** Fees are cumulative, meaning users may pay multiple fees depending on the nature and complexity of the request.
5. **Clarity and Accountability:** The use of defined terms (CPU, TWL) and structured schedule items ensures clarity and consistency in fee application.

---

### **Jurisdiction and Enforcement**
- The fees are collected by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**.
- The Order applies to **any person** (individuals, businesses, government agencies) who requests or receives ocean data or services from DFO.
- Enforcement is likely handled through standard administrative procedures, including billing and dispute resolution processes.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**
- The Order does **not apply to publicly available, non-processed data** that is freely accessible without charge.
- It does **not cover basic or routine services** unless explicitly listed in the schedule.
- Fees are not retroactive and apply only to services provided after the Order comes into force.

---

### **Significance and Impact**
- This regulation helps DFO maintain a **professional and financially viable data service infrastructure**.
- It ensures that users are **accountable for the cost of specialized services**, which promotes responsible use of oceanographic data.
- It supports **research, environmental monitoring, maritime operations, and policy development** by providing a clear, predictable cost model.

### **Conclusion**
The *Ocean Data and Services Fees Order, 1993* is a foundational regulatory instrument that governs how the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans charges for oceanographic data and services. By clearly defining categories of data, services, and processing, and linking each to a specific fee structure, the Order ensures transparency, cost recovery, and operational sustainability. It remains a key reference for users seeking access to DFO’s oceanographic resources, particularly in scientific, commercial, or governmental contexts.

> **Note:** While the Order was issued in 1988 and published in 1994, it may have been updated or superseded by later regulations. Users should verify current applicability through official DFO publications or updated schedules.
