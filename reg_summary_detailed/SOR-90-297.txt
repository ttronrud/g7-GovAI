**Detailed Summary of the Indian Band Revenue Moneys Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

The **Indian Band Revenue Moneys Order** is issued under **subsection 69(1) of the *Indian Act***, which grants the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) the authority to regulate the **control, management, and expenditure of revenue moneys** received by First Nations.

This Order is a formal legislative instrument that establishes a legal framework allowing certain **First Nations bands** to **exercise full control, manage, and spend their own revenue moneys**—a significant step toward self-determination and financial autonomy.

The Order may be cited as:  
**The Indian Band Revenue Moneys Order**

### **2. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Empower First Nations** to manage their own financial resources directly.
- **Remove restrictions** that previously limited the ability of some bands to control and use revenue generated from land, resources, or other sources.
- Promote **financial sovereignty**, transparency, and accountability in how First Nations use their funds.
- Support **economic development**, community investment, and long-term sustainability.

By permitting bands to control their revenue moneys, the Order recognizes the **distinct governance and economic needs** of First Nations and aligns with broader federal policies promoting Indigenous self-governance and self-reliance.

### **3. Scope of the Order**

The Order specifically **permits the following First Nations bands** to:

- **Control** their revenue moneys (i.e., decide how funds are held and allocated),
- **Manage** these funds (i.e., administer financial operations, budgeting, accounting),
- **Expend** the funds as they see fit (i.e., for community programs, infrastructure, services, or development projects).

This includes all revenue generated from:
- Land leases
- Resource development (e.g., forestry, mining, agriculture)
- Government grants or transfers
- Sales or royalties from natural resources
