**Regulatory Instrument:**  
*Order Approving the Re-application and Exclusion of Certain Provisions of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Section 20 of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA)  
**Citation:**  
S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 12 and 13; SOR/84-181  
**Issued by:**

### **Background and Context**

This regulation addresses the application of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to specific positions within the **Office of the Governor-General’s Secretary (GGS)**. The PSEA generally governs employment conditions, terms, and practices for public servants across Canada. However, certain positions are traditionally excluded from its full scope under specific orders approved by the Governor in Council.

The regulation arises from a decision by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)**, which concluded—after consultation with the employer—that it would be **neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service** to apply certain provisions of the PSEA to the positions designated by **position numbers GGS-S-910 to GGS-S-920** in the Office of the Governor-General’s Secretary.

This decision was made in accordance with **subsection 20(2)** of the PSEA, which requires consultation with the employer before excluding positions from the Act’s application.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Re-application of the PSEA to Excluded Positions**  
   - The regulation **re-applies** the provisions of the PSEA to the positions previously excluded under the *Office of the Governor-General’s Secretary Exclusion Approval Order* (SOR/84-181).  
   - This re-application is **subject to the approval of the Governor in Council**, which has now been granted.  
   - This means that, in general, the full scope of the PSEA applies to these positions, restoring the standard employment protections and governance mechanisms.

2. **Exclusion of Specific Provisions from the PSEA**  
   - Despite the re-application, the PSC has determined that **certain provisions of the PSEA should not apply** to the positions GGS-S-910 to GGS-S-920.  
   - These positions are **excluded from the application of the PSEA**, **except for specific sections** listed below:  
     - Sections **17, 18, 19** (relating to employment terms, conditions, and public service values)  
     - Section **54** (on disciplinary procedures)  
     - Section **68** (on appeals)  
     - Section **69** (on termination and dismissal)  
     - Sections **111 to 122** (covering matters such as employment equity, workplace health and safety, and certain administrative procedures)  
   - This exclusion is made **pursuant to subsection 20(1)** of the PSEA and is subject to **Governor in Council approval**, which has now been granted.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary rationale for this exclusion is **practicality and institutional necessity**:

- The positions designated GGS-S-910 to GGS-S-920 are part of a **highly sensitive, confidential, and politically sensitive office** within the Governor-General’s Secretariat.  
- These roles involve **direct support to the Governor-General**, including confidential communications, protocol, and sensitive administrative functions.  
- Applying the full breadth of the PSEA—particularly those related to collective bargaining, grievance procedures, and public service-wide employment standards—could interfere with the **operational independence, confidentiality, and discretion** required in this office.  
- The PSC concluded that the **core values of public service integrity and accountability** are still upheld through the retained provisions (e.g., sections 17, 18, 19, 54, 68, 69, and 111–122), which cover key employment rights and protections.

### **Legal and Procedural Framework**

- **Section 20 of the PSEA** empowers the Public Service Commission to determine whether certain positions should be excluded from the Act’s application, subject to consultation with the employer and approval by the Governor in Council.  
- The **consultation process** with the employer (the Office of the Governor-General’s Secretary) was conducted and found to support the exclusion.  
- The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**, has formally approved the decision.  
- This approval ensures that the exclusion is not only procedurally valid but also politically and institutionally justified.

### **Scope and Application**

- **Applicable Positions:**  
  Only the positions with the following **position numbers** are affected:  
  **GGS-S-910 to GGS-S-920**  
- **Applicable Personnel:**  
  All individuals currently holding or who may hold these positions are subject to the exclusion (with the specified exceptions).  
- **Effective Date:**  
  The regulation takes effect upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and is binding on all public servants in the affected positions.

### **Implications**

- **Limited Employment Protections:**  
  The excluded positions are not subject to the full range of employment rights and procedures under the PSEA, such as collective bargaining, grievance processes, or certain termination rules.  
- **Retained Protections:**  
  Key protections—such as fair treatment in disciplinary actions (section 54), appeal rights (section 68), and termination fairness (section 69)—remain in place, ensuring that employees are not left without basic safeguards.  
- **Institutional Autonomy:**  
  The Office of the Governor-General’s Secretary retains operational flexibility and discretion, which is essential for fulfilling its unique constitutional and ceremonial duties.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **balanced and narrowly tailored exception** to the general application of the Public Service Employment Act. It reflects a careful assessment of institutional needs, confidentiality requirements, and public service effectiveness. By excluding only specific positions from the Act—while preserving essential protections—the regulation ensures that the core principles of fairness, accountability, and public service integrity are maintained, while allowing the Governor-General’s office to function with the necessary discretion and independence.

---

**In essence:**  
This regulation **restores the PSEA’s general application** to positions in the Office of the Governor-General’s Secretary, **but excludes those positions from certain employment provisions**—preserving essential rights and protections while allowing operational flexibility in a sensitive governmental role.
