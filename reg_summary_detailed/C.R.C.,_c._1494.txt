**Detailed Summary of the Tackle Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The **Tackle Regulations**, formally titled *"The Tackle Regulations"* and cited as such, are a set of safety regulations under the **Canada Shipping Act** (Act), designed to ensure the safety of workers and the integrity of cargo-handling operations during loading, unloading, and handling of cargo, bunker coal, ship’s stores, and ship/cargo fittings. These regulations apply specifically to **ship-to-shore operations** and related activities, emphasizing the safety of personnel, equipment, and structural components involved in the processes.

The regulations are administered by the **Board of Steamship Inspection (Board)**, which is established under Part VIII of the Canada Shipping Act. The Board has the authority to approve gear, prescribe safety standards, and issue exemptions when appropriate.
