### **Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes the **conditions under which the federal government may authorize the deposition (intentional release or placement) of deleterious substances into aquatic environments**, specifically under **subsection 36(5.2)** of the *Fisheries Act*. It outlines the **specific criteria and safeguards** that must be met when such deposits are permitted—whether for **aquaculture, pest control, aquatic invasive species management, or research activities**—to ensure the **protection of fish populations, fish habitats, and human use of fish resources**.

---

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Fisheries Act*, which provides the legal framework for the regulation of fish and aquatic resources.

2. **Biochemical Oxygen-Demanding Matter (BOD)**  
   Any organic material that consumes dissolved oxygen in water or sediment, potentially leading to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and harm to aquatic life.

3. **Procedure for pH Stabilization EPS 1/RM/50**  
   A standardized testing procedure developed by the Department of the Environment (now Environment and Climate Change Canada) to stabilize pH levels during acute lethality tests of wastewater effluents on rainbow trout. It is used to ensure consistent and reliable results in toxicity testing.

4. **Reference Method EPS 1/RM/13**  
   The official biological test method for determining the acute lethality of effluents to rainbow trout (second edition, December 2000, with May 2007 amendments). This method is the benchmark for assessing whether a substance is acutely lethal.

5. **Research Activities**  
   Activities involving the intentional deposition of a deleterious substance **solely for the purpose of acquiring scientific knowledge**.

---

## **Acute Lethality Definition**

A substance is considered **"acutely lethal"** if, at 100% concentration:
- It kills **more than 50% of rainbow trout** over a **96-hour period** when tested using:
  - The **Reference Method EPS 1/RM/13**, and
  - If applicable, in conjunction with the **pH Stabilization Procedure EPS 1/RM/50**.

This threshold is critical in determining whether a substance poses a significant risk to aquatic life and thus requires stricter regulatory oversight.

---

## **Conditions for Authorization by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFoD)**

The MFoD may authorize deposits of deleterious substances in the following contexts **only if**:

1. **Justification for Management/Conservation**  
   The Minister is satisfied that the regulations are necessary for:
   - Proper management and control of fisheries, or  
   - Conservation and protection of fish.

2. **Eligibility of the Deleterious Substance**  
   The substance must fall into one of these categories:
   - A **drug** that is:
     - Permitted or authorized for sale or import under the *Food and Drugs Act*, or
     - Not prohibited under that Act.
   - A **pest control product** that is:
     - Registered under the *Pest Control Products Act*, or
     - Authorized for use under that Act.
   - **Biochemical oxygen-demanding matter (BOD)**.

> ⚠️ Note: This authorization is limited to **aquaculture, pest control, or invasive species management**.

## **Conditions for Authorization by the Minister of the Environment (MOE) – Research Activities**

The MOE may authorize the deposition of deleterious substances for **research purposes**, provided that the authorized entities have **in place or are subject to processes** that ensure:

### 1. **Scientific Contribution**
   - The research must contribute to the development of knowledge for:
     - Managing, conserving, protecting, or restoring fish populations or fish habitats.

### 2. **Supervision by Qualified Personnel**
   - Research must be conducted under the supervision of a person with **expertise in aquatic research**.
   - Evidence of such expertise must include a **substantial and relevant peer-reviewed publication record**.

### 3. **Minimal Harm to Fish and Habitats**
   - The research design must:
     - **Avoid harmful effects** on fish, fish habitat, and human use of fish—**except** for effects necessary to achieve scientifically valid results.
     - **Confine any unavoidable harmful effects** strictly to the waters where the deposit is authorized.

### 4. **Environmental Recovery Timeline**
   - If the research renders any waters or fish populations **unsuitable** for sustaining fish populations or for human consumption:
     - The waters and fish populations must be **restored to suitability within 20 years** of the completion of the research.

### 5. **Monitoring and Compliance**
   - The research must be:
     - **Regularly evaluated** to ensure it is carried out as designed.
     - **Documented** any deviations from the original plan.
     - **Findings must be made publicly available**.

> ✅ This ensures transparency, accountability, and environmental responsibility in research.

## **Conditions for Authorization by the Minister of the Environment – Other Subject Matters**

For **non-research activities** (e.g., industrial or commercial operations), the MOE may authorize a deposit **only if**:

1. **Legal Authorization Exists**  
   The substance, its deposit, or the activity resulting in the deposit is:
   - Authorized under **federal or provincial law**, or
   - Subject to **government guidelines** issued by federal or provincial authorities.
   - And is **subject to an enforcement or compliance regime** (i.e., there are mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance).

2. **Compliance with Water Quality Guidelines**  
   The deposit must:
   - Not exceed the levels of deleterious substance that would result in **acute lethality**.
   - Meet the **Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life (1999)** as amended, or:
     - Site-specific applications derived from those guidelines (as amended), or
     - Peer-reviewed guidelines adopted by a federal or provincial body for protecting aquatic life.

3. **Scientific Evaluation of Environmental Effects**  
   The potential impacts of the deposit on:
   - Fish,
   - Fish habitat, and
   - Human use of fish  
   must have been evaluated using **generally accepted standards of good scientific practice**.

> 📌 This ensures that even non-research activities are subject to robust environmental risk assessment.

## **General Administrative Requirements**

To be valid, these regulations must meet the following procedural requirements:

1. **Public Notice Requirement**  
   - The proposed regulations must be **published in the Canada Gazette at least 30 days before they are made**.  
   → This provides public notice and an opportunity for stakeholder feedback.

2. **Cost Estimation Requirement**  
   - Before publication, the relevant Minister (MFoD or MOE) must provide the **President of the Treasury Board with an estimate of the implementation costs**.  
   → Ensures transparency and fiscal accountability.
