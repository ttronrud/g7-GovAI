**Detailed Summary of the *Carriages and Strollers Regulations* (S.C. 2016, c. 9, s. 67; S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Carriages and Strollers Regulations* are a set of safety standards established under **section 37a of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. These regulations aim to ensure that carriages (also known as "baby carriers" or "landaus") and strollers (also known as "poussettes") are safe for children by setting strict requirements related to:

- Structural safety and performance standards  
- Chemical composition of materials  
- Labeling and user information  
- Prohibitions on hazardous substances  
- Instructions for safe use and handling  

These regulations were introduced to align Canadian product safety standards with internationally recognized benchmarks such as **ASTM F833** and **ISO 31110**, while also addressing specific risks associated with children’s products.

---

## **Key Definitions**

The regulations begin with a list of key definitions used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **ASTM F833** | Standard for consumer safety performance of carriages and strollers, published by ASTM International, as amended from time to time. |
| **Carriage** | A wheeled vehicle designed to transport a child in a reclined or horizontal position; includes devices that can be converted to function as a carriage. |
| **Stroller** | A wheeled vehicle designed to transport a child in a seated position; includes devices convertible to strollers. |
| **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)** | Practices aligned with OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17), ensuring scientific integrity in testing. |
| **Good Scientific Practices (GSP)** | For test data: compliance with OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals; for lab practices: GLP. |
| **ISO 31110** | International standard for pushchairs and prams, covering requirements and test methods. |
| **LC50** | Concentration of a substance in air that causes death of at least 50% of animals after inhalation over a specified time. |
| **LD50** | Single dose of a substance that causes death of at least 50% of animals via a defined route (e.g., oral, dermal). |

---

## **Safety Compliance Requirements**

Carriages and strollers must meet **one of the following two sets of requirements**:

### **Option 1: ASTM F833 Standards (with exceptions)**
- Must comply with **all requirements of ASTM F833**, **except**:
  - Sections 5.3, 5.12, 8, and 9 (which relate to specific performance tests or features deemed less critical).

### **Option 2: Hybrid Standard (ASTM F833 + ISO 31110)**
- Must meet:
  - Sections **6.8 and 6.10 of ASTM F833** (specifically related to structural stability and safety features)
  - All requirements of **ISO 31110**, **except**:
    - Sections 6, 7, and 10 (which pertain to certain testing or design aspects considered non-essential or redundant).

> This dual-pathway approach allows manufacturers flexibility in choosing between widely recognized international standards, with a focus on ensuring equivalent safety outcomes.

---

## **Transition Periods for New Standards**

To avoid disrupting the market when updated standards are introduced, the regulations provide **transition periods**:

| Scenario | Duration |
|--------|---------|
| **Manufacture or import** of a carriage or stroller | 180 days after publication of a new version of ASTM F833 or ISO 31110 |
| **Advertising or sale** of a carriage or stroller | 365 days after publication of a new version of the applicable standard |

> During these periods, products compliant with the **previous version** of the standard remain legally acceptable.

---

## **Prohibited Toxic Substances**

Carriages and strollers must **not contain** any of the following substances if they could become accessible to a child or be released upon breakage or leakage:

| Substance | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Carbon tetrachloride or any compound containing it | Prohibited |
| Any substance with >10 mg methyl alcohol per gram | Prohibited |
| Any substance with >100 mg petroleum distillates per gram | Prohibited |
| Benzene | Prohibited |
| Any substance with >100 mg turpentine per gram | Prohibited |
| Boric acid or salts of boric acid | Prohibited |
| Ethyl ether | Prohibited |

> These restrictions are based on known toxicological risks to infants and young children, especially regarding inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption.

---

## **Toxicity Limits for Substances in Use**

If a carriage or stroller contains a toxic substance, **at least one** of the following must be met:

1. **Inaccessibility**: The substance cannot be ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin due to the product’s design, form, size, or physical characteristics.

2. **Quantity Limit**:  
   For a child weighing **10 kg**, the total quantity of the substance must not exceed the **lesser of**:
   - 1% of the **oral LD50** (determined using good scientific practices)
   - 1% of the **dermal LD50** (determined using good scientific practices)

3. **Toxicity Threshold**:  
   The substance must not exceed the toxicity limits specified in **Schedule 1** of the regulations (which includes specific thresholds for various chemicals based on LD50 values).

> These limits are based on risk assessment principles to ensure that even if exposure occurs, it remains below harmful levels.

---

## **Lead, Mercury, and Heavy Metal Restrictions**

For **removable stickers, films, or surface coatings** on accessible parts of the product:

- **Lead**: ≤ 90 mg/kg total lead  
- **Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Selenium, Barium**: If more than 1000 mg/kg migrates from the material, it is prohibited  
- **Mercury**: ≤ 10 mg/kg total mercury  

> Testing must follow **good laboratory practices (GLP)** to ensure accuracy and reliability.

---

## **Phthalate Restrictions in Vinyl Materials**

Vinyl components (e.g., plastic parts) are subject to strict limits on phthalate plasticizers:

| Phthalate Type | Maximum Limit |
|---------------|---------------|
| **DEHP, DBP, BBP** | ≤ 1000 mg/kg in any vinyl part |
| **DINP, DIDP, DNOP** | ≤ 1000 mg/kg **only in parts that can reasonably be placed in a child’s mouth** (under 4 years old) |

> **Exception**: A part is considered "accessible to a child's mouth" if:
> - It can be brought to the child’s mouth and kept there for sucking or chewing  
> - One of its dimensions is less than **5 cm**

> For **inflatable parts**, dimensions are measured in the **deflated state**.

### **Font Requirements**
- **Sans-serif typeface** (not compressed, expanded, or decorative)
- **Large x-height** (relative to ascenders/descenders) — as illustrated in **Schedule 2**
- **Minimum height of 2.5 mm** (measured from upper-case or lower-case letters with ascenders or descenders, e.g., "b" or "p")

> The font must ensure **high readability**, especially for parents and caregivers.

### **Signal Words**
- "WARNING" and "MISE EN GARDE" must be in **uppercase letters**
