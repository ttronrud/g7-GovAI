**Detailed Summary of the Computer Generated Mailing List Remission Order**

**Order Title:**  
*Computer Generated Mailing List Remission Order*

**Purpose:**  
This regulatory order establishes a remission (i.e., a refund or cancellation) of certain taxes imposed on specific goods—specifically, computer-generated mailing lists—imported during a defined period. The remission applies to both customs duties and sales taxes, and it is designed to correct or offset tax liabilities that were calculated based on an incorrect valuation method.

**1. Scope of Remission – Customs Duty:**

- **Goods Covered:** Computer-generated mailing lists.
- **Time Period:** Commences on **February 14, 1972**, and ends on **June 30, 1985**.
- **Remission Granted:** A full remission (refund) of the **customs duty** that was originally paid or is otherwise payable under **Schedule A to the Customs Tariff** for these goods during the specified period.

> *Explanation:* This means that any customs duty assessed on computer-generated mailing lists imported between February 14, 1972, and June 30, 1985, is being formally waived or refunded. This is likely due to a determination that the original duty assessment was based on an inaccurate or outdated valuation method, or that the nature of the goods (as computer-generated data) warranted a different treatment under tariff rules.

**2. Scope of Remission – Sales Tax:**

- **Goods Covered:** Same computer-generated mailing lists referred to in Section 2 of the regulation.
- **Tax Type:** Sales tax under the **Excise Tax Act**.
- **Remission Amount:** The difference between two calculated sales tax amounts:
  - **Sales tax calculated on the "duty-paid value" of the goods**, and  
  - **Sales tax calculated on the "value for duty" of the goods**.

> *Explanation:*  
This provision is particularly significant because it addresses a valuation discrepancy. In tax calculations, the "value for duty" typically refers to the value used to determine customs duty (e.g., the transaction value or market value), while the "duty-paid value" may refer to the value used to determine the sales tax (which may be based on a different valuation or accounting method).

- The remission is **only equal to the difference** between these two values.  
- This implies that if the sales tax calculated on the duty-paid value was higher than the tax calculated on the value for duty, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of the difference.  
- Conversely, if the tax on the duty-paid value was lower, no remission is granted—though the regulation implies the intent is to correct overpayment.

> *Practical Implication:* This adjustment ensures that taxpayers are not taxed at a higher rate due to a misapplication of valuation standards between customs duty and sales tax. It corrects a potential inconsistency in the tax treatment of the same goods under different tax regimes.

**Key Legal and Regulatory Context:**

- The Order is issued under authority to correct tax assessments that were based on erroneous or inconsistent valuation methods.
- The use of "computer-generated mailing lists" as a distinct category suggests that these were treated as data or information products, which may have been subject to unique classification or valuation rules at the time.
- The remission reflects a policy decision to rectify past tax obligations due to a change in understanding or application of valuation principles.

**Significance of the Order:**

- **Corrects Historical Tax Errors:** Addresses a long-standing issue where the valuation of computer-generated data products led to overpayment of both customs duty and sales tax.
- **Promotes Fairness and Accuracy:** Ensures that the sales tax is not applied at a higher rate than it should be due to a mismatch in valuation methods.
- **Provides Relief to Importers/Consumers:** Offers a financial remission to entities that imported these mailing lists during the specified period, reducing their overall tax burden.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Computer Generated Mailing List Remission Order* grants a formal refund of customs duties and a partial refund of sales taxes for computer-generated mailing lists imported between February 14, 1972, and June 30, 1985. The sales tax remission is limited to the difference between tax calculated on the duty-paid value and tax calculated on the value for duty, ensuring that tax liabilities are aligned with accurate and consistent valuation principles. This order serves as a corrective measure to ensure fair and equitable tax treatment of information-based goods in the past.
