**Detailed Summary of the Wrigley Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption**
The *Wrigley Airport Zoning Regulations* are formally enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically:
- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in a local newspaper (The News of the North) to provide public notice and a reasonable opportunity for public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt proposed regulations after public consultation.

These regulations were:
- Published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **June 24 and July 1, 1995**,
- Published in two successive issues of *The News of the North* on **June 19 and June 26, 1995**.

This process ensured that stakeholders—including landowners, local communities, and aviation authorities—had sufficient time to submit representations or objections before the final adoption.

### **2. Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled:
> **Wrigley Airport Zoning Regulations**  
> May be cited as: *Wrigley Airport Zoning Regulations*

They are incorporated into the *Statutes of Canada*, specifically:
- *R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1*  
- *S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10*

### **3. Definitions and Key Terms**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Wrigley Airport, located in the vicinity of Wrigley, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the runway used as a reference for measuring elevations and spatial boundaries. Located on the centerline of runway 10-28, 533.4 meters from the threshold of runway 10. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 10-28). These surfaces define safe zones for aircraft during landing approaches. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the elevation of the ARP. However, if this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is instead set at 9 meters above ground to prevent impractical or unsafe conditions. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing zone, including the runway, designated for takeoff and landing in a particular direction. For runway 10-28, it is 90 meters wide (45 meters on each side) and 1,186.8 meters long. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 ratio (1 meter vertical to 7 meters horizontal), until they intersect with the outer surface. These surfaces provide a gradual transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

---

### **4. Elevation Reference**
- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point** is **146.6 meters above sea level**.
- All surface boundaries (approach, outer, transitional) are measured relative to this reference point.

---

### **5. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to **all land**, including:
- Public road allowances,
- Private properties,
- Any land adjacent to or in the vicinity of Wrigley Airport.

The **boundary of the affected land** is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the Airport Reference Point (ARP). This creates a zone of influence around the airport where development is strictly regulated.

---

### **6. Prohibited Development (Core Restriction)**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** (including natural growth) on land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

1. The **approach surfaces**  
2. The **outer surface**  
3. The **transitional surfaces**

This restriction ensures that:
- Aircraft can safely approach and land without interference from obstacles.
- Visual and navigational clarity is maintained during critical flight phases.

---

### **7. Natural Growth Provisions**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the height of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or lessee of the land to:
  - **Remove the excess growth**,
  - Or take other corrective actions as deemed necessary.

This provision protects aviation safety by preventing uncontrolled tree growth that could interfere with aircraft operations.

---

### **8. Regulatory Plan Reference**

All spatial and elevation boundaries are based on the **Wrigley Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3040**, dated **December 5, 1994**, which includes detailed maps and descriptions of:
- The airport reference point,
- The approach surfaces,
- The strip dimensions,
- The outer surface,
- The transitional surfaces,
- The 4,000-meter radius boundary.

This plan serves as the **technical foundation** for the zoning and height restrictions.

### **9. Key Design Features of the Surfaces**

#### **Approach Surfaces (Runway 10 and 28)**
- Each has an **inclined plane** with a **1:30 ratio** (1 meter vertical rise per 30 meters horizontal distance).
- Rises to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
  - 2,500 meters horizontally from the end of the runway,
  - 295 meters from the runway centerline,
  - At an elevation of **83.3 meters above the elevation at the runway end**.

> This ensures a safe buffer zone for aircraft during final approach, reducing the risk of collision with terrain or structures.

#### **Outer Surface**
- A flat plane at **45 meters above the ARP** (146.6 m = 191.6 m above sea level).
- **Exception**: If this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground, it is set at **9 meters above ground** to avoid impracticality.

> This defines the upper limit for all structures outside the immediate runway area.

#### **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical to 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **edges of the strip and approach surfaces** up to where they meet the outer surface.
- Provide a smooth, gradual transition from the runway area to the outer surface.

> These surfaces help prevent abrupt changes in terrain or structure height, improving flight safety.

### **10. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **ensure aviation safety** by minimizing obstacles near the airport.
- To **protect aircraft during takeoff and landing**, especially during critical approach phases.
- To **preserve visual and navigational clarity** for pilots.
- To **provide a clear, enforceable framework** for land use and development near the airport.

---

### **11. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Enforce the height restrictions,
  - Require removal of excess natural growth,
  - Issue directives or penalties where necessary.
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative and legal means, including inspections and compliance reviews.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Wrigley Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for land use and development around Wrigley Airport in the Northwest Territories. By defining strict height limits through approach, outer, and transitional surfaces, the regulations prioritize **aviation safety**, **operational efficiency**, and **public interest**. The rules are grounded in a detailed zoning plan and supported by a transparent public consultation process, ensuring both legal legitimacy and community accountability.

These regulations remain a critical component of Canada’s national aviation safety infrastructure, particularly in remote northern regions where airspace management is vital.
