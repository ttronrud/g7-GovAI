Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations* as enacted under the *Fisheries Act*, S.C. 2012, c. 19, ss. 149(2) to (4), and R.S., c. F-14.

## 📚 **Comprehensive Summary of the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations**

### 🔍 **Overview**
The *Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations* (AISR) are a federal regulatory framework established under the *Fisheries Act* to **prevent, control, and eradicate aquatic invasive species (AIS)** that threaten native fish populations, fish habitats, and the sustainable use of aquatic resources. These regulations are designed to protect Canada’s freshwater ecosystems by restricting the importation, possession, transport, and release of certain non-native species — particularly those known to be invasive or potentially harmful.

The regulations were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, pursuant to specific provisions of the *Fisheries Act* (subsections 34(2), 36(5), and 43(1)a and (2)b).

## 📌 Key Provisions and Structure

---

### 1. **Definitions and Scope**

#### Key Definitions:
- **Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS):**  
  Any species listed in **Part 2 or Part 3 of the Schedule** to these regulations. These are species that have been introduced outside their natural range and pose a threat to native fish, fish habitat, or the use of fish.

- **Indigenous (in respect of an aquatic species):**  
  A species that originated naturally in a particular region or body of water. This is used to determine whether an introduced species is a threat.

- **Common Name vs. Scientific Name:**  
  A reference to a species by its **common name** in the Schedule is interpreted as referring to its **scientific name** (listed in column 2). This ensures regulatory precision and avoids ambiguity.

- **Carrier / Conveyance or Structure:**  
  - *Carrier:* Any non-conveyance item (e.g., equipment, gear, soil) that hosts or facilitates the movement of an AIS.  
  - *Conveyance or Structure:* A vessel, boat, dock, or structure that transports or supports an AIS.

- **Biofouling:**  
  Accumulation of aquatic organisms (microorganisms, plants, animals) on submerged or exposed surfaces (e.g., hulls of boats).

- **Ballast Water and Sediments:**  
  Defined as per the *Ballast Water Regulations*, meaning water taken on board vessels for stability, which may carry AIS.

### 2. **Prohibited Activities (General Prohibitions)**

The following activities are **prohibited** for any person **unless authorized**:

| Activity | Where it Applies | Conditions |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Import** | Into the area specified in **column 4** of Part 2 of the Schedule | Only if the member is in a specific condition (if any) listed in column 3 |
| **Possession** | Within the area specified in **column 5** of Part 2 | Only if in a specific condition (if any) |
| **Transportation** | Within the area specified in **column 6** of Part 2 | Only if in a specific condition (if any) |
| **Release or activity leading to release** | Into a body of water frequented by fish in the area specified in **column 7** of Part 2 | Only if in a specific condition (if any) |

> ⚠️ *Note:* These prohibitions apply to **any member of the species**, including **genetic material capable of propagating** the species (e.g., seeds, eggs, DNA).

---

### 3. **Prohibition of Unauthorized Introduction**

It is **prohibited** to introduce any aquatic species into a region or body of water frequented by fish **where it is not indigenous**, **unless authorized** under:
- Federal law, or  
- Provincial law.

This provision reinforces the principle of **preventing non-native species from establishing** in ecosystems where they could disrupt ecological balance.

---

### 4. **Exemptions and Authorized Uses**

Certain individuals and activities are **exempted** from the general prohibitions under specific conditions.

#### Exemptions under Scientific, Educational, or Control Purposes:
- Employees or persons acting under the direction of:
  - Educational institutions
  - Research facilities
  - Zoos or aquariums
  - Federal or provincial departments with mandates to manage or control AIS

- Persons engaged in activities authorized under **subsection 19(3)** of the *Fisheries Act*

> ✅ **Requirement:** These exempted persons must hold **valid permits, licences, or authorizations** issued under specific provincial or federal regulations (e.g., Ontario Fish Licensing, Manitoba Fishing Licensing, British Columbia Freshwater Fish Regulation, etc.).

#### Specific Exemptions:
- **Section 7 (Possession):**  
  Does **not apply** to a person who:
  - Has caught an AIS listed in Part 2
  - Takes **immediate measures** to destroy it in a way that ensures it and its genetic material **cannot survive**

- **Diploid Grass Carp (Alberta):**  
  Exempt from Section 7 (possession) for persons employed by:
  - Lethbridge College Aquaculture Centre
  - Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development  
  **Only if:**  
  - They hold a **fish research licence** under subsection 12(1) of the *Fisheries (Alberta) Act*  
  - The diploid grass carp are being held **for the purpose of culturing triploid grass carp**

- **Triploid Grass Carp (Alberta):**  
  Exempt from Sections 7 and 8 (possession and transport) for persons holding a **cultured fish licence** under subsection 12(1) of the *Fisheries (Alberta) Act*, when releasing **confirmed triploid grass carp** for **vegetation control** on **privately owned, isolated land** (i.e., not connected to other water bodies).

> 🔍 *Purpose:* To allow controlled use of grass carp for habitat management without risking spread.

---

### 5. **Exemptions for Emergency and Operational Activities**

- **Sections 6 to 10 do not apply** to:
  - Fishery officers or guardians acting under their duties
  - Persons operating vehicles, vessels, or aircraft in:
    - Emergency operations
    - Search and rescue
    - Firefighting
