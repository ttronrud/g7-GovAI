**Detailed Summary of the Feed Grain Transportation and Storage Assistance Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Feed Grain Transportation and Storage Assistance Regulations* (the "Regulations") are a set of administrative rules established under the *Livestock Feed Assistance Act* (the "Act") to provide financial assistance to producers and handlers of feed grain in Canada. These regulations define eligible feed grains, specify geographic areas, establish transportation and storage payment rates, and outline conditions under which such payments are made.

Importantly, these Regulations were **repealed or superseded** by subsequent legislation (notably SOR/89-521 and SOR/80-846), and many references to outdated entities—such as the "Board," "British Columbia," "Prairie Region," and "Western Canada"—have been **officially removed**. As such, this summary reflects the **content and structure** of the regulations as originally published, with clear notes on their **current legal status** and **historical context**.

## **Key Definitions and Designations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Livestock Feed Assistance Act*, which provides the legal basis for the financial assistance program. |
| **Feed Grain** | Specifically designated as: **Rye, grain corn, No. 1 feed screenings, and sample feed grain**. These are recognized as eligible feed grains under the Act. |
| **Mixed Feed Oats** | A specific grade of grain defined under section 17 of the *Off Grades of Grain and Grades of Screenings Order*; included in the definition of feed grain. |
| **No. 1 Feed Screenings** | A grade of screenings defined under subsection 16(3) of the same Order; considered feed grain. |
| **Sample Feed Grain** | A grade of grain defined under section 19 of the Off Grades Order; included in feed grain classification. |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Several geographic designations (e.g., British Columbia, Prairie Region, Western Canada) have been **repealed** (SOR/89-521, s. 2), indicating that the geographic scope of the program was revised or replaced.

## **Geographic Designations**

1. **Eastern Canada**  
   - Defined as: *All that area of Ontario lying west of the meridian passing through the eastern boundary of the former city of Port Arthur as it existed on December 31, 1969*.  
   - This creates a historical boundary for determining eligibility for transportation and storage payments.
   - **Exception**: Payments for storage are **excluded at Thunder Bay**, which is an exception to the general rule.

2. **Livestock Definition**  
   - All classes of animals raised for food, agricultural purposes, or fur production are considered **livestock** under the Act.  
   - This includes birds and fish, broadening the scope beyond traditional livestock.

## **Transportation Payment Rules**

### **1. Transportation During the Period January 1, 1993 – March 31, 1993**
- If a feed grain (listed in the heading of column III of Schedules I, II, or III) is transported **during this window** to a destination in column II of a Schedule, **full payment** is made at the rate specified in **column III** of that item.

### **2. Transportation After March 31, 1993**
- For transport **after March 31, 1993**, the payment is **90% of the rate** set out in column III of the relevant Schedule item.

> This reduction reflects a policy shift to reduce subsidies over time, possibly to encourage more efficient transport or market integration.

### **3. Special Provisions for Later Schedules (Post-1994)**  
Despite the general 90% reduction, certain feed grains are eligible for **full-rate payments** after specific dates:

| Schedule | Feed Grain | Eligibility Date |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Schedule IV | Feed grain in heading of column III | After **January 31, 1994** |
| Schedule V | Feed grain in heading of column III | After **December 31, 1994** |
| Schedule VI | Feed grain in heading of column III | After **March 31, 1995** |

> These schedules appear to cover specific types of feed grain (e.g., specialty or lower-grade grains) and allow for full-rate payments after a transitional period, possibly to support regional or niche producers.

### **4. Final Exclusion**
- **No transportation payments are made after January 9, 1996**.  
  This marks the **end of the transportation assistance program** under these regulations.

### **5. Request Deadline**
- A request for payment must be submitted to the Minister **before May 31, 1996**.  
  This ensures timely processing and compliance with administrative deadlines.

## **Conditions for Motor Vehicle Transport Payments**

Payments for **motor vehicle transport** are only made if one of the following conditions is met:

1. The **owner of the motor vehicle** was:
   - The **owner or wholesale seller** of the feed grain transported in the vehicle; **OR**
2. The owner was:
   - A **licensed common carrier**, **and**
   - Had issued a **bill of lading** that **correctly stated the destination** of the feed grain.

> This ensures that payments are only made for legitimate, documented commercial movements of feed grain and prevents fraud or misuse.

> ⚠️ This provision was **repealed** (SOR/81-561, s. 1), indicating that the requirement for bill of lading or ownership verification is no longer in force.

---

## **Storage Payment Rules (Eastern Canada)**

### **Eligibility**
- Payments for **feed grain storage in Eastern Canada** are made **only for feed grain grown in Canada** and stored in a vessel **within Eastern Canada**, **except at Thunder Bay**.

### **Payment Rates**
- **Wheat**: $2.95 per tonne  
- **Oats**: $5.20 per tonne  
- **Barley**: $3.69 per tonne  

> These rates are fixed and apply to storage costs incurred in designated areas.

### **Exclusion Condition**
- A payment **shall not be made** if the feed grain could have been stored in **another available storage facility**.  
  This ensures that assistance is only provided when storage is necessary due to lack of alternatives.

---

## **General Conditions for All Payments**

All payments—whether for transportation or storage—must be made **on the condition that**:

1. The recipient maintains **books of account, records, bills of lading, and invoices** related to the purchase and sale of feed grain.  
2. These records are **retained for six years** after they are created.  
3. The records are **available for inspection and audit** by an authorized representative of the Minister during normal business hours.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with audit requirements.

---

## **Overpayment Rule (Transportation)**

If feed grain is transported to a destination **other than the one for which payment is being claimed**, and the **cost of transportation to that alternative destination is less than the rate** for the destination in which the payment is being made, then:

- The payment is considered an **overpayment**.
- The **difference between the actual cost and the rate** is to be recovered.

> This prevents overcompensation and ensures payments are aligned with actual transportation costs.

---

## **Storage Condition**

All storage payments must be made **only if the feed grain is or will be fed to livestock in Eastern Canada**.

> This ensures that the subsidy supports actual feed use, not speculative or idle storage.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- The **names in brackets** after cities and villages refer to the **Federal Census counties** where those locations are situated. This provides administrative clarity for geographic mapping and eligibility determination.
- The regulations were **issued in the early 1990s** and were **repealed or replaced** by later amendments (e.g., SOR/89-521, SOR/80-846, SOR/81-561), meaning that **this version is no longer in active legal force**.
- The program appears to have been **phased out** by January 9, 1996, with final deadlines for claims set at May 31, 1996.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Feed Grain Transportation and Storage Assistance Regulations* established a structured, geographically defined, and time-limited financial assistance program under the *Livestock Feed Assistance Act*. The regulations aimed to:

- Support the movement and storage of essential feed grains (especially rye, corn, screenings, and oats) to livestock producers in Eastern Canada.
- Ensure that payments were only made for legitimate, documented, and necessary transport and storage activities.
- Promote accountability through record-keeping and audit requirements.
- Gradually reduce subsidies over time (e.g., 90% rate after 1993), with full rates restored for certain grains after specific dates.

However, due to the **repeal of key provisions** (e.g., geographic designations, motor vehicle ownership rules) and the **end of the program in 1996**, these regulations are **historically significant but no longer applicable**.

> 📌 **Current Status**: **Repealed**. These regulations are **not in force** today and have been superseded by
