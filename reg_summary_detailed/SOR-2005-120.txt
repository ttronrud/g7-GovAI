**Detailed Summary of the Toronto Port Authority Regulations (S.C. 1998, c. 10)**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. This action is authorized under **paragraph 62(1)(b) of the Canada Marine Act**, which empowers the federal government to make regulations governing the use and management of ports and port-related activities in Canada.

**Regulatory Title and Purpose:**
The regulation establishes specific restrictions on the use of the Toronto Port Authority’s facilities and infrastructure for the construction of certain types of fixed links between the mainland of the City of Toronto and the Toronto Islands.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Prohibition on Bridge and Similar Fixed Links:**
   - The **Toronto Port Authority (TPA)** is explicitly prohibited from:
     - Using the port facilities;
     - Authorizing or permitting any other person to use the port to build a **bridge** or **similar fixed link** (such as a causeway or elevated structure) connecting the mainland of Toronto to the Toronto Islands.
   - This restriction aims to protect the port’s existing infrastructure, preserve its maritime character, and prevent development that could interfere with port operations, navigation, or environmental integrity.

2. **Exemption for Pedestrian Tunnels:**
   - **Section 1 of the regulation does not apply** to **pedestrian tunnels**.
   - This means that the prohibition on fixed links does not extend to the construction of tunnels designed solely for pedestrian use. Such projects may proceed under the authority of the TPA, provided they meet other applicable regulations and do not interfere with port functions.

**Interpretation and Scope:**
- The regulation applies specifically to the **Toronto Port Authority’s jurisdiction and use of port facilities**.
- The term “similar fixed link” is interpreted broadly to include any non-floating, permanent structure (e.g., a bridge, viaduct, or causeway) that provides a physical connection between the mainland and the Toronto Islands.
- The exclusion of pedestrian tunnels indicates a distinction between transportation modes: while vehicular or vehicle-transport infrastructure is restricted, non-motorized, human-only passage is permitted.

**Policy Objectives:**
- **Preservation of Port Functionality:** Prevents development that could disrupt maritime traffic, port operations, or access to port facilities.
- **Environmental and Urban Planning Considerations:** Maintains the natural and scenic character of the Toronto Islands and the surrounding waterways.
- **Land Use and Zoning Clarity:** Provides clear legal boundaries on what types of infrastructure can be developed on or through port lands, reducing ambiguity for developers and municipal planners.

**Effective Date and Legal Status:**
- The regulation is part of **S.C. 1998, c. 10**, the *Toronto Port Authority Regulations*, which came into force in 1998.
- It is a subordinate legislation under the *Canada Marine Act*, making it legally binding within the jurisdiction of the Toronto Port Authority and applicable to all persons using or acting through the port.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation effectively restricts the construction of vehicular or commercial fixed links (such as bridges) between Toronto’s mainland and the Toronto Islands, ensuring that the port remains focused on its maritime and transportation functions. However, it allows for the development of pedestrian tunnels, recognizing the need for safe, accessible pathways without compromising port operations or environmental values. The regulation serves as a key tool in balancing urban development with the preservation of port infrastructure and public access to the Toronto Islands.
