### **Detailed Summary of the Sept-Iles Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **Sept-Iles Airport Zoning Regulations** were formally approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This establishes the legal foundation for regulating land use around Sept-Iles Airport in Quebec.

These regulations are officially titled:  
> **"The Sept-Iles Airport Zoning Regulations"**

They are binding and enforceable within the jurisdiction of the Province of Quebec and govern land use in the vicinity of the airport to ensure aviation safety and operational integrity.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions in the Regulations**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Sept-Iles Airport**, located in the **Township of Letellier**, Quebec. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographical point used as the origin for measuring distances and angles. It is located at **provincial geodetic point number 120 M.O.T.**, with coordinates: <br> **E. 392,770.593 metres**, **N. 5,565,720.089 metres**. <br> It is considered to be at **51.77 metres above sea level** for elevation calculations. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway (strip), perpendicular to its centerline. This surface ensures that aircraft have a clear path during landing and takeoff, minimizing obstacles. Described in **Part III of the Schedule**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface extending above and around the airport, encompassing the broader area. Designed to protect aircraft from hazards at higher altitudes. Detailed in **Part IV of the Schedule**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing field designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction (e.g., Runway 10–28). Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surfaces. Ensures a smooth transition between the runway and surrounding terrain. Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**. |

#### **3. Coordinate and Measurement System**
- All **coordinates and azimuths** are based on the **M.T.M. (Military Terrain Mapping) System**, with the **central meridian at 67°30′**.
- All **distances** are expressed in the **metric system** (metres).
- The use of this standardized system ensures consistency and precision in mapping and land-use planning.

---

#### **4. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to:
- All **land parcels and water areas** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Sept-Iles Airport.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are formally part of the airport infrastructure (e.g., runways, taxiways, hangars) are **not subject** to these zoning restrictions.

This means that **private and public land**, including road allowances, is subject to the height restrictions unless explicitly exempted.

---

#### **5. Height Restrictions – Core Prohibition**
**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of the object:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> ⚠️ *This restriction applies to all new constructions and modifications to existing structures.*

**Purpose**: To prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases, thereby ensuring flight safety and compliance with aviation standards.

---

#### **6. Natural Growth Exceptions**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes) on regulated land **exceeds** the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.

> This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural landscapes while maintaining safety standards.

---

#### **7. Geometric Description of Regulated Lands (Part II of the Schedule)**

The regulated land area is described in precise, coordinate-based survey language. It begins at a defined point and follows a series of arcs and straight lines based on the **airport reference point** and radii of 5,486.224 metres.

**Key elements of the boundary description**:
- Begins at the **intersection of the northwesterly limit of the approach surface for strip 10–28** and an arc of a circle with radius 5,486.224 m centered at the ARP.
- Follows the arc **northerly, easterly, southerly** to intersect with the **northeasterly limit of the approach surface for strip 14–32**.
- Proceeds along straight lines (with defined azimuths) to key intersection points.
- Returns via arcs and lines to the starting point, forming a closed polygon.

This boundary encloses a **complex, irregular shape** that reflects the aerodynamic and safety zones required around the airport.

#### **8. List of Included Land Parcels and Lots**

The regulated area comprises **over 180 individual parcels, lots, and parts of lots**, including:

- **Blocks and lots** such as:
  - BLOCK 17-1, 17-2, 17-3
  - BLOCK 18, BLOCK 37, BLOCK C, BLOCK D
  - Pt BLOCK T-3, T-5, X, Z
- **Specific lots** with alphanumeric designations (e.g., 34-3-b, 35-1-a-1, 36-1-a-5)
- **Water lots** (e.g., Pt 2 (WATER LOT), 3 (WATER LOT), 6 (WATER LOT))
- **Numerous numbered lots** from 215 to 244, 257 to 287, 375 to 431, 432-1, 433 to 443, etc.
- **High-numbered lots** such as 768-1, 845 to 853, 950 to 962, 1008, 1056, 1112, 1122-1, 1137, 1138, 1140 to 1189, 1200 to 1229, and others.
- **Blocks with internal subdivisions** (e.g., C-1 to C-611, 5-1 to 5-280, 9-1 to 9-26)

> These parcels span across the Townships of **Arnaud, Letellier, and Moisie**, all within the **Sept-Iles Registration Division**.

This comprehensive list ensures that every parcel within the regulated zone is clearly identified and subject to the height restrictions.

#### **9. Revocation Note**
> [Revoked, SOR/81-178, s. 1]  
This note indicates that a **previous version** of these regulations was revoked by **SOR/81-178, Section 1**, and this current version is the **reissued, valid regulation**.

This confirms the current regulation is the **most up-to-date and legally effective version**.

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aviation Safety** | Prevents obstacles that could interfere with aircraft during approach, takeoff, or flight paths. |
| **Land Use Control** | Establishes clear boundaries and height limits for development near the airport. |
| **Public and Private Land Coverage** | Applies to both private property and public road allowances. |
| **Flexibility for Nature** | Allows for natural growth to exist, but with limits and potential removal if excessive. |
| **Precision and Legality** | Uses standardized coordinates and defined geometric surfaces to ensure enforceability. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Sept-Iles Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, technically precise set of rules designed to **protect aviation safety** by controlling the **height and placement of structures and natural features** in the vicinity of the airport.

By defining key surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), setting strict elevation limits, and clearly identifying the affected land parcels through coordinates and lot numbers, the regulations provide a **clear, enforceable framework** for land use in a critical aviation zone.

They represent a balance between **development rights** and **aviation safety**, ensuring that the airport remains safe and operational while allowing for responsible land use in surrounding communities.

---

### **Recommendations for Implementation**
- Local authorities and landowners should **review their property status** to determine if they fall within the regulated zone.
- Any proposed construction or development **must be pre-approved** with the Minister of Transport.
- Landowners with natural growth exceeding the defined surfaces should **monitor and comply** with potential removal directives.
- The use of **geospatial mapping tools** is recommended to verify compliance with the defined surfaces and boundaries.
