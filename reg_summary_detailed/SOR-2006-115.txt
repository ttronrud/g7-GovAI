**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Extending the Time for the Assessment of the Status of Wildlife Species

**Legal Authority:**  
Pursuant to **subsection 130(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, as enacted in *S.C. 2002, c. 29*.

---

### **Background and Purpose**

Under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, the Government of Canada is required to assess the status of wildlife species at risk to determine whether they meet criteria for designation as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “special concern,” and to develop recovery strategies where necessary. 

Section 130(5) of SARA provides a mechanism for the Minister of the Environment to extend the time frame for completing such status assessments when justified by circumstances such as scientific complexity, data gaps, or other reasonable reasons. This extension is subject to consultation with relevant federal, provincial, and territorial ministers and must be publicly recorded in the official registry.

This Order is issued under that authority, allowing additional time to complete a formal status assessment for three specific wildlife species listed in Schedule 2 of SARA.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Extension of Assessment Period**  
   The time allowed for the assessment of the status of the following three species is **extended by one year**, beginning from **June 5, 2006**.

2. **Species Affected**  
   The extension applies specifically to the following three species:

   - **Snake, Lake Erie Water (Nerodia sipedon insularum)**  
     - Common name: *Lake Erie Water Snake*  
     - Scientific name: *Nerodia sipedon insularum*  
     - Category: Reptile  
     - Listed under the heading “REPTILES” in **Part 1 of Schedule 2** to SARA.

   - **Cisco, Blackfin (Coregonus nigripinnis)**  
     - Common name: *Blackfin Cisco*  
     - Scientific name: *Coregonus nigripinnis*  
     - Category: Fish  
     - Listed under the heading “FISH” in **Part 2 of Schedule 2** to SARA.

   - **Sculpin, Deepwater (Myoxocephalus thompsoni) – Great Lakes population**  
     - Common name: *Deepwater Sculpin (Great Lakes population)*  
     - Scientific name: *Myoxocephalus thompsoni*  
     - Category: Fish  
     - Listed under the heading “FISH” in **Part 2 of Schedule 2** to SARA.

3. **Reason for Extension**  
   The Minister of the Environment has conducted consultations with the competent ministers (including provincial and territorial counterparts) and has provided a public statement in the registry explaining the reasons for the extension. These reasons are not detailed in the text provided but are implied to include scientific, ecological, or logistical challenges in assessing the status of these species, such as limited data availability, habitat complexity, or the need for further research.

4. **Effective Date**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, which is the official publication of federal regulations.

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This Order is a **temporary administrative measure** to provide flexibility in the implementation of SARA’s mandate to assess species at risk.
- It reflects the government’s commitment to scientific rigor and thoroughness in species assessments, recognizing that some species may require extended time due to the difficulty of gathering sufficient data.
- The extension ensures that decisions about species protection, recovery planning, or potential listing under SARA are based on comprehensive and up-to-date information.

---

### **Implications**

- **For Conservation Efforts:** The extension allows time for scientists, Indigenous communities, and other stakeholders to gather more data on population trends, habitat conditions, and threats affecting these species.
- **For Policy Development:** With a more complete assessment, future decisions on protection measures, habitat management, or recovery plans can be made with greater confidence.
- **For Public Accountability:** The requirement for public consultation and registry publication ensures transparency and public access to the rationale behind the extension.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally sound and transparent exercise under SARA’s procedural framework. It provides a one-year extension to complete the status assessment of three fish and one reptile species found in the Great Lakes region—specifically the Lake Erie Water Snake, Blackfin Cisco, and Deepwater Sculpin (Great Lakes population). The extension is justified by the need for more robust scientific data and is subject to oversight through ministerial consultation and public disclosure. It supports the long-term conservation of biodiversity by ensuring that assessments are both thorough and scientifically defensible.
