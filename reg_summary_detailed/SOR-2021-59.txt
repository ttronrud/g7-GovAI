**Detailed Summary of the Marine Safety Fees Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 1, s. 141)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Marine Safety Fees Regulations* are a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001**, specifically **paragraph 35(1)(g)a**, which empowers the Minister of Transport to establish and administer fees related to marine safety services. These regulations define the fees payable by vessels, shippers, and interested persons for various administrative and inspection-related services provided by the Canadian Coast Guard (or marine safety inspectors).

The regulations came into force in stages beginning **April 1, 2021**, with specific provisions entering force progressively from 2021 to 2023. The primary objective is to ensure that the cost of marine safety inspections, certifications, and administrative services is fairly and transparently recovered from users, while also adjusting fees annually to reflect inflation.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

### **1. Authority and Applicability**
- **Issued by**: His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**.
- **Legal Basis**: Paragraph 35(1)(g)a of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*.
- **Applicable Entities**: Vessels, shippers, owners, authorized representatives, and interested persons involved in maritime operations.

---

### **2. Fee Adjustment Mechanism (Annual Inflation Adjustment)**

- Fees are **adjusted annually on April 1** based on the **percentage change** in the **April All-items Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Canada**, as published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*.
- **Adjustment Trigger**: The fee is adjusted if the percentage change over the previous fiscal year is **equal to or greater than 1%**.
- **No Adjustment**: If the percentage change is **less than 1%**, the fee remains unchanged for that fiscal year.
- **Carry-Forward Rule**:  
  If the change in a fiscal year is less than 1%, that **percentage change is carried forward** to the next fiscal year.  
  The **combined percentage change** across years is then assessed.  
  If the **combined change is less than 1%**, the fee is **not adjusted** in the subsequent year, and the carry-forward continues to the next year.

> *Purpose*: This mechanism ensures fees keep pace with inflation while preventing unnecessary increases during periods of low inflation.
