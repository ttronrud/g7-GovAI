**Detailed Summary of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, made under the authority of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMOA), establishes the legal privileges and immunities for the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** and its associated personnel, specifically in relation to its new office in Canada — the **BIS Innovation Hub Toronto Centre** (BISIH Toronto Centre). The Order is based on a formal agreement between the Government of Canada and the BIS, signed on January 31, 2024, and grants specific legal rights and immunities to the Organization, its Board members, senior officials, staff, and experts while they carry out official duties in Canada.

The Order is rooted in international legal frameworks — particularly the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* (the "Convention") — and applies the principles of diplomatic immunity and functional immunity to the BIS, which is recognized as an international financial organization, not a traditional diplomatic mission.

### **Privileges and Immunities Granted**

The Order grants distinct privileges and immunities based on the role and function of individuals involved in the operation of the Centre and the Organization. These are derived from the **United Nations Convention** and are limited to the scope of official activities and as specified in the Agreement.

#### 1. **The Organization (BIS)**
- While carrying out official activities in Canada, the BIS has:
  - The **legal capacity of a body corporate** (i.e., it can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued).
  - The **privileges and immunities** set out in **Articles II and III of the Convention**, **to the extent specified in Articles 2 and 4 to 10 of the Agreement**.

> This means the BIS is treated as a legal entity with full corporate status in Canada, enabling it to operate independently and without interference in its official functions.

#### 2. **Board Members & Central Bank Representatives**
- Members of the BIS Board of Directors and representatives of central banks and monetary authorities that are members of the BIS (as referenced in Article 11 of the Agreement):
  - Have the **privileges and immunities under Article IV of the Convention**, **to the extent specified in Article 11**.

> These individuals are granted immunity from legal proceedings in Canada for actions taken in the course of their official duties, protecting them from being sued or detained in Canada.

#### 3. **General Manager and Deputy General Manager**
- The General Manager and Deputy General Manager of the BIS:
  - Have the **privileges and immunities under Article V of the Convention**, **to the extent specified in sub-paragraphs (1)(a), (c), (d) and paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the Agreement**.

> These senior executives are granted immunity from legal action in Canada for acts performed in connection with their official duties.

#### 4. **Centre Officials (as defined in Article 1(e))**
- Officials of the Centre (specifically those designated in paragraph (e) of Article 1):
  - Have the **privileges and immunities under Article V of the Convention**, **to the extent specified in sub-paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) and (e) to (h), and paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the Agreement**.

> These are mid-level staff working at the Toronto Centre who perform official functions. Their immunities are limited and tied to their roles and the Agreement.

#### 5. **Officials of the BIS (as defined in Article 1(d))**
- Officials of the BIS (not part of the Centre, but working within the organization):
  - Have the **privileges and immunities under Article V of the Convention**, **to the extent specified in sub-paragraphs (1)(a), (b), and (d), and paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Agreement**.

> These are BIS employees engaged in broader organizational functions, including technical and administrative work.

#### 6. **Experts Performing Missions**
- Experts (as defined in sub-paragraph (f) of Article 1) who perform missions for the BIS:
  - Have the **privileges and immunities under Article VI of the Convention**, **to the extent specified in Article 15 of the Agreement**.

> This includes temporary experts or consultants working on specific projects. Immunity applies only to their official work and is not personal.

### **Important Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No Personal Benefit**:  
  All privileges and immunities granted are **not for personal benefit**. They are intended solely to enable individuals to carry out their official duties **independently and without fear of legal interference** in Canada.

- **Traffic Accidents and Offences**:  
  Despite the immunities, **nothing in this Order exempts any person from liability arising from a traffic accident or traffic offence** imposed under Canadian law — **to the extent specified in Article 17 of the Agreement**.  
  → This means that individuals may still be held criminally or civilly liable for traffic violations, even if they are carrying out official duties.

- **Tax Liability**:  
  The Order **does not exempt any Canadian citizen or permanent resident** from paying taxes or duties imposed by Canadian law.  
  → This is a critical safeguard to ensure that individuals who are Canadian residents remain subject to Canadian tax obligations.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Enable the **BIS Innovation Hub Toronto Centre** to operate effectively in Canada.
- Provide the necessary **legal and operational framework** so that the BIS and its personnel can conduct research, innovation, policy development, and financial technology collaboration without fear of legal obstruction or interference.
- Ensure that the BIS can function as a **neutral, independent international institution** in Canada, consistent with international norms and best practices.

The recognition of the BIS as a "body corporate" with full legal standing is particularly significant, as it allows the Centre to establish offices, enter into contracts, and manage its own operations independently.

### **Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette. This ensures immediate applicability upon official publication.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a significant step in Canada’s engagement with international financial institutions. By granting the BIS and its personnel specific privileges and immunities under the framework of the United Nations Convention, it:
- Supports Canada’s role in global financial innovation and stability.
- Enhances the ability of the BIS to operate in Canada as a trusted, neutral hub for financial technology and policy development.
- Balances international legal protections with domestic legal obligations (such as traffic and tax laws), ensuring compliance with Canadian law while respecting international norms.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to fostering international cooperation in financial innovation, while maintaining the integrity of its legal and fiscal systems.
