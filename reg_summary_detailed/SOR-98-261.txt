**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order No. 1, 1998 – Authorization for Government Employees to Acquire Interests in Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Territorial Lands Act**, specifically **paragraph 29(1)(a)**, which permits the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to authorize certain employees of the Government of Canada to acquire interests in territorial lands within the **Northwest Territories (NWT)**.

The Order is formally titled:  
**"Order No. 1, 1998, authorizing certain employees of the Government of Canada to acquire interests in territorial lands in the Northwest Territories."**

It is a statutory instrument that provides specific legal recognition and authorization for land acquisition or leasing by designated government employees, enabling them to obtain ownership or usage rights over specific parcels of land in the NWT.

### **2. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on **April 23, 1998**.

---

### **3. Scope and Purpose**

The primary purpose of this Order is to facilitate the acquisition of land interests by **Government of Canada employees** who are stationed in or have responsibilities within the Northwest Territories. These acquisitions are not for general development or commercial purposes but are intended to support **official duties**, such as:

- Residential or operational use (e.g., hunting and fishing cabins),
- Administrative or professional functions (e.g., auditing, resource management),
- Ensuring that government personnel have access to land necessary for their work in remote areas.

This Order operates under a special provision allowing employees to acquire land through **assignment from the current lessee**, which implies that the land is currently under lease and the government employee is taking over the rights via a legal transfer from the existing lessee.

### **4. Specific Authorizations by Employee**

The Order provides three distinct land acquisition or leasing authorizations, each tailored to the individual employee's role and needs:

### **5. Key Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Crown Land Management**:  
  The Order underscores the principle that **mineral rights remain with the Crown** even when surface rights are transferred. This is a standard legal safeguard in Canadian territorial land law to prevent private exploitation of natural resources.

- **Government Employee Privileges**:  
  The provision allows employees to access land in remote regions to carry out their duties, particularly in areas where housing or operational facilities are scarce.

- **Use of Land for Official Purposes**:  
  The land is being used for **official government functions**—such as policing, auditing, and environmental resource management—rather than for private or commercial development.

- **Legal Documentation and Record Keeping**:  
  Each transaction is tied to a specific survey plan or sketch plan, and copies are filed in the **Land Titles Office**, ensuring transparency, traceability, and compliance with land registration standards.

### **6. Conclusion**

This Order No. 1, 1998 is a targeted, legally sound, and operationally practical instrument that enables **three key government employees** in the Northwest Territories to acquire or lease specific parcels of land for **official, non-commercial purposes**. It reflects a balance between:

- Supporting the operational needs of federal employees in remote regions,  
- Maintaining the Crown’s ownership and control over mineral rights,  
- Ensuring compliance with the Territorial Lands Act and land administration procedures.

The Order is consistent with broader federal policies on land use in northern Canada and demonstrates how statutory authority can be used to facilitate government functionality in geographically isolated areas.

**Final Note**: This Order does not confer ownership of mineral rights, nor does it allow for commercial exploitation. It is strictly limited to surface use or lease for administrative, security, or recreational purposes.
