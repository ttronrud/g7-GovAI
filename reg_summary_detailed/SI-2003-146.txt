**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Text:**  
*Whereas it appears to the Governor in Council that the documents set out in the annexed schedule, required by an Act of Parliament to be laid before one or both Houses of Parliament, contain the same information as or less information than is contained in the Public Accounts or in any estimates of expenditures submitted to Parliament;  
Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board, pursuant to section 157a of the Financial Administration Act, hereby directs that the documents set out in the annexed schedule be discontinued, and hereafter they need not be prepared or laid before either House of Parliament.*  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47  

**Annexed Documents to be Discontinued:**  
1. *Annual Report on the activities of the Canada Industrial Relations Board*  
   – Under the *Canada Labour Code*, specifically section 121(1), R.S. 1985, c. L-2  
2. *Annual Report on the activities of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council*  
   – Under the *Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act*, specifically section 18(1), R.S. 1985, c. N-21

**Purpose and Context:**  
This regulation, enacted under the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically section 157a), serves to streamline parliamentary reporting by eliminating redundant or duplicative financial and operational disclosures. The primary objective is to reduce the administrative burden on Parliament by ensuring that reports submitted to either House of Parliament do not provide information that is already available—either in full or in substantial part—through more comprehensive and official sources such as the *Public Accounts* or the *estimates of expenditures*.

---

**Key Legal Basis:**  
- **Section 157a of the Financial Administration Act** grants the Governor in Council the authority to discontinue the preparation and submission of certain reports to Parliament if they are found to be redundant or contain no additional value compared to existing financial or budgetary disclosures.  
- The decision is made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, indicating a collaborative and policy-driven approach to financial transparency and efficiency.

---

**Rationale for Discontinuation:**  
The Governor in Council determined that:  
- The annual reports in question (on the Canada Industrial Relations Board and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council) contain **information that is either identical to or less comprehensive than** what is already provided in:  
  - The *Public Accounts of Canada*, which offer a detailed and official account of government spending and financial operations; or  
  - The *estimates of expenditures* submitted to Parliament during budgetary processes.  
- Since the reports do not add new or meaningful information to the public or legislative record, their continued submission is deemed unnecessary and inefficient.

---

**Scope and Effect:**  
- The regulation **discontinues** the preparation and submission of both annual reports.  
- From the effective date of this regulation (as set out in the Statute, S.C. 1991, c. 24), these reports are **no longer required** to be:  
  - Prepared by the respective bodies (the Canada Industrial Relations Board and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council);  
  - Laid before either the House of Commons or the Senate.  
- This change applies **retrospectively and prospectively**, meaning no further submissions of these reports will be required in the future.

**Implications:**  
1. **Reduction in Parliamentary Workload:**  
   Parliament no longer needs to review or consider these reports, freeing up legislative time and resources for more substantive issues.  

2. **Improved Efficiency in Financial Oversight:**  
   The Public Accounts and budget estimates already provide a full picture of government spending and program performance. This regulation ensures that no duplicate or redundant reports are submitted, promoting a more coherent and transparent financial reporting framework.  

3. **Shift in Accountability:**  
   While the annual reports are discontinued, the accountability of these agencies to Parliament remains intact. Their operational performance and financial outcomes are still expected to be reported through other official channels, such as annual statements or performance reports, which may be more aligned with broader fiscal and policy objectives.  

4. **Potential for Reassessment:**  
   The decision assumes that the current reports are redundant. If future changes in policy, public interest, or reporting standards require more detailed or specific information, Parliament or the Minister of Finance could revisit the decision under the same legal authority.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a practical and legally sound decision to eliminate redundant parliamentary reporting. It reflects a broader trend in public administration toward efficiency, transparency, and the avoidance of duplication. By aligning the reporting obligations of federal agencies with the existing financial disclosures in the Public Accounts and budget estimates, the government ensures that Parliament receives comprehensive, timely, and non-redundant information—without unnecessary administrative overhead.  

The discontinuation of these two annual reports is a clear example of how financial governance can be optimized through careful review and evidence-based decision-making.
