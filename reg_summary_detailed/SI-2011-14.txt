---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to:
- **Withdraw subsurface rights** in specified tracts of territorial land in the **Northwest Territories (NWT)**.
- Ensure that these lands are **not subject to mineral exploration or development disputes** during the establishment of the **Gwich’in Land Use Plan**.
- Support the **Gwich’in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (GLCA)** by providing a clear, protected framework for land use and resource management in the **Gwich’in Settlement Area**.

> This withdrawal is not a permanent restriction but a **temporary measure** designed to allow Indigenous-led land planning and stewardship.

---

### **3. Scope of Withdrawal**
- **What is withdrawn**: Subsurface rights (i.e., rights to minerals, oil, gas, and other subsurface resources).
- **Geographic Area**: Specific tracts of land described in **Schedules 1 to 17**.
- **Time Period**: 
  - Begins on the **date the Order is made**.
  - Ends on **January 31, 2014**.
- **Jurisdiction**: Applies only to **territorial lands in the Northwest Territories**, specifically within the **Gwich’in Settlement Area** as defined in **Appendix A of the Gwich’in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement**.

> This means that during this period, no new mineral rights can be disposed of (e.g., through leasing, granting, or sale) in the specified tracts.

| **Issuance of significant discovery licences** | If the licence covers an area under a **pre-existing exploration licence**, it may proceed. |
| **Issuance of production licences** | Production licences covering areas under **pre-existing exploration or discovery licences** may proceed. |
| **Granting of surface leases** | Surface leases required to enable a claim holder to exercise rights under a recorded claim are allowed. |
| **Renewal of interests** | Renewals of existing mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are permitted. |

### **5. Specific Land Description (Repeal Section)**
The regulation identifies a **specific parcel of land** in the Gwich’in Settlement Area using a detailed **descriptive survey** based on geographic coordinates and topographic features.

#### **Key Details**:
- **Datum**: North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)
- **Topographic Data Sources**:
  - National Topographic Data Base (NTDB) datasets:
    - 106M, 116P, 107B, 117A
  - Produced by **Geomatics Canada**, Natural Resources Canada (1992–1994 editions)

#### **Survey Description (Summary Path)**:
The parcel begins at the intersection of:
- Latitude 68°02′19″N and a westerly boundary of the Gwich’in Settlement Area (approx. longitude 136°28′05″W)

Then proceeds through a series of directional lines (northeasterly, southeasterly, easterly, etc.) intersecting with:
- Boundaries of **Gwich’in Parcels A**
- Natural features (lakes, creeks, rivers)
- Geographic landmarks (e.g., unnamed lakes, creeks)

Final point returns to the **southwest municipal boundary of Aklavik**, at approximately:
- Latitude 68°13′13″N, longitude 135°06′29″W

> This parcel is **part of the larger Gwich’in Settlement Area**, which is central to the Indigenous land claim and cultural heritage.

### **6. Significance and Implications**
- **Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination**: The Order supports the Gwich’in people’s right to **control and manage their traditional lands** and resources, particularly in the context of climate change and energy development.
- **Environmental and Cultural Protection**: The withdrawal helps protect **sensitive ecosystems**, **cultural sites**, and **traditional hunting and gathering areas** from potential disruption.
- **Land Use Planning**: It enables the development of a **comprehensive, community-driven Land Use Plan** that reflects Gwich’in values and priorities.
- **Temporal Nature**: The 1-year duration (until January 31, 2014) ensures the plan can be developed and approved without indefinite restrictions.

---

### **7. Legal and Policy Context**
- This Order is part of the broader **Gwich’in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (GLCA)**, signed in 1999 and implemented in phases.
- The **Gwich’in Land Use Plan (GLUP)** is a key component of the agreement, outlining how land will be used, protected, and managed in a way that respects Indigenous knowledge and rights.
- The withdrawal is a **temporary, targeted intervention** to ensure that land use decisions are made with full Indigenous input.
