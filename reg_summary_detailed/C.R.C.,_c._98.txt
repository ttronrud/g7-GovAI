### **Detailed Summary of the New Montreal International Airport (Mirabel) Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"New Montreal International Airport (Mirabel) Zoning Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a comprehensive set of spatial and developmental restrictions governing land use and elevation around the Mirabel Airport.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions and Terminology**

To ensure clarity and enforceability, the regulation defines several key geographical and technical terms:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to the *New Montreal International Airport (Mirabel)* located in Mirabel, County of Deux-Montagnes, Quebec.

- **Airport Reference Points (Alpha and Bravo)**:
  - These are two fixed geographic points used as reference for establishing elevation and spatial boundaries.
  - **Alpha**:
    - Survey Marker #268
    - Coordinates:  
      - E: 267,656.86 metres (878,139.31 feet)  
      - N: 5,062,987.78 metres (16,610,852.30 feet)  
      - Latitude: 45°42′28″ N  
      - Longitude: 73°58′37″ W
  - **Bravo**:
    - Survey Marker #312
    - Coordinates:  
      - E: 260,582.32 metres (854,928.87 feet)  
      - N: 5,057,524.66 metres (16,592,928.68 feet)  
      - Latitude: 45°39′29″ N  
      - Longitude: 74°04′03″ W
  - **Elevation Assumption**: For all regulatory purposes, both reference points are deemed to be **234 feet above sea level**.

- **Approach Surface**:
  - An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway (strip), perpendicular to its centerline.
  - Designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing paths.
  - Fully described in **Part III of the Schedule**.

- **Transitional Surface**:
  - An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a runway and its associated approach surface.
  - Acts as a buffer zone to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations.
  - Detailed in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

- **Outer Surface**:
  - A broad, imaginary surface located above and surrounding the airport, extending beyond the runways and approach zones.
  - Designed to protect the entire airport environment from visual and physical interference.
  - Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**.

- **Strip**:
  - A rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction.
  - Includes runways and associated taxiways.
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**.

> All these surfaces are imaginary and serve as **elevation limits** for land development and natural growth.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- All **land and underwater areas** adjacent to or near the airport.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- The regulation applies **except** where the land is officially incorporated into the airport's operational or administrative boundaries.

This includes:
- **Registry Division of Deux-Montagnes** (Mirabel)
- **Registry Division of Argenteuil** (parts of parishes: Saint-Jérusalem, Saint-Jérôme, Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Saint-Janvier, Sainte-Thérèse-de-Blainville, Saint-Augustin, Sainte-Scholastique, Saint-Benoît, Saint-Canut, Saint-Colomban, Saint-Hermas)
- **Registry Division of Terrebonne** (parts of: Saint-Jérôme, Sainte-Sophie, Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Saint-Janvier, Sainte-Thérèse-de-Blainville, and villages of Saint-Jérôme and Sainte-Thérèse)

> The regulation covers a large geographic area surrounding the airport, extending across multiple municipalities and land parcels.

---

#### **4. Core Prohibitions: Elevation Restrictions**

No person may:
- **Construct or erect** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures),  
- **Allow natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to exceed the elevation of any of the following surfaces:

✅ **Approach Surfaces**  
✅ **Outer Surface**  
✅ **Transitional Surfaces**

> The **highest point** of any structure or natural object must **not exceed** the elevation of any of these surfaces **at the exact location** of the object.

This means:
- Even a small tree or building extension that rises above the imaginary approach or outer surface is **prohibited**.
- The regulation applies **point-by-point**, based on the vertical projection of the surface over the land.

---

#### **5. Enforcement Mechanism: Control of Natural Growth**

- If an **owner or occupier** allows natural growth (e.g., trees, bushes) to exceed the permitted elevation limits:
  - The **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** (formal directive) requiring:
    - A person to enter the land and **remove the excessive vegetation**.
  - This provides a legal and administrative tool for enforcement without requiring court action.

> This mechanism ensures that even natural features do not compromise aviation safety or visual integrity.

---

#### **6. Coordinate System**

- All coordinates are in the **M.T.M. (Military Terrain Map) system**.
- The central meridian of the zone is **73°30′ West**.
- Coordinates are expressed in metres (Easting/Northing) and converted to feet for consistency with aviation standards.

---

#### **7. Boundary Description (Perimeter of Regulated Area)**

The outer limits of the regulated zone are defined by a **detailed, step-by-step boundary description** in the regulation. This includes:

- Starting at the **intersection of lot lines between lots 135 and 137** and the **southerly limit of a public road** in Terrebonne (Saint-Jérôme parish).
- Progressing through a series of directional lines (e.g., southeasterly, southwesterly, westerly) with specific bearings and distances.
- Crossing public roads (e.g., Route 117, Route 148, Notre-Dame Road).
- Following lot lines and river curves (e.g., Rivière Sainte-Marie).
- Ending at a point where the boundary intersects the **northerly limit of the approach surface of strip 11L-29R** and later connects to the **southeasterly limit of the approach surface of strip 06R-24L**.

> This boundary forms a **closed, geometric perimeter** that defines the total area subject to the zoning restrictions.

---

#### **8. Purpose and Intent**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**:
   - Prevent obstructions (buildings, trees, hills) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
   - Maintain unimpeded flight paths and visibility.

2. **Visual and Environmental Integrity**:
   - Preserve the visual character of the airport and surrounding landscape.
   - Prevent clutter or visual pollution that could affect flight operations.

3. **Legal Clarity and Enforcement**:
   - Provide precise geographic and elevation boundaries.
   - Empower the Minister of Transport to act decisively against violations.

4. **Compliance with Aviation Standards**:
   - Align with international standards for airport zoning and obstruction control.

---

#### **9. Key Legal and Administrative Implications**

- **Applicability**: Applies to all landowners and occupiers within the defined perimeter.
- **Enforcement Authority**: The **Minister of Transport** has the power to issue enforcement directions.
- **Burden of Compliance**: Landowners must proactively monitor and manage vegetation and construction.
- **No Exceptions**: Even minor deviations (e.g., a tree growing beyond the surface) are prohibited.
- **No Exemptions**: The only exemption is where land is formally part of the airport itself.

---

#### **10. Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations establish a **strict zone of no obstruction** around the New Montreal International Airport (Mirabel). Within this zone:

- **No building or structure** can rise above specific imaginary surfaces (approach, transitional, outer).
- **No trees or natural growth** can grow above these surfaces.
- If someone violates this rule, the **Minister of Transport can order removal** of the overgrown vegetation.
- The boundaries are precisely defined using survey markers and coordinates.
- The rules are designed to ensure **safe, clear flight paths** for aircraft and to protect the airport environment from visual and physical interference.
