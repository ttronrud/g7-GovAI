Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled *Red Lake Airport Zoning Regulations*, enacted under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act*.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Red Lake Airport Zoning Regulations**

### 📌 **1. Legal Basis and Enforcement Authority**

- The regulation is issued under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Minister of Transport to make zoning regulations for airports.
- The proposed regulations were **published twice in the Canada Gazette Part I** (May 14 and 21, 1994) and **twice in the Red Lake Sunset County Times** (May 31 and June 7, 1994), providing a **reasonable opportunity for public comment**.
- The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, has now **formally enacted** these regulations.

> ✅ This ensures transparency, public participation, and adherence to procedural requirements in the regulatory process.

### 🏢 **2. Definition of Key Terms**

The regulation defines several technical terms critical to understanding the zoning restrictions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Red Lake Airport**, located in the Township of Dome, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point used as a datum for measuring elevation and distances. Located at UTM coordinates: **5,657,375.56 N and 444,294.05 E** (Zone 15, 93°W). |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 08–26), designed to ensure aircraft have clear visual and operational visibility during landing approaches. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, but **reduced to 9 meters above ground level** where it would otherwise be below 9 meters. |
| **Strip** | The central landing area of the airport, including the runway. For runway 08–26: **150 meters wide (75 meters on each side)** and **1,644.28 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending up to intersect with the outer surface. |

> ⚠️ All these surfaces are based on the **Red Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. 60-041 86-112**, dated September 28, 1988, and referenced across multiple sheets (e.g., Sheets 4–6 for approach/transitional surfaces, Sheets 1–9 for outer boundary).

---

### 📏 **3. Elevation Reference**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point is 376.5 meters above sea level**.
- All height restrictions are measured **relative to this point**, with the outer surface set at **45 meters above ARP**, i.e., **376.5 + 45 = 421.5 meters above sea level** (in most areas).
- In areas where the ground is lower, the outer surface is **clamped at 9 meters above ground level** to prevent overreach.

---

### 🚧 **4. Applicability of the Regulations**

- The regulations apply to **all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including **public road allowances**.
- The **exact boundary** of the regulated zone is defined in a detailed, step-by-step description (see below) and is drawn from the zoning plan.

> 🔍 This ensures that **no development near the airport**—even on public roads—can violate the height or use restrictions.

---

### 🚫 **5. Prohibited Development and Construction**

#### ❌ No construction or modification of existing structures is allowed if the **highest point** of any building, structure, or object exceeds any of the following:

1. **Approach Surfaces**
2. **Outer Surface**
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> 💡 This means:
> - Trees, antennas, towers, or buildings cannot exceed the height of the approach or outer surfaces.
> - Even small structures (like sheds or fences) must not rise above these imaginary planes.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees) may grow beyond these limits and must be removed if it causes interference.

---

### 🚨 **6. Restrictions on Land Use**

#### ❌ No use or development that:
- Interferes with **aircraft communications or navigation signals**
- Interferes with **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, radio towers, control towers)

> 📡 This protects the integrity of air traffic control and flight safety.

#### ❌ No disposal of **waste that is edible or attractive to birds**

> 🐦 This prevents bird strikes—a major hazard in aviation—by banning the dumping of food scraps, seeds, or other bird-attractive materials.

---

### 🌲 **7. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees) grows beyond the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister may require removal**.
- This gives the government authority to **enforce vegetation control** to maintain safe airspace.

> ✅ This is a proactive measure to prevent unexpected obstructions during takeoff and landing.

---

### 🗺️ **8. Geographic Boundaries of the Regulated Area**

The outer boundary of the land subject to the zoning regulations is defined in a **detailed, coordinate-based description** (as per the zoning plan). It follows a long, winding path through several mining claims and land parcels, including:

- **Mining Claims**: KRL1016, KRL998 (now KRL17797), KRL1010 (KRL19209/KRL19210), KRL19667, KRL20830, KRL20755, KRL19671, KRL20070, KRL20252, KRL20255, KRL20840, KRL118 (now KRL19502), KRL8542 (now KRL20837), K1582, K1597, K1167, KRL20015, K1532 (now KRL28939), KRL12672, KRL12671, KRL11325, KRL12670, KRL6005, KRL12849, KRL5944, KRL5945, KRL5946, KRL42069 (now KRL869570), KRL42063, KRL42062, KRL11528, KRL869652, KRL915, KRL12181, KRL12180, KRL10651, KRL10668, and others.

- **Highway 125** and **Red Lake’s high water mark** serve as key reference points.
- The boundary is maintained **20.117 meters from the high water mark of Red Lake**, ensuring a buffer zone from the lake.

> 📐 This complex boundary ensures that only land **within a defined perimeter** around the airport is subject to the height and use restrictions.

### 📝 **9. Purpose and Intent of the Regulation**

The primary objectives of the Red Lake Airport Zoning Regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Protect flight operations** by maintaining clear lines of sight and unimpeded communication.
3. **Minimize risks** such as bird strikes and signal interference.
4. **Preserve the integrity** of the airport’s operational environment through strict land-use controls.
5. **Provide a clear, enforceable framework** for landowners and developers near the airport.

### 📌 Summary in Plain Language

This regulation establishes strict **height and land-use rules** around Red Lake Airport to ensure **safe aviation operations**. No building, structure, or natural growth can exceed certain imaginary planes (approach, outer, or transitional surfaces) that extend upward and outward from the runway. These surfaces are carefully defined based on runway geometry and elevation. The regulation applies to all land within a large, precisely mapped zone surrounding the airport, including public roads. Landowners must avoid using land in ways that interfere with aircraft signals or attract birds. If trees
