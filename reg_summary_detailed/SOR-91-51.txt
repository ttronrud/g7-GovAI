## 📌 Purpose of the Regulation

The primary purpose of these regulations was to allow **small and medium-sized businesses (registrants)** to simplify their excise tax calculations by adopting a **"quick method"** of determining their net tax liability — instead of using the full, complex accounting and reporting requirements of the standard tax regime.

This streamlined approach aimed to:
- Reduce administrative burden
- Improve compliance for businesses with low-volume or routine taxable supplies
- Provide a consistent and predictable tax rate based on the registrant's business activity and location

## 🔍 Key Definitions and Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act* |
| **Election** | A formal choice by a registrant to use the quick method for calculating net tax under section 227 of the Act |
| **Specified Registrant** | A business that does not fall into certain exempt or high-risk categories (e.g., financial institutions, professional service providers, charities, non-profits). Must meet strict criteria throughout relevant fiscal quarters. |
| **Specified Supply** | A taxable supply that is *not* exempt or deemed exempt — excludes sales of real property, capital assets, financial services, zero-rated supplies, or supplies outside Canada. |
| **Threshold Period** | A defined time period (typically 4 fiscal quarters) used to calculate the "basic threshold amount" and determine eligibility for the quick method. |
| **Basic Threshold Amount** | A formula-based calculation that determines the baseline for determining the quick-method rate. |
| **Quick-Method Rate** | A fixed percentage tax rate applied to specified supplies based on the registrant’s location and the location of its permanent establishment. |

## 📐 Formula for Basic Threshold Amount

The **basic threshold amount** for a reporting period is calculated using the formula:

> **Basic Threshold Amount = (A + B) / C**

Where:
- **A** = Total consideration (excluding goodwill) received by the registrant for taxable supplies (excluding financial services, real property, capital assets, and deemed supplies) made in Canada.
- **B** = Total tax under Division II (excise tax) that became collectible in the threshold period on those same supplies.
- **C** = Number of days in the threshold period.

This formula measures the **total revenue and tax collected** relative to the time period, forming the basis for eligibility and rate determination.

---

## 📐 Formula for Total Threshold Amount

The **total threshold amount** includes:
1. The basic threshold amount (as above), and  
2. A sum of amounts from **associated businesses (associates)**.

For each associate:
> **Associate Amount = (D + E) / F**

Where:
- **D** = Consideration received by the associate for taxable supplies (excluding financial services, real property, capital assets).
- **E** = Excise tax collected by the associate on those supplies.
- **F** = Number of days in the associate’s fiscal year.

This allows for **grouping of related businesses** to assess overall tax exposure.

## 💰 Cost of Tangible Personal Property

The "cost" of acquiring tangible personal property (e.g., goods sold) is defined as:

> **Cost = A + B + C / D**

Where:
- **A** = Consideration paid by the registrant for the property
- **B** = Value of imported property (as per section 215 of the Act)
- **C** = Excise tax paid on the property
- **D** = Number of days in the threshold period

This cost is used to determine whether the registrant meets the **40% threshold** for qualifying under the quick method.

---

## 🚦 Threshold Period Rules

The threshold period is determined based on when the registrant makes the election:

| Scenario | Threshold Period |
|--------|------------------|
| Election becomes effective during a fiscal year | The 4 quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the election takes effect |
| Election was effective before the start of the fiscal year | The previous fiscal year |

**Special Rule for January 1, 1991:**
- If an election is filed after the end of a fiscal year ending in 1990, the threshold period is the **last fiscal year before filing**.
- If no filing is made, the last fiscal year before filing is used to determine the quick-method rate.

## 📊 Quick-Method Tax Rates

The **quick-method rate** depends on:
1. Where the **permanent establishment** of the registrant is located
2. Where the **supply is made**

### ✅ Quick-Method Rates (by location of permanent establishment)

| Permanent Establishment | Supply Location | Tax Rate |
|------------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Ontario** | Ontario | 4.4% |
| | Nova Scotia | 5.3% |
| | New Brunswick, PEI, NL | 6.1% |
| | Non-participating province | 0% |

| **Nova Scotia** | Ontario | 3.9% |
| | Nova Scotia | 4.7% |
| | NB, PEI, NL | 5.6% |
| | Non-participating | 0% |

| **NB/PEI/NL** | Ontario | 3.3% |
| | Nova Scotia | 4.2% |
| | NB, PEI, NL | 5.0% |
| | Non-participating | 0% |

| **Non-participating province** | Ontario | 8.8% |
| | Nova Scotia | 9.6% |
| | NB, PEI, NL | 10.4% |
| | Non-participating | 1.8% |

> ⚠️ **Note:** These rates were **repealed in 2016** (SOR/2016-212, s. 4) and replaced with updated rates under the modern *Excise Tax Act* framework.

## 📝 Special Rules

1. **Deduction under subsection 234(3)**  
   - If a registrant is entitled to a deduction (e.g., for input tax), the supply is **deemed to be made in a non-participating province** for rate purposes.

2. **Treatment of Supplies Through Permanent Establishments**  
   - If **substantially all** of the specified supplies are made in a participating province → treat all as made in a participating province  
   - If **substantially all** are made in non-participating provinces → treat all as made in a non-participating province

3. **Net Specified Supplies**  
   - Calculated as:  
     > **Total consideration received + Tax collected**  
     > **Minus** refunds, rebates, or credits given to customers or for tax

4. **Change in Status**  
   - If a registrant **ceases to be a qualified registrant** (e.g., due to revocation of election or loss of status) during a fiscal quarter, the **quick-method rate reverts to the previous quarter’s rate**.
