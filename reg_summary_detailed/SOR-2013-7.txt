## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Unsolicited Telecommunications Fees Regulations**

### 🔹 **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- The regulations are established under **subsection 41.21(1)a of the Telecommunications Act** (S.C. 1993, c. 38; S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 597).
- The proposed regulations were first published on **October 23, 2012**, on the CRTC website, giving interested parties a **reasonable opportunity to submit representations**.
- After considering public feedback, the CRTC formally adopted and enacted the regulations on **January 23, 2013**, in Gatineau, Quebec.

> This regulatory framework establishes a **fee-based system** for individuals who subscribe to the **National Do Not Call List (NDNCL)**, ensuring that the CRTC receives funding to regulate unsolicited telemarketing calls while protecting consumer privacy.

---

## 🔍 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Fiscal Year** | The period from **April 1 to March 31** of the following year. |
| **National Do Not Call List (NDNCL)** | A national registry established under **section 41 of the Telecommunications Act** to prevent unsolicited telemarketing calls to registered numbers. |

> Subscribers to the NDNCL are required to pay fees to the CRTC (or a delegated collector) as outlined in the regulations.

---

## 💰 Fee Structure by Subscription Period

Subscribers must pay fees based on the **type of subscription** and the **date of subscription**, with different fee schedules in effect during distinct periods:

| Subscription Period | Applicable Schedule |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **August 1, 2015 – March 31, 2016** | **Schedule 1** |
| **April 1, 2016 – March 31, 2017** | **Schedule 2** |
| **On or after April 1, 2017** | **Schedule 3** |

> Each schedule specifies fees based on two subscription types:
> - **All area codes**
> - **Single area code**

> The fee amounts are listed in **column 2** of each schedule, corresponding to the subscription type in **column 1**.

> Example: A subscriber choosing "all area codes" during the 2015–2016 period would pay a specific fee as set out in Schedule 1, column 2.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: These fees are **in addition to any other fees** that may be charged by a delegate under **subsection 41.4(1)** of the Telecommunications Act — such as fees to join the NDNCL itself.

## 📅 Annual Fee Adjustment and Refund Mechanism

### 1. **Annual Fee Determination**
- No later than **90 days after the end of each fiscal year**, the CRTC (or a delegated collector) must:
  - Determine the **fees payable** to the CRTC by each subscriber for that fiscal year, **in accordance with subsection 4(1) or (2)**.
  - If the **amounts paid under subsection 3(1)** exceed the **actual fees due**, the **excess must be refunded** to the subscriber.

> This ensures that subscribers are **not overcharged** and that any overpayment is returned.

---

### 2. **Fee Calculation Formula (When Costs Exceed Total Payments)**

If the total of all fees paid by subscribers in a fiscal year **exceeds** the CRTC’s actual telemarketing regulatory costs, then the **fee per person is calculated** using the following formula:

\[
\text{Fees Payable} = \left( \frac{\text{Amounts Paid by Person}}{\text{Total Amounts Paid by All Subscribers}} \right) \times \text{Telemarketing Regulatory Costs}
\]

Where:
- **Amounts Paid by Person** = the amount paid by that individual under subsection 3(1) in the fiscal year
- **Total Amounts Paid by All Subscribers** = sum of all such payments across all subscribers in the fiscal year
- **Telemarketing Regulatory Costs** = the CRTC’s actual costs for that fiscal year related to telemarketing regulation

> This formula ensures **proportional funding** — the fee each subscriber pays is based on their share of total payments relative to the total regulatory cost.

---

### 3. **Refund of Excess Payments**

- The **difference** between:
  - The amount paid by a person under subsection 3(1) in a fiscal year, and  
  - The fees payable under subsection 4(2) for that year  
  → must be **refunded** to the person **if the difference is at least $5**.

> This protects consumers from paying more than necessary and ensures financial fairness.

---

## 💵 Determination of Telemarketing Regulatory Costs

- The **telemarketing regulatory costs** for a fiscal year are defined as:
  - The portion of the CRTC’s **total annual expenditures** (as published in the **Government of Canada’s Estimates**, including **Part III** and **Supplementary Estimates**) that:
    - Are **attributable to the CRTC’s responsibilities under section 41.2** of the Telecommunications Act (i.e., telemarketing regulation), **and**
    - Are **not recovered** through other regulations under **section 68** of the Act.

> In other words, only the **direct, non-recovered costs** related to telemarketing oversight are included.

---

## 📢 Public Disclosure Requirements

The CRTC is required to publish annually in **Canada Gazette, Part I**, the following:

1. **Telemarketing regulatory costs** for the fiscal year.
2. **Total amount of all fees paid** under subsection 3(1) in the **previous completed fiscal year**.

> This ensures **transparency** and allows the public and stakeholders to verify how fees are used and whether the system is fair and accountable.

---

## 🚀 Effective Date

- These regulations **come into force on April 1, 2013**.

> This means that all fee obligations, subscription rules, and refund processes apply from that date forward.

## 🔍 Key Objectives and Principles

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Funding for Regulation** | Provides a stable, predictable source of revenue to fund the CRTC’s telemarketing oversight activities. |
