**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun (GST) Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to make orders related to financial administration, particularly in matters involving tax remission or adjustment, when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

The regulation specifically applies to the **First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun (NNYD)** and concerns the **remission (forgiveness or cancellation) of Goods and Services Tax (GST)** that was previously paid by individuals during a specified period.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant a remission of GST** that was paid by eligible persons between **October 1, 1997, and March 31, 2001**, in accordance with the terms of the **First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun Self-Government Agreement**. This remission is structured as a **refund equivalent** to what is provided under specific sections of the Agreement — namely, **Sections 15.7 to 15.11** — and is intended to recognize and support the self-governance and financial autonomy of the First Nation.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
- **"Agreement"**: Refers to the **First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun Self-Government Agreement**, signed on **May 29, 1993**, as it was **amended and read on April 1, 2001**. This version includes the provisions that govern the financial and administrative arrangements between the First Nation and the federal government.
- **"Person"**: Defined in accordance with **subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act**, which broadly refers to individuals, corporations, or other entities subject to excise tax obligations. In this context, it applies to any individual or entity that paid GST during the relevant period.

---

### **4. Scope of the Remission**
- The remission applies to **GST paid by a "person"** during the period from **October 1, 1997, to March 31, 2001**.
- The amount of remission is **limited to and structured exactly as a refund** provided under **Sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**.
- This means the remission is not a blanket cancellation of tax but is **specifically tied to the financial provisions agreed upon in the Self-Government Agreement**, which may include conditions, eligibility criteria, or calculation methods for refunds.

---

### **5. Key Condition: Exclusion of Other Refund Rights**
- The remission **does not allow for a refund under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**.
- This is a critical condition: **no refund can be claimed under Section 18.1**, which may otherwise provide for general tax relief or refunds for First Nations. This ensures that the remission is **exclusive** to the terms of the self-government agreement and prevents overlap or duplication of benefits.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on April 2, 2001**.
- This date is strategically chosen to coincide with the **April 1, 2001** date when the Self-Government Agreement was last amended and read, ensuring alignment with the agreement’s effective version.

---

### **7. Conditional Validity**
- The Order **does not come into force unless** the amendment adding **Sections 15.7 to 15.11** to the Self-Government Agreement has been **consented to in accordance with Section 6.2 of the Agreement** by **April 1, 2001**.
- Section 6.2 of the Agreement likely outlines the **consent process** required for amending the self-government agreement, including consultation with the First Nation, approval by the federal government, and possibly a formal vote or agreement by the First Nation council.
- This condition ensures **legitimacy and consent-based governance** — the federal government cannot unilaterally impose this remission without the First Nation’s formal agreement to the amendment.

---

### **8. Public Interest and Policy Rationale**
The Order reflects a policy of **supporting Indigenous self-governance** and **financial equity**. By remitting GST paid during a period when the First Nation was establishing its self-governance framework, the federal government acknowledges the financial burden placed on the First Nation during the transition period. This supports the broader goals of the Self-Government Agreement, including financial independence and the ability of the First Nation to manage its own affairs without undue federal financial intervention.
