**Detailed Summary of the Fort McMurray Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled the **Fort McMurray Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. These rules establish specific zoning and height restrictions around Fort McMurray Airport in Alberta to ensure aviation safety by controlling the construction and development of buildings, structures, and objects near the airport.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and enforceability, the regulations define several key terms:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Fort McMurray Airport**, located in the vicinity of Fort McMurray, Province of Alberta.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation measurements.  
  - Defined in **Part I of the Schedule**.  
  - **Deemed to be at 1,205 feet above sea level** for all purposes within these regulations.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (specifically runway 07–25).  
  - Slope ratio: **1 foot vertically to 50 feet horizontally** (1:50).  
  - Rises to an imaginary horizontal line **1,000 feet above the elevation at the end of the runway**.  
  - Horizontal extent: **50,000 feet from the end of the runway**.  
  - Outer ends of this line are **8,000 feet from the runway centerline**.  
  - Applies to both **runway approach 07** and **runway approach 25**.  
  - Excludes any portion within the vertical projections of the **Clearwater Indian Reserve No. 175**.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An imaginary surface that forms a **constant elevation boundary** above the airport reference point.  
  - At **150 feet above the ARP (1,205 ft = 1,355 ft AGL)**.  
  - Where this plane is **less than 30 feet above ground level**, the surface is instead **30 feet above ground** to ensure practicality.  
  - Acts as a general boundary for all development around the airport.

- **Strip**:  
  The central landing area of the airport, including runways.  
  - For **runway 07–25**:  
    - **Width**: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of the centerline).  
    - **Length**: 7,400 feet.  
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule** and shown on Department of Public Works Plan E.1017.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending **outward and upward from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**.  
  - Slope ratio: **1 foot vertically to 7 feet horizontally** (1:7).  
  - Extends upward until it intersects the **outer surface**.  
  - Ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the broader outer surface boundary.

### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**

These regulations apply to **all land and underwater areas** (including public road allowances) that fall within the following boundaries:

#### a) **Outer Limits of the Airport Zone**  
- Defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.  
- Described by boundary lines that follow:
  - **North**: Northern boundaries of Section 36, Township 88, Range 9, and Sections 31–35, Township 88, Range 8, and their extensions across road allowances.  
  - **East**: Eastern boundaries of Sections 14, 23, 26, and 35, Township 88, Range 8, and their extensions.  
  - **South**: Southern boundaries of Sections 14–18, Township 88, Range 8, and Section 13, Township 88, Range 9.  
  - **West**: Western boundaries of Sections 13, 24, 25, and 36, Township 88, Range 9.  
- These boundaries are **graphically depicted** on **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1017**, dated **September 28, 1972**.

#### b) **Land Directly Beneath the Approach Surface**  
- Applies to land directly beneath the approach surfaces, **excluding**:
  - Land that is part of the airport itself.
  - Land that forms part of the **Clearwater Indian Reserve No. 175**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The **Minister provision** (originally included) has been **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, Section 2**, meaning it no longer has legal force.

### **4. Prohibited Development**

No person may:
- **Erect, construct, or add to** any building, structure, or object on any land or underwater area covered by these regulations,  
- **If the highest point** of that structure **exceeds the elevation** of any of the following surfaces **at the location of that point**:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> This means that **all structures must remain below or at the level** of these defined surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

---

### **5. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is **aviation safety**. By establishing strict height limits and spatial boundaries:

- They prevent obstructions to aircraft visibility and flight paths.
- They reduce the risk of collision with structures during critical phases of flight.
- They ensure that the airport’s operational environment remains unimpeded by tall or large structures.

The use of **imaginary surfaces** (approach, transitional, outer) allows for a scientifically calculated buffer zone that accounts for:
- Aircraft approach angles.
- Visibility requirements.
- Wind and terrain factors.

These surfaces are based on **standard aviation safety standards**, and their design reflects best practices in airport zone planning.

---

### **6. Reference to Plans and Maps**

All boundaries and surfaces are **graphically illustrated** on the following official document:
- **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1017**, dated **September 28, 1972**.

This plan serves as the **primary reference** for:
- Determining the exact location of the airport reference point.
- Locating the outer limits of the regulated zone.
- Visualizing the approach, transitional, and outer surfaces.

> Any development or construction project must be reviewed against this plan to ensure compliance.

---

### **7. Key Exceptions**

- The regulations **do not apply** to:
  - Land that is part of the **airport** (e.g., runways, taxiways, terminal areas).
  - Land that forms part of the **Clearwater Indian Reserve No. 175** (a First Nations reserve).

> This recognition of Indigenous land rights reflects a balance between safety regulations and Indigenous land ownership.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in this excerpt, enforcement would typically involve:
- Zoning officers or municipal authorities.
- Development applications requiring pre-approval.
- Height and setback assessments using the defined surfaces.
- Potential penalties for non-compliance.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Fort McMurray Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and precise framework to protect aviation safety by defining **strict height and spatial boundaries** around Fort McMurray Airport. By setting limits on structures through the use of **approach, transitional, and outer surfaces**, the regulations ensure that no obstruction will interfere with aircraft operations—particularly during takeoff and landing. The rules are grounded in technical aviation standards, supported by a detailed map (Plan E.1017), and apply to a clearly defined area around the airport, with recognized exceptions for airport land and Indigenous reserves.

These regulations represent a critical component of regional planning and infrastructure safety in Alberta’s growing energy and transportation corridor.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The Fort McMurray Airport Zoning Regulations restrict all construction and development near the airport to ensure aviation safety by enforcing strict height limits based on defined approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, all referenced to a fixed elevation point and illustrated on a 1972 public works plan.
