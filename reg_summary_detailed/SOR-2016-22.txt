## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Cost Recovery Regulations**

### 🔹 **1. Background and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**:  
  These regulations are made under **Section 30.1c** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act"), which provides the authority for cost recovery mechanisms in offshore petroleum operations between Canada and Nova Scotia.

- **Publication and Consultation**:
  - A proposed version of the regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 11, 2015**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit written representations to the Minister of Natural Resources.
  - The Minister consulted the **Provincial Minister of Nova Scotia**, who approved the regulations.
  - The final regulations were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 1988, c. 28 (original Act)

### 🔹 **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a **transparent, fair, and accountable cost recovery system** for the **Marine Board of Canada–Nova Scotia (the "Board")**. The Board is responsible for regulating offshore petroleum activities in the shared jurisdiction between Canada and Nova Scotia.

Key goals include:
- Ensuring that applicants and operators **cover the actual regulatory costs** incurred by the Board in carrying out its duties.
- Providing **predictability and transparency** in fee structures through clear formulas and published cost benchmarks.
- Encouraging compliance with regulatory requirements by introducing a **"heavy burden coefficient"** for non-compliance or negligence.
- Preventing cost overruns and ensuring fiscal responsibility in the regulatory process.

### 🔹 **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*. |
| **Actual Full Cost** | The total cost confirmed by the Board’s audited financial statements. This is the real, verified cost of regulatory activities. |
| **Direct Regulatory Activities** | Activities essential to fulfilling regulatory responsibilities, such as:<br>• Assessing applications<br>• Issuing licenses<br>• Granting approvals<br>• Verifying compliance<br>• Providing information and services |
| **Indirect Regulatory Costs** | Support functions that enable direct activities, including:<br>• Office space, supplies, equipment<br>• Professional services (legal, accounting, IT)<br>• Travel, training, HR, finance, communications<br>• Preparation of policies, guidelines, and technical advice |
| **Project** | Any work or activity under paragraph 142(1)(b) of the Act, including development, production, abandonment, exploratory drilling, or multi-year/seismic programs. |

### 🔹 **4. Regulatory Activity Plan and Annual Charge Calculation**

#### ✅ For **New Projects**:
- Upon receiving a **project description or letter of intent**, the Board must:
  1. Prepare a **regulatory activity plan** outlining the scope and timeline of regulatory actions.
  2. Calculate an **estimated annual charge** based on:
     - The estimated total number of **units of time** required to perform direct regulatory activities in that fiscal year.
     - Any other costs (excluding those calculated via other cost recovery methods).
  3. Notify the applicant/operator **in writing** of:
     - The regulatory activity plan
     - The estimated annual charge

#### ✅ For **Existing Projects**:
- After the Board’s annual budget is approved (following submission under subsection 28(2) of the Act), the Board must:
  1. Prepare a **new regulatory activity plan**.
  2. Recalculate the **estimated annual charge** using the same methodology as above.
  3. Notify the applicant/operator in writing of:
     - The updated regulatory activity plan
     - The revised estimated annual charge

> ⚠️ **Change Management**:  
> If an applicant or operator proposes changes to the project that are **not reflected in the regulatory activity plan**, the Board may **recalculate** the annual charge and adjust the payable amount accordingly.

---

### 🔹 **5. Quarterly Invoicing and Payment**

- The Board must issue a **quarterly invoice** for **25% of the estimated annual charge** to each applicant/operator who has been notified under paragraph 2(c) or 3(c).
- Payment is due within **30 days** of the invoice date.
- This ensures steady, predictable revenue flow for the Board and allows for ongoing operational funding.

---

### 🔹 **6. Annual Cost Adjustment and Final Settlement**

At the end of each fiscal year, the Board must:

1. **Calculate the actual full cost** of implementing the regulatory activity plan (based on audited financial statements).
2. **Calculate a charge adjustment** by subtracting the **estimated annual charge** from the **actual full cost**.
3. **Notify the applicant/operator in writing** of:
   - The actual full cost
   - The charge adjustment (positive or negative)

> 📌 **Adjustment Rules**:
> - If **actual cost < estimated charge**:  
>   → The difference is **credited** to the applicant/operator’s account and **refunded** on the next invoice.
> - If **actual cost > estimated charge**:  
>   → The Board issues an invoice for the difference, and the applicant/operator must pay it within **30 days**.

This mechanism ensures that applicants pay only for the **real costs incurred**, promoting fairness and accountability.

### 🔹 **7. Units of Time and Cost Recovery Formulae**

#### 🔹 Base Units of Time
- Published by the Board based on estimated time required for each regulatory activity (as detailed in the tables under section 9).
- Used as a standard metric for measuring workload.

#### 🔹 Variable Units of Time
- Published for specific variables (e.g., number of vessels or aircraft used).
- Calculated based on the **number of primary vessels or aircraft** involved in an activity.

#### 🔹 Effective Rate
- A rate derived from:
  $$
  \text{Effective Rate} = \frac{\text{Total estimated cost of direct regulatory activities + indirect costs}}{\text{Total units of time spent}} - \text{Unrecovered costs (e.g., for ministerial requests)}
  $$
- This rate is used to calculate fees for most activities.

#### 🔹 Heavy Burden Coefficient
- A **multiplier applied when**:
  - An applicant/operator fails to comply with the Act
  - Shows negligence or lack of effort in responding to Board questions
- The Board may apply this coefficient to increase the fee for the activity to reflect **additional time and effort** required due to non-compliance.

> 💡 Purpose: To incentivize compliance and penalize poor performance.

### 🔹 **8. Fee Determination Formulas**

| Activity Type | Formula |
|-------------|--------|
| **Standard activities** (base units) | Fee = (Base Units of Time) × (Effective Rate) |
| **Activities with heavy burden** | Fee = (Base Units of Time) × (Effective Rate) × (Heavy Burden Coefficient) |
| **Activities with variable units** | Fee = (Variable Units of Time × Number of Vessels/Aircraft) × (Effective Rate) × (Heavy Burden Coefficient, if applicable) |

> These formulas ensure fees are **proportional to workload and complexity**.

### 🔹 **9. Daily Access Rate for Geodata Centre**

- Any person **other than**:
  - Academic researchers
  - The Federal Minister
  - The Provincial Minister  
  must pay a **daily access rate** for each day they access a physical sample at the **geodata centre**.
- The rate is **published electronically** and must be accessible to applicants and operators.

> Purpose: To generate revenue for maintaining and operating the geodata centre.

---

### 🔹 **10. Reimbursement for Non-Standard Activities**

The Board may require **full reimbursement** for costs related to activities not covered in Parts 1–3, including:

- Verification of compliance involving **travel to other locations**
- Participation in the **Oil and Gas Committee**
- Technical analysis or process reviews **requested by applicants**
- Public reviews, hearings, or inquiries **related to specific projects**
- Participant funding programs under the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012*
- Information, products, or services **requested by a third party**

> This ensures the Board can cover essential, ad-hoc regulatory work.

---

### 🔹 **11. Interest on Delinquent Payments**

- Interest is calculated and compounded **monthly at 1.5%**.
- It begins on the **due date** and accrues until the payment is received.
- Interest is **payable and enforceable** during the period between the due date and the day before receipt.

> Purpose: To encourage timely payments and provide financial incentive for prompt settlement.
