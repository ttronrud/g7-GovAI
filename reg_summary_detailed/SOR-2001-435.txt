**Detailed Summary of the Total Assets for Public Holding Requirements (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **section 531a of the Trust and Loan Companies Act** (TLC Act). This provision grants the government the authority to establish specific requirements related to the public holding levels of trust and loan companies, ensuring transparency, stability, and accountability in the financial sector.

---

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to **define what constitutes "total assets" for a trust and loan company** at a given point in time. This definition is critical for compliance with **subsection 380(3) of the Trust and Loan Companies Act**, which governs the public holding requirements—specifically, the minimum percentage of a company’s total assets that must be held by the public (i.e., not by insiders or affiliated entities).

**3. Definition of "Total Assets"**  
Under these regulations, **"total assets"** of a trust and loan company at a particular time is defined as:  
> *The total value of the assets that would be reported on its balance sheet, prepared as at that time, in accordance with the accounting principles and specifications set out by the Superintendent under subsection 313(4) of the Trust and Loan Companies Act.*

This means:
- The calculation of total assets follows **standardized accounting practices**.
- The balance sheet must be prepared in compliance with the **accounting standards** established by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** (a key regulatory body under the TLC Act).
- The standards referenced in subsection 313(4) are the official accounting principles adopted by the regulator for financial reporting in the trust and loan company sector.

This ensures consistency, comparability, and regulatory reliability in determining the company’s asset base for public holding purposes.

**4. Regulatory Effective Date**  
The regulations **come into force on the date that Section 3 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (FCACA), Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001, comes into force**.

- The FCACA was enacted to strengthen consumer protection and financial regulation in Canada.
- Section 3 of this Act likely establishes the operational framework for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), including the implementation of regulatory requirements for financial institutions.
- Therefore, the effective date of these regulations is **aligned with the broader regulatory framework** of the FCACA, ensuring coherence in financial regulation across institutions.

*Note: These regulations were in force as of October 24, 2001, as referenced in SI/2001-102 (Statutory Instrument 2001-102).*

**5. Key Implications and Context**

- It supports **market transparency**, as investors and regulators can assess the proportion of assets held by the public versus private (e.g., insiders or related parties).
- It strengthens **financial stability and accountability**, reducing the risk of insider control and enhancing public trust in financial institutions.
- The reliance on the Superintendent’s accounting standards ensures that the measurement aligns with current regulatory and financial reporting practices.

**6. Legal and Regulatory Significance**  
- These regulations are **binding and enforceable** under the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
- They are part of a broader regulatory ecosystem designed to protect consumers, maintain financial integrity, and ensure equitable access to financial services.
