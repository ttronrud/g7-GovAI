**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title and Authority:**  
The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207). This provision empowers the federal government to reassign certain duties, powers, and functions among different ministers in the Department of Public Service and Procurement, or in other departments, as part of a broader public service restructuring.

**Key Provision:**  
The regulation transfers the following responsibilities from the **Minister of National Revenue** to the **Minister of Transport**:

1. **Control and Supervision of the Royal Canadian Mint**  
   This includes all authority, oversight, and administrative responsibility related to the day-to-day operations, strategic direction, and governance of the Royal Canadian Mint. The Minister of Transport assumes full control and supervision over the institution, including its financial management, operational planning, and compliance with relevant laws and policies.

2. **Powers, Duties, and Functions of the Minister of National Revenue under the Royal Canadian Mint Act**  
   This refers to all statutory responsibilities, legal authorities, and administrative functions that the Minister of National Revenue previously exercised under the *Royal Canadian Mint Act*. These include:
   - Approving the mint’s annual budget and financial plans
   - Authorizing the production and issuance of coins and medals
   - Overseeing the mint’s compliance with federal laws and regulations
   - Approving design proposals and minting specifications
   - Managing the mint’s relationship with the Government of Canada and external stakeholders

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer of these responsibilities becomes effective on **February 6, 2006**.

**Rationale and Context:**  
This transfer reflects a broader reorganization of federal government responsibilities aimed at improving efficiency and aligning departmental mandates with national priorities. The Royal Canadian Mint, while historically associated with the Department of National Revenue due to its role in currency issuance and tax-related financial oversight, was repositioned under the Minister of Transport as part of a strategic shift to strengthen the role of transportation and infrastructure in Canada’s national identity and economic policy.

This move may also reflect a recognition of the mint’s symbolic and cultural importance—particularly in relation to national identity, heritage, and the promotion of Canadian values—aligning it more closely with the Minister of Transport’s mandate to promote national infrastructure, safety, and public services.

**Implications:**  
- The **Minister of Transport** now bears full responsibility for the Royal Canadian Mint’s operations, including its role in producing commemorative coins, circulating currency, and managing public engagement initiatives.
- The **Minister of National Revenue** no longer exercises any statutory or administrative authority over the mint, though it may retain oversight of financial reporting or tax-related aspects if they intersect with mint operations.
- The *Royal Canadian Mint Act* remains in force, but its implementation is now directed by the Minister of Transport, who must ensure compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant reallocation of federal government responsibilities, transferring the control and oversight of the Royal Canadian Mint from the Department of National Revenue to the Department of Transport. It is effective as of February 6, 2006, and underscores a shift in how Canada manages national institutions that serve both economic and symbolic functions. The transfer enhances coordination between national currency policy and broader transportation and infrastructure objectives, reflecting a modernized approach to public service governance.
