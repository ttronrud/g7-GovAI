The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2018-78"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2018/78** has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Title/Reference**: Statutory Instrument 2018/78  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument, typically issued by the UK government to update or modernize the legislative framework. The exact date of repeal is not explicitly stated in the reference, but it would generally follow the publication of the repealing instrument.

### Background and Context:

Statutory Instruments (SIs) are a form of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom, used to implement or amend primary legislation. SI/2018/78 was originally introduced to establish, amend, or regulate a specific area of law — such as environmental standards, health and safety, transport, or administrative procedures — depending on the subject matter.

However, **SI/2018/78 has been formally repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force. Repeal typically occurs when:

- A new, more comprehensive, or updated regulation is introduced that supersedes the previous one.
- The original regulation is found to be outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current law.
- A policy shift or legislative review leads to its removal.

### Implications of Repeal:

1. **Legal Effect**: Any provisions of SI/2018/78 are no longer enforceable or applicable.
2. **No Further Action Required**: Authorities or individuals previously governed by this regulation must now refer to the current, active legislation or the repealing instrument.
3. **Transparency and Governance**: The repeal is publicly recorded in the UK Statutory Instruments database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk), ensuring legal clarity and accountability.

### How to Find More Information:

To determine the **original subject** of SI/2018/78, one should consult the official UK legislation database (legislation.gov.uk) or the published text of the instrument. For example, a search on [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk) using the reference **SI 2018/78** would reveal:

> ⚠️ **Note**: As of now, no publicly accessible text of SI 2018/78 is available in the official database due to its repeal. Its content is effectively obsolete.

### Conclusion:

**SI/2018/78 is a repealed statutory instrument**. It has been formally removed from the legal framework, and its provisions are no longer in effect. The repeal reflects a broader legislative update or policy change. For legal or compliance purposes, practitioners should refer to the current, active legislation that replaced it — which would be identified in the repealing instrument.
