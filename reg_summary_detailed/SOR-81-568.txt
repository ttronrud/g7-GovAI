### **Detailed Summary of the Villeneuve Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Purpose**
The **Villeneuve Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations establish specific zoning and elevation controls around **Villeneuve Airport** in Alberta to ensure safe aviation operations by limiting structures and natural features that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, or approach.

These regulations are officially titled:  
**"The Villeneuve Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Villeneuve Airport located in Township 54, Range 27, West of the Fourth Meridian, Province of Alberta. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. Defined as: Starting at the end of the centerline of runway 26L, then moving west 1,752 feet along the centerline of runway 08R–26L, then south 2,050 feet perpendicularly to reach the ARP. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (for all runways). It slopes upward at a **1:50 ratio** (1 foot rise per 50 feet horizontal) to a horizontal line 200 feet above the end of the strip. For runway 26L, this extends to **600 feet vertically** and **10,000 feet horizontally** from the end, with the outer edge 1,250 feet from the centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the ARP elevation** (2,227 feet above sea level). However, if the ground elevation is less than 30 feet above the surface, the outer surface is set at **30 feet above ground level** to prevent unsafe undercutting. |
| **Strip** | The designated area (runway plus approach zones) for aircraft takeoff and landing. Each strip is defined by width and length, with specific dimensions based on runway orientation. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot rise per 7 feet horizontal), until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface adjacent to a neighboring strip. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 2,227 feet above sea level.

#### **3. Geographic Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to **all lands**, including public road allowances, that lie **within the outer limits** described in **Part II of the Schedule**.

This boundary is a complex, multi-segmented polygon that encircles the airport and includes:
- Sections 36, 35, 27, 22, 21, 16, 15, 10, 3, 2, and 1 of Township 54, Range 27, West of the Fourth Meridian.
- Road allowances and highway corridors (e.g., Plan 350 T.R., Plan 7821436, Plan 3949 T.R.) are incorporated into the boundary.
- The boundary ultimately closes by returning to the starting point after traversing the full perimeter.

This ensures that **all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport** is subject to the zoning rules.

---

#### **4. Prohibitions on Structures and Objects**
No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any new building, structure, or object;
- **Add to an existing building, structure, or object**  
on any land within the regulated zone  
**if the highest point of that object exceeds**:
- The **approach surface**,
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surface**.

> This rule is designed to prevent obstacles (such as trees, towers, or buildings) from interfering with aircraft during critical phases of flight (approach, takeoff, landing).

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring:
- The **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.

This provision allows regulatory enforcement to maintain visual and physical clearance, even for natural features.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Waste Accumulation**
No owner or occupier may:
- Use any part of the regulated land for the **disposal or accumulation of waste, materials, or substances** that are:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**.

> This rule is critical for **aviation safety**, as bird strikes pose a significant risk to aircraft. Preventing food sources or debris that attract birds helps reduce the likelihood of bird-related incidents.

---

#### **7. Description of Key Components (Based on Department of Public Works Plan No. E1455, June 21, 1978)**

##### **Approach Surfaces**
- Eight approach surfaces are defined, corresponding to the ends of the following runways:
  - 08L, 26R, 08R, 26L, 16L, 34R, 16R, 34L
- Each surface is an inclined plane rising at a **1:50 slope** to a horizontal plane **200 feet above the end of the strip**.
- **Exception for 26L**: Extends **600 feet vertically** and **10,000 feet horizontally** from the end of the strip.
- The outer ends of these horizontal lines are **1,250 feet from the centerline** of the runway.

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring a clear visual and physical path.

##### **Outer Surface**
- A horizontal plane at **150 feet above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 2,227 + 150 = 2,377 feet above sea level).
- **Exception**: If the ground elevation is less than 30 feet above ground level, the outer surface is set at **30 feet above ground** to avoid creating unsafe "dips" in terrain.

> This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any object across the entire airport perimeter.

##### **Strip Dimensions**
Each runway strip has a **500-foot width** (250 feet on each side of the centerline) and specific lengths:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 08L–26R | 500 ft | 4,400 ft (200 ft beyond each end) |
| 08R–26L | 500 ft | 4,300 ft (200 ft beyond 08R; 600 ft beyond 26L) |
| 16L–34R | 500 ft | 3,900 ft (200 ft beyond each end) |
| 16R–34L | 500 ft | 4,400 ft (200 ft beyond each end) |

> These strips define the active areas where aircraft operate, and their extended approach zones are protected by approach and transitional surfaces.

##### **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot rise per 7 feet horizontal) from the **lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces**.
- Extend upward until they meet:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - Another transitional surface adjacent to a neighboring strip.
- These surfaces ensure smooth, continuous clearance between the runway edge and the outer boundary, preventing abrupt changes in terrain or obstruction height.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue directions for removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions.
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative action, including notices, fines, or legal proceedings if violations occur.

---

#### **9. Overall Objectives and Safety Implications**
The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining unobstructed flight paths during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Prevent bird-related hazards** by eliminating food sources and waste that attract birds.
3. **Establish clear, measurable boundaries** for land use around the airport using precise geometric definitions and elevation standards.
4. **Provide a standardized, legally binding framework** that applies uniformly across all adjacent lands, including public roads and private properties.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Villeneuve Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive, technically precise, and safety-focused set of land-use controls designed to protect aviation operations at Villeneuve Airport. By defining specific elevation limits (approach, outer, transitional surfaces), establishing clear boundaries, and restricting hazardous activities (such as waste accumulation and excessive vegetation), the regulations serve to:

- Minimize risks to aircraft,
- Prevent bird strikes,
- Maintain visual and physical clarity during flight operations,
- And ensure compliance through enforceable, measurable standards.
