The regulation you provided — **SOR/2016-163, s. 2** — is a **definition and operational framework** for the **safety and operational requirements of Canadian fishing vessels**, particularly those under **24.4 meters in length and 150 gross tonnage or less**. Although the regulation is marked as *repealed*, it appears to have been part of a broader set of safety regulations governing fishing vessels in Canada prior to its replacement or integration into newer legislation (such as the *Fishing Vessels Safety Regulations* or related amendments under the *Marine Safety and Environmental Protection Act*).

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the content, organized by key themes and sections for clarity and regulatory understanding.

## 🔍 OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATION

- **Status**: *Repealed* (SOR/2016-163, s. 2) — This means the definitions and provisions are no longer in force as of the date of repeal.
- **Applicability**: Applies to **Canadian fishing vessels** not exceeding:
  - **24.4 meters in hull length**
  - **150 gross tonnage**
- **Purpose**: To establish **safety standards**, **equipment requirements**, **operational procedures**, and **maintenance obligations** for fishing vessels operating in Canadian waters.
- **Key Legal Frameworks Referenced**:
  - *SOLAS* (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea)
  - *IS Code* (International Code on Intact Stability)
  - *LSA Code* (Life-Saving Appliance Code)
  - *TP 127*, *TP 1332*, *TP 14475* (Canadian technical standards)
  - IMO Resolutions (e.g., MSC.81(70), MSC.48(66), MSC.267(85))

## 📚 DEFINITIONS (KEY TERMS)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Fishing Vessel** | A vessel used or intended for commercial fishing, harvesting, or transporting fish or other living marine resources. |
| **Length** | Measured from the forward end of the foremost hull surface to the aft end of the aftermost hull surface. Special rules apply if no rudder stock or permanent structure exists. |
| **Hull Length** | Distance from the forward end to the aft end of the hull shell (outer surface). |
| **Amidships** | Midpoint of the vessel’s length — used differently in different parts of the regulation (Part 0.1 vs. Parts I & II). |
| **Closed Construction** | More than 50% of the vessel’s length is covered full width by decks or permanent enclosures at or above the gunwale. |
| **Open Construction** | The opposite of closed construction — no such coverage. |
| **New Vessel** | Construction began on or after January 6, 1965. For foreign vessels entering Canadian registry, “new” status applies regardless of construction date. |
| **Existing Vessel** | Not new — any vessel built before or after that date, but not classified as new. |
| **Power-Driven** | Vessel propelled by an engine or has one on board. |
| **Permanently Installed** | Securely fastened so tools are required to remove. |
| **Readily Accessible** | Can be reached safely and easily during emergencies without tools. |
| **Watertight** | Prevents water passage under design head pressure in any direction. |
| **Weathertight** | No water penetration under normal sea conditions. |
| **Lifejacket** | Includes SOLAS, Class 1/2, standard, or small vessel lifejackets. |
| **Lifebuoy** | SOLAS or small vessel type. |
| **Life Raft** | SOLAS, reduced capacity, or coastal raft. |
| **EPIRB** | Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon. |
| **Pyrotechnic Distress Signal** | Rocket flares, hand flares, smoke signals. |
| **Sound-Signalling Device** | Pealess whistle or electric/compressed-gas horn. |
| **Reboarding Device** | Ladder, harness, or apparatus to assist people reboarding from water. |
| **Recovery Boat** | Auxiliary boat used in emergencies. |
| **Machinery Space** | Any space containing propulsion, steering, generators, boilers, or major electrical systems. |
| **Engine Space** | Space containing propulsion or auxiliary engines and connected areas. |
| **Classification Society** | Member of IACS (International Association of Classification Societies). |
| **Product Certification Body** | Accredited body certifying products meet safety standards. |
| **Recommended Practices & Standards** | Industry or government-issued standards for marine use. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: References to "near coastal voyage, Class 2" include "inland voyage" **except** in specific provisions (e.g., 3.25(1), 3.27(1) subparas b(ii)).

## 🚢 VESSEL OPERATIONAL AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### 1. **Design, Construction, and Equipment**
- The **authorized representative** must ensure the vessel is:
  - Designed and constructed to operate safely and be **seaworthy** in its area of operation.
- If the **Minister** has reasonable grounds to believe the vessel is unsafe, they may require the representative to prove compliance with safety requirements.

### 2. **Stability and Modifications**
- Any modification affecting **vessel stability** must be recorded.
- Record must be maintained in a form and manner specified by the Minister.
- For vessels that have undergone a stability assessment, the modification record is retained **until a new stability assessment** is conducted.

### 3. **Freezing Spray Conditions**
- **No operation** in areas where Environment Canada issues a **freezing spray warning** unless:
  - A **stability assessment** confirms safe operation in freezing spray with ice accretion.
- Vessels must carry **means to remove accumulated ice** from the hull.

### 4. **Pre-Operation Notification**
- Before first service, the authorized representative must inform the Minister of:
  - Intention to operate the vessel.
  - Physical characteristics (size, length, tonnage, etc.).
  - Nature of operation (e.g., trawling, purse seining).
- The representative must provide this information upon request.

### 5. **Design Limitations and Safe Operation**
- **No operation** beyond the vessel’s **design limitations**.
- **No careless operation** — must be conducted with due care, attention, and consideration for others.

### 6. **Lifejacket Requirements**
- **All persons on board** must wear a lifejacket when:
  - Vessel has **no deck or deck structure** → all must wear lifejackets.
  - Vessel has a **deck** → all persons on the deck or in the cockpit must wear lifejackets.

### 7. **Weather-Exposed Openings**
- Openings exposed to weather must be **closed** when not needed for operations.
- If danger of water entry exists, they must be **closed immediately**.

### 8. **Maintenance and Tools**
- Tools and spare parts for routine maintenance and minor repairs must be:
  - Carried on board.
  - Secured in a **readily accessible location**.

### 9. **Fuel Safety (Gasoline-Powered Vessels)**
- **Engine space blower must run for at least 4 minutes** before starting the engine.
- **No fuel leakage** allowed.
- **Fuel discharge** must comply with *Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemicals Regulations*.
- **Fueling rules**:

2. Measures to:
   - Prevent falls overboard.
   - Retrieve persons who fall overboard.
   - Protect limbs from rotating equipment.
