### **Key Provisions:**

#### 1. **Designation of Areas:**
- The regulation designates certain **surveyed areas** (identified by unique survey numbers) as:
  - **Towns**
  - **Visitor Centres**
  - **Resort Subdivisions**
- These designations are based on **official survey plans** listed in the **Schedule** attached to the regulation.
- Each designated area is clearly defined in the schedule by:
  - **Survey number(s)** (e.g., 50523, 42293, etc.)
  - **Jurisdictional province** (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba)
  - **Type of designation** (town, visitor centre, or resort subdivision)

#### 2. **Jurisdictional Coverage:**
The designations span **four provinces**:
| Province       | Number of Surveyed Areas (Designated) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **British Columbia** | 34 (e.g., 50523, 51644, 52882, 42293, etc.) |
| **Alberta**           | 88 (e.g., 72468, 8071 F.H., 31133, 42914, etc.) |

> *Note: Survey numbers are unique identifiers for land parcels or plots, typically referencing cadastral or topographic survey records.*

#### 3. **Designation Types:**
- **Towns**: Permanent residential or commercial settlements with infrastructure (e.g., housing, roads, utilities).
- **Visitor Centres**: Facilities providing information, services, and recreational access (e.g., visitor information desks, restrooms, interpretive exhibits).
- **Resort Subdivisions**: Planned areas for short-term accommodation, such as hotels, cabins, or vacation rentals, typically serving tourism or recreation purposes.

### **Implementation and Legal Effect:**
- The **revocation** of the old regulations means that the previous designation rules no longer apply.
- The **new regulations take effect immediately** upon publication and are binding on all relevant government agencies, landowners, developers, and stakeholders.
- The designations are **legally enforceable** and form part of the official land-use framework within national parks.
- These designations may influence:

### **Significance and Implications:**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Conservation Balance** | Allows for limited human development while preserving natural ecosystems. |
| **Tourism Development** | Supports sustainable tourism by enabling well-planned visitor facilities and accommodations. |
| **Administrative Clarity** | Provides clear legal boundaries and classifications, reducing ambiguity in land management. |
| **Inter-Provincial Consistency** | Aligns national park management practices across provinces under a common regulatory framework. |

### **Conclusion:**
This regulation represents a significant update to the governance of human activity within national parks in Canada. By formally revoking outdated rules and replacing them with a precise, province-specific designation system, it strengthens the balance between **conservation, public access, and responsible development**. The designation of towns, visitor centres, and resort subdivisions ensures that any human presence in national parks is **planned, regulated, and environmentally sensitive**—supporting both ecological integrity and public enjoyment of Canada’s natural heritage.
