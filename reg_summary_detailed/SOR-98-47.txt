### Detailed Summary of the Tariff Item Nos. 9971.00.00 and 9992.00.00 Accounting Regulations

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations are specifically designed to govern the **accounting requirements** for certain types of goods classified under **Tariff Item Nos. 9971.00.00 and 9992.00.00** in the *Customs Tariff*. These items typically relate to **repair or alteration services** applied to goods that are then exported to specific countries.

The regulations are **not required to be published in the Canada Gazette** under *section 164(3)* of the *Customs Act* because they are **partially derived from a public announcement made on October 27, 1997**. This is explicitly stated in the text under *paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a* of the *Customs Act*, which provides that certain regulations stemming from prior public announcements do not require formal publication.

This exemption is significant because it streamlines the regulatory process—avoiding the need for a formal gazette notice—while still ensuring legal validity and enforceability.

#### **2. Legal Authority**

The regulations are issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under the following provisions of the *Customs Act*:

- **Subsection 32(1)c**: Authorizes the Minister to issue accounting regulations for specific tariff items.
- **Subsection 32(2)**: Provides for the establishment of accounting procedures for goods.
- **Subsection 32(5)d**: Grants authority to regulate the accounting of goods subject to specific conditions.
- **Paragraph 164(1)(i)e**: Allows the issuance of regulations for goods under the customs tariff when necessary for proper administration.

These provisions collectively provide the legal foundation for the creation and enforcement of these accounting rules.

#### **3. Scope of the Regulations**

The regulations apply to:

- **Goods** defined as those falling under **Tariff Item No. 9971.00.00 or 9992.00.00**, as listed in the *Schedule to the Customs Tariff*.

These tariff items generally pertain to **goods that undergo repair or alteration** (such as mechanical or structural modifications) before being exported. The key purpose of the regulations is to ensure **accurate accounting and documentation** of such modifications and their associated costs.

#### **4. Accounting Requirements**

When an importer, owner of goods, or any person authorized to account for these goods under **section 32 of the Customs Act** (specifically under paragraphs 32(6)(a) or subsection 32(7)) submits an accounting statement, they must provide **two key documents**:

1. **Invoice or Written Statement from the Person Who Performed the Repair or Alteration**  
   - Must include:
     - A **detailed description** of the repair or alteration performed.
     - The **value** (monetary amount) of the repair or alteration.

   This document serves as proof of the work done and helps verify the legitimacy and cost of modifications applied to the goods.

2. **Proof of Exportation**  
   - Must demonstrate that the goods were exported to one of the following destinations:
     - United States
     - Mexico
     - Chile
     - Costa Rica
     - Israel
     - Another country that is a **CIFTA beneficiary** (Canada–India Free Trade Agreement, or other CIFTA member)
     - An **EFTA state** (European Free Trade Association)
     - Peru
     - Colombia
     - Jordan
     - Panama
     - Honduras

   This requirement ensures that the goods are not being re-imported or diverted from their intended export path, and that the repair/alteration is part of a legitimate export transaction.

#### **5. Repeal Clauses**

The text includes two lines stating "[Repeal]" — these are likely placeholders or formatting remnants indicating that previous versions of the regulation have been replaced or superseded. However, in this version, the regulation is **not being repealed**; rather, it is being **issued as a new, current version** effective from a specific date.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on January 1, 1998**.

This date marks the start of the formal implementation of the accounting requirements for goods under tariff items 9971.00.00 and 9992.00.00. All importers, owners, or authorized accountants must comply with the rules from this date onward.

---

#### **7. Key Objectives and Purpose**

- **Ensure transparency and accountability** in the treatment of goods that undergo repair or alteration prior to export.
- **Prevent fraud or misrepresentation** by requiring detailed documentation of both the work performed and the export destination.
- **Support international trade compliance**, especially with countries that have free trade agreements with Canada (CIFTA, EFTA, etc.).
- **Align with customs administration standards** by establishing clear, enforceable procedures for accounting under section 32 of the *Customs Act*.
