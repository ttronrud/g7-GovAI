### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"P.E.I. Vegetable Information (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such in all official and legal contexts.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Commodity Board**:  
  Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Vegetable Commodity Marketing Board* (in French: *Office de commercialisation*). This body is responsible for regulating and overseeing the production, marketing, and trade of vegetables in Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.), particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

- **Person**:  
  Encompasses any individual, firm, partnership, association, or corporation that:
  - Grows or markets vegetables in P.E.I., or  
  - Has servants or agents involved in such activities.  
  This definition ensures that all entities directly or indirectly involved in vegetable production or marketing are subject to the regulation.

- **Vegetable**:  
  Defined narrowly as **any turnip produced in the Province of Prince Edward Island**.  
  → This is a critical point: the regulation applies only to *turnips*, not to other vegetables such as carrots, beets, or potatoes. The term "vegetable" is limited to turnips grown within P.E.I.

    - Exported **outside Canada**.

  - **Inspect any place or premises** used for:
    - The production (e.g., farms, fields)

    of turnips at any **reasonable time**.
