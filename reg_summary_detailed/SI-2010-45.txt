### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **exclude certain provisions of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** from applying to specific positions within **Statistics Canada** that are directly involved in **conducting the population census and agriculture census**.

These exclusions are made because:
- It is **neither practicable nor in the public interest** to apply the full scope of the PSEA’s employment rules to these roles.
- The nature of the work — administrative, management support, or data processing — is **temporary and census-specific**, requiring flexible staffing arrangements.

---

### **3. Scope of Exclusion**

#### **Applicable Positions:**
The exclusion applies to:
- Positions in **Statistics Canada** whose **function is solely** to:
  - Provide **administrative or management support**, or  
  - Perform **data processing duties**  
  for the purpose of conducting:
  - The **Population Census**  
  - The **Agriculture Census**

#### **Applicable Individuals:**
- Persons who are:
  - **Appointed** or **deployed** to these positions  
  - On a **specified term basis** (i.e., temporary, fixed-term contracts)

> ⚠️ **Exception:** The exclusion **does not apply** to persons mentioned in **subsection 5(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*. This means that certain key public servants (e.g., senior officials, permanent staff with specific responsibilities) remain subject to the full application of the PSEA.

---

### **4. Provisions Excluded from Application**

The following definitions and sections of the *Public Service Employment Act* are **excluded** from applying to the above-mentioned positions and individuals:

#### **Definitions Excluded:**
- **"Deployment"** (as defined in subsection 2(1))  
- **"Internal appointment process"** (as defined in subsection 2(1))

> This means that temporary staff can be assigned to census-related duties without going through formal internal hiring processes or being subject to deployment rules.

#### **Sections Excluded:**
- Section **40** – Relating to internal appointments and the internal appointment process  
- Section **41c** – Concerning the internal appointment process and eligibility  
- Section **48** – On internal appointment procedures and criteria  
- Sections **51 to 53d** – Covering internal appointment processes, fairness, and transparency  
- Section **57** – On internal appointments and competitive processes  
- Section **59** – On internal appointment procedures and public disclosure  
- Section **62** – On internal appointment processes and compliance

> These sections are **not triggered** for temporary census-related staff, allowing for more flexible and rapid deployment of personnel.

### **5. Legal Basis and Process**

The regulation is grounded in **section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act**, which empowers the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** to exclude certain provisions of the Act from applying in specific circumstances.

#### Key procedural elements:
- The **Public Service Commission** determined that applying the full PSEA rules to temporary census staff would be:
  - **Impractical** (due to the short duration and high volume of temporary roles)
  - **Against public interest** (as it would hinder timely and efficient census operations)
- The Commission **consulted with the employer** (Statistics Canada), as required under **subsection 20(2)** of the PSEA
- The decision was made **on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage**, reflecting interdepartmental coordination

---

### **6. Rationale and Justification**

#### Why Exclude These Provisions?
- **Census operations are time-sensitive** and require rapid mobilization of personnel.
- The work is **temporary and cyclical**, occurring only every 10 years (censuses), making long-term employment structures inefficient.
- Data processing and administrative support roles are **routine and standardized**, not requiring the competitive or transparent internal processes typical of permanent public service roles.
- Applying full PSEA rules (such as internal appointment processes, fairness assessments, and public disclosure) would **delay deployment**, increase administrative costs, and compromise census timelines.

#### Public Interest Considerations:
- Ensures **timely and accurate census data collection**
- Maintains **public trust** in the census process by avoiding unnecessary delays
- Supports **efficiency and cost-effectiveness** in national statistical operations

---

### **7. Legal and Administrative Impact**

- **No formal internal appointment process** is required for temporary census staff.
- Staff can be **quickly deployed** to census-related roles without undergoing competitive selection or lengthy review processes.
- The exclusion is **limited in scope** — only applies to temporary positions with specific functions related to census operations.
- The exclusion **does not affect** permanent staff or those covered under subsection 5(1) of the PSEA.

---

### **8. Duration and Renewal**

- The regulation is **not time-limited** in the text provided, but such exclusions are typically **renewed or reviewed** periodically, especially before each census cycle (e.g., every 10 years).
- It is **renewed automatically** for each census cycle as needed, based on the continued need for temporary staffing.

- The Order may be cited as:  
  **"Statistics Canada Census-Related Term Employment Exclusion Approval Order"**

### **10. Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **flexible, temporary staffing framework** for Statistics Canada during census operations. By excluding key employment provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*, it enables:
- Rapid deployment of personnel  
- Efficient management of administrative and data processing tasks  
- Timely completion of critical national censuses  
- Compliance with public service principles while recognizing the unique nature of temporary, census-specific work

It reflects a **pragmatic balance** between public service accountability and operational necessity, ensuring that census operations proceed without undue bureaucratic constraints.

---

✅ **In essence:**  
This regulation allows Statistics Canada to hire and deploy temporary staff for census work without being bound by standard public service hiring rules — a necessary exception to ensure the timely and effective collection of vital national data.
