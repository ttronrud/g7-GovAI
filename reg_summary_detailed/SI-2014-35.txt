**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (South Slave and North Slave Regions) Order*  
**Citation:** R.S., c. T-7  
**Issued by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 23(a) of the *Territorial Lands Act*

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories — specifically in the South Slave and North Slave regions — from disposal (i.e., sale, lease, or transfer) for a period of two years**. This action is taken to **facilitate the resolution of Aboriginal land and resource agreements**, particularly those involving First Nations communities, ensuring that land rights and resource development interests are negotiated and finalized in a fair, transparent, and culturally appropriate manner.

This withdrawal supports ongoing land negotiation processes between the Government of the Northwest Territories, the Government of Canada, and Aboriginal groups, especially the Akaitcho Dene First Nation, to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes regarding land use, sovereignty, and economic development.

### **Scope of Withdrawal**

#### **1. Tracts Withdrawn from Disposal**
- **Schedule 1**: All tracts listed in Schedule 1 are **fully withdrawn** from disposal, including:
  - The **surface rights** to the land
  - The **subsurface rights** to the land  
  → This means these lands cannot be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of during the two-year period.

- **Schedule 2**: All tracts listed in Schedule 2 are **withdrawn from disposal**, but **only the subsurface rights** are affected.  
  → Surface rights remain available for disposal under normal processes.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The withdrawal applies only to the **disposal of land**, not to other forms of land use or rights such as exploration, claims, or development permits.

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**
- The withdrawal is effective for a **period of two years**, beginning on the date the Order is made.

---

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exceptions)**

Despite the general withdrawal, the following activities and interests are **explicitly excluded** from the scope of Section 2 (the withdrawal provision):

1. **Disposal of substances or materials under the Territorial Quarrying Regulations**  
   → Quarrying operations and related material disposals are not affected.

2. **Land used for electrical transmission lines and ancillary facilities**  
   → Specifically, land required for:
   - Transmission lines
   - Ancillary infrastructure  
   associated with hydroelectric projects on:
     - The **Taltson River**
     - The **Bluefish hydroelectric dam**

3. **Land interests under the 1988 Acquisition Agreement**  
   → The agreement dated May 5, 1988, between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and:
     - The Government of the Northwest Territories
     - The Northern Canada Power Commission
     - The Northwest Territories Power Corporation  
   → Any land interests listed in this agreement are **exempt** from the withdrawal.

---

### **Additional Clarifications (For Greater Certainty)**

The Order explicitly states that the withdrawal does **not apply** to the following actions, even if they involve land or mineral rights:

| Activity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mineral claims** | - Locating a mineral claim by a holder of a prospecting permit granted **before** the Order was made<br> - Recording a mineral claim that was **already located or referred to** before the Order was made |
| **Leasing of recorded claims** | - Granting a lease under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person with a **recorded claim**, if the lease covers an area within that claim |
| **Significant discovery licences** | - Issuing a significant discovery licence under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of an exploration licence issued **before** the Order, if the licence covers the same area as the exploration licence |
| **Production licences** | - Issuing a production licence to a holder of an exploration or significant discovery licence issued **before** the Order, if the production licence covers the same area |
| **Surface leases** | - Issuing a surface lease to a claim holder (under mining regulations or petroleum interests), **if required** to allow exercise of rights under the claim or interest |
| **Renewal of interests** | - Renewing any existing interest (e.g., exploration or mining rights) under the relevant regulations |

> ✅ These exclusions ensure that **existing rights and ongoing development activities are not disrupted** by the withdrawal, preserving continuity in exploration, development, and operations.

### **Repeal Clause (Historical Land Parcels)**

This section **repeals or replaces** previous land designations related to surface–subsurface parcels in the Northwest Territories. It specifically refers to:

- All parcels of land shown as **Surface–Subsurface Lands** on **1:250,000 reference maps** that:
  - Have been **approved** by:
    - **Don Balsillie**, Akaitcho Dene First Nations Land Negotiator  
    - **Janet Pound**, Government of Canada Acting Chief Lands Negotiator  
  - Are **on file** at the **Land Negotiation Office**, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, in Yellowknife  
  - Have **copies deposited** with the **Regional Manager, Land Administration**, in Yellowknife  

> This means that any such parcels previously approved through this negotiation process are now **formally recognized and integrated** into the current land management framework, and their status is no longer subject to arbitrary disposal.

Additionally, the Order references and incorporates:

- The **Commissioner’s Order R-087-2006**, dated November 1, 2006  
- The accompanying map dated October 31, 2006  
- Amendments to that order:
  - R-072-2011  
  - R-072-2012  
  - R-075-2013  

→ These amendments updated and refined the boundaries and scope of the land parcels in question, particularly regarding **subsurface rights**. The Order confirms that the **subsurface rights** of land mirroring those identified in these orders are also protected from disposal during the two-year period.

### **Key Implications and Significance**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Aboriginal Land Rights** | Strengthens the process of negotiating land rights with First Nations, especially the Akaitcho Dene First Nation, promoting self-determination and equitable outcomes. |
| **Land Use Planning** | Provides a temporary pause on land sales or leasing, allowing time for negotiation and agreement on shared resource use and governance. |
| **Mineral Exploration Continuity** | Ensures that existing exploration and development activities (especially pre-existing claims and licences) can continue without disruption. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Offers clear boundaries on what is and is not affected by the withdrawal, reducing legal uncertainty for stakeholders. |
| **Historical Recognition** | Formally recognizes and protects land parcels that were previously negotiated and approved through formal land negotiation processes. |

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a **strategic and targeted intervention** in land management in the Northwest Territories, designed to support the **resolution of Aboriginal land and resource agreements** in the South Slave and North Slave regions. By withdrawing specific surface and subsurface tracts from disposal for two years, it creates a stable and predictable environment for negotiations between Indigenous communities and government entities.

At the same time, it **preserves critical development pathways** through clear exceptions for existing mineral claims, exploration licences, and infrastructure projects, ensuring that economic and energy development is not halted in the interest of land protection.

The Order reflects a balanced approach — one that respects Indigenous rights and self-determination while maintaining the operational continuity of resource development in a transitional period.

--- 

**Final Note:** This regulation is a key tool in Canada’s broader policy of **Indigenous land rights reconciliation**, particularly in the context of the *Treaty and Land Negotiation Framework* in the Northwest Territories.
