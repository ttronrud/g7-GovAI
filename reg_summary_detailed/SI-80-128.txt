### **Regulatory Context and Background**

This regulation, issued under the **Northern Pipeline Act** by the **Northern Pipeline Agency (Designated Officer)**, addresses the modification of the terms and conditions governing the construction and operation of a natural gas pipeline in southern British Columbia. The specific action involves:

- **Rescinding** certain obligations originally included in **Condition 7 of Schedule III** to the Northern Pipeline Act.
- **Adding new socio-economic and environmental terms and conditions** tailored specifically to Foothills Pipe Lines (South B.C.) Ltd. ("Foothills").
- The regulation is part of a broader regulatory framework designed to ensure that pipeline development in Canada respects environmental protection, Indigenous rights, community interests, and economic equity.

The original Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity was issued on **April 13, 1978**, to Foothills (South B.C.) for a pipeline route in southern British Columbia. The regulatory action stems from earlier public consultations and undertakings made during a 1976 hearing before the **National Energy Board (NEB)** regarding the "Alaska Highway Pipeline Project," which included commitments related to social, economic, and environmental matters.

Under **subsection 21(2)** of the Northern Pipeline Act, such undertakings are deemed to be terms or conditions of the certificate and are incorporated into **Schedule III** — the regulatory framework governing pipeline operations.

Under **subsection 20(4)**, the Designated Officer (Northern Pipeline Agency) has the authority to **rescind, amend, or add** to these terms and conditions with the approval of the Governor in Council.

### **Key Actions Taken in This Regulation**

#### 1. **Rescission of Condition 7 of Schedule III (in part)**
- The Designated Officer **rescinds** the original Condition 7 of Schedule III **as it applies to Foothills (South B.C.)**.
- This condition had previously included broad undertakings related to:
  - Social and economic development
  - Environmental protection
  - Fisheries, agriculture, and wildlife
- However, **one specific undertaking is preserved**:  
  → The **compensation undertaking** listed in **Item 7 under "Compensation" in Appendix 5-2, page 9 of Volume 3 of the NEB’s Reasons for Decision (June 1977)**.

> This means that while general social and environmental commitments are removed, the obligation to provide compensation (likely to landowners or affected communities) remains in force.

#### 2. **Addition of New Terms and Conditions**
A comprehensive new set of **Socio-Economic and Environmental Terms and Conditions** is added to Schedule III and becomes binding on Foothills for the specified pipeline segment.

These terms are titled:  
👉 **"Northern Pipeline Socio-Economic and Environmental Terms and Conditions for Southern British Columbia"**

They apply only to the **specific portion of the pipeline** running from:
- Near **Coleman** on the Alberta-British Columbia border
- In a **south-westerly direction** across southern BC
- To the **International Boundary Line** near **Kingsgate**, USA

This ensures geographic specificity and avoids overreach into other regions.
