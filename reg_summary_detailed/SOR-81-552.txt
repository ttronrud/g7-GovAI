### Background and Context:

- This regulation was introduced to ensure **financial accountability** and **cost recovery** for the administrative and inspection services provided by CMHC.
- The issuance of a certificate of construction start is a key regulatory step in the development process, confirming that construction has officially begun and meeting certain standards (e.g., zoning, building codes).
- Prior to this regulation, there may have been no formalized or consistent fee structure for such inspections, leading to potential cost inefficiencies or inconsistent service delivery.

---

### Significance:

- **Transparency:** Clearly defines the cost associated with a service provided by a federal agency.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** Provides a predictable fee structure that helps developers plan budgets and ensures CMHC can sustain its inspection and certification functions.
- **Compliance with Financial Administration Act:** Ensures that fees are set through a legally authorized process, maintaining fiscal accountability and public trust.

---

### Limitations or Exclusions:

- The regulation does **not cover** single-unit residential buildings or non-residential construction.
- It does **not apply** to inspections or certificates issued before August 1, 1981.
- It does not address fees for other services offered by CMHC (e.g., mortgage insurance, housing counseling).

---

### Conclusion:

The *Construction Starts Fee Order* (SI/81-81) establishes a clear, enforceable, and legally grounded fee of **$60 per certificate** for the issuance of construction start certificates for **multiple-unit residential buildings** in Canada, effective **August 1, 1981**. It ensures that the CMHC is compensated for its inspection services and promotes transparency and consistency in the regulatory process for residential construction projects.

This regulation remains a foundational piece of administrative policy in the Canadian housing development framework, particularly in relation to early-stage compliance and project certification.
