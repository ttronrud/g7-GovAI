**1. Legal Basis and Authority:**

- The regulation is issued under **section 161 of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act** (S.C. 1984, c. 18), a federal statute enacted to establish a framework for the governance and cooperation between the Cree and Naskapi peoples in Quebec.
- The Governor General in Council (the federal executive authority) acts on the **recommendation** of three key stakeholders:
  - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (representing the federal government),
  - The **Cree Regional Authority** (a governing body representing the Cree people in Quebec),
  - The **Naskapi Band of Quebec** (a self-governing Indigenous community in northern Quebec).

This collaborative process ensures that the decision reflects the interests and consensus of both Indigenous communities and the federal government.

**2. Key Provision:**

- The **City of Ottawa, Ontario**, is officially designated as the **head office location** of the **Cree-Naskapi Commission**.

This designation establishes Ottawa as the central administrative and operational hub for the Commission.

---

**3. Purpose and Significance:**

- The **Cree-Naskapi Commission** is a joint body established to promote cooperation, mutual understanding, and shared interests between the Cree and Naskapi peoples, particularly in areas such as:
  - Cultural preservation,
  - Economic development,
  - Environmental management,
  - Governance and policy coordination,
  - Cross-community initiatives.

- By locating the head office in Ottawa:

  - It enhances **intergovernmental coordination** and facilitates dialogue with other Indigenous organizations and national bodies.

**4. Jurisdictional and Geographical Context:**

- Although the Cree and Naskapi communities are primarily located in **northern Quebec**, the Commission is a cross-territorial entity established under federal law.
- The choice of Ottawa—despite the communities’ geographic location in Quebec—reflects a pragmatic decision to ensure **effective governance, administrative efficiency, and national integration**.

---

**5. Legal and Policy Implications:**

- This designation is not a transfer of land or jurisdiction but a **functional administrative decision**.
- It does not alter the **autonomy or self-governance** of the Cree or Naskapi communities; rather, it supports a collaborative, centralized structure for joint governance and coordination.
- The Commission remains a **federally recognized body** under the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act, and its operations are subject to the Act’s provisions.

**6. Date and Source:**

- The regulation was issued in **1984** (S.C. 1984, c. 18), during the early years of the Cree-Naskapi Commission’s formation.
- It is part of the **Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act**, which was passed to formalize the relationship between the two Indigenous groups and to provide a legal basis for joint governance.

**Conclusion:**
