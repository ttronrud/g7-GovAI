**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation (P.C. 2013-614)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Context**

This proclamation is issued under **Section 23 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA)**, a federal law in Canada that regulates the use and development of navigable waters and their adjacent areas. The key provisions relevant to this proclamation are:

- **Section 22** of the NWPA: This section generally **prohibits the construction, alteration, or destruction of structures** (such as dams, bridges, or other works) on or in navigable waters or their adjacent areas without a permit, unless such activities are exempted.
- **Section 23**: Allows the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on advice of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change) to issue a **proclamation** declaring certain rivers, streams, or waters — or parts thereof — **exempt from the operation of Section 22**, provided that the **public interest would not be injuriously affected** by such an exemption.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Proclamation**

The purpose of this specific proclamation is to **exempt a defined portion of South McMahon Lake — specifically the Mink Arm — from the restrictions imposed by Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**.

This exemption enables certain activities (such as construction, dredging, or modifications to the lake’s structure) that would otherwise be prohibited under the NWPA, **provided that the exemption does not harm the public interest**.

---

### **3. Geographic Scope of the Exemption**

- **Location**: South McMahon Lake, located in the province of **Saskatchewan**.
- **Specific Area**: The **Mink Arm** of South McMahon Lake.
- **Nature of Exemption**: The exemption applies **in whole or in part** to the Mink Arm. It is not a blanket exemption for the entire lake, but rather a targeted one for this specific water body.

---

### **4. Decision-Making Process**

The Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet) determined that:

- The exemption of the Mink Arm from Section 22 of the NWPA **would not injuriously affect the public interest**.
- This assessment was based on environmental, economic, social, and safety considerations, including:
  - The potential for beneficial development (e.g., infrastructure, agriculture, recreation).
  - The absence of significant environmental degradation or harm to aquatic ecosystems.
  - The lack of adverse impacts on public health, safety, or access to water resources.

This decision was formalized through **Order in Council P.C. 2013-614**, issued on **May 30, 2013**, which authorized the issuance of the proclamation.

### **5. Legal Effect of the Proclamation**

By this proclamation, the **Governor in Council formally declares** that:

> The **Mink Arm portion of South McMahon Lake** is **exempt from the operation of Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**.

This means that:

- No permit is required under Section 22 for activities such as:
  - Building or modifying structures (e.g., dams, embankments, access roads).
  - Dredging or altering the lakebed.
  - Constructing or expanding facilities on or adjacent to the Mink Arm.
- The exemption is **temporary and conditional** on the public interest not being harmed.

However, this exemption **does not override other environmental or land-use regulations**. It only removes the specific restriction under Section 22 of the NWPA.

### **6. Legal Authority and Significance**

- The proclamation is issued under the authority of the **Governor in Council**, acting on the advice of the federal Cabinet.
- It is **binding on all persons and entities** affected by the exemption, including:
  - Developers, landowners, municipalities, and government agencies.
- It is **published officially** and affixed with the **Great Seal of Canada**, confirming its legal status and enforceability.
- The proclamation is part of a broader framework of federal environmental regulation, balancing **development needs** with **environmental protection**.

### **8. Key Implications**

| Implication | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Development Flexibility** | Landowners or developers can now proceed with projects in the Mink Arm without needing a permit under Section 22. |
| **Environmental Oversight** | The exemption is conditional — it assumes no public harm. Ongoing monitoring may be required to ensure compliance. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Provides clear legal status for activities in the Mink Arm, reducing uncertainty for stakeholders. |
| **Public Interest Principle** | The decision reflects a formal evaluation that the benefits of development outweigh potential risks to public interest. |

---

### **9. Conclusion**

This proclamation is a **targeted, legally sound exemption** under the Navigable Waters Protection Act, allowing specific development activities in the Mink Arm of South McMahon Lake, Saskatchewan, without requiring a permit under Section 22. It was issued after a formal assessment by the federal government confirming that the public interest would not suffer. While it promotes development and economic activity, it remains within the broader regulatory framework designed to protect navigable waters and public welfare.

---

**Final Note**: This proclamation is a **non-binding policy decision** in the sense that it is subject to review and potential revocation if future assessments show that public interest has been harmed. It is a tool used in the federal government’s approach to balancing environmental protection with practical land-use needs.
