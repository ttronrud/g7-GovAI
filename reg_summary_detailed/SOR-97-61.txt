**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Prescription of a Territory for the Purpose of the Definition "Country" in the Customs Tariff

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 2(3)a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended). This provision allows the government to designate specific territories for the purposes of defining "country" in customs law.

**Statutory Basis:**  
- **S.C. 1996, c. 33, s. 41(3)** – Section 41(3) of the *Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act* (chapter 33 of the Statutes of Canada, 1996) provides the legal basis for the regulation.  
- **R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)** – This refers to the *Customs Tariff*, specifically the third supplementary volume, which contains the tariff schedules and definitions, including the definition of "country" for customs purposes.

**Key Provision:**  
The regulation designates a **specific territory**—the area where the **customs laws of Israel** are applied in accordance with **Article III of the Protocol on Economic Relations** (set out in **Annex V** to the *Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip*, signed on **September 28, 1995**)—as a **"prescribed territory"** for the purposes of the definition of "country" in **subsection 2(1) of the Customs Tariff**.

**Explanation of the Designated Territory:**  
- The territory in question is not the entire state of Israel, but a **specific region** where Israeli customs regulations apply under the terms of the **Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement**.  
- This includes areas of the **West Bank and Gaza Strip** where Israel maintains customs authority and enforcement, as defined by the Protocol on Economic Relations.  
- The Protocol allows for the application of Israeli customs laws in these areas, and this regulation formalizes that application within Canada’s customs framework.

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective is to ensure that **customs classifications and tariff treatment** for goods moving through or originating in this designated territory are consistent with international trade practices and the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA). By formally recognizing this territory as a "country" for customs purposes, Canada can:

- Apply appropriate tariff rates and trade rules;
- Facilitate cross-border trade between Canada and Israel, including goods originating in or transiting through the West Bank and Gaza Strip;
- Maintain compliance with the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, which includes provisions for the treatment of goods from designated territories.

---

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 41 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (S.C. 1996, c. 33) comes into force.  
This date was **January 1, 1997**, as noted in the official notice (SI/97-9), which confirms the regulation’s entry into force on that date.

**Note on Legal Status and Interpretation:**  
- The regulation is **not** a declaration that Israel's customs laws apply to all of the West Bank or Gaza Strip in a general sense. It is a **customs-specific designation** under Canadian law, based on the international agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  
- The designation is **temporary and conditional**, tied to the terms of the Interim Agreement and its amendments. It remains valid only as long as the Protocol remains in force and the conditions for its application are met.  
- The regulation reflects Canada’s recognition of the **distinct customs regime** in certain areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip due to the unique legal and political framework established by the 1995 Interim Agreement.

---

**Significance:**  
This regulation is a practical example of how Canada integrates international agreements into its domestic customs regime. It enables Canada to treat goods from areas under Israeli customs administration as originating from a "country" for tariff and trade purposes, thereby ensuring consistency and predictability in international trade, especially in the context of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally designates the territory governed by Israeli customs law under the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement as a "prescribed territory" for the purposes of Canadian customs law. It ensures that Canadian customs authorities can properly classify and treat goods from that area under the tariff and trade rules applicable to "countries" under the Customs Tariff, effective January 1, 1997. The regulation operates within the broader framework of Canada’s trade relations with Israel and reflects Canada’s adherence to international agreements on economic and customs cooperation.
