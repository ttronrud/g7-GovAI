**Detailed Summary of the St. Hubert Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled:  
**"St. Hubert Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and form a legal framework governing land use and development near St. Hubert Airport in the Province of Quebec.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Technical Terms**

The regulations define several critical technical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **St. Hubert Airport**, located in the parish of St. Hubert, Quebec. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for measuring distances and elevations. It is located at the intersection of:<br>– The **easterly lateral limit** of the strip associated with **runway 18–36**<br>– The **southerly lateral limit** of the strip associated with **runway 06L–24R**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip, perpendicular to its centerline. It is defined in **Part III of the Schedule** and ensures safe aircraft approach paths. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface located above and around the airport, designed to protect aircraft during takeoff and landing by limiting obstructions in the airspace above the airport. Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**. Each strip corresponds to a runway or runway configuration. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surfaces. It serves as a buffer zone between the strip and surrounding land. Defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**. |

> All coordinates and azimuths are based on the **M.T.M. (Military Topographic Map) system**, with a central meridian at **73°30′**. Distances are expressed in the **metric system** (metres).

> The **airport reference point is deemed to be 25.3 metres (83 feet) above sea level** for all elevation calculations.

---

### **3. Scope and Applicability**

- **Applies to**: All lands and submerged areas (including public road allowances) **adjacent to or in the vicinity of St. Hubert Airport**, as defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Excludes**: Lands that have been formally incorporated into the airport's operational or administrative boundaries (i.e., lands that are part of the airport itself).

> This means the regulations govern development **around** the airport but **do not apply** to land that is now officially part of the airport property.

---

### **4. Prohibitions on Construction**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the point of location:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> These surfaces are imaginary planes that define safe zones above the airport to prevent visual or physical interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

> The restriction applies **even if the object is not directly on the runway** — any structure or object (including towers, trees, or buildings) must remain below the elevation of these defined surfaces.

---

### **5. Regulation of Natural Growth**

- If a **natural growth** (e.g., tree, bush, vegetation) on regulated land **exceeds the elevation** of any of the above-mentioned surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazards to aviation operations.

> *Note: This provision was previously revoked by SOR/81-177, Section 1 — however, it is included here in the original text, suggesting either a current or historical version. If revoked, it would no longer be enforceable. This must be verified against current legislation.*

### **6. Geographical Boundaries of Regulated Land**

The regulated land is precisely described in **a detailed legal description** (a legal description or "metes and bounds") in the text, beginning with a starting point and proceeding through a series of directional bearings and distances.

#### **Summary of the Land Boundary Description:**

The boundary starts at:
- The intersection of **de la Savane Road** (without cadastral number) and the **lot line between lots 241 and 242**, in the parish of **Ste. Famille-de-Boucherville**.

Then proceeds through a series of directions and lines, including:
- Along the **approach surface of runway 06L–24R**
- Along **parish lines**, **lot lines**, and **public roads** such as:
  - Montée Sabourin
  - Cousineau Boulevard
  - Montée St. Hubert
  - Autoroute 30 (provincial highway)
- Across various streets and subdivisions (e.g., lots 113–425, 118–390, 119–771, etc.)
- Eventually reaches the **St. Lawrence River shoreline** on both the **south and north sides**

The boundary closes when it returns to the **northern edge** of the original starting point, via:
- The **parish line between St. Hubert and St. Antoine-de-Longueuil**
- Then through **St. Antoine-de-Longueuil** to the **southeastern limit of lot 221-10**
- Returning via public roads and lot lines back to the **initial point**

> This boundary encircles a large area of land extending from the airport’s southern and eastern flanks to the St. Lawrence River, including parts of multiple parishes:  
> - St. Hubert  
> - St. Bruno  
> - Ste. Famille-de-Boucherville  
> - St. Antoine-de-Longueuil  
> - Laprairie  
> - Chambly  

> The area includes **public road allowances**, **private parcels**, and **subdivided lots**, all of which are subject to the zoning restrictions.

### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- **Maintain clear flight paths** by limiting structures and natural features that could interfere with aircraft visibility or flight performance.
- **Protect the airport environment** by controlling development in critical zones near runways and approach corridors.
- **Preserve the integrity of the airport’s operational zone** by establishing precise elevation and spatial boundaries.

---

### **8. Key Implications for Landowners and Developers**

- **All new construction, expansions, or modifications** must comply with the elevation limits of the **approach, outer, and transitional surfaces**.
- **Tree trimming or removal** may be required if vegetation exceeds the defined surface elevations.
- **Development proposals** (e.g., buildings, towers, wind turbines, antennas) must be reviewed by the **Minister of Transport** to ensure compliance.
- **Natural features** (like trees or hills) must be assessed for elevation relative to the surfaces — any excess must be removed or managed.

---

### **9. Legal Authority and Enforcement**

- The **Minister of Transport** is the **sole authority** to:
  - Enforce the regulations
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth
  - Determine compliance with elevation limits

> This gives the Minister significant enforcement power, especially in cases involving natural growth or unregulated development.

---

### **10. Status and Amendments**

- A note at the end of the regulation states:  
  > **[Revoked, SOR/81-177, s. 1]**  
  This indicates that the **provision regarding natural growth removal** (Section 5) was **revoked** by **SOR/81-177, Section 1** (Statutory Order 1981-177).  
  → Therefore, **the power of the Minister to direct removal of excessive natural growth is no longer active** under this regulation.

> This is a **critical point**: While the rest of the regulation (on construction and elevation limits) remains in force, the **provision allowing the Minister to order removal of natural growth is legally obsolete**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **St. Hubert Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework to ensure aviation safety by:

- Defining key spatial and elevation boundaries (approach, outer, transitional surfaces),
- Applying strict limits on construction and development near the airport,
- Specifying the exact geographic area covered by the regulations,
- Empowering the Minister of Transport to enforce compliance.

However, a significant limitation exists:  
✅ The **prohibition on natural growth exceeding surface elevations** has been **revoked** by SOR/81-177, Section 1.  
➡️ As such, **landowners are not legally required to remove trees or vegetation** that exceed the surface elevations — unless otherwise governed by another regulation (e.g., municipal or environmental law).

> **Recommendation**: This regulation should be reviewed in light of current aviation safety standards and environmental protection laws. The revocation of the natural growth
