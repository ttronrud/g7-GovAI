---

### **Overview**
The *Samples of Negligible Value Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument that establishes a framework for the **remission (exemption)** of certain taxes and duties on **imported samples of goods** when those samples meet specific criteria related to value, purpose, and usage. This order applies to consignments of imported samples of goods of all kinds and provides relief from excise taxes and customs duties under defined conditions.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Chief Officer of Customs (Agent en chef des douanes)**  
   - Refers to the **manager or designated official** responsible for overseeing customs operations in a particular geographic area or place.  
   - This individual has authority to enforce and administer the provisions of the Order within their jurisdiction.

2. **Sample (Échantillon)**  
   - Defined broadly as an article that is representative of a specific category of goods, either already produced or intended for production.  
   - Includes any **package, case, binder, or other integral component** that accompanies or is part of the sample.  
   - Examples: A small piece of clothing, a bottle of perfume, a prototype device, or a product in its original packaging.

### **Eligibility for Tax Remission**

Remission of taxes and duties is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

#### 1. **Negligible Value of the Sample**  
   - A sample is deemed to have "negligible value" if the **taxes and duties** that would otherwise be payable under:
     - Division III of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* (relating to excise taxes),  
     - Any other part of the Excise Tax Act, and  
     - Section 21 of the *Customs Tariff* (relating to customs duties)  
     — would **not exceed two dollars (CAD $2)** *if this Order did not apply*.  
   - This threshold ensures that only truly low-value samples qualify for exemption.

#### 2. **Purpose of Use**  
   - The sample must be used **solely for soliciting orders** for the actual goods of the same kind.  
   - It must not be used for any commercial sale, resale, or distribution as merchandise.  
   - The intent must be to generate interest or customer demand for the product, not for personal or retail consumption.

#### 3. **One Sample per Kind or Quality**  
   - In a single consignment, there may be **no more than one sample of each kind or quality**.  
   - This prevents duplication and ensures that the exemption applies only to necessary, representative samples.

#### 4. **Direct Supply from Abroad**  
   - The goods represented by the sample must be **supplied directly from abroad**.  
   - This ensures that the samples are not intermediated through domestic distributors or resellers.

### **Exception: Foodstuffs, Non-Alcoholic Beverages, Perfumes, and Chemical Products**

- **Special provision applies** to consignments involving:
  - Foodstuffs  
  - Non-alcoholic beverages  
  - Perfumes  
  - Chemical products  

- If these items are **intended to be consumed or destroyed during a demonstration**, the consignment may include **more than one sample** of the same kind or quality.  
- This exception is **only valid if**:
  - The **quantity and packaging** make it impractical or impossible to use the samples otherwise (e.g., as retail goods or for resale).  
  - The samples are used strictly for demonstration purposes and not for commercial sale.

> *Rationale*: This allows for practical demonstration in trade shows, exhibitions, or promotional events where multiple units are needed to showcase product variety or functionality, and where the goods are not intended for sale.

### **Customs Officer’s Authority to Modify Samples**

- A **chief officer of customs** may require that a sample be **rendered unusable as merchandise** through physical alterations such as:
  - Marking  
  - Tearing  
  - Perforating  
  - Gluing  
  - Other similar modifications  
- However, **such alterations must not compromise the sample’s usefulness** in promoting or soliciting orders.  
- The goal is to prevent misuse or resale while preserving the sample’s function as a marketing tool.

> *Example*: A sample of a new cosmetic product can be perforated to prevent it from being opened and used as a product, but it must still be visually and functionally representative so that it can be used to attract potential customers.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

- **Encourages international trade and market access** by reducing barriers for businesses that wish to promote new or existing products through samples.  
- **Protects consumer interests** by ensuring that samples are not used for resale or commercial gain.  
- **Prevents abuse of the tax exemption system** through clear limits on quantity, value, and use.  
- Supports **fair and transparent customs procedures** by setting clear, objective criteria for eligibility.
