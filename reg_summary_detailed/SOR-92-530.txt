## 🔍 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*. |
| **Designated Entity** | An entity that is *not* an insurance company, a securities dealer, or an entity controlled by either. This category is used to distinguish entities that are subject to different capital treatment rules. |
| **Insurance Company** | Any insurance company incorporated under Canadian federal or provincial law. |
| **Minority Interest** | An equity interest in a company (or entity) that is controlled by another company, held by a person *other than* the controlling company or an entity controlled by it. |
| **Securities Dealer** | An entity defined in paragraph (g) of the definition of *financial institution* in Section 2 of the Act. |

> These definitions establish the scope and boundaries of the regulatory capital framework, particularly distinguishing between regulated financial institutions and non-regulated or indirectly controlled entities.

## 📊 **Core Definition of Regulatory Capital (Section 3)**

> **Subject to subsection (2) and Section 4**, the regulatory capital of a company at a particular time is:

### ✅ The sum of:
1. **Shareholders’ Equity**  
2. **Minority Interests**  
3. **Subordinated Indebtedness**

### ❌ Less:
- The amount of **goodwill** included in the company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** set out by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** under subsection 313(4) of the Act.

> This means that regulatory capital is derived from the **financial statements** of the company, using standard accounting practices, but **excludes goodwill** as it is not considered a reliable or stable source of capital.

## 📏 Criteria for Including a Security in Regulatory Capital (Subsection 3(1))

For a security (e.g., a preferred share or subordinated debt) to be counted toward regulatory capital, it must meet **all of the following conditions**:

| Requirement | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1. Subordination** | The security must be **subordinate in right of payment** to all deposit liabilities and other liabilities of the issuing entity — *except* for liabilities that are equally ranked or subordinate to it. |
| **2. Fully Paid-Up** | The security must be **fully paid-up** — i.e., all issuance costs and par value have been fully settled by the investor. |
| **3. Minimum Term** | For subordinated indebtedness or preferred shares:<br> - Must have an **initial term of five years or more**, or<br> - Must have **no fixed term** (i.e., perpetual). |
| **4. Non-Redemption in First Five Years** | The security **cannot be redeemed or purchased for cancellation** during the first five years after issuance. |

> These criteria ensure that only **long-term, truly subordinated obligations** are counted as capital — protecting depositors and creditors by ensuring that such instruments are not used as short-term funding tools or easily callable debt.

## 🚫 Adjustments to Regulatory Capital (Sections 464–466 of the Act)

For the purposes of **Sections 464 to 466** of the Act (which likely relate to capital adequacy, risk management, or supervisory reporting), the **regulatory capital** is adjusted downward by subtracting certain amounts related to **control structures and intercompany transactions**.

Specifically, the regulatory capital is reduced by:

### 1. **Shareholders’ Equity and Subordinated Indebtedness of Controlled Insurance or Securities Dealers**
- If the company controls an **insurance company** or **securities dealer**, or an entity controlled by such a company:
  - Any **shareholders’ equity** or **subordinated indebtedness** of that controlled entity that is included in the parent company’s regulatory capital **must be excluded**.
- This prevents **double-counting** of capital held in subsidiaries.

> ⚠️ *Example:* If a trust company holds a 100% stake in a securities dealer, and that dealer has $10 million in subordinated debt, that $10 million would **not** be included in the parent company’s regulatory capital under this rule.

---

### 2. **Investments in Controlled Insurance or Securities Dealers**
- Any **investment** (other than shareholders’ equity or subordinated indebtedness) made by the company or a designated entity it controls in:
  - An insurance company or securities dealer,
  - Or an entity controlled by such a company,
- **Where the investment is part of the capital** of the controlled entity,
- Must be **excluded** from the regulatory capital calculation.

> This prevents capital from being artificially inflated due to investments that are treated as part of the capital base of a subsidiary.

> ⚠️ *Example:* If a trust company invests $5 million in a securities dealer as part of its capital structure, that $5 million is not counted in the parent’s regulatory capital.

---

### 3. **Loans to Controlled Insurance or Securities Dealers**
- Any **loan** (other than subordinated indebtedness) made by the company or a designated entity it controls to:
  - An insurance company or securities dealer,
  - Or an entity controlled by such a company,
- **Where the loan is part of the capital** of the recipient entity,
- Must be **excluded** from the regulatory capital calculation.

> This ensures that loans used to fund the capital of a subsidiary are not counted as capital of the parent company.

> ⚠️ *Example:* If a trust company lends $2 million to a securities dealer to support its capital, that $2 million is not included in the parent’s regulatory capital.

---

### 4. **Minority Interests in Controlled Insurance or Securities Dealers**
- Any **minority interest** (i.e., non-controlling equity stake) in:
  - An insurance company or securities dealer,
  - Or an entity controlled by such a company,
- That is **included** in the parent company’s regulatory capital under Section 3,
- Must be **excluded** from the regulatory capital calculation under this section.

> This prevents overstatement of capital due to minority stakes in subsidiaries.

> ⚠️ *Example:* If a trust company holds a 20% stake in a securities dealer, and that stake is treated as capital, it is now excluded from the parent’s regulatory capital.

## 📚 Capital Definition for Insurance Companies and Securities Dealers

For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) (i.e., in the context of the adjustments above), the term **"capital"** is defined differently depending on the type of entity:

| Entity Type | Definition of Capital |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Insurance Company** (to which the *Insurance Companies Act* applies) | Regulatory capital as defined in the **Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations**. |
| **All Other Insurance Companies or Securities Dealers** | An amount that would be treated as capital by the **regulatory body** that oversees that entity (e.g., the Superintendent of Financial Institutions or a provincial regulator). |

> This ensures that capital standards are consistent with the regulatory framework applicable to each type of financial institution.

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Regulatory Objectives

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To define a clear, transparent, and consistent measure of regulatory capital** for trust and loan companies.
2. **To prevent capital overstatement** due to:
   - Double-counting of equity or debt in subsidiaries,
   - Investments or loans that are part of a subsidiary’s capital,
   - Minority interests.
3. **To ensure financial stability** by focusing on truly resilient, long-term, and subordinated capital instruments.
4. **To align with international best practices** in capital adequacy, particularly regarding subordinated debt and capital structure.
5. **To support effective supervision** by regulators under Sections 464–466 of the Act, which likely govern risk-based capital requirements or stress testing.
