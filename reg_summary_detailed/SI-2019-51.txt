### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to remit administrative fees to provincial and territorial governments when such fees are incurred in connection with the administration of certain federal tax-related programs.

---

### **Key Provisions and Recipients:**

#### 1. **Remittance to the Government of Yukon**

- **Amount Remitted:** Up to **$3,343,998**
- **Purpose:** To cover the **administrative fees** paid or to be paid by the Government of Canada under the **Tax Collection Agreement** between Canada and Yukon, effective **January 1, 2004**.
- **Programs Covered:**
  - **Personal Carbon Price Rebate** (under Section 7 of the Income Tax Act, Chapter 118 of the Revised Statutes of Yukon, 2002)
  - **Business Carbon Price Rebate** (under Section 16 of the same Income Tax Act)

> These rebates are part of Canada’s carbon pricing policy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing financial support to individuals and businesses affected by carbon pricing.

- **Administrative Responsibility:** The Government of Canada is responsible for administering these rebates, and the associated administrative costs (e.g., processing, verification, payment systems) are borne by Canada. The remittance ensures that Yukon receives a share of these costs as a form of cost-sharing or compensation for its administrative involvement or local impact.

#### 2. **Remittance to the Government of the Northwest Territories (NWT)**

- **Amount Remitted:** Up to **$1,598,690**
- **Purpose:** To cover the **administrative fees** paid or to be paid by the Government of Canada under the Tax Collection Agreement with the NWT, effective January 1, 2004.
- **Program Covered:**
  - **Cost of Living Offset (CLO)** — a program designed to offset the financial impact of certain tax increases on low- and middle-income individuals in the NWT.

> The remittance is conditional upon the **coming into force of provisions substantially consistent with proposed Section 3.5 of Bill 43**, which was introduced during the **3rd session of the 18th Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories**.

- **Bill 43 Context:**
  - The proposed section (Section 3.5) in Bill 43 aims to amend the Income Tax Act to better align the cost of living offset with the needs of residents in the NWT.
  - The remittance is **conditional** on these provisions being enacted or coming into force — meaning the federal government will only pay the administrative fees if the NWT legislature adopts or implements this specific legislative measure.

> This conditional nature ensures that federal funding is tied to meaningful legislative action that strengthens the program’s fairness and effectiveness.

### **Key Features and Implications:**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public Interest Justification** | The Governor General acts on the public interest, indicating that equitable cost-sharing and fair administrative burden distribution are priorities. |
| **Federal-Subnational Cost-Sharing** | The federal government administers the rebates and offsets, but remits fees to the provinces/territories to reflect shared responsibility and local impact. |
| **Conditional Payment (NWT)** | The NWT remittance is not automatic — it depends on the enactment of specific legislative changes (Section 3.5 of Bill 43), ensuring alignment between policy and local governance. |
| **Timeframe** | The agreements in question began on **January 1, 2004**, and the fees are for administrative costs incurred since that date. |
| **Maximum Caps** | The amounts are capped at $3.3 million (Yukon) and $1.6 million (NWT), indicating a defined and finite financial commitment. |

### **Policy Objectives and Rationale:**

1. **Equity and Fairness:** Recognizes that territorial governments are directly affected by federal tax programs and should share in the administrative costs.
2. **Support for Territorial Capacity:** Helps support the administrative capacity of Yukon and the NWT in managing and delivering carbon pricing and cost-of-living programs.
3. **Legislative Accountability:** The conditional nature of the NWT payment ensures that federal funding is linked to legislative action, promoting accountability and responsiveness to local needs.
4. **Sustainability of Programs:** Ensures the long-term viability of carbon pricing and cost-of-living programs by providing stable, predictable funding to territorial governments.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a **federal-to-territorial financial transfer** of administrative fees related to two key federal environmental and social programs:  
- The **carbon price rebates** in Yukon, and  
- The **cost of living offset** in the Northwest Territories.

The transfer is **not unconditional** — particularly for the NWT, where it is contingent upon the enactment of specific legislative provisions. This reflects a broader policy framework that balances federal oversight with territorial autonomy and responsiveness to local economic and social conditions.

The regulation underscores Canada’s commitment to **cooperative governance**, **equitable cost distribution**, and **policy alignment** between federal and territorial governments in the context of climate action and social protection.
