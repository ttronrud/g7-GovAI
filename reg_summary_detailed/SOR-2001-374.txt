**Detailed Summary of the Complaint Information (Retail Associations) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The *Complaint Information (Retail Associations) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **section 463a of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCAA)**. This regulatory instrument serves to implement and clarify the requirements for how retail cooperative credit associations must provide complaint-related information to consumers.

The regulation is referenced in the following statutory sources:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 339** (a specific provision in the Statutes of Canada)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 48** (the original enactment of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act)

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that **consumers of retail credit associations** (such as credit unions or cooperatives offering retail credit products like credit cards, installment plans, or payment arrangements) are clearly informed of their **rights to file complaints** and **how to access complaint-related information**.

Specifically, the regulation implements **subsections 385.22(4)** and **385.24(1)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, which require certain retail associations to provide specific complaint information to consumers in a clear, accessible, and standardized manner.

**Key Provisions and Requirements:**

1. **Prescribed Contact Information for Complaints:**

   For the purposes of **subsection 385.22(4)** and **subsection 385.24(1)** of the CCAA, the **prescribed information** that must be provided to consumers includes:

   - The **official contact details of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)** (formerly known as the Agency), which is the regulatory body responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector.

   **Contact Methods:**
   - **Office Address:**  
     427 Laurier Avenue West, 6th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1R 1B9  
   - **Website:**  
     www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca  

   This information must be made available to consumers so they know where and how to direct complaints related to financial products or services offered by retail associations.

2. **Manner of Providing Complaint Information:**

   The regulation specifies **how** the complaint information must be provided to consumers. It must be included in one of the following formats:

   - **A brochure**  
     A printed or digital document that provides general information about the complaint process, rights, and procedures.

   - **A statement of account**  
     This is a standard document that consumers receive with each billing cycle. The complaint information must be included in this document, ensuring that consumers are informed even when they are reviewing their account details.

   - **A written statement**  
     A standalone, written communication that contains all required information about the complaint process and includes other disclosures required under the Act. This may be issued in response to a consumer inquiry or as part of a new arrangement.

   - **In a separate document**  
     The information may also be provided in a distinct, dedicated document (e.g., a separate leaflet or notice), which is clearly labeled and easily accessible to the consumer.

3. **Content Requirements:**

   The complaint information must include, at a minimum, the following:
   - The name and contact details of the **FCAC** (as specified above).
   - A clear description of the **complaint process**, including:
     - How to file a complaint.
     - How long the association or regulator will take to respond.
     - Who to contact for assistance or follow-up.
   - Reference to **other required disclosures** under the CCAA, such as:
     - The **cost of borrowing**.
     - **Payment, credit, or charge card terms**.
     - Any **consumer obligations** under the retail arrangement (e.g., interest rates, fees, penalties).

   This ensures that consumers are not only informed about how to file a complaint but are also aware of the broader financial terms and obligations tied to their credit arrangement.

**Scope of Application:**

This regulation applies specifically to **retail associations** under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. These include:
- Credit unions offering retail credit products (e.g., credit cards, installment plans, lines of credit).
- Cooperatives providing consumer credit or payment arrangements to members or the public.

The provisions are designed to protect **consumer rights** and promote **transparency**, enabling individuals to understand their financial obligations and the mechanisms available to them if they believe their rights have been violated.

---

**Regulatory Objectives:**

- **Transparency:** Ensure consumers are fully informed about how to file complaints and where to direct them.
- **Accessibility:** Provide multiple, convenient ways (digital and physical) for consumers to access complaint information.
- **Consumer Protection:** Strengthen the ability of consumers to seek redress when disputes arise with retail credit arrangements.
- **Compliance:** Help retail associations meet their legal obligations under the CCAA, particularly in relation to disclosure and consumer rights.

**Conclusion:**

The *Complaint Information (Retail Associations) Regulations* are a critical component of consumer protection within the cooperative credit sector in Canada. By mandating that retail associations provide clear, accessible, and standardized complaint information—through brochures, statements of account, or separate documents—the regulation empowers consumers to take action when necessary and ensures regulatory accountability. The inclusion of FCAC contact details ensures that consumers can escalate complaints to an independent, authorized body if needed.

This regulation enhances trust in the financial system by promoting openness and fairness in how credit products are offered and managed.
