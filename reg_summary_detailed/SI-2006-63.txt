**Summary:**

This regulation establishes a formal leadership designation within the Public Appointments Commission Secretariat (PACS). Specifically:

1. **Designation of Deputy Head:**  
   The Executive Director of the Public Appointments Commission Secretariat is officially designated as the **deputy head** of the Secretariat. This role is not merely administrative but carries significant leadership responsibilities, including oversight of operations, policy implementation, and strategic direction within the Secretariat.

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   The designation is authorized under **paragraph 11(2)(a)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to appoint or designate individuals to leadership roles within federal institutions, particularly those involving financial or administrative management. The use of this specific paragraph underscores the regulatory and constitutional basis for the appointment, ensuring it aligns with established federal governance and financial accountability frameworks.

3. **Governance and Accountability:**  
   The appointment reflects a structured hierarchy within the Public Appointments Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the appointment and promotion of public officials in Canada. By appointing the Executive Director as deputy head, the federal government strengthens internal governance, clarifies lines of authority, and ensures that the Secretariat has a clearly defined leadership structure capable of managing complex appointments processes.

4. **Policy and Operational Impact:**  
   This designation enhances the operational efficiency and accountability of the Secretariat. As deputy head, the Executive Director will have authority over day-to-day management, staffing, budgeting, and implementation of policies related to public appointments. It also facilitates coordination between the Secretariat and other federal departments or agencies involved in public service appointments.

5. **Context and Purpose:**  
   The Public Appointments Commission Secretariat plays a key role in ensuring transparency, fairness, and merit-based selection in the public service. The designation of the Executive Director as deputy head supports the Commission’s mandate by reinforcing institutional stability and ensuring continuity in leadership during transitions or periods of change.

6. **Timeline and Source:**  
   The regulation was enacted in **2003** as part of **Statutory Instrument 2003, Chapter 22** (S.C. 2003, c. 22), a public law that likely includes several provisions related to the structure, function, and governance of the Public Appointments Commission.
