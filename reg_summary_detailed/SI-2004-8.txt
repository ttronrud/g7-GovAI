Certainly. Here is a detailed and clear summary of the provided regulation:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Public Service Control – Crown Corporation Secretariat  
**Effective Date:** January 24, 2004  
**Issuing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*

---

**Overview:**

This regulation formally transfers administrative control and supervision of a specific portion of the public service within the Department of Transport to the Department of the Environment. The transfer is not related to the operational activities of the Crown corporations themselves, but rather to the administrative and managerial functions that support them—specifically, those managed by the **Crown Corporation Secretariat**.

---

**Key Details:**

1. **Transfer of Function:**  
   The control and supervision of the **Crown Corporation Secretariat**—a unit within the Department of Transport—relating to three specific Crown corporations are being transferred. These corporations are:
   - **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)**
   - **Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC)**
   - **Queens Quay West Land Corporation (QQWLC)**

2. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer involves **control and supervision of the public service functions** associated with these entities. This includes administrative, policy, and oversight responsibilities that are typically managed through the secretariat, such as staffing, budgeting, governance support, and interdepartmental coordination.  
   It does **not** transfer ownership, operational management, or day-to-day business operations of the corporations themselves. The corporations remain legally and financially independent entities under the jurisdiction of the relevant federal departments.

3. **Departmental Shift:**  
   - **From:** Department of Transport  
   - **To:** Department of the Environment  
   This reallocation reflects a broader government strategy to align public service responsibilities with current policy priorities. Given that CMHC, CLC, and QQWLC are involved in land use, housing, and environmental land management (especially in urban and ecological planning), the transfer to the Department of the Environment is consistent with a focus on environmental sustainability, land use planning, and housing policy integration.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which allows the federal government to reorganize public service functions by transferring control and supervision between departments, provided such transfers are made in the public interest and with appropriate policy justification.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer takes effect on **January 24, 2004**. All administrative, reporting, and supervisory responsibilities for the Crown Corporation Secretariat functions related to the three named corporations will be transferred to the Department of the Environment from that date onward.

---

**Implications and Context:**

- This move reflects a strategic shift in federal governance to centralize oversight of Crown corporations that have significant implications for land use, housing, and environmental stewardship under the Department of the Environment’s mandate.
- The Department of the Environment may now have greater authority to influence policy development, land-use planning, and sustainable development initiatives related to these corporations.
- The transfer may also facilitate better coordination between housing policy, environmental protection, and land management across federal programs.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a formal administrative reorganization that reassigns the public service oversight of the Crown Corporation Secretariat—specifically concerning CMHC, CLC, and QQWLC—from the Department of Transport to the Department of the Environment, effective January 24, 2004. The change is grounded in statutory authority and aims to improve policy coherence and governance in areas where housing, land use, and environmental considerations intersect.

**Note:** This summary does not alter the legal or financial status of the Crown corporations themselves, nor does it affect their operations, funding, or statutory responsibilities. It only changes the department responsible for supervising the administrative functions of the secretariat.
