**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Context:**  
The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which authorizes the transfer of certain public service functions and responsibilities between departments and offices within the Canadian federal government.

This transfer is part of a broader administrative restructuring aimed at improving efficiency, aligning service delivery with strategic government priorities, and enhancing coordination between key government entities—particularly in the areas of communications, information management, and public outreach.

**Key Transfer Details:**

The regulation transfers control and supervision of specific public service units from **Communication Canada** to the **Privy Council Office (PCO)**, effective **April 1, 2004**.

The transferred units are:

1. **Regional Operations Branch**  
   – *Entire branch is transferred*, except for a specific exception:  
     → The **Outreach, Analysis and Information Management** unit (which is part of the Research Branch) is **excluded** from the transfer.  
     → This means that while the broader Regional Operations Branch is moved to the Privy Council Office, the outreach and analytical functions within the Research Branch remain under Communication Canada.

2. **Information Services**  
   – This unit is part of the **Communications Services Branch**.  
   – However, the **Electronic Media Monitoring Service** is **excluded** from this transfer.  
   → Thus, all other functions of Information Services (excluding media monitoring) are transferred to the Privy Council Office.

3. **Communications Support Group**  
   – This unit is part of the **Communications Branch**.  
   – The entire group is transferred to the Privy Council Office.

**Purpose and Implications of the Transfer:**

- **Strategic Alignment:** The transfer reflects a shift in government priorities, placing key communication and information management functions under the direct oversight of the Privy Council Office. The PCO plays a central role in advising the Prime Minister and coordinating government-wide communications, policy dissemination, and public messaging.

- **Enhanced Coordination:** By centralizing these functions, the government aims to improve consistency in messaging, streamline interdepartmental communication, and strengthen the government’s ability to respond to public and media inquiries.

- **Preservation of Key Functions:** The exclusion of certain units—such as Outreach, Analysis and Information Management, and the Electronic Media Monitoring Service—suggests that the government recognizes the unique value of these functions in research, policy analysis, and media intelligence. These units are retained within Communication Canada to preserve specialized expertise and continuity in research and media monitoring.

- **Administrative Efficiency:** The transfer streamlines reporting lines and reduces duplication, allowing the Privy Council Office to manage critical public service functions more effectively.

**Effective Date:**

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization of the federal public service, moving key operational and support functions from Communication Canada to the Privy Council Office. While the transfer strengthens central coordination and strategic oversight, it also preserves essential research and media monitoring capabilities within Communication Canada to ensure continued expertise and responsiveness in those specialized areas. The decision underscores the importance of aligning public service operations with the core functions of government leadership and communication.
