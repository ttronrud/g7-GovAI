### 🔹 **5. Creditable Periods and Eligibility (Core Mechanism)**

Creditable periods are used to establish eligibility for pensions, disability benefits, and other social security benefits.

#### 📌 Definitions:
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Creditable Period** | A period of contributions or residence used to qualify for benefits under a country’s system. |
| **Gainful Activity** | Work generating income, as defined under each country’s law. |
| **Government Employment** | Employment in public sector (civil service, military, judiciary). |

#### 🔄 **Creditable Periods Can Be Totalized**
- If a person has contributed under **both Canada and Hungary**, those periods can be **combined (totalized)** to determine eligibility for benefits, **provided they do not overlap**.

##### ✅ **Totalizing Rules by Benefit Type**

| Benefit | Totalizing Rule |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Old Age Security (OAS) – Canada** | A period of residence in Hungary during which the person was subject to the CPP or provincial pension plan is considered a **period of residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants. |
| **OAS – Canada** | A period of residence in Canada during which the person was subject to Hungarian legislation is **not** counted as residence in Canada. |
| **CPP – Canada** | A calendar year in which the person earned at least **90 days of creditable periods** under Hungarian legislation is treated as a **full creditable year** under the CPP. |
| **Hungarian Old Age Benefit** | A calendar year of CPP creditable periods is treated as **365 days** of creditable periods under Hungarian law. |
| **Hungarian Disability Benefit** | Same as above — a CPP year counts as 365 days of creditable periods. |
| **Hungarian Benefit (for non-citizens)** | If creditable periods under both countries are insufficient, the person may be eligible based on totalized periods from **third countries** where both parties have reciprocal agreements (territorial principle exceptions apply). |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Totalizing only applies if the person would **not otherwise be eligible** under the rules of either country.

### 🔹 **6. Benefit Calculation and Payments**

#### 📊 **Old Age Security (OAS) – For Persons Outside Canada**
- A person is eligible for OAS **only if** their totalized periods of residence (Canada + Hungary) meet or exceed the **minimum residency requirement** for OAS outside Canada.
- If eligible, the **amount** is calculated as follows:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on CPP pensionable earnings.
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Determined by multiplying the flat-rate amount under CPP by:
    > (Periods of CPP contributions / Minimum qualifying period required under CPP)

> 🔍 **Cap**: The fraction cannot exceed **1.0** — meaning the maximum flat-rate benefit is the full CPP flat-rate.

#### 📊 **Hungarian Benefit Calculation**
- If Hungarian eligibility is based solely on totalizing periods, the competent institution in Hungary:
  1. Calculates the **theoretical benefit** that would have been paid if all periods had been accumulated under Hungarian law alone.
  2. Then applies a **proportional adjustment**:
     > Actual benefit = Theoretical benefit × (Hungary’s creditable periods / Total creditable periods from both countries)

> 📌 This ensures fairness in benefit allocation based on actual contribution history.

#### 📉 **Exclusion of Third-State Contributions**
- Creditable periods accumulated under a **third country** with Hungary under a **territorial principle agreement** are **not** counted.
