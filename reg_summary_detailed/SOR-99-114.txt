**Detailed Summary of the Ocean Dumping Permit Fee Regulations (Site Monitoring)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The *Ocean Dumping Permit Fee Regulations (Site Monitoring)* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment and the Treasury Board. This action is authorized under **paragraph 19.1(a)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the government to establish fees related to the administration of environmental permits.

These regulations are a component of Canada’s regulatory framework governing the disposal of materials at sea, specifically targeting dredged material and inert, inorganic geological matter.

---

**2. Definitions and Interpretation**  
The terms and expressions used in these regulations are defined consistently with those in **Division 3 of Part 7 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999**. This ensures legal consistency and clarity in interpreting key concepts such as:  
- "Dredged material"  
- "Inert, inorganic geological matter"  
- "Permit"  
- "Disposal at sea"  

This alignment with CEPA ensures that the regulatory language and application are harmonized with broader environmental protection standards.

**3. Fee Structure**  
The fee for ocean dumping is calculated as follows:  
- **$470 per 1,000 cubic meters (m³)**, or **any portion thereof**, of dredged material or inert, inorganic geological matter that is authorized under a permit to be disposed of at sea.  

This means that even if a permit authorizes the disposal of less than 1,000 m³, the fee is still charged on a per-thousand-metre basis. For example:  
- 500 m³ → $470 (full fee for the portion of 1,000 m³)  
- 1,200 m³ → $470 × 2 = $940  

The fee is directly tied to the volume of material being disposed of, making it a volume-based charge that incentivizes responsible and measured disposal.

**4. Payment Requirements**  
The fee must be paid in accordance with one of the following two options:  

**Option 1: Full Payment Prior to Permit Publication**  
- The entire fee must be paid **before** the permit is officially published in the *Canada Gazette*.  
- This ensures that the government receives full financial assurance before the permit becomes active and allows for regulatory oversight.

**Option 2: Staged Payment**  
- **At least 50% of the total fee** must be paid **before** the permit is published in the *Canada Gazette*.  
- The **remaining balance** must be paid **no later than halfway through the permit’s validity period**.  
- This option provides flexibility for permit holders who may require time to budget or secure funding, while still ensuring timely payment of the full fee.

> *Note:* The fee calculation is based on the total volume of material authorized under the permit, as determined in accordance with Section 2 of the regulations.

**5. Effective Date**  
These regulations come into force on the **date of registration** with the Government of Canada. This date is typically when the regulations are officially published in the *Canada Gazette*, marking the start of their legal application.

---

**6. Purpose and Context**  
These regulations serve several key purposes:  
- **Revenue Generation**: The fee provides a financial mechanism to fund environmental monitoring and enforcement activities related to ocean dumping.  
- **Environmental Protection**: By charging a fee, the government encourages responsible disposal practices and supports the monitoring and assessment of potential environmental impacts.  
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The structured payment process ensures that permit holders are financially accountable and that the government can track and manage costs associated with site monitoring.  

The regulations are specifically linked to **site monitoring**, indicating that the fees support the ongoing environmental assessment and surveillance of dumping sites to ensure compliance with environmental standards.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Ocean Dumping Permit Fee Regulations (Site Monitoring)* establish a clear, volume-based fee structure for the disposal of dredged material and inert geological matter at sea. They provide two flexible payment options—full upfront payment or a staged payment plan—to accommodate permit holders while ensuring timely and complete financial obligations. These regulations are grounded in CEPA and supported by financial administration authority, reinforcing Canada’s commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable ocean management.
