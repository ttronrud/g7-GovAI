### **Detailed Summary of the National Energy Board Export and Import Reporting Regulations (S.C. 1990, c. 7, s. 42)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**
These regulations were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Natural Resources**, under **subsection 129(1)** of the *National Energy Board Act*.  
They came into effect on **October 31, 1995**, and are formally known as the **National Energy Board Export and Import Reporting Regulations**.

These rules establish the **mandatory reporting obligations** for individuals and entities involved in the **export or import of oil, gas, or electricity** through the National Energy Board (NEB), ensuring transparency, accountability, and regulatory oversight of energy trade across Canada and internationally.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *National Energy Board Act*, the primary legislation governing the NEB’s authority and operations. |
| **Border Accommodation Transfer** | A transfer of power or energy to: <br> - Provide electricity to a foreign country lacking access to its power system; <br> - Support an international work; or <br> - Restore service during emergencies when a foreign power system has lost service. |
| **Electricity Transfer** | Includes five types:<br>1. **Sale transfer** – under a sales contract;<br>2. **Equichange transfer** – equal energy exchanged within a set period;<br>3. **Storage transfer** – energy stored in a reservoir (e.g., hydro) with expectation of return later;<br>4. **Adjustment transfer** – to balance energy accounts or compensate for services;<br>5. **Carrier transfer** – power routed through another system as a carrier to a third party or back to origin. |
| **Energy** | Total quantity of electricity transmitted over time, measured in **watt-hours** or multiples/sub-multiples (e.g., kWh). |
| **Licence** | A permit issued under Part VI of the Act for exporting or importing gas, oil, or electricity. |
| **Order** | An authorization issued by the NEB for the export/import of gas (including export for later import or import for later export). |
| **Permit** | A permit specifically for exporting electricity. |
| **Power** | The rate of energy transfer, measured in **watts** or multiples/sub-multiples (e.g., kW). |
| **Power System** | The complete infrastructure including generating stations, transformers, transmission lines, substations, and distribution networks necessary for producing, transmitting, and distributing electricity. |
| **Refined Petroleum Products** | Includes: <br> - Oil sands-derived oil; <br> - Gasoline-type fuels; <br> - Blending components; <br> - Middle distillates (kerosene, diesel, fuel oils); <br> - Heavy fuel oils (Nos. 4–6, bunker C oil, residual fuel oil); <br> - Partially processed oil (commingled or not). |

#### **3. Recordkeeping Requirement**
- A **copy of every return** submitted to the NEB must be **retained by the submitter for three years** from the month to which the return relates.

---

    - Temperature: **15°C**  
    - Pressure: **101.325 kPa (1 atm)**  
  - If measured under different conditions, must be **converted to standard conditions** using the **Ideal Gas Law**.
  - If deviation from ideal gas behavior exceeds **1%**, correction must be applied using **AGA Report No. 3** (Orifice Metering of Natural Gas and Other Related Hydrocarbon Fluids), as amended.

- **Thermal Measurement**:  
  - Computed in **joules on a dry basis**  
  - Dry gas is defined as having moisture content **less than 110 mg/m³**

##### **Liquid Measurement (Propane, Butanes, Ethane)**
- May be measured in **liquid form** (cubic metres)

#### **6. Purpose and Significance of the Regulations**

These regulations serve several critical functions:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - Ensures that all energy exports and imports are fully documented, enabling the NEB to monitor market activity and prevent unfair practices.

2. **Market Integrity**  
   - Provides data on pricing, volumes, and destinations to support fair competition and prevent market manipulation.

3. **Regulatory Oversight**  
   - Enables the NEB to assess the environmental, economic, and national security implications of energy trade.

4. **International Compliance**  
   - Standardizes measurement and reporting for cross-border transactions, ensuring consistency with international trade norms.

5. **Emergency Preparedness**  
   - The inclusion of "border accommodation transfers" allows for emergency power support to foreign countries, enhancing Canada’s role in international energy security.

6. **Data for Policy Development**  
   - The detailed reporting supports long-term planning, such as energy policy, infrastructure investment, and climate strategy.

#### **7. Key Compliance Notes**

- **Timeliness**: All returns must be submitted **on time** — monthly (except for small border transfers, which are every six months).
- **Accuracy**: Measurements must follow strict technical standards (e
