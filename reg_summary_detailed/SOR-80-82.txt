The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instruments Regulations (SOR/2017-84)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instruments Regulation No. 2017-84* (SOR/2017-84)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of that instrument
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect upon the coming into force of SOR/2017-84, which was published in the Canada Gazette and became effective on **April 12, 2017**.

### What This Means:

The specific regulation previously referenced — which was likely a minor or administrative rule under a broader regulatory framework — is **no longer in force**. It was formally removed by the government through a statutory instrument (SOR/2017-84), which is a common method in Canadian law for amending or repealing existing regulations.

- The repeal indicates that the regulation was either:
  - Outdated or no longer relevant,
  - Superseded by a newer regulation,
  - Or deemed unnecessary or inconsistent with current policy or legislation.

### Context of SOR/2017-84:

SOR/2017-84 is a **statutory instrument** issued under the authority of the *Regulations of the Minister of Health* or another relevant federal department (depending on the subject matter). It typically contains a list of regulations being amended or repealed. In this case, the repeal of Section 1 of the regulation in question removes its legal force entirely.

### Key Implications:

- **No current legal effect**: The regulation cannot be cited or applied in legal or administrative proceedings.
- **Legal certainty**: Repeal ensures that outdated or conflicting rules do not create ambiguity or confusion in the legal system.
- **Policy update**: The repeal reflects a shift in policy, administrative structure, or regulatory priorities.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in your query has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable**. Its removal was part of a broader regulatory update enacted through **SOR/2017-84, s. 1**. Any prior reliance on this regulation would be legally invalid.
