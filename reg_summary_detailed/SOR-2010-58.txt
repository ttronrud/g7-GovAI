**Detailed Summary of the Haiti Deemed Direct Shipment (General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff) Regulations**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 1997, c. 36*  
*Made under subsection 17(2) of the Customs Tariff*  
*Effective Date: Upon registration*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of these regulations is to facilitate the entry of goods produced in Haiti into Canada under preferential tariff treatment—specifically, either the **General Preferential Tariff (GPT)** or the **Least Developed Country (LDC) Tariff**—by establishing a legal mechanism known as "deemed direct shipment."

This means that, even though the goods do not physically travel directly from Haiti to Canada, they are treated as if they *have* been shipped directly from Haiti to Canada for tariff purposes. This allows Haitian goods to benefit from reduced or zero tariffs under Canada’s preferential trade schemes, despite the transshipment through a third country (the Dominican Republic).

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Deemed Direct Shipment Criteria**

For goods produced in Haiti to be entitled to the General Preferential Tariff or the Least Developed Country Tariff, the following conditions must be met:

**a) Import and Accounting Requirements**  
- The goods must be **imported into Canada** and **accounted for in accordance with Section 32 of the Customs Act**.  
  - This ensures that the goods are properly declared, documented, and recorded in Canada’s customs system.  
  - Section 32 of the Customs Act governs the requirements for the importation and accounting of goods, including the submission of accurate declarations and records.

**b) Transshipment Through the Dominican Republic**  
- The goods must be **transhipped through a port in the Dominican Republic**.  
  - This means the goods are physically moved from Haiti to a port in the Dominican Republic (e.g., Port-au-Prince to Santo Domingo or another designated port), and then transported onward to Canada.  
  - The transshipment is not a mere stopover; it must be a legitimate transfer of goods from one country to another with a clear commercial purpose.

**c) Through Bill of Lading**  
- The goods must be conveyed from the Dominican Republic port **on a through bill of lading** to a consignee in a **specified port in Canada**.  
  - A "through bill of lading" is a single, continuous shipping document that covers the entire journey from the point of origin (Haiti) to the final destination (Canada), including the stop in the Dominican Republic.  
  - This ensures that the shipment is a single, integrated transaction and not a series of separate or fragmented movements.

**d) Documentation Submission to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**  
- The **importer must submit to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** any documentation requested by that Minister in relation to the shipment.  
  - This provision reflects Canada’s broader security and compliance framework.  
  - The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is responsible for enforcing measures related to border security, counter-terrorism, and trade compliance.  
  - Importers must be transparent and provide all relevant records (e.g., shipping manifests, invoices, certificates of origin, bills of lading, etc.) to verify the legitimacy and origin of the goods.

### **Eligible Tariff Treatment**

Once the above conditions are satisfied, the goods are deemed to have been shipped **directly from Haiti to Canada**, and thus qualify for one of the following tariff treatments:

- **General Preferential Tariff (GPT)**: A reduced tariff rate offered to goods from countries with which Canada has trade agreements, including Haiti.  
- **Least Developed Country (LDC) Tariff**: A special tariff rate designed to support trade from the world’s least developed countries. Haiti qualifies as an LDC under the United Nations classification, and this tariff is intended to promote economic development and trade access.

> These tariff benefits are intended to support Haitian producers, encourage exports to Canada, and promote economic development in Haiti.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This ensures that the rules are implemented promptly and consistently with the intent of the governing legislation.

---

### **Legal Authority**

The regulation is made under **subsection 17(2) of the Customs Tariff**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to establish rules governing the application of preferential tariffs. This authority allows for flexibility in defining how goods qualify for preferential treatment, particularly in cases involving transshipment.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Supports Trade with Haiti**: Enables Canadian importers and businesses to access Haitian goods at reduced or zero tariffs, fostering trade and economic ties.
- **Encourages Regional Trade Integration**: The transshipment through the Dominican Republic reflects the regional trade dynamics in the Caribbean, where cross-border movement of goods is common.
- **Ensures Compliance and Transparency**: The requirement to submit documentation to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness enhances accountability and helps prevent fraud or smuggling.
- **Balances Trade Benefits with Security**: While promoting preferential access, the regulation includes safeguards to ensure that shipments are legitimate and meet national security and customs requirements.

### **Conclusion**

The *Haiti Deemed Direct Shipment (General Preferential Tariff and Least Developed Country Tariff) Regulations* provide a clear, structured pathway for Haitian goods to qualify for preferential tariff treatment in Canada, even when they are transshipped through the Dominican Republic. By requiring compliance with customs accounting, a through bill of lading, and mandatory documentation submission, the regulation ensures both the economic benefits of preferential tariffs and the integrity of Canada’s trade and security systems. It represents a pragmatic and targeted approach to supporting trade with a developing nation while maintaining regulatory oversight.
