The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Sor/2017-84, s. 1* (a statutory instrument published in the Canada Gazette)
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of SOR/2017-84, which was issued on **April 27, 2017**.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The specific regulation being referenced was previously a rule or provision under a broader regulatory framework (likely related to employment standards, occupational health and safety, or another area of federal or provincial regulation — though the exact subject is not specified in the provided text). However, due to the repetition of "Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1", it appears that the original regulation was a standalone provision or section that was formally canceled.

### Key Implications of the Repeal:

1. **Legal Effect**: The regulation no longer exists in force. Any legal obligation, requirement, or interpretation previously derived from it is no longer applicable.
2. **No Further Application**: Entities (e.g., employers, government agencies, or individuals) are not required to comply with the provisions of the repealed regulation.
3. **Replacement or Supersession**: The repealed regulation may have been replaced by a new rule or policy introduced in a subsequent regulation. However, no such replacement is indicated in the provided text.
4. **Public Record**: The repeal is publicly documented in the *Canada Gazette*, Part I, and is accessible through official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Statutes Database*.

### Why Was It Repealed?

While the exact reason is not specified in the provided text, common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
- Obsolescence (the regulation no longer serves a practical purpose),
- Inconsistency with current laws or policies,
- Redundancy (overlap with other existing rules),
- Improved administrative efficiency,
- A shift in policy direction.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced — listed multiple times as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **officially canceled** and is **no longer in effect**. It should be disregarded in legal, compliance, or interpretive contexts. For accurate and current regulatory information, one must consult the current version of the applicable statute or regulation, which may have been updated or replaced by a newer instrument.
