**Detailed Summary of the Programming Undertaking Regulations (S.C. 1993, c. 23, s. 2)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Programming Undertaking Regulations*, made under subsection 3(1.41) of the *Copyright Act* and effective August 31, 1993, define the legal concept of a "programming undertaking" for the purpose of applying certain provisions of the *Copyright Act*—specifically, subsection 3(1.4)—to digital and telecommunication-based distribution of programming content.

These regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology and the Secretary of State of Canada. The regulations are formally cited as the *Programming Undertaking Regulations*.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to clarify and define what constitutes a "programming undertaking" under the *Copyright Act*. This definition is critical because it determines which entities are subject to specific copyright obligations, particularly in relation to the transmission and communication of programming content via telecommunication networks.

This definition helps establish legal boundaries in the emerging field of digital broadcasting and telecommunications, especially in the context of cable, satellite, and other forms of direct-to-consumer or public transmission of programming.

### **Definition of "Programming Undertaking"**

Under the regulations, a *programming undertaking* is defined as a network (not falling within the definition of a network under the *Broadcasting Act*) that meets **either of the following two conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Transmission of Programs**
A person who:
- Transmits by telecommunication **all or part of the person’s own programs or programming**  
- **Directly or indirectly**  
- To a **specific person** referred to in paragraph (b) below.

#### **Condition 2: Communication to the Public**
A person who:
- Communicates **all or part of the programs or programming** referred to in paragraph (a)  
- To the **public**  
- By **telecommunication**.

### **Key Elements of the Definition**

1. **Exclusion of Broadcasting Networks**  
   The term "programming undertaking" **excludes networks that fall within the definition of a network under the Broadcasting Act**.  
   This distinction is important because the *Broadcasting Act* governs traditional public and commercial broadcasting (e.g., TV networks like CBC or CTV), and thus, the scope of these regulations does not apply to those entities. The regulations are specifically targeted at non-broadcasting, telecommunication-based distribution models.

2. **Telecommunication Requirement**  
   The definition is limited to transmission or communication via **telecommunication**, which includes technologies such as:
   - Cable
   - Satellite
   - Internet-based streaming
   - Direct-to-home (DTH) services
   - Other forms of electronic data transmission

   This excludes physical distribution (e.g., print or analog broadcast over airwaves) and focuses on digital, point-to-point, or point-to-mass transmission.

3. **Two-Part Structure**  
   The definition is structured in two parts:
   - **Part (a)**: The entity that transmits its own programming to a specific recipient.
   - **Part (b)**: The entity that communicates that programming to the public.

   This structure allows for a broad interpretation that covers both direct distribution (e.g., a cable provider sending content to a subscriber) and public dissemination (e.g., a satellite service broadcasting content to a wide audience).

4. **"All or Part" of Programs**  
   The regulations do not require transmission or communication of entire programs. Even partial transmission (e.g., a single episode or a segment) qualifies under the definition, making it applicable to a wide range of content delivery scenarios.

5. **"Person" as the Subject**  
   The term "person" is used broadly and includes individuals, corporations, and organizations. This ensures the definition applies to both small-scale and large-scale service providers.

### **Legal Context and Application**

- The definition is used in **subsection 3(1.4)** of the *Copyright Act*, which governs the rights of creators and rights holders in relation to the transmission and communication of copyrighted programming.
- The regulations ensure that entities involved in the **distribution of programming through telecommunication networks**—especially those outside the scope of the *Broadcasting Act*—are properly identified and subject to relevant copyright rules.
- This helps prevent unauthorized or unlicensed distribution of copyrighted content and supports the rights of content creators and rights holders in the digital environment.

---

### **Significance and Historical Context**

- Enacted in 1993, these regulations were a response to the rapid growth of digital and cable-based media services during the late 20th century.
- They represent an early attempt by Canadian legislation to regulate the emerging landscape of digital content delivery and to clarify the legal status of non-broadcast networks.
- The regulations laid the groundwork for later developments in copyright law related to internet streaming, digital platforms, and subscription-based services.

### **Conclusion**

The *Programming Undertaking Regulations* provide a clear, legally binding definition of who qualifies as a "programming undertaking" in Canada—specifically, entities that transmit or communicate programming via telecommunication networks, excluding those covered by the *Broadcasting Act*. By defining this category, the regulations ensure that appropriate copyright protections are applied to digital content distribution, supporting the rights of creators while enabling lawful technological innovation in media delivery.

These regulations remain relevant in understanding the legal framework governing digital content distribution in Canada, even as technology evolves into areas such as on-demand streaming and over-the-top (OTT) platforms.
