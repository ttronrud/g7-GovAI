The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of specific sections of a regulatory instrument under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*, specifically:

- **SOR/2016-311, s. 796** (repeated 28 times)
- **SOR/2006-271, s. 9** (once)

### Summary:

This list does **not** contain a detailed regulation itself, but rather a **record of repeals** — meaning that the sections referenced have been **officially removed or canceled** by the Ontario government.

#### Key Points:

1. **Repealed Sections**:
   - **SOR/2016-311, s. 796**: This section was repealed on or after the date the regulation came into force (likely January 1, 2017). It was part of a broader regulatory update or consolidation effort.
   - **SOR/2006-271, s. 9**: This section, which may have been related to the *Ontario Environmental Protection Act* or a similar statute, was also repealed, likely as part of a legislative or regulatory modernization.

2. **Purpose of Repeal**:
   - Repeal typically occurs when a regulation is:
     - Outdated or no longer relevant.
     - Conflicting with newer laws.
     - Superseded by a more comprehensive or updated regulation.
     - Found to be redundant or overly burdensome.
   - In this case, the repeals suggest that the original provisions were either redundant, inconsistent with current policy, or replaced by more effective or modern rules.

3. **Legal Status**:
   - As of the date of repeal (effective January 1, 2017), **both sections are no longer in force**.
   - Any legal or administrative action based on these sections is invalid or unenforceable.

4. **Contextual Clue**:
   - SOR/2016-311 is a *Statutory Regulation* issued in 2016, likely related to environmental protection, waste management, or industrial safety (common themes in such regulations).
   - The repeated references suggest that multiple provisions were affected by the same repeal notice, possibly indicating a broad regulatory reform.

5. **No Content Provided**:
   - The actual **text or content** of the repealed sections is not included in the provided data. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation’s original provisions cannot be offered.

### Conclusion:

The provided text is **not a regulation** but a **list of repeals**. It indicates that **specific sections of a prior regulation (SOR/2016-311, s. 796 and SOR/2006-271, s. 9) have been formally canceled** by the Ontario government. These sections are no longer legally binding or enforceable. There is no active, enforceable regulation in place corresponding to these repealed sections.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> The listed entries are records of repeals — the removal of specific regulatory provisions from the Ontario Statutory Rules. As of the effective date of SOR/2016-311, these sections are **no longer in force** and are **not applicable** under current law. No detailed content of the original regulation is available in this text.
