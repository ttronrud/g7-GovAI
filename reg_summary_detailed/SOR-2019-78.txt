- It is enacted under **sections 304a and 304.1b of the Excise Act, 2001**, which authorize the imposition of excise duties on cannabis products.
- This regulation establishes the **excise duty framework for cannabis** in Canada, including how duties are calculated, who is liable, and under what conditions.

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **(a) "Act"**
- Refers to the *Excise Act, 2001*, the primary legislation governing excise taxes.

#### **(b) "Base Amount"**
The base amount is the foundation for calculating the excise duty on a cannabis product and varies depending on:
- **How the product is obtained** (by purchase vs. otherwise)
- **Which specified province** the product is delivered to or produced in.

##### **Case 1: Delivered or Made Available Without Purchase**
- If a person obtains cannabis **not through a purchase** (e.g., gifted, given, or received as a result of a non-commercial transaction), the **fair market value** of the product is the base amount.

##### **Case 2: All Other Cases (e.g., Purchased or Sold)**
The base amount is calculated using a formula:
> **Base Amount = (A) + (B) + (C) × (D)**

Where:
- **A** = Total dutiable amount under section 2 of the Act (based on product type and quantity)
- **B** = Total amount under section 1 of Schedule 7 of the Act (relating to production or processing costs)
- **C** = A provincial-specific amount determined under **section 1 of a relevant Schedule** (based on province):
  - Ontario → Schedule 1
  - New Brunswick → Schedule 4
  - Prince Edward Island → Schedule 6
  - Saskatchewan → Schedule 7
  - Alberta → Schedule 8
  - Newfoundland and Labrador → Schedule 9
  - Nunavut → Schedule 12
- **D** = A provincial-specific percentage (from **section 5 of the relevant Schedule**) applied to C.

> This formula ensures that each province has a unique duty structure based on local economic and regulatory factors.

#### **(c) "Listed Specified Province"**
Refers to the following provinces:
- Ontario
- New Brunswick
- Prince Edward Island
- Saskatchewan
- Alberta

- **Reference standards** (highly purified, standardized substances used in labs or research) that:
  - Contain known quantities of cannabis chemicals (e.g., THC, CBD)
  - Are used for **analytical, medical, industrial, educational, law enforcement, or research** purposes
  - Are **not intended for human consumption**

> These exclusions ensure that lab tools and scientific reference materials are not taxed as cannabis products.

### **3. Dutiable Amount Determination**

#### **(a) For Products Delivered or Made Available Without Purchase**

- This applies when the product is given as a gift, received as a donation, or otherwise not acquired via a formal sale or purchase.

- A duty is imposed on **cannabis produced in Canada** if it is **intended for consumption, use, or sale to consumers in a specified province**.

##### **Duty Calculation by Province**:
Each province applies a **tiered formula** to determine the duty amount. The structure is consistent across provinces but varies in specific schedules.

| Province | Duty Formula |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ontario** | Total of: <br> - Greater of (Schedule 1, section 1 vs. section 2) <br> - If section 1 ≥ section 2 → Schedule 1, section 5; otherwise → Schedule 1, section 6 |
| **Quebec** | Greater of (Schedule 2, section 1 vs. section 2) |
| **Nova Scotia** | Greater of (Schedule 3, section 1 vs. section 2) |
| **New Brunswick** | Total of: <br> - Greater of (Schedule 4, section 1 vs. section 2) <br> - If section 1 ≥ section 2 → Schedule 4, section 5; otherwise → Schedule 4, section 6 |
| **BC** | Greater of (Schedule 5, section 1 vs. section 2) |
| **PEI** | Total of: <br> - Greater of (Schedule 6, section 1 vs. section 2) <br> - If section 1 ≥ section 2 → Schedule 6, section 5; otherwise → Schedule 6, section 6 |
| **Saskatchewan** | Total of: <br> - Greater of (Schedule 7, section 1 vs. section 2) <br> - If section 1 ≥ section 2 → Schedule 7, section 5; otherwise → Schedule 7, section 6 |
| **Alberta** | Total of: <br> - Greater of (Schedule 8, section 1 vs. section 2) <br> - If section 1 ≥ section 2 → Schedule 8, section 5; otherwise → Schedule 8, section 6 |

| **Yukon** | Greater of (Schedule 10, section 1 vs. section 2) |
| **NWT** | Greater of (Schedule 11, section 1 vs. section 2) |
| **Nunavut** | Total of: <br> - Greater of (Schedule 12, section 1 vs. section 2) <br> - If section 1 ≥ section 2 → Schedule 12, section 5; otherwise → Schedule 12, section 6 |

> The formula ensures that **Ontario, New Brunswick, PEI, SK, AB, NL, and Nunavut** have a **multi-tiered duty** (with a "fallback" to section 6), while others have a simpler two-tiered structure.
