### **Key Provisions and Details**

#### 1. **Prescribed Form**  
- The **form of the Notice of Objection** is set out in the **Schedule** attached to the regulation.  
- This form is mandatory and must be used by any company that wishes to object to an assessment under subsection 26(1.1) of the Northern Pipeline Act.

#### 2. **Scope of Application**  
- Applies specifically to **objections to assessments under subsection 26(1.1)** of the Northern Pipeline Act.  
- This subsection typically relates to assessments of pipeline-related costs, charges, or fees imposed on companies operating or using the Northern Pipeline system.

#### 3. **One Notice per Assessment**  
- A **separate Notice of Objection** must be submitted for **each individual assessment** to which an objection is being made.  
- **Exception**: If the facts and reasons for objection are **identical** across multiple assessments, the company may consolidate the statement of facts and reasons into a single notice.  
  - This consolidation is permitted only when the underlying factual basis and legal grounds are the same.  
  - The regulation allows for efficiency in submission without compromising procedural integrity.

#### 4. **Number of Copies**  
- **Two (2) completed and signed copies** of the Notice of Objection must be prepared.  
- The signature must be provided by an **authorized officer** of the company (e.g., a director, officer, or person with legal authority to act on behalf of the company).

#### 5. **Delivery Requirements**  
- The two copies must be sent by **registered mail** to:  
  > *The Minister responsible for the Northern Pipeline Agency*  
  > Post Office Box 1605, Station B  
  > Ottawa, Ontario  
  > K1P 5A0  
- The **envelope must be postmarked within 30 days** of the date on which the *Notice of Assessment* is mailed to the company.  
  - This 30-day deadline is critical and establishes a strict time limit for filing an objection.

#### 6. **Timing of Objection**  
- The objection must be filed **within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Assessment**.  
- This ensures timely review and prevents undue delays in administrative processes.

- **Procedural Fairness**: The regulation provides a structured, transparent, and time-bound process for companies to challenge assessments, protecting their rights under the Act.  
- **Efficiency**: The consolidation rule allows companies to avoid redundant submissions when multiple assessments share the same factual and legal basis, reducing administrative burden.  
- **Timeliness**: The 30-day deadline ensures that assessments are reviewed promptly and prevents prolonged disputes.  
- **Legal Authority**: The requirement for an authorized officer to sign the notice ensures that objections are made by legitimate corporate representatives, enhancing their legal validity.
