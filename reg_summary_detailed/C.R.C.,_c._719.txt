**Note on Repetition:**  
The repeated entries ("[Repealed, SOR/2012-253, s. 17]") likely reflect a formatting or data entry error in the original source, possibly due to a copy-paste issue or system duplication. However, they do not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed—only one repeal event is referenced.
