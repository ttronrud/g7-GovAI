**Regulation Summary: Designation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development as the Appropriate Minister for the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO)**

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**

- The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 2 of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 69(2); R.S., c. F-11)**.
- Specifically, it invokes **paragraph (c.1)a of the definition of "appropriate Minister"** in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act.
- This provision allows for the designation of a Minister of the Crown as the "appropriate Minister" for a particular organization or body when the organization is established under the Financial Administration Act and requires ministerial oversight or financial accountability.

**2. Key Action Taken:**

- The **Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, officially designates the **Minister of Employment and Social Development** as the **appropriate Minister** with respect to the **Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO)**.

**3. Purpose of the Designation:**

- The designation establishes the Minister of Employment and Social Development as the official point of contact and responsible minister for the governance, funding, and oversight of CASDO under the Financial Administration Act.
- This ensures that CASDO, which is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility standards in Canada (particularly in the areas of digital and physical accessibility), operates under a clear and accountable ministerial framework.

**4. Effective Date:**

- The designation becomes effective on **July 11, 2019**.

**5. Significance and Context:**

- CASDO was established to develop and maintain the **Canadian Accessibility Standards (CAS)**, which are designed to ensure that public services, digital content, and physical environments are accessible to people with disabilities.
- By designating the Minister of Employment and Social Development as the appropriate Minister, the government assigns responsibility for CASDO’s strategic direction, budget, and compliance with federal financial and administrative rules.
- This reflects the government’s commitment to accessibility as a core value in public service delivery and aligns with broader disability inclusion policies.

**6. Legal and Administrative Implications:**

- The designation ensures that CASDO receives appropriate financial and administrative support through the federal budget process.
- It also provides clarity in interdepartmental coordination, particularly between the Department of Employment and Social Development (ESDC) and other federal departments involved in accessibility (e.g., Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, or the Department of Justice).
- The Financial Administration Act provides the legal basis for such ministerial designations, ensuring that public funds are allocated and managed in accordance with established accountability and transparency principles.

**7. Relevance to Accessibility Policy:**

- This designation supports the implementation of the **Canadian Accessibility Standards**, which are critical for ensuring equal access to services and information for persons with disabilities.
- It reinforces Canada’s obligations under international human rights instruments, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and domestic legislation like the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)** in Ontario.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally assigns the Minister of Employment and Social Development as the designated minister responsible for the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization under the Financial Administration Act, effective July 11, 2019.
