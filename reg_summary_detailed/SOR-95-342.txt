The provided text consists of three identical entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2006-321, s. 5]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 5 of the Statutory Instruments Regulation (SOR/2006-321)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repealing Instrument**: *SOR/2006-321*, which stands for *Statutory Instrument 2006-321*.
- **Section Cited**: Section 5 of that Statutory Instrument specifically repealed the regulation in question.
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect upon the coming into force of SOR/2006-321, which was published in 2006.
- **Legal Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are no longer applicable. Entities or individuals relying on it would need to refer to current, active legislation or regulations for compliance.

### Contextual Notes:
- SOR/2006-321 is a Statutory Instrument issued under the authority of the Government of Canada (or a provincial jurisdiction, depending on the context—though without further detail, it is likely federal).
- The repetition of the same line three times may reflect a formatting or archival error in the original document, but it does not suggest multiple distinct regulations or amendments.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** to summarize because the regulation referenced has been **officially repealed**. The only factual detail is that it was removed from the legal framework by **Section 5 of SOR/2006-321**.

👉 **Recommendation**: To understand what replaced the repealed regulation (if applicable), one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulatory framework referenced in SOR/2006-321 or subsequent amendments.

If you can provide more context—such as the name of the regulation, the subject matter (e.g., environmental, health, transportation), or the jurisdiction (federal, provincial, etc.)—I can help identify what replaced it or provide further historical or legal context.
