### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Production Insurance Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 22)**

The **Canada Production Insurance Regulations**, made under the **Farm Income Protection Act (FIPA)**, establish a framework for compensating agricultural producers for losses caused by **wildlife damage**, beyond the scope of standard crop insurance programs. These regulations are designed to address **exceptional circumstances** where existing crop insurance mechanisms do not adequately cover wildlife-related damages, and they formalize the creation of **wildlife compensation mechanisms** through agreements between the federal government (via the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) and participating provinces.

This summary provides a comprehensive, structured breakdown of the regulation’s **purpose, key definitions, obligations, financial safeguards, and operational requirements**.

---

## **I. Purpose and Background**

### **1. Legislative Basis**
- The regulations are enacted under **subsection 18(2)** of the *Farm Income Protection Act*, which authorizes the Minister to consult with provinces on insurance-related matters.
- The Minister has determined that **exceptional circumstances** exist—specifically, damage to agricultural products caused by **wildlife**—that are not adequately addressed by existing crop insurance programs under provincial agreements (pursuant to subsections 4(1) and 12(5) of FIPA).
- The Minister consulted with provinces under **subsection 12(1)** of FIPA to determine appropriate responses.
- Based on this consultation, the **Governor in Council authorized** the Minister to enter into **production insurance agreements** with one or more provinces to provide **wildlife compensation** to producers.

### **2. Objective**
To create a **formal, transparent, and financially responsible mechanism** for compensating producers for **wildlife-caused damage** to agricultural products, while ensuring that such compensation:
- Is **actuarially sound**,
- Is **financially sustainable**,
- Does not lead to **moral hazard** or **overcompensation**,
- Is **aligned with national standards** and **provincial capacity**.

| **Production insurance agreement** | A bilateral agreement between Canada and a province to share costs and support insurance programs |
| **Responsible officer** | Provincial official designated to manage the province’s insurance program |

## **III. Core Requirements of Production Insurance Agreements**

### **1. Proposal Submission for New or Changed Programs**
- Any province proposing:
  - A **new insurance plan** for a **new agricultural product**, or
  - A **change to an existing program** with financial impact
  must submit a **written proposal at least 60 days before implementation**.
- Proposal must include:
  - Complete operational details
  - Financial impact estimate
- Canada will respond within a reasonable time to determine:
  - Whether the proposal is eligible for **federal contributions**
  - Any **non-compliance** with the Act or these Regulations

---

### **2. Coverage Limits (Maximum Insurable Value)**

| Insurance Plan Type | Maximum Coverage Level |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Based on **yield** | 90% of probable yield |
| Not based on yield, with weather/peril-related production loss | 90% of value of production |
| All other non-yield-based plans | 100% of value of production **minus** long-term average loss percentage (or 90% of value if long-term loss % cannot be determined) |

> *Note: This ensures that coverage does not exceed realistic production expectations and prevents over-insurance.*

---

### **3. Multi-Peril Coverage Requirement**
- All insurance contracts (except those covering losses specified in section 15(c)) must provide coverage for **more than one peril** (e.g., drought, pests, wildlife).
- This promotes **risk diversification** and reduces dependency on single-event coverage.

---

### **4. Determining Farm Enterprise Losses**
- Loss = **Total production guarantee** – **Total actual production (adjusted for quality losses)**
- Applies to all farm enterprises (joint or individual producers)

---

### **5. Criteria for Separate Insurance Coverage of Agricultural Products**
An agricultural product may be covered separately under an insurance plan if it meets **all four** of the following:
1. Can be **distinguished** from other like products
2. Has a **separate market price**
3. Has **different productive capabilities or risks**
4. Has **sufficient volume and data** to support financial viability

> *Example: Organic vs. conventional wheat may qualify due to different market prices and risks.*

---

### **6. Risk-Splitting Benefits (Special Provisions)**

#### a) **Definition**
- A risk-splitting benefit is an insurance benefit that **splits risk** (e.g., wildlife damage) from other perils (e.g., weather).
- Such benefits are **not part of standard coverage**.

#### b) **Conditions for Feasibility**
To be supported by Canada, the risk-splitting benefit must demonstrate:
- **Standards and procedures** for adjusting losses are in place
- **Adequate administrative resources** are available (agreed upon by Canada and province)
- **Administrative costs** are reported separately from other insurance costs
- **Sufficient volume and data** to ensure financial viability

#### c) **Loss Adjustment & Payment Rules**
- Damage must be paid **only once**.
- Any indemnity under a risk-splitting benefit must be **deducted** from other indemnities under the same contract.

#### d) **Eligibility for Premium Support**
A risk-splitting benefit may receive **premium support** under high-cost production coverage if **one of the following is true**:
1. The province proves the benefit arises from **third-party intervention** (e.g., government or private action)
2. Statistical analysis shows **lower indemnity payments** than under a standard plan
3. Total costs of the benefit are **less than** those of a standard plan without risk-splitting

---

## **IV. Premium Rate Requirements**

### **General Principles**
- Premiums must be established in an **actuarially sound manner**
- Must include:
  - Full cost of risk transfer
  - A **repayment mechanism** for program deficits
  - A **reserve margin** (to cover future losses)
- Premiums for **risk-splitting benefits** must be calculated **separately** from other benefits
- All cost elements must be included in premium calculations

### **Mandatory Actuarial Opinions**
Each agreement must require submission of two signed actuary opinions:
1. **Opinion on premium rate methodology** (must be actuarially sound)
2. **Opinion on program self-sustainability** (must demonstrate the program can cover its costs without deficits)

> *Note: These opinions are required to ensure financial responsibility and transparency.*

### **Payment Limits Until Opinions Are Submitted**
- If **one requirement** is met → Canada pays **90%** of the amount otherwise payable
- If **neither requirement** is met → Canada pays **80%**

> *This acts as a financial safeguard to prevent unsustainable or unproven programs.*

### **Premium Receipts for Reinsurance Fund**
- If opinions are not submitted, the Minister will use **estimated premium receipts** (based on what would have been collected if opinions had been positive) to calculate payments from the **Crop Reinsurance Fund**.

> *This ensures continuity of funding while maintaining accountability.*

### **Exception for New Agricultural Products**
- No actuarial opinion is required for **premium rate methodologies** for **new agricultural products** (due to lack of data)

---

## **V. Probable Yield Methodologies**

### **Requirements**
- Probable yields must be determined using **statistical measures** based on **actual yields per seeded area**
- Adjustments may be made to reflect:
  - Producers’ demonstrated productive capabilities
  - Quality levels relevant to the insurance plan

### **Alternative Data Sources**
- If insurance data is unavailable or unrepresentative, other data (e.g., historical yields, farm records) may be used **with provincial agreement**

### **Actuarial Opinion Requirements**
-
