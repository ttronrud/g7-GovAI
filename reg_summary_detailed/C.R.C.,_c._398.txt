Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, which appears to be a **Proclamation issued by the Government of Canada** under its authority to certify the status of certain states and territories as **High Contracting Parties** to key international air carriage conventions.

### 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Nature and Purpose of the Proclamation**
This document is a **formal Canadian government proclamation** issued under the authority of the Crown, with the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**. Its primary purpose is to **certify and declare** the status of various states and their territories as **High Contracting Parties** to three key international agreements governing international air carriage:

- The **Warsaw Convention (1929)**  
- The **Protocol amending the Warsaw Convention (1955)** – known as the **Hague Protocol**  
- The **Additional Protocol** to the Warsaw Convention (which allows certain states to opt out of certain provisions)

This proclamation serves as **legal notification** to the international community and domestic stakeholders that Canada recognizes these states and their territories as parties to these treaties, and that the relevant provisions of the treaties are now applicable to those jurisdictions.

#### **2. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

##### **A. Certification of High Contracting Party Status to the Warsaw Convention (1929)**

> *"Each state named in Part I of Schedule I and Schedule II hereto is a High Contracting Party to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed at Warsaw on October 12, 1929, in respect of the territory described in that Part opposite the state named."*

- **What this means**:  
  The Canadian government officially recognizes that the listed states (and their territories) are parties to the **Warsaw Convention**, which establishes standardized rules for international air carriage, including liability limits for damage to luggage or cargo, and rules on jurisdiction and enforcement.

- **Territories included**:  
  The proclamation includes **all territories under the sovereignty or jurisdiction** of each listed state. For example:
  - Australia → includes all Australian territories (e.g., Northern Territory, external territories)
  - France → includes overseas territories such as French Guiana, Réunion, etc.
  - United Kingdom → includes Crown Dependencies (e.g., Isle of Man, Channel Islands), as well as overseas territories (e.g., Gibraltar, Bermuda)

- **States explicitly listed**:
  - Australia  
  - France  
  - Netherlands  
  - New Zealand  
  - Norway  
  - South Africa  
  - Spain  
  - The U.S.S.R. (now defunct; refers to the Soviet Union)  
  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  
  - The United States of America  

> ✅ **Note**: This certification applies to **international carriage by air** conducted within or involving these territories.

##### **B. Certification of High Contracting Party Status to the Hague Protocol (1955)**

> *"Each state named in Part II of Schedule I and Schedule II hereto is a High Contracting Party to the Protocol to amend the said Convention signed at The Hague on September 28, 1955, as set out in Schedule III to the Carriage by Air Act."*

- **What this means**:  
  The **Hague Protocol (1955)** modernized the Warsaw Convention by:
  - Extending liability limits for damage to baggage and cargo
  - Clarifying rules on liability for loss or damage
  - Introducing new rules on the application of the Convention to carriage by air between countries

- **Applicability**:  
  This certification confirms that the listed states (same as above) have ratified or acceded to the **amendment**, thereby bringing their international air carriage laws into line with updated standards.

- **Date of Entry into Force**:  
  The proclamation notes that the **date on which the Protocol came into force** for each party is specified (though not fully detailed here). This is important because the Protocol only becomes effective when a sufficient number of states have ratified it.

- **States included**:
  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (again, including all its territories)

> ⚠️ **Note**: The Hague Protocol is **not universally applied** to all states. Only those listed in Part II are recognized as having ratified it.

---

##### **C. Certification of the Additional Protocol (Optional Application)**

> *"Each state that is a High Contracting Party named in Part III of Schedule I hereto has availed itself of the Additional Protocol to the said Convention to the extent that it has declared at the time of accession to the Convention that the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Convention shall not apply to international carriage by air performed directly by the state or any territory or possession under its jurisdiction."*

- **What this means**:  
  The **Additional Protocol** allows certain states to **opt out** of the first paragraph of **Article 2 of the Warsaw Convention**, which normally applies to international carriage and requires that liability for damage be governed by the Convention.

  By declaring at accession that **"the first paragraph of Article 2 does not apply"**, a state may exclude the Convention’s liability rules when:
  - The carriage is **direct** (i.e., carried entirely within the state’s own territory or by its own carriers)
  - The flight is **domestic** or **within the jurisdiction** of that state

- **Purpose**:  
  This provision allows states to maintain **domestic air transport rules** that differ from the international standards set by the Warsaw Convention, particularly in cases where national laws or public policy require different liability frameworks.

- **States that have availed themselves of this**:  
  The list of such states is included in **Part III of Schedule I**.  
  (Note: The exact list is not provided in the excerpt, but the proclamation confirms that these states have made such declarations.)

> ✅ Example: A state may allow its domestic airlines to be governed by its own civil aviation laws rather than the Warsaw Convention’s liability limits.

#### **4. Legal and Practical Implications**

| Implication | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Standardization of Air Carriage Rules** | All listed states are bound by standardized rules on liability, carriage, and jurisdiction for international flights. |

| **Domestic Exemptions** | States that have opted into the Additional Protocol can maintain **national liability regimes** for domestic flights, avoiding international treaty rules. |
| **Territorial Coverage** | The inclusion of **overseas territories and possessions** ensures that international air transport involving these areas is governed by the relevant treaty. |

#### **5. Historical and Contextual Background**

- The **Warsaw Convention (1929)** was the first international treaty to standardize rules for international air carriage.  
- The **Hague Protocol (1955)** updated and modernized the Convention, especially regarding liability and scope.  
- The **Additional Protocol** allows flexibility for states to tailor rules for domestic operations, reflecting national regulatory preferences.
