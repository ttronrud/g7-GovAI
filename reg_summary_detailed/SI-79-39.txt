### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Chief Officer of Customs** | The manager of the customs office or offices serving a particular area or place. This is the official responsible for processing applications and decisions related to remission. |
| **Non-Commercial Imported Goods** | Goods imported **not for sale or commercial, industrial, or business use**, and where the **total customs duties and excise taxes payable do not exceed $50**. This excludes any goods intended for resale or commercial purposes. |

> ✅ *This definition is crucial: only goods imported for personal, household, or non-commercial reasons (e.g., personal repairs, replacements) qualify.*

---

### **4. Conditions for Remission of Duties and Excise Taxes**

The Order provides **three distinct scenarios** under which remission may be granted. In each case, the importer must submit **evidence** to a **Chief Officer of Customs**.

---

#### ✅ **Scenario 1: Replacement Due to Defect or Inferior Quality**
*Applies when goods are defective or of inferior quality and need to be replaced.*

**Conditions**:
- The goods are **not of the class or description** originally ordered.
- The goods are **defective or of inferior quality**.
- The goods have either:
  - Been **destroyed in Canada under the supervision of a customs officer**, **or**
  - Been **exported from Canada to the supplier** within **one year** of importation.

**Remission Granted For**:
- Customs duties and excise taxes **paid or payable** in respect of the original defective goods.

> ⚠️ *Note*: This applies only to **non-commercial imports** and where the total tax liability is ≤ $50.

---

#### ✅ **Scenario 2: Replacement of Defective Goods (Same Class, Approximate Value)**
*Applies when a replacement is needed after the original goods were destroyed or exported.*

**Conditions**:
- The replacement goods:
  - Are of a **similar class** and **approximately the same value** as the original defective goods.
- The **cost of the replacement** is **borne by the supplier**.
- The replacement is imported **within six months** of the destruction or exportation of the original goods.
- **No prior remission, refund, or drawback** has been granted for the original defective goods.

**Remission Granted For**:
- Customs duties and excise taxes **paid or payable** on the replacement goods.

> 📌 *This ensures that the importer does not bear the cost of a replacement if the original goods were defective and the supplier is responsible.*

---

#### ✅ **Scenario 3: Goods Exported for Repair (Under Warranty/Guarantee)**
*Applies when goods are exported for repair under a warranty or guarantee.*

**Conditions**:
- The goods were exported **within one year** of their initial importation.
- The goods were **returned to Canada within six months** of export.
- The **cost of repair** (excluding shipping, communication, or other incidental costs) is **borne by the foreign supplier** under the terms of the warranty or guarantee.

**Remission Granted For**:
- Customs duties and excise taxes **paid or payable** on the goods **after repair and re-importation**.

> 📌 *This supports consumer protection and warranty obligations by allowing tax relief when goods are repaired under a supplier’s guarantee.*

---

### **5. Application Requirements**

Remission **cannot be granted unless**:
- A formal **application is submitted** to the **Chief Officer of Customs** at the **customs office where the goods were originally imported**.
- The application is made within **90 days** of:
  - The **destruction or exportation** of the original defective goods (for Scenario 1 or 2), **or**
  - The **entry into Canada** of the replacement or repaired goods (for Scenarios 2 or 3).

> ❌ *Late applications will not be accepted.*

---

### **6. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No remission applies** if:
  - The goods were imported for **commercial or business purposes**.

  - A **prior remission, refund, or drawback** has already been granted for the original goods.
- The **supplier must bear the cost** of the replacement or repair (except for shipping, communication, or other incidental expenses).
- The **original goods must have been defective or of inferior quality** — mere dissatisfaction or normal wear and tear does not qualify.
