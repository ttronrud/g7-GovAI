**Detailed Summary of the Oaths of Allegiance and Office Order (N.W.T.)**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Oaths of Allegiance and Office Order (N.W.T.)*. It serves as a legal instrument that prescribes the specific oaths required of the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories (NWT), outlining both the oath of allegiance and the oath of office.

---

**2. Oath of Allegiance**  
- The *oath of allegiance* is derived from the *Oaths of Allegiance Act*.  
- This oath is mandatory for the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories to take and subscribe.  
- However, it is important to note that **the specific wording or content of the oath of allegiance is not provided in this Order**. It is referenced only as being prescribed by the parent Act (Oaths of Allegiance Act), which governs the formal declaration of loyalty to the Crown.  
- This oath is intended to affirm the Commissioner’s loyalty to the Canadian Crown and the principles of the Canadian Constitution.

> **Note**: The reference to the oath of allegiance being "repealed" in 2014 (Section 61 of *c. 2, s. 61*) indicates that the provision was formally removed or superseded by subsequent legislation. This suggests that the current Order may no longer require the Commissioner to take a formal oath of allegiance, or that such a requirement has been replaced or abolished.

**3. Oath of Office**  
- The *oath of office* is the formal pledge taken by the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories to perform their duties.  
- The specific wording of this oath is set out in **Schedule I** of the Order.  
- The oath in Schedule I reads:  
  > *"I, [Name], do solemnly and sincerely promise and swear that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my skill and knowledge execute the powers and trust reposed in me as the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories. So help me God."*  
- This oath emphasizes the Commissioner’s commitment to:  
  - Duly and faithfully carrying out their responsibilities.  
  - Exercising their powers with integrity, competence, and diligence.  
  - Acting in the public interest and within the bounds of their official duties.  
- The phrase *"to the best of my skill and knowledge"* reflects a standard of professional accountability and due diligence expected of public officials.

> **Note**: The oath is a solemn and binding declaration, with the invocation of "So help me God" indicating a religious component traditionally associated with oaths in Commonwealth jurisdictions. This may reflect historical or cultural practices, though it may not be required under modern secular frameworks.

**4. Administration of the Oaths**  
- The Commissioner must take both the oath of allegiance (if applicable) and the oath of office **before the Clerk or Assistant Clerk of the Privy Council**.  
- This procedural requirement establishes a formal and official channel for the swearing-in of the Commissioner, ensuring that the process is conducted under the authority of a recognized public office.  
- However, **this provision is also marked as "repealed" in 2014 (Section 62 of *c. 2, s. 62*)**.  
  - This means that the requirement to swear before the Clerk or Assistant Clerk of the Privy Council has been **removed or replaced** by newer legislation or administrative procedures.  
  - As a result, the current process for swearing in the Commissioner may now be conducted before a different official (e.g., the Chief Minister, the Lieutenant Governor, or a designated public official), or may be administered informally or under different rules.

---

**5. Legal Status and Repeal**  
- The Order was **repealed in 2014** through *Chapter 2, Section 61 and 62* of the *N.W.T. Statutes*.  
- This repeal indicates that the original provisions—specifically the requirement to take the oath of allegiance and to swear before the Clerk of the Privy Council—are **no longer in force**.  
- The current version of the Order may be a historical or archived document, and the actual swearing-in of the Commissioner may now follow updated procedures established under other legislation or administrative guidelines.

---

**6. Implications and Interpretation**  
- Despite the repeal, the **core substance of the oath of office**—a solemn promise to serve faithfully and with competence—remains relevant and may be preserved in current practice.  
- The omission of the oath of allegiance and the procedural requirement to swear before the Clerk of the Privy Council suggests a shift toward a more streamlined, modern, and possibly secular process for appointing and inducting public officials in the NWT.  
- The inclusion of the oath in Schedule I reflects a foundational element of public service ethics and accountability.

**Conclusion**  
The *Oaths of Allegiance and Office Order (N.W.T.)* is a historical regulatory instrument that once defined the formal oaths required of the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories. While the original provisions—particularly the oath of allegiance and the requirement to swear before the Clerk of the Privy Council—have been **repealed in 2014**, the **oath of office remains a foundational element** of the Commissioner’s duties. The current oath emphasizes loyalty, diligence, and public service, and though administered under different procedures today, it continues to serve as a symbolic and ethical commitment to the role.

> **Key Takeaway**: This Order is largely obsolete in its current form due to repeal. However, its core oath of office—focused on faithful and competent service—may still influence the swearing-in practices of the Commissioner in the NWT, even if administered differently today.
