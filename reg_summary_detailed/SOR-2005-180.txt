**Detailed Summary of the Motor Carrier Safety Fitness Certificate Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

These regulations are issued under **Section 16.1a of the Motor Vehicle Transport Act (MVT Act)**, which empowers the **Minister of Transport** to consult with all affected provinces before establishing or amending regulations related to the safety fitness of motor carriers operating across provincial boundaries.

The regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, following consultations with provincial authorities. This ensures that the rules are both nationally consistent and responsive to provincial concerns.

The regulatory framework is rooted in **S.C. 2001, c. 13, s. 6** and **R.S., c. 29 (3rd Supp.); S.C. 2001, c. 13, s. 1**, which provide the authority and procedural foundation for the regulation.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Motor Vehicle Transport Act*.
- **Safety Fitness Certificate**: A certificate issued under **Section 8 of the MVT Act** to verify that a motor carrier meets minimum safety standards.
- **NSC Standard #14**: The *National Safety Code for Motor Carriers, Standard #14 — Safety Rating*, as amended from time to time. This standard provides the methodology and criteria for assessing and assigning safety ratings to motor carriers.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to two primary entities:

1. **Provincial Authorities** – Those responsible for issuing safety fitness certificates within their jurisdiction.
2. **Extra-Provincial Motor Carrier Undertakings** – Motor carriers that operate across provincial borders (i.e., not solely within one province).

---

### **4. Eligibility for Issuance of a Safety Fitness Certificate**

A provincial authority may issue a safety fitness certificate to a person or body that operates an extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking if the vehicle meets **one or both of the following criteria**:

- A **truck, tractor, trailer, or combination** with a **registered gross vehicle weight exceeding 4,500 kg**.
- A **bus** designed and used for passenger transportation with a **designated seating capacity of more than 10 persons (including the driver)**, and operated **for purposes other than personal use**.

> *Note: This excludes private or personal use vehicles.*

---

### **5. Mandatory Requirements for Provincial Authorities**

Each provincial authority must:

#### a) Assign a **Unique National Safety Code (NSC) Number**
- Every extra-provincial motor carrier operating in the province must be assigned a **unique NSC number**.
- This number is used to identify and track the carrier across jurisdictions.

#### b) Develop and Maintain a **Motor Carrier Profile**
- For every extra-provincial motor carrier based in the province and holding a safety fitness certificate, the authority must maintain a **comprehensive motor carrier profile**.
- The profile must contain all information specified in **Section 2 of Part C of NSC Standard #14**.
- This includes details such as ownership, operations, vehicle types, driver information, and safety records.

---

### **6. Safety Rating Requirement**

Before issuing a safety fitness certificate, a provincial authority **must assign a safety rating** to the carrier based on the process outlined in **Section 3 of Part C of NSC Standard #14**.

The safety rating must be one of the following:
- **"Satisfactory"**
- **"Satisfactory (Unaudited)"**
- **"Conditional"**

> ⚠️ **A safety fitness certificate cannot be issued unless the carrier has a rating of "satisfactory," "satisfactory unaudited," or "conditional."**

This rating is determined through a systematic evaluation of the carrier’s safety performance, including:
- Historical accident records
- Compliance with safety standards
- Driver qualifications
- Maintenance records
- Enforcement history

---

### **7. Required Documentation and Information**

A provincial authority **may not issue a safety fitness certificate** unless it has obtained the information and documents specified in **Section 4 of Part C of NSC Standard #14**.

This includes:
- Proof of ownership or control
- Vehicle registration details
- Driver records
- Maintenance logs
- Safety management systems
- Compliance with other relevant regulations

The authority may **require the carrier to provide** this information directly.

---

### **8. Liability Insurance Requirements**

An extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking must demonstrate compliance with **minimum liability insurance coverage**. The requirements differ slightly between **trucks** and **buses**.

#### a) For Extra-Provincial Truck Undertakings

To cover bodily injury or death to persons (excluding cargo), or property damage to others, the carrier must maintain:

- **$1,000,000 per motor vehicle** (for general liability)
- **$2,000,000 per motor vehicle** if transporting **dangerous goods** listed in **Column 2 of Schedule 1 to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations**, in the quantities specified in **Column 6** of that Schedule.

> *Note: This applies only when an emergency response assistance plan (ERAP) is required under Part 7 of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations.*

#### b) Insurance Policy Endorsement Requirements

The insurance policy must include an **endorsement** stating that:
- At least **15 days before** the policy is:
  - Cancelled
  - Not renewed
  - Lapses
  - Or changed in a way that removes minimum coverage
> The insurer must **notify the provincial authority** to which the proof of insurance was submitted.

#### c) Immediate Notification of Policy Changes

The carrier must **immediately notify** the provincial authority of:
- Any change in the policy
- Any notice from the insurer that the policy will be changed or cancelled
> This ensures timely updates to the provincial authority and maintains regulatory oversight.

---

### **9. Proof of Insurance**

An extra-provincial motor carrier may submit **either**:
- **Written proof** that it currently holds the required minimum liability insurance coverage, **or**
- A **written undertaking to purchase** the required insurance coverage

> However, **proof of actual coverage must be provided before the certificate is issued**.

Thus, an undertaking to purchase insurance is **not sufficient alone**—it must be followed by **proof of coverage** before the certificate can be granted.

---

### **10. Prohibition on Issuance Without Compliance**

A provincial authority **shall not issue a safety fitness certificate** to any extra-provincial motor carrier undertaking unless:
- It has a **valid safety rating** ("satisfactory", "satisfactory unaudited", or "conditional")
- It has **provided the required documentation**
- It has **demonstrated compliance with minimum liability insurance requirements**

---

### **11. Effective Date and Repeal**

- These regulations **come into force on the day that the enabling Act comes into force** — specifically, **the day that "An Act to amend the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987 and to make consequential amendments to other Acts" (Chapter 13 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001) comes into force**.
- The regulations were **in force as of January 1, 2006**, as noted in **SI/2005-58** (Statutory Instrument 2005-58).

> This ensures that the new safety standards are implemented in a coordinated, timely manner across Canada.

---

### **12. Purpose and Significance**

These regulations establish a **national, standardized system** for evaluating and licensing motor carriers that operate across provincial lines. The key objectives include:

- Enhancing **road safety** through consistent, evidence-based safety ratings.
- Ensuring **financial responsibility** through mandatory, minimum liability insurance.
- Improving **transparency and accountability** via the requirement to maintain motor carrier profiles and unique NSC numbers.
- Strengthening **inter-provincial coordination** by aligning provincial safety standards under a common framework (NSC Standard #14).

### **Conclusion**

These regulations represent a critical step toward **national consistency in motor carrier safety oversight**. By mandating standardized safety ratings, detailed carrier profiles, and strict insurance requirements, they ensure that carriers operating across provincial boundaries meet a minimum baseline of safety and financial responsibility. The integration of the NSC Standard #14 provides a transparent, measurable, and enforceable framework for assessing safety performance, ultimately contributing to safer roads and greater public confidence in the transportation sector.
