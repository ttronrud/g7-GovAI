**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
Order in Council P.C. 1988-1094 (Revocation and Authorization)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the Treasury Board, pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**.

### **1. Revocation of Previous Order**  
The regulation formally **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1987-1093**, issued on May 28, 1987, and its corresponding publication in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, page 2212 (SI/87-109).  

- **Purpose of the Revocation:**  
  The 1987 Order had previously established a fee structure for services related to copyright registration under the *Copyright Act*. By revoking this order, the government removes the prior fee provisions that were in place at that time.

- **Legal Basis for Revocation:**  
  The revocation is carried out under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically **paragraph 13(b)**, which allows the Governor in Council to revoke or amend orders in council, particularly those that are no longer necessary or are superseded by new legislative or administrative arrangements.

### **2. Authorization to Prescribe New Fees**  
The regulation **authorizes the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** to issue a new order prescribing the **fee to be paid by persons for services related to registration under the Copyright Act**.

- **Scope of Authority:**  
  The Minister is empowered to set the fee for registration services (such as applying for or processing copyright registrations) through a subsequent **regulatory order**. This includes determining the amount, method of payment, and any conditions related to the fee.

- **Exception to the Copyright Act (Section 41):**  
  This authorization operates **notwithstanding Section 41 of the Copyright Act**.  
  - Section 41 of the *Copyright Act* traditionally prohibits the imposition of fees for copyright registration, as it is considered a public service and not a commercial transaction.  
  - By explicitly stating that the fee can be prescribed "notwithstanding" Section 41, the regulation overrides this statutory restriction.  
  - This is a significant legislative exception, allowing the government to introduce a fee system for copyright registration services — a change that would otherwise be blocked by the Act.

### **Key Implications and Context**

- **Policy Objective:**  
  The revocation and authorization reflect a shift in policy to allow for the **financial sustainability of copyright registration services**. This enables the Canadian government to cover administrative and operational costs associated with processing registration applications, including review, verification, and record-keeping.

- **Administrative Flexibility:**  
  The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs (or a designated official) can now issue a fee order tailored to current costs, inflation, and service demands, providing flexibility in response to changing needs.

- **Public Accountability:**  
  The Minister must ensure that any fee prescribed is reasonable, transparent, and justified, and that it does not create undue burden on applicants, especially small businesses or individuals.

- **Legal Precedent:**  
  This regulation sets a precedent for the government to use administrative authority to introduce fees in areas traditionally exempted by statute — a practice that may be applied in other public services under similar conditions.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation marks a significant administrative and policy change in Canada’s copyright regime. By revoking outdated fee provisions and authorizing the Minister to establish a new registration fee — despite the restrictions in Section 41 of the *Copyright Act* — the government enables a more financially viable and sustainable system for managing copyright registration services. The change underscores the government’s ability to balance statutory constraints with practical administrative needs through delegated authority under the *Financial Administration Act*.

**Note:** This regulation is effective upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*, and any subsequent fee order issued by the Minister will be subject to public notice and potential review.
