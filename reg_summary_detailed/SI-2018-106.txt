### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Authority and Legal Basis**  
   - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)a** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (PSRTDA).  
   - This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) the power to reorganize or transfer control over parts of the federal public service, including the assignment of administrative functions and responsibilities between departments.

2. **Transfer of Responsibility**  
   - The **Internal Trade Directorate** (a division within the Department of Industry) is being transferred.
   - The **control and supervision** of this Directorate are being moved from the **Department of Industry** to the **Privy Council Office (PCO)**.

3. **Nature of the Change**  
   - This is not a dissolution or elimination of the Directorate — it is a **reassignment of oversight and administrative control**.
   - The Directorate continues to operate, but now falls under the administrative authority and policy direction of the Privy Council Office.

4. **Purpose and Implications**  
   - The Privy Council Office serves as the central administrative and policy coordination body for the federal government. It oversees the implementation of government policy, manages interdepartmental coordination, and ensures consistency in public service operations.
   - By transferring the Internal Trade Directorate to the PCO, the government signals a strategic shift toward:
     - Strengthening central coordination of trade policy.
     - Enhancing policy coherence across federal departments.
     - Improving oversight of trade-related activities, which may include standards, compliance, market access, and regulatory frameworks.
     - Aligning internal trade functions more closely with broader government policy objectives.

5. **Timeline and Context**  
   - The regulation was enacted in **2003**, during a period of public service restructuring in Canada.
   - The move reflects a broader trend in federal governance to centralize key policy functions under the PCO to improve efficiency, accountability, and interdepartmental coordination.

6. **Impact on the Department of Industry**  
   - The Department of Industry will no longer have direct control over the Internal Trade Directorate’s operations, staffing, budget, or strategic direction.
   - However, the Directorate may still carry out its operational mandate (e.g., supporting trade policy, managing trade compliance, promoting Canadian exports) under the oversight of the PCO.

7. **Operational Continuity**  
   - The functions and services of the Internal Trade Directorate are preserved. Only the **administrative control and supervision** are transferred.
   - Staffing, funding, and day-to-day operations are likely to remain unchanged, though reporting lines and policy guidance may shift.

### **Significance of the Transfer**

- **Policy Integration**: Places trade policy within a more centralized and strategic framework, ensuring alignment with national economic and policy goals.
- **Accountability**: Enhances accountability by placing trade-related functions under the direct supervision of the Office of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination**: Facilitates better coordination between trade, economic development, and regulatory bodies.
- **Modernization of Public Service Structure**: Part of a larger effort to modernize and streamline federal governance.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant reorganization within Canada’s federal public service. It transfers the **control and supervision** of the **Internal Trade Directorate** from the **Department of Industry** to the **Privy Council Office**, pursuant to statutory authority under the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. The change strengthens central policy oversight, improves coordination of trade-related activities, and reflects a strategic move toward more unified and accountable federal governance. The Directorate continues to function, but now operates under the broader policy and administrative umbrella of the Privy Council Office.

This transfer is a key example of how Canada uses statutory powers to restructure public administration for greater efficiency and coherence.
