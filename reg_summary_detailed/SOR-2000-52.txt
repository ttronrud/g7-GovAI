**Detailed Summary of the Sales or Trades (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Sales or Trades (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the *Bank Act*:

- **Paragraphs 540(4)(b)a and (5)(b)a** of the *Bank Act*  
- **Subsection 540(6)a** of the *Bank Act*

These provisions empower the federal government to regulate certain transactions involving financial instruments issued, guaranteed, or accepted by **authorized foreign banks** in Canada.

The regulation is formally published in *Statutes Canada* as:
- **S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 35(1)** (amending the Bank Act)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 46** (original reference)

### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Bank Act*, which governs banking activities in Canada, including the supervision of foreign banks operating in the country.

- **"Prescribed classes of entities"**:
  - These are defined as all classes of entities composed of any of the entities listed in **subparagraphs 540(4)(a)(i) and (ii)** of the *Bank Act*.
  - These entities typically include:
    - Canadian chartered banks
    - Credit unions
    - Trust companies
    - Other financial institutions designated under the Bank Act as eligible participants in certain financial activities.

> In essence, the regulation applies only to transactions involving entities that fall within these designated classes—ensuring that only certain Canadian financial institutions can engage in transactions with financial instruments from authorized foreign banks.

### **3. Permitted Transactions and Conditions**

Under these regulations, **financial instruments**, **securities**, and **bills of exchange** issued, guaranteed, or accepted by an **authorized foreign bank** may be:

- **Sold to**, or
- **Traded with**, an entity that belongs to a prescribed class of entities  
  — **provided two conditions are met**:

#### **Condition 1: Denomination Requirement**
- The financial instruments, securities, or bills of exchange must be sold or traded in **denominations of $150,000 or more**.

> This threshold ensures that only large-scale, institutional-level transactions are permitted, reducing the risk of small-scale or speculative dealings involving foreign bank instruments.

#### **Condition 2: Written Notification Requirement**
- The **seller or trader** (depending on the transaction type) must provide a **written notice** to the recipient entity (the buyer or trading counterparty) that includes:
  
  1. **Disclosure of the foreign bank’s non-membership status**:
     - The authorized foreign bank that issued, guaranteed, or accepted the financial instrument is **not a member institution** of the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**.
     - This is a critical disclosure because CDIC membership is a key indicator of financial stability and depositor protection in Canada.

  2. **Restriction on Recipient Entities**:
     - The financial instrument, security, or bill of exchange may **only be sold to or traded with an entity that is within a class of entities prescribed by section 2 of the Bank Act**.
     - This means that only institutions recognized under the Bank Act (such as certain Canadian banks, trust companies, or financial institutions) can participate in such transactions.

> This requirement serves to **limit exposure** to entities that may not be financially sound or properly regulated, thereby protecting Canadian financial stability.

### **4. Purpose and Regulatory Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- **Risk mitigation**: Preventing unregulated or non-CDIC-member institutions from engaging in transactions involving foreign bank instruments.
- **Transparency**: Ensuring that all parties are fully informed about the origin and risk profile of the financial instruments involved.
- **Financial system integrity**: Maintaining the stability of Canada’s financial system by restricting access to high-value foreign instruments to only qualified, regulated Canadian institutions.
- **Compliance with international banking standards**: Aligning Canada’s domestic rules with global practices regarding foreign bank participation in domestic financial markets.

### **5. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Statutes of Canada.

> This means they become effective immediately upon official publication and registration, ensuring prompt implementation of the regulatory framework.

### **Conclusion**

The *Sales or Trades (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* establish a **strict and transparent framework** for the sale and trading of financial instruments issued by authorized foreign banks in Canada. By setting a **minimum transaction value of $150,000** and requiring **written disclosure of the foreign bank’s non-membership in CDIC**, the regulations protect Canadian financial institutions and the broader financial system from risks associated with unregulated or unstable foreign entities.
