- Attend meetings and negotiations freely;
- Access necessary information and records;
- Conduct official communications without fear of legal action;
- Operate in a secure and professional environment.

The temporary nature of the Order (limited to the three-day summit) ensures that the privileges and immunities are granted only for the specific purpose of the event and do not extend beyond the defined timeframe.

- **Temporary and Event-Specific**: Applies only to the 2014 Summit and does not extend to other events or future gatherings.
- **Limited in Scope**: Grants only the privileges and immunities necessary for the exercise of official duties related to the Meeting.
- **Based on International Law**: Uses the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities as the legal basis, ensuring consistency with international norms.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a formal legal framework to protect the rights and operational capacity of foreign delegates participating in the 2014 "Saving Every Woman, Every Child" Summit. By granting targeted privileges and immunities under the United Nations Convention, it enables a productive and respectful international dialogue on maternal, newborn, and child health, while maintaining Canada’s legal and diplomatic obligations under international law. The Order reflects Canada’s commitment to supporting global health initiatives through effective, rights-based diplomatic engagement.
