### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **conditional remission (forgiveness) of a debt** owed by the Government of Quebec to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. The remission is granted under a specific financial agreement between Canada and Quebec related to agricultural revenue insurance programs.

The key feature of this regulation is that the remission is **not unconditional**—it is **conditional** upon the Government of Quebec entering into an agreement with the Government of Canada to use the remitted funds for the benefit of Quebec’s grain and oilseed producers.

### **Key Financial Details**

- **Amount of Remission:**  
  $7.828 million (Canadian dollars)  
- **Interest Accrual:**  
  Any interest that has accrued on this amount from **April 1, 2004**, forward, is also included in the remission.  
  → This means the total amount forgiven includes both the principal and interest that has accumulated since that date.

- **Nature of the Debt:**  
  The debt arises under the **Canada-Quebec 2002–2004 Agreement on the Use of the Interest Generated by the Surplus in the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan Funds for Quebec Crops**.  
  → This agreement originally established a framework where surplus interest generated from the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan (GRIP) funds—specifically those allocated to Quebec crops—was to be used for agricultural support.

### **Conditional Requirement**

The remission is **subject to a condition**:

> The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food must enter into an agreement with the Government of Quebec under which:  
> - The Government of Quebec agrees to make the **same amount ($7.828 million plus accrued interest)** available to **Quebec grain and oilseed producers**.  
> - This funding will be provided through the **Production Insurance Program**.

This Production Insurance Program is established under the **Canada-Quebec Implementation Agreement** for the Purposes of Implementing the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Framework Agreement on Agricultural and Agri-Food Policy for the Twenty-First Century.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

- The Governor General in Council determines that the remission is **in the public interest**.  
- The rationale is to ensure that **funds previously tied up in interest from surplus insurance funds are redirected to support agricultural producers** in Quebec—particularly those in the grain and oilseed sectors, who are vulnerable to market fluctuations.

- By conditioning the remission on the use of the funds in a targeted, beneficial way, the regulation ensures that the financial benefit of debt forgiveness does not go unused or unaccounted for, but instead serves the broader public interest in agricultural stability and food security.

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

- **Financial Accountability:** The condition ensures transparency and accountability in how public funds are used.  
- **Inter-Governmental Cooperation:** It reinforces the cooperative framework between federal and provincial governments in agricultural policy.  
- **Support for Producers:** It directly benefits Quebec farmers by providing access to insurance support, which helps mitigate risks in crop production and improves long-term farm viability.

---

### **Timeline and Context**

- The original agreement (2002–2004) created a mechanism for surplus interest from the GRIP funds to be used for agricultural development.  
- By 2004, the surplus interest had accumulated, and the debt related to this surplus was formally recognized.  
- This regulation formalizes the forgiveness of that debt, with a clear mechanism to ensure the funds are not lost to general government spending but are instead deployed to support farmers.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **conditional financial relief measure** that forgives $7.828 million (plus interest from April 1, 2004) owed by the Government of Quebec to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. The forgiveness is not final until the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food enters into an agreement with Quebec** to channel the same amount into the **Production Insurance Program** for grain and oilseed producers.  

This ensures that the financial benefit of the remission is directly tied to **agricultural support**, aligning with the broader goals of agricultural policy stability, equity, and resilience in Quebec’s farming sector. It reflects a balanced approach to intergovernmental finance, combining debt relief with accountability and targeted public benefit.
