**Detailed Summary of the Portions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Treasury Board**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, has issued these regulations under two key provisions of federal law:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)** – This grants the Treasury Board authority to make regulations related to the superannuation of public servants, particularly in cases involving organizational changes or divestitures.
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)** – This empowers the Treasury Board to make rules governing the administration of public service superannuation funds.

These regulations are specifically designed to address the **divestiture of certain functions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** — that is, the transfer of specific RCMP responsibilities or operations to a new employer — and to ensure that affected public servants’ superannuation rights are properly protected during and after this transition.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**

#### **Who Does This Regulation Apply To?**
The regulations apply to a person who:
- Ceases to be employed in the **public service** (specifically, in the RCMP);
- Becomes employed by a **new employer** as a result of an agreement between **Her Majesty in right of Canada** and that new employer.

> **Definition: "New Employer"**  
> A "new employer" is any person or body (such as a government department, agency, or private entity) that, through a formal agreement with the Government of Canada, assumes the duties and responsibilities previously carried out by a portion of the RCMP. It also includes any individual or entity acting on behalf of that new employer.

#### **Exclusions**
- The regulations **do not apply** to a person who later becomes **re-employed** by the same new employer.
- Sections **4 to 9** of the PSSA do not apply to individuals who have exercised an option under subsection **3(2)** (likely referring to a transfer or continuation option in superannuation).
- Sections **12 to 13.01 of the PSSA** only apply to a person **on and after the date they cease employment** with the new employer.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The regulation clarifies that the rights and benefits under the PSSA (such as pension and survivor benefits) only begin to apply from the date of ceasing public service employment — not earlier.

### **3. Key Provisions and Their Implications**

#### **(a) Return of Contributions (Section 12 and 12.1 of the PSSA)**  
If, **without these regulations**, a person would have been entitled to a **return of contributions** under:
- Subsection **12(3)** of the PSSA (return of contributions upon leaving public service), or  
- Subsection **12.1(4)** (return of contributions in certain cases involving private employment),

Then the person may **request a return of contributions** in writing **within one year** of ceasing public service employment and becoming employed by the new employer.

> ✅ This provides a critical right to reclaim contributions made to the public service superannuation fund, which may otherwise be lost or not recoverable under normal circumstances.

#### **(b) Exercise of Transfer Option (Section 13.01 of the PSSA)**  
If, **without these regulations**, a person would have been entitled to exercise an option in favour of the **transfer value** (i.e., the value of their pension or superannuation rights) under section 13.01 of the PSSA, then they may:
- Exercise that option **within one year** of ceasing public service employment and becoming employed by the new employer.

> ✅ This allows individuals to transfer their superannuation rights to a new employer (e.g., in a private sector job) and receive a fair valuation of their pension entitlements — protecting their financial interests during the transition.

#### **(c) Survivor and Child Benefits**  
The **survivors and children** of a person who dies while employed by the new employer are entitled to **one of the following benefits**, which they would have received if the individual had remained employed in the public service:

- The **death benefit** under:
  - Subsection **12(8)** or **12.1(8)** of the PSSA (for pension or retirement benefits).
- The **allowances** under:
  - Subsection **13(3)** or **13.001(3)** of the PSSA (such as dependents' allowances).

> ✅ This ensures that family members are not deprived of vital benefits due to the change in employment status.

> ⚠️ *Note: This provision was previously repealed by SOR/2016-203, section 70 — however, the current version of the regulation appears to reference it as if it remains in force. This may indicate a temporary or transitional application or an error in the reference. As of 2016, this provision is officially repealed, so its continued inclusion may be a drafting oversight or a historical reference. This should be verified with current legislation.*

#### **(d) Child Allowance for Stepchildren or Adopted Children**  
For the purposes of **subsection 26(2) of the PSSA**, a child who:
- Is born to or adopted by the person, or
- Becomes a **stepchild** of the person,

**during the period** between:
- The date the person ceases public service employment, and  
- The date they cease employment with the new employer,

is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA** (which governs pension and superannuation benefits for dependents).

> ✅ This ensures that children formed during the transition period are not excluded from benefits, even if the relationship develops after leaving public service.

#### **(e) One-Year Period for Section 10(5) of the PSSA**  
Under **subsection 10(5)** of the PSSA, which relates to the timing of benefit claims or appeals, the **one-year period** begins on the **date the person ceases employment with the new employer** — not on the date they left public service.

> ✅ Clarifies the timeline for claims or actions related to pension or superannuation rights.

#### **(f) Pensionable Service and Age for PSSA Purposes**  
- **Pensionable service** includes the period of service with the **new employer** that begins on the day the person ceases public service employment and ends on the day they cease employment with the new employer.
- The **age** of the person for purposes of pension calculations is their age on the **day they cease employment with the new employer**.

> ✅ This ensures that the transition period with the new employer is counted toward pensionable service and that age is correctly assessed for retirement eligibility.

### **4. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on July 1, 1999**.

> This marks the beginning of their application in the context of RCMP divestitures and transitions involving public servants.

---

### **5. Key Objectives and Purpose**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

1. **Ensure continuity of superannuation rights** for public servants transitioning from the RCMP to a new employer due to organizational restructuring or divestiture.
2. **Protect individuals** during a period of employment change by allowing them to:
   - Request a return of contributions;
   - Exercise a transfer option for pension value;
   - Receive survivor and child benefits;
   - Maintain dependant allowances.
3. **Clarify key definitions and timelines**, especially regarding service periods, age, and benefit eligibility.
4. **Provide transitional fairness** to employees who may have been displaced or reassigned due to government reorganization.

---

### **6. Important Notes and Caveats**

- The regulation references a **repealed provision** (SOR/2016-203, s. 70), which suggests that the survivor and child benefit clause may no longer be valid. This may require legal or administrative review to determine whether the provision is still enforceable or if it has been superseded by newer legislation.
- The inclusion of **"new employer"** as a broad term allows flexibility in applying the rules to various types of entities (public or private) that may take over RCMP functions.
- The one-year window for requesting returns or exercising transfer options is **strict** and must be met to be valid — no extensions are provided.

---

### **Conclusion**

These **Portions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Divestiture Regulations** serve as a critical bridge between the public service and private or new public-sector employment following the divestiture of RCMP functions. They ensure that affected employees and their families are not left without access to essential superannuation benefits, including pension rights, death benefits, and dependant allowances — even during transitional employment periods.

While some provisions may be outdated or repealed (e.g., the survivor benefit clause), the core structure — particularly around contribution returns, transfer options, and service recognition — remains a foundational element of superannuation policy in Canada’s public service reform context.

---

📌 **Recommendation for Review**:  
Given the reference to a **repealed section**, stakeholders should verify whether the current version of these regulations is still in force and whether the survivor and child benefits are still applicable under current PSSA law. This may require consultation with the Department of Finance or the Public Service Superannuation Office.
