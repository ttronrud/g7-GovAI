---

### 6. **Creditable Periods and Totalization of Benefits**
This is a **central mechanism** enabling individuals with cross-border work or residence to accumulate creditable periods from both countries.

#### ✅ Totalization Rules:
- **For Old Age Security (OAS)**:
  - A period of residence or contribution in Chile counts as a **period of residence in Canada** (and for spouse/dependants).
  - A period of residence in Canada counts **only if** the person made contributions under the CPP or provincial pension plan.
  - If a person has **insufficient creditable periods** under one country, totalization applies — **provided periods do not overlap**.

- **For Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**:
  - A calendar year with **at least 3 months (13 weeks)** of contributions under Chilean legislation counts as a **year of contributions in Canada**.

- **For Chilean Pensions (Old Age/Disability/Survivors)**:
  - A year of CPP contributions counts as **12 months (52 weeks)** of creditable periods in Chile.
  - A month or week of OAS contributions (not part of a CPP year) counts as a **month/week** of creditable periods in Chile.

> ⚠️ **Limitation**: If total creditable periods are **less than one year**, the competent institution **does not have to award benefits** under that country’s legislation.

---

### 7. **Calculation of Benefits (OAS, Spouse’s Allowance, Guaranteed Income Supplement)**
For individuals entitled to benefits **only through totalization**:

- **Earnings-related portion**:
  - Calculated **solely based on CPP pensionable earnings**.

- **Flat-rate portion**:
  - Calculated by multiplying:
    - The flat-rate amount under CPP
    - By the **fraction** of contributions relative to the **minimum qualifying period** under CPP.
  - This fraction **cannot exceed 1.0** (i.e., maximum flat-rate benefit is capped at full CPP flat-rate).

> Example: If someone has 10 years of CPP contributions (out of 15 required), the flat-rate portion is 10/15 = 2/3 of the full amount.

---

### 8. **Special Provisions for Chilean Individual Capitalization System**
Chile uses a **personal capitalization model** (individual pension accounts). Key rules:

- **Affiliated persons** (those in the New System of Pensions) must finance their pensions from their **individual capitalization accounts**.
- If the account balance is **insufficient to meet the minimum guaranteed pension**, the person may:
  - **Totalize creditable periods** under Chapter 1 to qualify for the **minimum old age or disability pension**.
- **Survivors** of pensioners also have this right.

> **Early retirement eligibility**: Chilean workers who have received a pension under Canadian legislation are considered **pensioners** under Chile’s INPS plans.

---

### 9. **Voluntary Contributions and Health Benefits**
- Chilean workers residing in Canada may:
  - Make **voluntary social insurance contributions** to the Chilean system as **self-employed persons**.
- These contributions are **subject to Canadian contribution laws** (i.e., must comply with Canadian tax and insurance obligations).
- Workers who opt in are **exempt from paying health insurance contributions** in Canada.

> This allows Chilean workers to maintain coverage and contribute to Chile’s pension system while living in Canada.

---

### 10. **Pensioner Status and Eligibility for Chilean Health Plans**
- Individuals receiving pensions under Canadian legislation who reside in Chile:
  - Are entitled to **enrol in Chile’s health benefit plans** under the **same conditions** as Chilean pensioners.

> This ensures access to healthcare without discrimination.

---

### 11. **Disability Determinations and Medical Examinations**
- Each country’s competent institution conducts **disability evaluations** under its own legislation.
- If one country requests a medical examination of a person residing in the other country:
  - The examination must be **arranged and conducted** by the institution in the **residing country**.
  - The **cost of the examination** is borne by the **requesting institution**.
- If Chile bears the cost:
  - It may **charge the individual 50% of the cost**.
  - This 50% is **deducted from the pension** or
