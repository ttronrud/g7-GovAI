**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Remission Order Concerning Certain Expenses Incurred as a Result of the Tsunami Disaster of December 26, 2004 in South and Southeast Asia**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**
This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, was enacted in response to the **devastating tsunami disaster that occurred on December 26, 2004** in South and Southeast Asia. The government recognized that the financial burden placed on Canadian citizens affected by the disaster—particularly in terms of travel, medical care, and administrative fees—was **unreasonable and unjust**. 

Given the humanitarian nature of the event and the significant personal loss suffered by many Canadians, the government determined that **remission (forgiveness) of certain related costs and fees** was in the **public interest**.

The regulation is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the government to remit certain debts when doing so is deemed to be in the public interest.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Remission**

#### **A. Remission of Specific Costs Incurred by Canadian Citizens**
The following types of expenses are fully remitted—meaning they are forgiven—**for Canadian citizens** who were affected by the tsunami:

1. **Repatriation Costs**  
   - Costs associated with the **repatriation of deceased Canadian citizens** to Canada or to another country.  
   - This includes the **cost of transporting the body or remains** of a deceased Canadian citizen.  
   - Also covers **transportation costs for accompanying baggage**.

2. **Transportation for Family Members**  
   - Transportation costs for **up to two individuals** designated by the estate or legal successor to accompany the remains or ashes of the deceased.  
   - These individuals must be legally recognized as part of the deceased’s estate or succession.

3. **Emergency Medical Care Costs**  
   - Fees for **emergency hospitalization or emergency medical treatment** received by Canadian citizens in the aftermath of the disaster.  
   - This includes medical expenses incurred during the immediate response phase due to the tsunami.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> The remission **does not apply** to costs that are:
> - Covered by **insurance** (e.g., travel or health insurance), or  
> - Reimbursed through **public health programs** or any other **source of indemnification**.

This ensures that individuals who had access to existing coverage or financial protection are not unfairly burdened.

#### **B. Remission of Passport Application Fees**
The regulation also provides remission of specific **passport-related fees** for Canadian victims of the tsunami who applied for a passport as a direct result of the disaster.

- **Fees remitted**:
  - The **fee under Section 4 of the Consular Services Fees Regulations** (related to consular services).
  - Fees listed in the **Schedule to the Passport Services Fees Regulations** (e.g., application, processing, issuance fees).

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> Remission **does not apply** to passport fees that are **reimbursable under the Repayment of Receipts Regulations, 1997** for **destitute persons** (those without means of support).  
> This maintains the integrity of existing financial accountability mechanisms for vulnerable individuals.

### **3. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To qualify for remission under this regulation, claimants must meet the following **mandatory condition**:

> The claimant must provide, **before December 26, 2006**, an **official document** to the **Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFIT)** that:
> - Proves **payment** of the fees or costs, or  
> - Proves **indebtedness** (i.e., the existence of an outstanding obligation).

This requirement ensures that the government can verify claims and prevent fraud or misuse of the remission policy.

### **4. Interest on Remitted Amounts**
Any **interest** that would have been payable on the original fees or costs is also **forgiven** as part of the remission. This means that even if interest had accrued over time, it is waived as a result of the government's decision.
