**Detailed Summary of the Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Banks, Bank Holding Companies, Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under two key provisions of Canadian financial legislation:

- **Section 978a of the Bank Act** – Authorizes the setting of fees related to security certificate transfers for banks and bank holding companies.
- **Section 1021c of the Insurance Companies Act** – Authorizes the setting of fees related to security certificate transfers for insurance companies and insurance holding companies.

This legislative authority enables the government to establish reasonable and standardized fees for the issuance of security certificates in connection with transfers, ensuring transparency and consistency in financial services.

### **2. Core Provision: Maximum Transfer Fee**

The central provision of these regulations establishes a **maximum fee of $5** that may be charged by:

- Banks  
- Bank holding companies  
- Insurance companies  
- Insurance holding companies  

**For a security certificate issued in respect of a transfer.**

This fee applies specifically to the **cost of issuing a security certificate** (a document that serves as proof of ownership of a financial instrument, such as a share or bond) when a transfer of that security occurs.

---

### **3. Purpose and Scope**

The purpose of this regulation is to:

- **Ensure fair and predictable pricing** for security certificate transfers.
- **Prevent excessive or arbitrary fees** that could burden financial consumers or create market inefficiencies.
- **Promote transparency** in the transfer process by setting a clear cap on allowable fees.
- **Align with consumer protection principles**, particularly under the broader framework of financial services regulation.

The regulation applies only to **security certificates** issued in connection with **transfers** — not to other services such as issuance, registration, or settlement of securities.

---

### **4. Applicable Provisions in the Parent Acts**

The fee cap is implemented to fulfill the requirements of:

- **Section 85(2) of the Bank Act** – Requires banks to charge reasonable fees for issuing security certificates in connection with transfers.
- **Section 89(2) of the Insurance Companies Act** – Requires insurance companies to charge reasonable fees for issuing security certificates in connection with transfers.

By setting a maximum of $5, the regulation ensures that fees remain within a reasonable and affordable range, consistent with consumer protection standards.

### **5. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 724 of the Bank Act** becomes effective. 

Section 724 of the Bank Act was enacted by **Section 183 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**. This provision was introduced to modernize and strengthen consumer protections in financial services, including fee transparency and accountability.

Thus, the effective date of these transfer fee regulations is **the date on which Section 724 of the Bank Act comes into force**, which was **October 24, 2001** — as noted in the official notice (SI/2001-102).

---

### **6. Repeal Notices**

The text includes two lines stating "[Repeal]" — these are likely **placeholder or typographical annotations** indicating that earlier versions of the regulation or related provisions have been repealed or superseded. However, in this case, the current regulation is **not being repealed**; rather, it is a standalone, active regulation that replaces or supersedes previous fee rules.

No actual repeal of the current regulation is indicated, and the "[Repeal]" lines may reflect outdated or redundant text from earlier versions of the statute or regulation.

---

### **7. Regulatory Context and Significance**

This regulation is part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to:

- Improve **financial consumer protection**.
- Increase **transparency** in financial transactions.
- Ensure **fairness and consistency** in fees charged by financial institutions.

By capping the transfer fee at $5, the government ensures that even in complex financial transactions, the cost of transferring ownership of a security is minimal and predictable — reducing barriers to entry and enhancing market efficiency.
