#### **2. Key Actions Taken**

##### **(a) Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 1996-324**
- The regulation **repeals** (officially cancels or removes) **Order in Council P.C. 1996-324**, dated March 12, 1996.
- This prior order established a previous administrative arrangement for the management of trade-mark matters, likely designating a different Minister or setting out procedural responsibilities under the Trade-marks Act.
- By repealing this order, the government is **eliminating outdated or obsolete administrative provisions** that no longer serve a current function.

> **Significance**: This action reflects a modernization effort to align current administrative responsibilities with present-day governance structures and to remove legacy arrangements that may have become redundant or inconsistent with current legislation.

- The regulation **designates the Minister of Industry** as the **designated Minister** responsible for the administration and implementation of **Sections 11.11 to 11.24** of the *Trade-marks Act*.
- These sections pertain to **procedural and administrative aspects of trade-mark enforcement, appeals, and related processes**, including:
  - Procedures for the filing and processing of applications (Section 11.11);
  - The role of the Trade-marks Office and its internal processes;
  - Appeals to the Commissioner of Trade-marks or to the Federal Court;
  - Procedures involving the use of the trade-mark registry and record-keeping;
  - Administrative powers and responsibilities related to trade-mark disputes and enforcement.

#### **3. Purpose and Rationale**
The primary objectives of this regulation are:
- To **clarify administrative responsibility** by assigning a specific Minister to oversee key operational and procedural aspects of the trade-mark system.
- To **ensure accountability and consistency** in the administration of trade-mark law by aligning ministerial oversight with the current structure of federal departments.
- To **modernize the trade-mark governance framework** by replacing outdated ministerial designations with a more current and relevant one.

By designating the **Minister of Industry**, the government recognizes that trade-mark policy and administration fall within the broader mandate of industrial and innovation policy, which is the domain of the Department of Industry, Science and Natural Resources (or its successor department).

#### **4. Legal and Practical Implications**
- **Administrative Accountability**: The Minister of Industry now has formal responsibility for the implementation and oversight of sections 11.11 to 11.24, including the operation of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), which administers the trade-mark system.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination**: This designation facilitates coordination between the trade-mark system and broader economic development, innovation, and small business policy initiatives.
- **Transparency and Public Confidence**: Clear designation of responsibility enhances transparency and helps stakeholders (such as businesses, applicants, and legal professionals) understand who is accountable for specific aspects of trade-mark administration.

#### **5. Effective Date and Publication**
- The regulation is published as a **Statutory Instrument (SI/96-24)**, which is a formal legal document issued under the authority of the federal government.
- It is effective upon **publication in the Canada Gazette**, the official journal of federal legislation.
- The repeal of P.C. 1996-324 is effective immediately upon publication, and the new designation takes effect from the same date.
