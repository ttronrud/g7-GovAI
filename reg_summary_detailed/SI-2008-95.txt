**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Respecting Ex Gratia Payments to Veterans and Science and Technology Workers Involved in Nuclear Weapons Testing or Nuclear Decontamination**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, establishes a framework for providing **ex gratia (voluntary, non-liability) payments** to certain **veterans and science and technology workers** who participated in **nuclear weapons testing** or **nuclear decontamination activities** during specific historical periods. The payments are intended to recognize the service and exposure of these individuals without implying any legal liability on the part of the Government of Canada.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of National Defence**. This individual has the authority to administer and approve the ex gratia payments under the Order.

2. **Science and Technology Worker**  
   A **civilian employee of the Government of Canada** who was attached to elements of the **naval, army, or air forces** of Canada to provide **scientific or technical support** to those military forces.

3. **Veteran**  
   A **former member** of:
   - The naval, army, or air forces of Canada; or  
   - The Canadian Forces.

> These definitions clarify who qualifies for the payment—both military personnel and civilian technical staff who served in connection with Canada’s defence or scientific operations.

### **Eligibility Criteria**

The following individuals are eligible for a one-time ex gratia payment of **$24,000**:

#### **1. Veterans or Science and Technology Workers Who Participated in Nuclear Weapons Testing**
- Must have participated in **allied forces nuclear weapons testing** in:
  - The **United States**,  
  - **Australia**, or  
  - The **South Pacific**.
- Testing must have occurred during the period:
  - **January 1, 1946, to December 31, 1963**.

#### **2. Veterans or Science and Technology Workers Who Assisted in Nuclear Decontamination at Chalk River**
- Must have assisted in the **decontamination of the nuclear reactor at Chalk River, Ontario**.
- Decontamination work must have occurred during **one of the following periods**:
  - **January 1, 1952 – December 31, 1953**, or  
  - **January 1, 1958 – December 31, 1958**.

> Both types of service (testing or decontamination) qualify for the payment, provided the individual meets the time and location criteria.

---

### **Conditions for Payment**

- The individual must be **alive on the day the payment is made** (for living applicants).
- For **deceased individuals**, the payment is made to specific beneficiaries depending on the circumstances of death.

---

### **Beneficiaries of Payments Upon Death**

The payment is distributed as follows based on the deceased person’s estate status:

| Death Status | Beneficiary |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Testate (deceased with a will)** and estate not yet distributed | To the **executor of the estate** or **liquidator of the succession** |
| **Testate** and estate fully distributed | To the **natural person(s) entitled to the residue of the estate**; if multiple, on a **pro rata basis** |
| **Intestate (deceased without a will)** | To the **adult(s) who were living with the deceased at the time of death** and who were **primarily responsible for providing unpaid care**; if multiple, on a **pro rata basis** |

> This ensures that the payment reaches those who were most directly affected by the individual’s death and care needs.

---

### **Application Process**

- Applications must be submitted **on or before December 31, 2009**.
- The application must:
  - Be in the **form approved by the Minister**.
  - Be **supported by evidence** that the Minister considers necessary (e.g., service records, medical reports, affidavits).
- **Late applications** may be accepted **only if** the applicant can demonstrate that they were **unable to submit the application earlier due to facts or circumstances beyond their control** (e.g., illness, lack of documentation, death before submission).

> The deadline of December 31, 2009, was set to ensure timely processing and administrative feasibility.

---

### **Payment Terms**

- The payment is a **one-time lump sum** of **$24,000**.
- No payment will be made **after December 31, 2010**, unless:
  - The applicant can show that **circumstances beyond their control** (e.g., illness, death of a beneficiary, discovery of new evidence) necessitate a delay.

> This establishes a clear time limit for processing, with a narrow exception for exceptional circumstances.

---

### **Legal and Ethical Clarifications**

- **No Admission of Liability**:  
  The payment **does not constitute an admission** that the Government of Canada is liable for any harm or injury suffered by the veteran or science and technology worker.  
  → This is a key legal distinction: the payment is **compassionate and symbolic**, not a settlement of a claim.

- **Purpose**:  
  The Order aims to:
  - Acknowledge the **service and exposure** of individuals involved in high-risk nuclear activities.
  - Provide **financial recognition** to those who faced potential health risks due to radiation exposure.
  - Offer **support to families** in cases of death, especially when care was provided without compensation.

### **Key Dates and Deadlines**

| Date | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| **January 1, 1946 – December 31, 1963** | Period of allied nuclear weapons testing eligibility |
| **January 1, 1952 – December 31, 1953** and **January 1, 1958 – December 31, 1958** | Periods of Chalk River reactor decontamination eligibility |
| **December 31, 2009** | Final deadline for submission of applications |
| **December 31, 2010** | Final deadline for making payments (unless exceptional circumstances apply) |

---

### **Significance and Context**

This regulation is part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to **recognize and address the health and safety concerns** of individuals exposed to radiation during Cold War-era nuclear activities. It reflects a **historical acknowledgment** of the risks faced by military personnel and civilian scientists involved in nuclear programs, particularly in the U.S., Australia, and Canada.

While the payment amount ($24,000) is modest, it represents a formal, government-backed gesture of **recognition and support**, especially given the lack of formal compensation or medical benefits at the time.

---

### **Limitations and Criticisms (Implied)**

- The **strict eligibility criteria** may exclude individuals who were exposed but not formally involved in testing or decontamination.
- The **deadlines (2009–2010)** may have excluded many applicants who only discovered their eligibility later.
- The **ex gratia nature** means the payment is not tied to medical claims or proven harm, which may limit its perceived value to those suffering from radiation-related illnesses.
- The **lack of liability admission** may be seen as insufficient in addressing long-term health impacts.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **structured, time-bound, and compassionate mechanism** for compensating veterans and science and technology workers who participated in nuclear weapons testing or decontamination activities during the mid-20th century. It balances administrative feasibility with historical recognition, while clearly delineating the scope, eligibility, and legal implications of the payments. Though limited in scope and financial value, it serves as an important step in acknowledging the risks faced by Canadian service members and civilian scientists during a critical period in national and global history.

**Final Note**: This Order is not a legal settlement or compensation for injury or illness, but rather a **one-time, non-admission-of-liability ex gratia payment** to honor service and provide financial support under defined conditions.
