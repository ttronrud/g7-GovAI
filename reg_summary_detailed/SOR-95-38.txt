### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 7 – Turkeys and Turkey Products for Personal Use**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is a **cancellation and replacement** of a previous import permit for turkeys and turkey products. It is grounded in Canadian federal legislation and international trade obligations:

- **Import Control List**: Turkeys and turkey products have been included on Canada’s Import Control List, indicating their subject to specific import controls due to trade, public health, or safety concerns.
  
- **Section 6.2(1) of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**: The Secretary of State for External Affairs (now the Minister of Foreign Affairs or relevant trade authority) determined an **import access quantity** for turkeys and turkey products. This establishes a legal cap on how much can be imported under certain conditions.

- **Section 10 of the EIPA**: Provides the legal authority to **cancel existing import permits** and issue new ones.

- **Subsection 8.3(3) of the EIPA**: Authorizes the issuance of a **general permit** (a broad, simplified authorization) for specific goods under defined conditions.

- **World Trade Organization (WTO) Implementation Act (S.C. 1994, c. 47)**:
  - Sections **106, 109, and 111** of the WTO Implementation Act came into force on or after December 29, 1994 — the effective date of this permit.
  - These sections relate to the **elimination of trade barriers**, including the removal of import restrictions that are inconsistent with WTO rules.
  - The permit is effective on the **later of** the dates when these sections came into force — ensuring alignment with international trade obligations.

> **Note**: This permit was originally issued on **February 4, 1981 (SOR/81-122)**, and was **repealed in 1997 (SOR/97-43, s. 2)**, meaning it is now a historical document. However, the current regulation appears to be a **renewal or reissue** of the same general permit under updated legal frameworks.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose is to:

- **Allow Canadian residents to import turkeys and turkey products for personal use**, without requiring individual import permits.
- **Modernize and simplify** the import process by replacing a legacy, restrictive permit with a general, accessible one.
- **Comply with WTO obligations**, which require the reduction or elimination of unnecessary import controls on food items.

---

#### **3. Scope of the Permit**

##### **Who Can Import?**
- **Any resident of Canada** may import under this permit.

##### **For Whom?**
- For the **personal use of the importer** and the **importer’s household** (i.e., not for resale, commercial use, or distribution).

##### **Quantities Allowed Per Importation:**
- **One turkey** (whole bird), or  
- **Up to 10 kg of turkey products** (net weight) per importation.

> This means a person can bring in one live turkey or up to 10 kg of processed turkey items (e.g., meat, sausages, prepared meals) at a time — but not more than that.

#### **4. Definition of "Turkey Products"**

The regulation defines "turkey products" to include specific goods classified under the **Customs Tariff**. These are categorized by tariff items and headings:

| Tariff Item / Heading | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Item 1** | Whole turkeys (dindons et dindes) |
| **Item 2** | Fresh, chilled, or frozen meat and edible offal (livers, etc.), not cut into pieces; classified under: <br> - 0207.24.11, 0207.24.91, 0207.25.11, 0207.25.91 |
| **Item 3** | Cuts of meat and edible offal (e.g., breast, legs, livers); classified under: <br> - 0207.26.10, 0207.27.11, 0207.27.91 |
| **Item 4** | Turkey fat (unrendered), fresh, chilled, frozen, salted, brined, dried, or smoked; classified under: <br> - 0209.90.30 |
| **Item 5** | Salted, brined, dried, or smoked turkey meat; classified under: <br> - 0210.99.14 |
| **Item 6** | Sausages and similar products (not canned or in glass jars); made from turkey meat, offal, or blood; classified under: <br> - 1601.00.31 |
| **Item 7** | Prepared or preserved liver paste (not in cans or glass jars); classified under: <br> - 1602.20.31 |
| **Item 8** | Prepared meals made from turkey (not specially defined mixtures); classified under: <br> - 1602.31.12 |
| **Item 9** | Prepared or preserved meat/offal (excluding meals and special mixtures); not in cans or glass jars; classified under: <br> - 1602.31.93 |
| **Item 10** | Goods classified under headings 98.04 or 98.26 that fall under any of the above tariff items |

> **Note**: Items 2–10 are the "turkey products" defined in the schedule. Item 1 (whole turkeys) is a separate category.

> **Important**: The permit does **not** cover:
- Live turkeys weighing **more than 185 grams** (i.e., small birds like chicks or fryers are exempt).
- Products in **cans or glass jars** (e.g., canned turkey or liver paste).
- Products that are **not classified** under the specified tariff items.

#### **5. Reporting Requirements**

Any goods imported under this permit must be reported to **Customs** using the prescribed form. The form must include one of the following statements:

> **"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 7 — Turkeys and Turkey Products for Personal Use"**  
> or  
> **"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 7 — Dindons et dindes et produits de dindons et dindes pour usage personnel"**

This ensures traceability and compliance with customs and trade regulations.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**

The permit becomes effective on the **later of** the following dates:

- The date when **Sections 106, 109, and 111** of the WTO Implementation Act (S.C. 1994, c. 47) came into force.
- The date of issuance: **December 29, 1994**.

Since these sections were enacted in 1994, the permit became effective on **December 29, 1994**.

---

#### **7. Legal Status and Repeal**

- This permit **replaces** the original permit issued on **February 4, 1981** (SOR/81-122).
- It was **repealed in 1997** (SOR/97-43, s. 2), which suggests that it is no longer in force as a standalone regulation.
- However, the **content and intent** of this permit may have been **incorporated into a current regulatory framework** or replaced by updated provisions under modern food import rules or the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) guidelines.

> **Conclusion**: While the regulation itself is **repealed**, its **principles** — allowing personal importation of turkeys and turkey products up to 10 kg or one whole bird — may still be reflected in current food import policies or under the authority of the CFIA or Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

#### **8. Key Implications and Considerations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Personal Use Only** | Cannot be used for resale, commercial purposes, or bulk distribution. |
| **No Need for Individual Permits** | Simplifies importation for consumers. |
| **WTO Compliance** | Aligns with international trade rules, reducing barriers to trade. |
| **Quantity Limits** | Prevents abuse or over-importation. |
| **Tariff-Based Classification** | Ensures only specific, clearly defined products are covered. |
