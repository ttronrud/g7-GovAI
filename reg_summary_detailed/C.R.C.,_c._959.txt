**Detailed Summary of the Indian Reserve Traffic Regulations**

---

**1. Regulation Title and Citation**  
These regulations are officially titled the *Indian Reserve Traffic Regulations* and may be cited as such. They serve as a set of specific traffic rules designed to govern the operation and use of vehicles on roads located within Indian reserves in Canada.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The regulations define two core terms:  

- **"Road"**: This includes any roadway, driveway, street, lane, or other public area open to the general public for the passage of vehicles. The term is broad and encompasses both formal and informal pathways used by the public.  
- **"Vehicle"**: This refers to any conveyance that is driven, propelled, or drawn by power, including but not limited to:  
  - Wagon, cart  
  - Motor car, motor truck, trailer  
  - Motorcycle  
  - Traction engine, tractor  
  - Road-making machinery  
  - Other similar conveyances  

This definition ensures that all forms of motorized or pulled transportation are covered under the scope of these regulations.

**3. Scope of Application**  
These regulations apply **to all roads located within Indian reserves**. Indian reserves are lands set aside under federal law for the use and benefit of recognized Indigenous communities. The regulations are specifically tailored to ensure safe and orderly traffic management in these often rural or remote areas.

---

**4. Enforcement by Authorized Personnel**  
- Any driver must **immediately come to a full stop** when ordered to do so by a person **authorized by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** to enforce these regulations.  
- Such authorized personnel may also issue directions regarding:  
  - The **routing of traffic**  
  - The **control of vehicle movement**  
  - **Parking of vehicles**  

This provision empowers designated officials to manage traffic flow and ensure public safety on reserve roads.

---

**5. Compliance with Traffic Devices and Signs**  
Drivers are required to **comply with all traffic control devices and signs** installed on roads for the purpose of controlling or routing traffic. This includes:  
- Traffic lights  
- Signs indicating speed limits, stop points, or no-entry zones  
- Barriers, cones, or other physical controls  

Failure to follow such devices constitutes a violation of the regulations.

---

**6. Prohibition of Use on Prohibited Roads**  
No vehicle may be driven over any road where the **use for public traffic is explicitly prohibited** by a sign or other device. This ensures that sensitive or restricted areas (e.g., private land, construction zones, or environmentally protected areas) remain off-limits to public vehicles.

---

**7. Safe Driving Practices**  
Drivers must:  
- **Avoid excessive or dangerous speeds** that are inappropriate given prevailing conditions (e.g., weather, visibility, road surface, traffic volume).  
- **Maintain full control of the vehicle** when approaching intersections, crossing points for pedestrians, or other traffic situations.  
- Take reasonable precautions to **prevent collisions or damage** to persons, property, or vehicles.  

This emphasizes safety and responsible driving behavior, especially in areas where infrastructure may be limited or conditions variable.

---

**8. Compliance with Provincial Motor Vehicle Laws**  
Drivers must comply with **all applicable provincial motor vehicle laws and regulations** that are in force in the province where the Indian reserve is located.  
**Exception**: These provincial laws are **not applicable if they conflict** with the provisions of these Indian Reserve Traffic Regulations. This means that in cases of inconsistency, the Indian Reserve Traffic Regulations take precedence.

This ensures that reserve-specific safety standards are maintained without undermining provincial laws where no conflict exists.

---

**9. Parking Restrictions**  
- **No vehicle may be parked or stationed on any road without explicit permission**.  
- Such permission must be clearly indicated by **signs erected over or marked directly on the roadway**.  
- Unauthorized parking is prohibited, promoting orderly use of public road space and reducing congestion or obstruction risks.

---

**10. Vehicle Safety Standards**  
- **No vehicle in a dangerous or unsafe condition** may be operated on any road.  
- This includes vehicles with mechanical failure, visible damage, or other defects that could compromise safety.  
- This provision ensures that only roadworthy vehicles operate on reserve roads, reducing the risk of accidents.

---

**11. Penalties for Violations**  
Any person who violates any provision of these regulations is guilty of an offence and may face:  
- A **fine of not less than $1 and not more than $50**, or  
- **Imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months**, or  
- Both (a fine and imprisonment)  

The penalties are structured as **summary convictions**, meaning they can be dealt with through a quick, less formal court process, which is appropriate for minor traffic offences in remote or underserved areas.

---

**Overall Purpose and Significance**  
The *Indian Reserve Traffic Regulations* are designed to:  
- Promote **road safety** in Indian reserves, which often lack comprehensive traffic infrastructure.  
- Provide a **clear, enforceable framework** for vehicle operation in areas where provincial traffic laws may not fully apply.  
- Respect Indigenous governance and land use by allowing local authorities to manage traffic through designated enforcement.  
- Balance the need for public access with the necessity of preventing hazards due to poor road conditions, limited visibility, or high-risk environments.

**Conclusion**  
These regulations represent a critical piece of administrative and public safety policy tailored to the unique context of Indian reserves. By establishing clear rules for vehicle operation, enforcement, and safety, they help protect residents, visitors, and the environment while respecting both provincial law and Indigenous land governance. The provisions are practical, enforceable, and focused on preventing accidents and ensuring orderly traffic flow in often remote and under-resourced communities.
