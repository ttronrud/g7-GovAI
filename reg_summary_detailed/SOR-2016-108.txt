**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Regulations Establishing a List of Spill-Treating Agents  
Under the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (COGOA)  

**Legal Authority:**  
The Minister of the Environment has established these regulations pursuant to **section 14.2a** of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (S.C. 2015, c. 4, s. 15; R.S., c. O-7; S.C. 1992, c. 35, s. 2). This provision empowers the Minister to create and maintain a list of approved spill-treating agents for use in the context of oil and gas operations in Canada.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to formally define and establish a list of spill-treating agents that are recognized under the legal definition of “spill-treating agent” found in **section 2 of the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act**. By specifying which agents are included in this list, the regulation ensures regulatory clarity, promotes consistency in spill response practices, and supports compliance with environmental protection standards.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Establishment of the List:**  
   The schedule attached to the regulation contains the names of specific spill-treating agents that are officially recognized and approved for use in the context of oil and gas operations. These agents are considered acceptable under the Act for use in responding to oil or gas spills.

2. **Approved Agents Listed:**  
   The only spill-treating agents included in this list are:  
   - **Corexit® EC9500A**  
   - **Corexit® EC9580A**  

   These are two specific formulations of dispersants developed by Shell (under the Corexit brand) and widely used in the oil and gas industry for the dispersion of oil spills in marine or surface environments.

3. **Scope and Application:**  
   The list applies exclusively to the definition of “spill-treating agent” as defined in section 2 of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*. This means that only agents listed in the schedule may be legally used in spill response activities involving oil or gas operations in Canada, unless otherwise authorized by regulation or exception.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. The registration date is **May 19, 2016**, as noted in the official publication. Therefore, the regulations became effective on that date.

5. **Regulatory Context:**  
   This regulation is part of a broader framework designed to ensure that spill response activities are conducted in a manner that minimizes environmental harm. By limiting the use of spill-treating agents to only those specifically approved, the government seeks to:  
   - Ensure product safety and environmental performance;  
   - Promote transparency and accountability in spill response;  
   - Support data-driven decision-making and monitoring of dispersant use;  
   - Enable better oversight and reporting by operators.

6. **Implications for Industry and Operators:**  
   Oil and gas operators, spill response teams, and third-party contractors must:  
   - Only use the listed agents (Corexit® EC9500A and EC9580A) when responding to spills;  
   - Maintain documentation of the use of these agents;  
   - Comply with reporting requirements under the COGOA and related environmental regulations;  
   - Be aware that use of any other dispersant not on this list would be considered non-compliant and may result in enforcement actions.

**Important Notes:**  
- The inclusion of Corexit® EC9500A and EC9580A reflects the historical use of these dispersants in Canada, particularly in marine spill response scenarios.  
- While these agents are approved under this regulation, their environmental impacts—such as effects on marine life and ecosystems—remain a subject of ongoing scientific review and public debate.  
- The regulation does not mandate the use of these agents, nor does it prohibit the use of other dispersants in emergency situations. However, such use would require prior approval or fall outside the scope of the Act unless authorized under other regulatory provisions.

**Conclusion:**  
These regulations provide a clear, legally binding list of approved spill-treating agents under the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*. By designating only Corexit® EC9500A and Corexit® EC9580A as spill-treating agents, the regulation enhances regulatory certainty, supports environmental protection, and ensures that spill response operations are conducted in a consistent and accountable manner. The regulations were issued by the Minister of the Environment on May 19, 2016, and became effective upon registration.
