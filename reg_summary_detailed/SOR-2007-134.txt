**Detailed Summary of the Public Opinion Research Contract Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The *Public Opinion Research Contract Regulations* are issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, pursuant to **subsection 42(3)a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision enables the government to establish regulations governing the conduct of contracts for public opinion research, ensuring transparency, accountability, and accessibility of research findings.

These regulations were enacted as **Section 312 of S.C. 2006, c. 9** and came into force upon registration.

---

### **Core Objective:**

To establish clear, standardized requirements for the **content, format, and dissemination** of public opinion research reports contracted by the Government of Canada, with a focus on **transparency, reproducibility, and public access**, while respecting the confidentiality of research used exclusively for government purposes.

---

### **Mandatory Report Delivery Requirements:**

All individuals or entities entering into a contract with Her Majesty (i.e., the Government of Canada) for public opinion research **must deliver a final report** in either **electronic or print format**, as specified in **subsection 40(2) of the Financial Administration Act**.

---

### **Reporting Requirements by Use of Research:**

#### **1. Public Opinion Research Not for Exclusive Use of Her Majesty:**

Such research must include:
- A **brief description of the methodology** used (e.g., survey design, sampling strategy, data collection methods).
- The **results of the research** (e.g., key findings, trends, statistics).

> *Purpose:* Ensures that research conducted for broader public or non-governmental use is transparent and methodologically sound, allowing stakeholders to assess credibility and relevance.

---

#### **2. Public Opinion Research for Exclusive Use of Her Majesty:**

In addition to the general report requirements, the report must include the following **specific elements**:

##### **Covering Page (Mandatory):**
- Title of the project  
- Name of the person or organization that entered into the contract  
- Contract number  
- Award date  

> *Purpose:* Provides clear, traceable documentation of the contract and project for administrative and archival purposes.

##### **Narrative Executive Summary (Minimum Components):**
- A statement of the **research purpose and objectives**  
- A **summary of key findings** (with an exception: if the contractor is *not* responsible for the design, development, or analysis of the research)  
- A **brief description of the methodology used**  
- A **statement on the extent to which findings can be extrapolated to a broader audience**  

> *Note on Exception:* If the contractor did not design, develop, or analyze the research, the key findings may not be included in the executive summary to avoid misrepresentation of responsibility.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that even internally used research provides a concise, accurate, and contextually relevant overview of the work for decision-makers.

---

##### **Appendices (Required for Both Quantitative and Qualitative Research):**

**For Quantitative Research:**
The appendices must contain:
- A **full set of tabulated data**  
- **Sample size**  
- **Sampling procedures and dates of fieldwork**  
- **Weighting procedures** (if applicable)  
- **Confidence interval and margin of error** (if applicable)  
- **Response rate and method of calculation** (if applicable)  
- **Research instruments used** (e.g., questionnaire, survey form)  
- **All other information necessary to replicate the research**  

> *Purpose:* Promotes scientific rigor, reproducibility, and transparency in statistical research. Enables independent verification and future use of the data.

**For Qualitative Research:**
The appendices must contain:
- **Research instruments used** (e.g., interview guides, focus group protocols)  
- **Test material** (if applicable, e.g., pilot versions of questions or scripts)  
- **All other information about recruitment or execution of fieldwork** necessary to replicate the initiative  

> *Purpose:* Ensures that qualitative studies—often more interpretive—are still transparent and methodologically defensible, allowing for replication and peer review.

---

### **Contractual Obligations (Mandatory in Contract Terms):**

If the research is for **exclusive use by Her Majesty**, the contract must include the following **two specific provisions**:

1. **Notification Requirement:**  
   The contract must **notify the contractor** that the final report will be sent to the **Librarian and Archivist of Canada (LAC)** in accordance with **Section 15.1 of the Library and Archives of Canada Act**.

2. **Consent Requirement:**  
   The contractor must **consent** to the **publication of the narrative executive summary** (as defined in paragraph 3(b)) on the **Library and Archives of Canada website**, in **both official languages (English and French)**.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that publicly accessible, non-sensitive summaries of government research are preserved in the national archives and made available to the public, promoting transparency and democratic accountability.

---

### **Enforcement and Effectiveness:**

- These regulations apply to **all public opinion research contracts** entered into by the Government of Canada.
- The **report must be delivered in a specified format** (electronic or print), and the **content requirements are mandatory**.
- The **contractual terms must explicitly include** the notification and consent provisions for exclusive-use research.
- The regulations come into force on the **day of registration** (i.e., upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*).

### **Key Principles Underlying the Regulations:**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | All research must clearly disclose its methodology and findings to ensure public trust. |
| **Accountability** | Contractors are responsible for the integrity and completeness of their research outputs. |
| **Accessibility** | Public summaries and methodological details are made available to the public via LAC. |
| **Reproducibility** | Detailed appendices allow other researchers or analysts to replicate the study. |
| **Balance of Confidentiality and Openness** | While exclusive-use research is protected, key summaries remain accessible to the public. |

---

### **Significance and Impact:**

These regulations represent a significant step toward **enhancing the transparency and credibility** of government research. By mandating detailed reporting and public dissemination of executive summaries, they:

- Strengthen **public confidence** in government decision-making.
- Support **evidence-based policy development**.
- Contribute to the **national research record**, preserving methodological integrity in government-sponsored studies.
- Align with broader Canadian principles of **open government and democratic accountability**.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The *Public Opinion Research Contract Regulations* provide a comprehensive, enforceable framework for how public opinion research must be conducted, reported, and shared. They balance the need for **government discretion** in sensitive or internal research with the **public’s right to know** about how government decisions are informed by public sentiment. By requiring detailed methodology, reproducible data, and public access to summaries, the regulations promote **scientific rigor, transparency, and democratic engagement** in Canadian governance.
