#### **4. Scope of Remission**

##### **A. Income Tax Remission (Section 6)**
- Applies to **Indians**.
- **Tax period**: All taxation years **after 1992**.
- **Remission amount**: The difference between:
  - The actual income taxes, interest, and penalties paid by the Indian during the year;
  - The taxes, interest, and penalties that **would have been payable** if the Indian settlements had been treated as **reserves** throughout the year.

> In essence, the government forgives the tax overpayment that results from the fact that these areas are not legally recognized as reserves, which would have triggered different tax treatment.

##### **B. Goods and Services Tax (GST) Remission (Section 7)**
- Applies to:
  - **Individual Indians** who receive a taxable supply (i.e., purchase goods or services subject to GST).
  - **Bands or designated corporations** who receive a taxable supply.
- **Tax period**: 
  - For individuals: **On or after the date the Order comes into force**.
  - For bands/corporations: **On or after January 1, 1991**.
- **Remission amount**: The difference between:
  - The actual GST paid or payable;
  - The GST that would have been payable **if the Indian settlements had been treated as reserves**.

> This provides relief to individuals and organizations that pay GST on goods and services used in or related to Indian settlements, where such settlements are not legally classified as reserves.

---

#### **5. Conditions for Remission**

- **Application Requirement**: 
  - A written application must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
  - The application must be filed **within four years** of the date the tax was paid or became due.

> This creates a strict time limit to claim remission — failure to apply within four years results in the loss of the right to remission.

#### **7. Rationale and Public Interest**
The Order reflects a policy of **recognition and equity** in the tax treatment of Indigenous communities. By treating Indian settlements as if they were reserves for tax purposes, the government acknowledges:
- The **historical and cultural significance** of these communities;
- The **economic and administrative burdens** imposed by the lack of reserve status;
- The **public interest** in reducing financial hardship for Indigenous peoples who are not entitled to the full benefits of reserve status.

This remission helps to:
- Reduce financial strain on Indigenous individuals and bands;
- Support community development and self-reliance;
- Promote reconciliation and equitable treatment under federal tax policy.

#### **8. Limitations and Exclusions**
- **Excluded from remission**:
  - Any land that is a **reserve** under the *Indian Act*;
  - Any **Category IA land** under the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*.
- **Excludes mines, minerals, and river beds** (e.g., in Cadotte Lake Settlement).
- Remission only applies to **taxes paid or payable** after the Order comes into force (for GST) or after 1992 (for income tax).

---

#### **9. Legal and Administrative Implications**
- The Order operates as a **temporary, discretionary relief measure** under federal tax law.
- It is **not a permanent change** to the *Indian Act* or tax statutes but rather a targeted policy intervention.
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for administering the application process and determining eligibility.

---

The **Indians and Bands on certain Indian Settlements Remission Order** is a significant piece of policy that:
- Provides **tax relief** to Indigenous individuals and communities;
- Recognizes the **non-reserve status** of specific settlements;
- Aims to promote **equity, fairness, and public interest** in Indigenous affairs;
- Is implemented through a **clear, structured, and time-bound process**.
