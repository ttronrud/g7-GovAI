### **Detailed Summary of the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Automotive Refinishing Products Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are issued under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, specifically pursuant to **subsection 332(1)a**, which allows the Minister of the Environment to regulate substances that contribute to air pollution and pose risks to human health and the environment.

- The proposed regulations were **published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on April 26, 2008**, giving stakeholders (including industry, environmental groups, and the public) a **formal opportunity to comment or file a notice of objection**.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was consulted under **section 6c** of CEPA 1999 to provide expert advice.
- The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendations of the **Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health**, concluded that:
  - The proposed regulations **do not conflict** with other federal laws.
  - They provide **adequate environmental and human health protection**.
- Therefore, the regulations are **officially enacted**.

#### **2. Definitions**

Key definitions clarify the scope and application of the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Automotive Refinishing** | Any activity involving servicing, maintenance, repair, restoration, or modification of motor vehicles or mobile equipment (or their parts), including the application of coatings or surface cleaners. |
| **Coating** | A product that forms a protective film when applied to a surface. Excludes: metal plating, lacquer topcoats, and oil-based enamel paints used for vehicle restoration made **on or before 1985**. |
| **Surface Cleaner** | A product used to clean surfaces before coating application. Excludes cleaners for equipment or handheld spot cleaners used prior to sanding. |
| **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** | Organic compounds that evaporate easily and participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions (e.g., smog formation). **Excluded compounds** include those listed in **Schedule 1, item 65**, and **acetic acid, 1,1-dimethylethyl ester (C₆H₁₂O₂)**. |
| **Mobile Equipment** | Non-motorized equipment capable of being pulled on highways (e.g., trailers, construction machinery). |
| **Motor Vehicle** | Self-propelled vehicles, excluding aircraft, rolling stock, and boats/ships designed for water navigation. |

#### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **any automotive refinishing product containing VOCs listed in Column 1 of the Schedule**, if:

- The product is **intended for use in automotive refinishing**, or  
- The **container or product documentation** indicates it may be used for such purposes.

**Exemptions** (Regulations do *not* apply):

1. **Products for export only** – manufactured, imported, or sold exclusively for export.
2. **Use in non-refinishing settings** – used in factories or shops for purposes unrelated to automotive refinishing (e.g., industrial coating).
3. **Non-refillable aerosol containers** – imported, sold, or packaged in non-refillable spray cans.
4. **Small containers** – containers with capacity **≤14.8 mL (0.5 fl oz)**.
5. **Use during vehicle manufacturing** – applied during the original construction of vehicles or mobile equipment.
6. **Laboratory use** – used as solvents in analysis, for scientific research, or as analytical standards.
7. **Military applications** – used in chemical agent-resistant coatings during military operations.
8. **Small containers for mobile restoration** – containers ≤118.3 mL (4.0 fl oz) used in mobile restoration services.

> *Note:* "Military operation" includes national security, humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, or NATO defense activities.

#### **4. Prohibited VOC Concentrations and Compliance Requirements**

**No person may manufacture or import** a product listed in the schedule with VOC concentration **exceeding the limit in Column 2 of the schedule**, unless:

- The product must be **diluted** to meet or fall below the limit, and  
  - The **dilution instructions** are clearly specified on the **label or documentation in both official languages (English and French)**, OR  
  - The manufacturer/importer holds a **valid permit under section 5**.

**No person may sell or offer for sale** such a product unless:

- It is diluted to meet the VOC limit with proper instructions, OR  
- It was **manufactured/imported under a permit** and the sale occurs **within one year of the permit’s expiry**.

> **Important Clarification**:  
> If multiple components must be combined before use, the **final VOC concentration after mixing must not exceed** the limit set in Column 2 of the schedule.

> If a coating is labeled as suitable for use in **a different coating category**, the **lowest VOC limit applies**.

---

#### **5. Permit System for High-VOC Products**

Any manufacturer or importer of a product that:
- Falls outside the exemptions, and  
- Has VOC concentration exceeding the allowed limit,

**must hold a permit issued under section 5** of CEPA 1999.

##### **Application Requirements**

An application must include:

1. **Applicant Information**:
   - Name, address, phone, fax, email
   - Name and contact details of authorized representative (if applicable)

2. **Product Information**:
   - Trade name (if any)
   - VOC concentration
   - Estimated annual volume (in units)
   - Product category (as per schedule) and rationale for classification

3. **Feasibility Statement**:
   - Evidence that it is **not technically or economically feasible** to reduce VOC levels to meet the limit at the time of application.

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Detailed plan outlining measures to reduce VOC levels to within the limit
   - Timeline for full implementation (must be completed within **4 years** of the first permit issuance)

5. **Record-Keeping Location**:
   - Address where records, supporting documents, and certification are stored

6. **Certification**:
   - A signed, dated statement confirming accuracy and completeness of all information
   - Can be submitted electronically (if compatible with Minister’s system)

##### **Minister’s Authority**

- The Minister **must issue the permit** if:
  - The applicant proves technical/economic infeasibility,
  - A clear implementation plan exists, and
  - The plan is to be completed within **4 years**.

- The Minister **must refuse** the permit if:
  - False/misleading information is provided, or
  - Required information is missing or insufficient.

##### **Permit Duration and Renewal**

- Initial permit: **24 months** from issuance
- Can be **renewed once** for an additional 24 months (total 48 months)
- Renewal must be applied for **within 30 days before expiry**

##### **Revocation of Permits**

- A permit may be revoked if:
  - The implementation plan will not be completed on time, or
  - False/misleading information was provided

> **Before revocation**, the Minister must:
> - Provide **written reasons** for revocation, and  
> - Give the permit holder a **written opportunity to respond**.

#### **6. Determining VOC Concentration**

The regulations specify **formulas** to calculate VOC concentration:

##### **For Coatings**:
\[
\text{VOC concentration (g/L)} = \frac{(W_{\text{volatiles}} - W_{\text{excluded}})}{(V_{\text{coating}} + V_{\text{water}} + V_{\text{excluded}})}
\]
Where:
- \(W_{\text{volatiles}}\) = weight of volatile compounds (g)
- \(W_{\text{excluded}}\) = weight of excluded compounds (g)
- \(V_{\text{coating}}\) = volume of coating (L)
- \(V_{\text{water}}\) = volume of water (L)
- \(V_{\text{excluded}}\) = volume of excluded compounds (L)

##### **For Surface Cleaners**:
\[
\text{VOC concentration (g/L)} = \frac{(W_{\text{volatiles}} - W_{\text{excluded}})}{V_{\text{surface cleaner}}}
\]

> These formulas apply **after dilution**, if required, as per manufacturer instructions.

#### **7. Laboratory Accreditation Requirements**

Any laboratory analyzing products under these regulations must be:
- **Accredited under ISO/IEC 17025:2005**, and  
- Must include the specific test method (VOC analysis) within its **scope of accreditation**.

---

#### **8. Product Labeling and Date of Manufacture**

- All products must have a **clear date of manufacture** or a **code representing that date** on the container.
- If a code is used, the manufacturer/importer must provide an **explanation upon request** by the Minister.

> If the manufacturer fails to provide this information, the **seller must add it** and provide an explanation.

---

#### **9. Dilution and Combination Instructions**

- If dilution is required:
  - Instructions must be clearly stated in **both official languages**.
  - Dilution must **not result in VOC concentration exceeding the
