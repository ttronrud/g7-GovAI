### **Overview**

This regulatory document formally designates specific judges of the **Court of Queen’s Bench for Manitoba** to act as **election judges** under the *Canada Elections Act*. The designation grants these individuals the authority to perform all the functions and powers typically conferred upon a judge by the Act — specifically in the context of overseeing and adjudicating matters related to federal elections.

### **Key Components of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Legal Authority**
The designation is made under **subparagraph (g)(iii) of the definition of "judge"** in **subsection 2(1) of the Canada Elections Act**. This provision allows the Minister of Justice to designate judges of a provincial court (such as the Court of Queen’s Bench) to exercise the powers and functions of a judge under the Act.

This provision is critical because it enables federal oversight of election disputes and ensures that qualified individuals can step in to resolve election-related legal issues, such as challenges to election results, voter eligibility, or judicial review of electoral processes.

#### 2. **Designated Judges**

The list includes judges serving in two divisions of the Court of Queen’s Bench for Manitoba:

---

##### **A. Trial Division Judges**

The following judges are designated to exercise powers in the **Trial Division**:

- Chief Justice Archibald Stewart Dewar  
- Mr. Justice James Edward Wilson  
- Mr. Justice Walter Scott Wright  
- Mr. Justice Peter Scott Morse  
- Mr. Justice Benjamin Hewak  
- Mr. Justice Guy Joseph Kroft  
- Mr. Justice John Ambrose Scollin  
- Mr. Justice Vern Simonsen  
- Mr. Justice Kenneth R. Hanssen  
- Mr. Justice Michel Alfonse Monnin  
- Mr. Justice Gordon Jacob Barkman  
- Mr. Justice Lorne Paterson Ferg  
- Mr. Justice Armand Dureault  
- Mr. Justice Patrick David Ferg

- Mr. Justice James Gordon Smith  
- Mr. Justice Sidney Irwin Schwartz  
- Mr. Justice Theodore Myron Glowacki  
- Mr. Justice Bernard Raymond Coleman (supernumerary judge)

> **Note on "Supernumerary Judge":**  
> Mr. Justice Bernard Raymond Coleman is designated as a **supernumerary judge** — meaning he is not actively assigned to a regular court division but may be called upon to serve in an administrative or temporary capacity. In this context, his designation allows him to act as a judge under the Elections Act when needed.

##### **B. Family Division Judges**

The following judges are designated to exercise powers in the **Family Division**:

- Associate Chief Justice Alvin Chown Hamilton  
- Madam Justice Bonnie Merilyn Helper  
- Madam Justice Claudia Myrna Bowman  
- Mr. Justice Robert Maxwell Carr  
- Mr. Justice Gilbert Raymond Goodman  
- Mr. Justice Joseph A. Mullally  

> **Note:** The Family Division typically handles matters related to family law (e.g., child custody, divorce). However, under the *Canada Elections Act*, judges in this division may be designated to handle certain **election-related disputes**, such as those involving the eligibility of candidates or challenges to electoral boundaries, especially if such matters intersect with family law (e.g., parental rights affecting voting eligibility). This reflects the broad scope of judicial authority under the Act.

---

#### 3. **Scope of Authority**

The designated judges are granted **all the functions and powers conferred upon a judge** by the *Canada Elections Act*. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Hearing and determining challenges to election results  
- Reviewing the eligibility of candidates  
- Resolving disputes over voter registration or voting rights  
- Issuing orders related to election procedures  
- Acting as a judicial body in cases involving electoral malpractice or irregularities  

This authority is **not limited to federal electoral boundaries or voting procedures** but extends to any matter falling within the jurisdiction of the Act.

---

#### 4. **Legal Effect and Evidence**

The document explicitly states:  
> "This document shall be evidence of their authority so to act."

This means that the **designation is legally binding and serves as official proof** that the listed judges are authorized to perform election-related judicial duties under the *Canada Elections Act*. It can be used in court proceedings, legal filings, or administrative processes to establish that a judge is acting within the scope of federal election law.

---

### **Context and Significance**

- **Purpose:** The designation ensures that the federal government has access to qualified, experienced judges who can intervene in election disputes without requiring a separate federal court appointment.
- **Judicial Efficiency:** By leveraging existing provincial court judges, the federal government avoids the cost and delay of appointing new federal election judges.
- **Provincial-Federal Cooperation:** This reflects a model of shared judicial responsibility, where provincial courts assist in federal electoral matters under specific legal provisions.
- **Historical Context (1984):** This designation was issued in 1984, during a period when Canada was strengthening its electoral oversight mechanisms. The *Canada Elections Act* was undergoing reforms to improve transparency and accountability in federal elections.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The designation is **not permanent** and may be revised or rescinded by the Minister of Justice.
- The judges are **not appointed as federal election judges**; they are acting in a temporary, functional capacity under federal law.
- Their authority is **limited to matters within the scope of the Canada Elections Act** and does not extend to other areas of provincial or federal law.
- The designation does not imply that these judges have broader federal jurisdiction beyond the specific powers granted by the Act.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a formal and legally binding **designation of provincial court judges** to serve as **election judges** under the *Canada Elections Act*. It ensures that qualified and experienced judges from Manitoba can intervene in federal election disputes, enhancing judicial oversight and accountability. The designation reflects a practical and efficient mechanism for federal-provincial judicial cooperation in the administration of democratic processes.

It remains a key example of how the federal government can leverage existing judicial infrastructure to fulfill its responsibilities under election law.
