**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Regarding the Recovery of the Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) Population under the Species at Risk Act (SRSA)**

---

### **Background and Context**

The regulation in question is a formal decision by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting under the authority of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, to **decline the proposed emergency order** for the protection of the **Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW)** population — a distinct population segment of *Orcinus orca* in the Northeast Pacific — despite significant threats to its survival.

This decision is rooted in a comprehensive assessment of recovery planning efforts, identified threats, and mitigation measures implemented or proposed by the Government of Canada. It reflects a balancing of scientific evidence, ecological urgency, and socio-economic considerations.

---

### **1. Recovery Planning Measures Under the Species at Risk Act**

The Government has implemented a series of formal recovery planning documents that outline strategies and actions for the protection and recovery of the SRKW population:

- **Recovery Strategy for Northern and Southern Resident Killer Whales (2008, amended 2011):**  
  The foundational document that identified key threats to the SRKW, including prey scarcity, human disturbance, and contamination. It established baseline objectives for population recovery and habitat protection.

- **Action Plan for Northern and Southern Resident Killer Whales (2017) and Multi-Species Action Plan for Pacific Rim National Park Reserve (2017):**  
  These plans integrated broader ecosystem management, emphasizing coordinated conservation across protected areas and species. They included specific actions related to habitat protection, research, and stakeholder engagement.

- **Multi-Species Action Plan for Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (2018):**  
  Focused on protecting critical foraging and breeding habitats in the Gulf Islands region, which are vital to SRKW survival.

- **Proposed Recovery Strategy (September 4, 2018):**  
  This update identified **additional areas of critical habitat**, expanding the geographic scope of protected zones where SRKWs forage, rest, and breed. It provided updated scientific data on habitat use and vulnerability.

### **2. Recognition of Imminent Threats (May 24, 2018)**

On May 24, 2018, the **Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Environment** jointly concluded that the SRKW population faced **imminent threats to its survival and recovery**. They identified three primary threats:

1. **Prey Availability (Chinook Salmon Decline)**  
   - SRKWs rely almost exclusively on Chinook salmon as a primary food source. A decline in salmon populations directly impacts the whales’ health, reproductive success, and survival.

2. **Acoustic and Physical Disturbance**  
   - Noise from commercial vessels, shipping lanes, and industrial activity disrupts whale communication, navigation, and foraging behavior.

3. **Environmental Contaminants**  
   - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as PBDEs, HBCD, PFOS, PFOA, and LC-PFCAs accumulate in the food chain and are toxic to SRKWs, affecting their immune function, reproduction, and overall health.

---

### **3. Regulatory and Policy Measures to Address the Threats**

In response to these threats, the Government of Canada implemented or proposed a range of actions across all three threat categories:

#### **A. Prey Availability – Mitigation Actions**

- **Fisheries Closures (2018):**  
  - Temporary closures of recreational finfish and commercial salmon fisheries in key foraging areas from **June 1 to September 30, 2018**.  
  - Partial, variable closures in the **mouth of the Fraser River** during the same period.  
  - Potential for **additional closures** in 2019, based on monitoring data.

- **Reduction in Chinook Salmon Removals:**  
  - A **25–35% reduction** in total fishery removals of Chinook salmon in 2018.  
  - Further reductions to be determined before the 2019 season based on scientific assessments.

- **Habitat Restoration:**  
  - Initiatives to restore salmon-bearing habitats (e.g., riparian zones, streamside vegetation) to improve Chinook productivity and spawning success.

- **Southern BC Chinook Strategic Planning Initiative (CSPI):**  
  - A coordinated effort to rebuild Chinook populations through science-based management, including habitat protection, fish passage improvements, and ecosystem-based planning.

- **Renegotiation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chinook Chapter):**  
  - Aims to strengthen cooperation between Canada and the United States in managing shared salmon stocks, with a focus on increasing Chinook availability.

- **Increased Hatchery Production:**  
  - Expansion of salmon hatchery programs to supplement wild populations, though with careful attention to minimizing genetic impacts.

#### **B. Acoustic and Physical Disturbance – Mitigation Actions**

- **Fishery Closures and Reduced Vessel Activity:**  
  - Closures and reduced fishing activity in key foraging zones reduce vessel traffic and associated noise.

- **Marine Mammal Regulations Amendment (Effective June 22, 2018):**  
  - Established a **minimum 200-meter approach distance** for all vessels in Canadian Pacific and BC fisheries waters when encountering killer whales. This is a key regulatory step to reduce physical and acoustic disturbance.

- **Enhanced Enforcement Capacity:**  
  - Increased patrols and monitoring to ensure compliance with the Marine Mammal Regulations and SARA.

- **Voluntary Slow-Downs and Lateral Displacement:**  
  - Commercial vessels in **Haro Strait** and other key areas were encouraged to **slow down** or **shift laterally** away from foraging zones to reduce noise exposure.

- **Seeking Legislative Authority under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001:**  
  - Proposal to expand government powers to regulate vessel noise and traffic patterns, especially in sensitive marine areas.

- **Noise Management Plans with Industry:**  
  - Formal agreements with stakeholders to develop and implement **noise mitigation strategies**, including vessel design modifications and operational changes.

- **Hydrophone Monitoring and Baseline Data Collection:**  
  - Deployment of underwater hydrophones to measure baseline noise levels and identify sources of disturbance.

- **Research on Ship Quieting Technologies:**  
  - Investigation into technical solutions such as quieter propellers, hull designs, and routing algorithms to reduce underwater noise.

- **Improved Whale Detection Tools:**  
  - Upgraded detection systems (e.g., automated acoustic monitoring) to enable faster response to whale presence and better enforcement.

---

#### **C. Environmental Contaminants – Mitigation Actions**

- **Regulatory Controls on Toxic Substances:**  
  - Enforcement of existing regulations under:
    - *Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations*
    - *Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations*
    - *Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations*
    - *Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2012*  
  These limit the release of pollutants into waterways.

- **Strengthening Controls on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs):**  
  - A **notice of intent (October 2018)** announced proposed amendments targeting five key POPs:
    - Two flame retardants: **PBDEs and HBCD**
    - Three water/oil repellents: **PFOS, PFOA, and LC-PFCAs**  
  - The proposed amendments were to be published in **Part I of the Canada Gazette in winter 2020**, following public consultation.

- **Upgrades to Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure:**  
  - Construction of:
    - Two new wastewater treatment plants in **Victoria and Vancouver**, operational by **January 1, 2021**  
    - A third plant in **Vancouver**, operational by **January 1, 2031**  
  - These upgrades aim to significantly reduce contaminant discharges into coastal waters.

- **Contaminant Research Program:**  
  - Ongoing research to monitor and measure pollutant levels in:
    - SRKW tissues
    - Their prey (mainly Chinook salmon)
    - Their foraging and breeding habitats

---

### **4. Ongoing Research and Monitoring**

To support adaptive management and future decision-making, the government expanded research into:

- **SRKW health and condition** (e.g., body condition, reproductive status, mortality rates)  
- **Effectiveness of mitigation measures** (e.g., do closures improve foraging success?)  
- **Foraging success and prey availability** over time in key foraging areas

This research is essential for evaluating whether current actions are effective and for refining future policies.

### **5. Decision: Declining the Emergency Order**

Despite the **clear identification of imminent threats** and the **existence of a robust suite of measures** aimed at addressing them, the Governor General in Council **declined to issue an emergency order under Section 80 of the Species at Risk Act**.

#### **Key Reasons for the Decision:**

1. **Comprehensive and Coordinated Measures Already in Place:**  
   The Government has implemented a wide range of actions across all three threat categories — from fisheries management and noise reduction to pollution control and habitat restoration. These actions, considered together, are deemed sufficient to **abate the imminent threats**.

2. **Scientific and Ecological Basis:**  
   The threats are well-documented and the proposed measures are grounded in scientific evidence and ecological understanding.

3. **Balancing Broader Public Interest:**  
   The decision acknowledges the **social, economic, and policy implications** of imposing emergency measures. These include:
   - Impacts on commercial fishing and tourism
