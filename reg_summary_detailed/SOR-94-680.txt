**Detailed Summary of the Guitar Parts Remission Order, 1994**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The *Guitar Parts Remission Order, 1994* was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action was taken under **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (*R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*), which authorizes the government to grant remissions (i.e., reductions or waivers) of customs duties under specific conditions.

This Order is formally designated as the **Guitar Parts Remission Order, 1994** and serves as a regulatory instrument to provide temporary relief from customs duties on certain guitar components imported into Canada.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., cancel or reduce) customs duties** that would otherwise be payable on specific parts used in the manufacture of guitars. This measure is intended to support the Canadian music instrument manufacturing industry by reducing the cost of essential inputs, thereby promoting domestic production and competitiveness.

---

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies specifically to **certain parts of guitars** listed in **Schedule I to the Customs Tariff**. These parts are defined as components that are directly used in the manufacturing process of guitars. Examples may include necks, bodies, strings, tuners, bridges, and other integral parts (though the full list is contained in the annexed schedule).

Importantly, the remission applies **only to goods imported during a specific time period**.

**4. Conditions for Eligibility**  
To qualify for the remission, the following three conditions must be met:

- **Time Period of Importation**:  
  The guitar parts must have been imported into Canada **between September 23, 1993, and March 10, 1994**, inclusive. This narrow window indicates a targeted, time-limited policy designed to assist manufacturers during a specific period, likely in response to market conditions or industry needs.

- **Purpose of Importation**:  
  The imported parts must be **intended for use in the manufacture of guitars**. This ensures that the remission is not being used for general commercial or non-manufacturing purposes, and that the funds are being directed toward supporting guitar production.

- **Timely Claim Submission**:  
  A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years of the date of importation** of the goods. This creates a strict deadline for applicants to act, emphasizing administrative accountability and timely processing.

---

**5. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The Order is **subject to Section 3** of the Customs Tariff, which likely imposes general limitations or conditions on the application of remissions (e.g., restrictions on the types of goods, eligibility criteria, or procedural requirements). These provisions ensure that the remission does not lead to abuse or unintended fiscal consequences.
- The claim process is administrative and requires direct engagement with the Minister of National Revenue, indicating that the government maintains oversight and control over the use of duty remission powers.

---

**6. Duration and Limitations**  
- The remission is **not a permanent or general policy**. It is a **temporary, time-bound measure** applicable only to the specified period (September 23, 1993 – March 10, 1994).
- It applies only to **specific parts** listed in Schedule I of the Customs Tariff, not to all guitar-related goods or components.
- The requirement to file a claim within two years of importation adds a time-sensitive procedural element, ensuring that claims are not indefinitely delayed.

---

**7. Policy Context and Rationale**  
This Order reflects a targeted fiscal policy aimed at supporting a specific sector—music instrument manufacturing—during a period of potential economic challenge. By reducing the cost of essential inputs (guitar parts), the government seeks to:

- Enhance the competitiveness of Canadian guitar manufacturers;
- Support job creation and industrial development in the music industry;
- Encourage domestic production and reduce reliance on imported components.

Such measures are often implemented during periods of economic downturn or when domestic industries face high input costs.

**Conclusion**  
The *Guitar Parts Remission Order, 1994* is a targeted, temporary regulatory measure that grants a full remission of customs duties on specified guitar parts imported into Canada between September 23, 1993, and March 10, 1994, provided that the parts are used in guitar manufacturing and a claim is filed with the Minister of National Revenue within two years of importation. The Order operates under strict eligibility conditions and is governed by the legal framework of the Customs Tariff, ensuring fiscal discipline and targeted industrial support. It exemplifies how Canadian customs policy can be used to promote specific sectors through strategic duty relief.
