**Detailed Summary of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal Criminal Appeal Rules, 1993**

---

### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Yukon Territory Court of Appeal Criminal Appeal Rules, 1993* (commonly referred to as the "1993 Criminal Appeal Rules") were enacted by the Appeal Court of the Yukon Territory on **March 12, 1993**, pursuant to **section 482 of the Criminal Code of Canada** and with the concurrence of the majority of the judges present at a formal meeting. These rules **repeal and replace** two previous sets of criminal appeal rules:

- The *Criminal Appeal Rules, Yukon Territory, 1973*  
- The *Yukon Criminal Appeal Rules, 1986*

The primary purpose of these rules is to **modernize, clarify, and streamline the procedures** governing criminal appeals in the Yukon Territory, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and fairness in the appellate process. They provide detailed procedural guidance for filing appeals, preparing appellate records, submitting legal arguments, and managing the conduct of appeals.

These rules are **specifically applicable to criminal appeals** and are supplemented by the *Court of Appeal Rules, Yukon Territory, 1974 (Civil)*, which govern civil appeals not explicitly addressed herein.
