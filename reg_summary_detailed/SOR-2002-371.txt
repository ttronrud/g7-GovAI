The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-203, section 15**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2015-203**, which is a **Supplemental Order of Regulation** issued in 2015. Specifically, **Section 15** of that order contains the repeal provision.
- **Scope of Repeal**: The repeated references suggest that **multiple provisions or sections** (though not individually listed) were repealed under Section 15 of SOR/2015-203. However, the original regulation being repealed is not explicitly named in the text provided.
- **Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it is **no longer in force**, and any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by it are **no longer applicable**.
- **Legal Significance**: Repeal typically occurs when a regulation is outdated, redundant, inconsistent with newer legislation, or superseded by a more current or comprehensive rule. The repeal by SOR/2015-203 indicates a formal update or consolidation of regulatory provisions.

### Important Notes:
- Without the original regulation’s title or content, it is not possible to determine the specific subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.) that was repealed.
- The repetition of the same line 17 times appears to be a formatting or data-entry error and does not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed — it is likely a duplication in the source document or database.
