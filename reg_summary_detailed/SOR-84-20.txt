  The provision was formally removed from force and effect by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. This means the regulation no longer exists in current legal effect and cannot be cited or applied.

- **SOR/2017-84**:  
  This is a **Statutory Instrument** (SI) issued in 2017 by the Government of Canada. Statutory Instruments are a form of secondary legislation used to implement or amend primary legislation. In this case, SOR/2017-84 is a regulatory amendment or repeal instrument.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84**:
