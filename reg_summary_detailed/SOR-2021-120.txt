### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Ballast Water Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 1, s. 141 and related statutes)**

The **Canadian Ballast Water Regulations** are a comprehensive set of rules designed to protect Canada’s aquatic ecosystems—particularly the Great Lakes and other sensitive waters—from the introduction and spread of invasive species through ballast water. These regulations are **complementary and additional** to the **International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004 (the “Convention”)**, and are enacted under the authority of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* and the *Fisheries Act*.

They establish specific, enforceable standards for the management of ballast water on vessels operating in Canadian waters, including both commercial and pleasure craft. Below is a detailed, structured summary of the key provisions and their implications.

## **I. Legal Authority and Purpose**

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulations are made under:
  - Subsections **35(1)a** and **35.1(1)b** of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*,
  - **Section 190c**,
  - Paragraphs **244(f)(d), (g), and (h)(e)** of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*,
  - Subsection **43(1)(g)** of the *Fisheries Act*.

- **Purpose**:  
  To prevent the **introduction of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens** into Canadian waters via ballast water, in accordance with international standards, while allowing for flexibility in certain cases (e.g., small vessels, exemptions, or alternative methods).

## **II. Definitions and Key Terms**

The regulations define key terms used throughout:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Ballast water** | Water taken on board to maintain stability during voyages; defined per Convention Article 1. |
| **Ballast water management (BWM)** | The process of managing ballast water to minimize the transfer of invasive species. |
| **Ballast water management system (BWMS)** | A system (e.g., filtration, treatment) that meets international standards (BWMS Code). |
| **Ballast water exchange standard** | Requires a complete exchange of ballast water in open ocean or designated areas (per Annex Regulation D-1). |
| **Ballast water performance standard** | Requires treatment of ballast water to reduce viable organisms to safe levels (per Annex Regulation D-2). |
| **Viable organisms** | Living organisms capable of surviving and reproducing in new environments (as defined in BWMS Code). |
| **Residual amounts** | Water that cannot be removed from a tank using installed equipment. |
| **Sediments** | Particles that settle out of ballast water. |
| **Great Lakes Basin** | Includes the five Great Lakes, their tributaries, and the St. Lawrence River up to the lower exit of the St. Lambert Lock in Montreal. |
| **Waters under Canadian jurisdiction** | Canadian territorial waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). |
| **Canadian pleasure craft** | A non-Canadian vessel primarily maintained or operated in Canada and not registered elsewhere. |
| **IBWM Certificate** | International Ballast Water Management Certificate issued under Annex E-2 or E-3. |

> **Interpretive Clarifications**:
> - "Administration" is read as "Minister" for Canadian vessels, pleasure craft, and offshore platforms.
> - "Ship" is read as "vessel".
> - "Survey" is read as "inspection".
> - "Discharge" = "release" (leakage, dumping, pouring, etc.).
> - "Should" in G3 guidelines is interpreted as "must" (mandatory).
> - "Location within 10 nautical miles" means without physical barriers.

## **III. Scope of Application**

### **Vessels Covered**
- **All Canadian vessels** operating **everywhere in the world**.
- **Non-Canadian vessels** operating in **waters under Canadian jurisdiction** (i.e., Canadian territorial waters and EEZ), **except**:
  - Vessels operated exclusively in the **Great Lakes Basin** and not taking on or releasing ballast water in Canadian waters (unless for safety reasons).
  - Vessels used in **government non-commercial service**.
  - Vessels carrying **only permanent ballast water** in sealed tanks (not subject to release).

> **Exclusions**:
> - Vessels operated by non-Convention parties (e.g., non-signatory countries) operating exclusively in the Great Lakes Basin and not releasing ballast water in Canadian waters.
> - Vessels used solely in government non-commercial service.
> - Vessels with sealed ballast water (no release possible).

> **Note**: The regulations apply to **any quantity** of ballast water that may be released—regardless of volume.

## **IV. Core Compliance Requirements**

### **1. Ballast Water Management Plan (BWMP)**
- **Mandatory for Canadian vessels and Canadian pleasure craft**.
- Must be **approved by the Minister** upon application and must meet the requirements in **Annex Regulation B-1**.
- Must be **in English, French, or both**.
- Must remain **up to date** and reflect current compliance methods.
- **Amendments** must be submitted to the Minister for approval if they alter the plan.

> **Exception**: Vessels under 50 meters in length or under 3,000 gross tons may opt into **alternative compliance** (see below).

---

### **2. Ballast Water Record Book**
- **Master and authorized representative** must ensure:
  - Entries are made according to Annex requirements.
  - Signatures meet Annex B-2 requirements.
  - Entries are maintained on board and kept **readily available** for inspection.
- For **Canadian vessels and pleasure craft**, the authorized representative must **retain entries** after the on-board period.

> **Language Requirement**: Entries must be in **English, French, or both** (despite Annex B-2).

---

### **3. Inspection and Certification**
- **Initial and renewal inspections** under Annex Section E must be conducted.
- A **valid IBWM Certificate** must be held and kept on board.
- **Issuance and endorsement** of the certificate are the responsibility of the Minister upon meeting inspection requirements.

> **For non-Canadian vessels**:
> - Must hold a valid IBWM Certificate **or** an equivalent document issued by their home country if it is a Convention party.
> - **No ballast water release** in Canadian waters unless certified.

---

## **V. Compliance Pathways**

### **A. Ballast Water Exchange Standard (D-1)**
- Requires **complete exchange** of ballast water in a designated area to reduce invasive species.
- **Mandatory conditions**:
  1. **Minimum distance from land**: At least **200 nautical miles** from nearest land.
  2. **Minimum depth**: At least **2,000 meters**.
  3. **Alternative areas**: If the above are not feasible, use **designated alternate exchange areas** listed in **TP 13617** (List of Canada’s Designated Alternate Ballast Water Exchange Areas and Fresh Waters).
  4. **Exception**: If exchange would threaten **safety or stability** of vessel due to weather, design, or equipment failure — master may waive it and must **record the reason** in the record book.

> **Saltwater flushing requirement**:
> - If tanks contain **only residual amounts** and were not previously exchanged, the vessel must perform a **saltwater flush**:
>   - Add water to tanks (as per exchange standard),
>   - Mix with residual amounts and sediments,
>   - Release the mixture such that **salinity exceeds 30 ppt** (parts per thousand).

### **B. Ballast Water Performance Standard (D-2)**
- Requires **treatment of ballast water** to reduce viable organisms to safe levels.
- Applies to vessels using a **ballast water management system (BWMS)**.
- **Approved systems** must be certified by the **Minister** under **Regulation D-3** of the Annex.
- A vessel is deemed to meet the performance standard if:
  1. The BWMS was installed **before September 8, 2024** (or before **September 8, 2030** for vessels built before January 1, 2009),
  2. The vessel meets **section 8** (basic BWM requirements),
  3. Holds a **valid IBWM Certificate**,
  4. The system is in **good working order** and maintained per manufacturer’s instructions,

>   - The system was installed before the applicable date,
>   - The exchange was conducted per **G6 Guidelines (2017)** (sequential method),
>   - The ballast water was not mixed with
