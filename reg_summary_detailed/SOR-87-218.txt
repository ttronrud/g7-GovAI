### **3. Determination of Provincial Population**
The population of a province for a fiscal year is determined as follows:

- For **fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 1991**, the population is based on the **official census** conducted by Statistics Canada in that fiscal year (in accordance with the *Statistics Act*).
- For **all other fiscal years**, the population is based on the **official estimate** of the province’s population on **June 1** of that fiscal year, as estimated by Statistics Canada and included in a certificate submitted to the Minister.

#### **Special Provision for Fiscal Year Beginning April 1, 1990**
- The population for that year is defined as the population on **June 1, 1990**, estimated by the Chief Statistician using:
  - The **1986 and 1991 censuses**;
  - Excluding **non-permanent residents**;
  - Adjusting for **Net Census Undercoverage**, **excluding** adjustments for incompletely enumerated Indian settlements and reserves;
  - Incorporating the most recent official data available within **30 months** after the fiscal year ends.

#### **Population Estimation for Subsequent Fiscal Years**

- For the fiscal year beginning **April 1, 1990**, a certificate must be submitted by **February 28, 1994**, covering that year and the four preceding years.

> **Note**: For purposes of calculating equalization payments and program funding, the population is used in two different ways:

> - **For administrative purposes (Subsection 4)**: Population on June 1 of the fiscal year, based on the most recent official data within 30 months of the fiscal year’s end.

### **4. Taxation Revenue Bases for Equalization and Payments**
These rules define how **personal income tax** and **corporation income tax** are aggregated to determine the relevant revenue base for a province.

#### **Personal Income Taxes**
- The relevant revenue base is calculated as:
  - **75%** of the assessed federal individual income tax applicable to the province for the **taxation year ending in the fiscal year** (determined by the Minister of National Revenue).
  - **25%** of the assessed federal individual income tax applicable to the province for the **taxation year beginning in the fiscal year**.

#### **Corporation Income Taxes**
- The relevant revenue base is calculated as:
  - **75%** of the total taxable income earned in the province by corporations with a taxation year ending in the **calendar year that ends in the fiscal year**.
  - **25%** of the total taxable income earned in the province by corporations with a taxation year ending in the **calendar year that begins in the fiscal year**.

> These amounts are derived from the Minister of National Revenue’s assessments under **paragraph 124(4)(a)** of the *Income Tax Act*.

---

### **5. Equalization Payment Adjustments**
The regulations specify how equalization payments are adjusted based on specific provisions of the Act.

#### **Adjustment under Subsection 4(6) of the Act**
- If subsection 4(6) applies, the equalization payment is **increased** by an amount calculated using a formula involving:
  - The population of the province (P);
  - The average per capita yield of the five largest provinces (Ontario, Quebec, BC, Manitoba, Saskatchewan) for the fiscal year (A and B);
  - A quotient (F) that measures the excess of the payment under subsection 4(6) over that under subsection 4(1), divided by the province’s population;
  - A value (C) from paragraph 4(9)(d) of the Act.

#### **Adjustment under Subsection 4(9) of the Act**
- If subsection 4(9) applies, the equalization payment **increased under paragraph (a)** is **reduced** by an amount calculated using a similar formula, based on the same variables.

> These adjustments ensure that provinces with lower revenue per capita receive greater equalization support, based on objective revenue and population metrics.

### **6. Advance Payments for Established Programs**
The Government of Canada may make **monthly advance payments** to provinces for established programs (e.g., post-secondary education, health, social services), based on **estimates** of future payments.

#### **Types of Programs Covered**
- The **program referred to in Section 20** (as read on March 31, 1996) — interpreted as the **Canada Post-Secondary Education Transfer**.
- The **programs in Sections 22 and 23** — interpreted as the **Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST)** and related social programs.

#### **Advance Payment Process**
- The Minister estimates the amount payable to the province and makes **monthly payments** starting on **April 30** of the fiscal year.
- Payments can be **adjusted during the fiscal year** to align with updated data used in tax collection agreements.

#### **Interim Adjustments**
- If more accurate information becomes available, the Minister may revise the estimate and adjust the **remaining monthly payments**.
- An **interim adjustment** may be calculated in a **subsequent fiscal year** and applied over a period of **up to eight months**, starting from the first or second month after the adjustment is calculated.
- **Timing of Adjustment**:
  - If the adjustment is made **on or before March 31, 1996**, it applies to the **established programs** (e.g., education, health).
  - If made **after March 31, 1996**, it applies only to the **Canada Health and Social Transfer**.

#### **Final Settlement**
- A **final settlement** is calculated using data available during the **30 months following the end of the fiscal year**.
- It is effective in the **third fiscal year after the fiscal year in question**.
- **If made on or before March 31, 1996**: Adjustments are made to **amounts otherwise payable** under the established programs.
- **If made after March 31, 1996**: Adjustments are made to the **Canada Health and Social Transfer**.
