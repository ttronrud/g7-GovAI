## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Regulation: Repeal and Replacement of General Radio Regulations (SOR/2021-40, s. 2)**

### 📌 **Overview and Purpose**
This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Radiocommunication Act** and the **Financial Administration Act**, formally **repeals four outdated regulations**:
1. *General Radio Regulations, Part I, C.R.C., c. 1371*

3. *Interference-causing Equipment Regulations* (P.C. 1993-408)
4. *Radio Operators’ Certificate Regulations* (March 9, 1978)

It replaces them with a **new, consolidated set of radiocommunication rules** governing:
- Radio authorizations and exemptions
- Operation of radio apparatus
- Interference-causing and radio-sensitive equipment
- Licensing conditions and technical standards

These new rules are effective upon publication in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, and represent a significant modernization of Canada’s radio spectrum governance framework.
