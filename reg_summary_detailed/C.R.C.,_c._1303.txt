**Detailed Summary of the *Precious Metals Marking Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Citation and Governing Act**
- These regulations are formally known as the **Precious Metals Marking Regulations**.
- They are enacted under the authority of the **Precious Metals Marking Act (the "Act")**, which establishes standards for the marking of precious metal articles in Canada to ensure consumer protection, transparency, and market integrity.

---

### **2. Exemptions from the Act**
Certain articles are **exempt from the requirements of the Act** when sold to a dealer outside Canada:
- **Articles sold to foreign dealers** are not subject to the marking requirements of the Act.

Additionally, specific **parts of articles** are exempt from assay (i.e., testing and certification) and from requiring a quality mark, including:
- **Mechanisms, movements, or works** contained within a case or cover.
- **Brooch pins, brooch joints, and brooch catches** on gold or silver insignia pins.
- Any article to which a **quality mark specified in Column I of items 1, 2, or 4 of the table in Section 7** may be applied (i.e., those that are already designated for marking).

> *Note: These exemptions apply to components that are not the primary body of the article but serve functional or decorative roles.*

---

### **3. Parts Where Quality Marks May Be Applied**
Where a quality mark is applied to an article, the following **specific parts** may be marked (depending on the article type):

#### **General Exempt Parts (No Marking Required)**
- Springs, winding bars, sleeves, crown cores, joint pins, screws, rivets, dust bands, movement rings, spring pins
- Hat pin stems and sockets
- Scarf pin, stick pin, collar tack clutchbacks
- Bracelet tongues
- Locket bezels
- Knife skeletons and blades
- Lapel button backs and their posts
- Earring setting posts
- Tubes and posts for drilled stones with attached collets or claws

#### **Spectacle Frames**
- Pad posts
- Cores and inner winding of comfort cable temples
- Any part permanently encased in non-metallic material
- Hinge assemblies

> These parts are exempt from marking because they are considered non-precious or non-core components.

---

### **4. Methods of Applying Quality Marks**
- A quality mark may be applied by **any method** (e.g., stamping, branding, engraving, or imprinting), **subject to subsections 10(1), 11(6), and 12(1)**.
- If a **trademark** is applied to the article under subsection 4(3) of the Act, it must be applied **using the same method** as the quality mark.

---

### **5. Labeling of Plated Articles**
#### **When Only Part of an Article is Plated**
- If only a portion of an article is composed of a precious metal plating (e.g., a silver-plated watch), and a quality mark is applied:
  - The **name of the plated part** must be included **immediately before or after** the quality mark.

#### **When Plating Thickness is Stated**
- If the thickness of the plating is expressed as a whole number followed by **"micrometres" (µm)** or **"vm"**, the term **"micron" or "v"** may be substituted.

---

### **6. Conditions for Applying Quality Marks**
A quality mark may be applied to an article (or part) only if:
- It is composed **wholly or partly** of a precious metal specified in **Column II** of the relevant table.
- It meets the **requirements specified in Column III** of that table.

> This applies to both **unplated** and **plated** articles, with different conditions based on the type of metal and article.

---

### **7. Requirements for Gold Quality Marks**
When a gold quality mark is used:
- The word **"gold"**, **"or"**, the letter **"G"**, or the abbreviation **"Au"** may be used alongside the mark.
- **Karats**:
  - The number must be in the **same proportion to 24** as the actual gold content to pure gold.
    - Example: 18-karat gold = 18/24 = 75% pure gold.
- **Decimals**:
  - The number must be in the **same proportion to 1** as the gold content to pure gold.
    - Example: 0.75 = 75% pure gold.

> These ratios must reflect the actual gold content in the article.

---

### **8. Plated Articles – Conditions for Marking**
A quality mark may be applied to a **plated article** (excluding watch cases, spectacle frames, and flatware/hollow ware) only if:
- The plating is of a **precious metal** specified in **Column II** of the table.
- The article meets the **requirements in Columns III and IV** of the table.

> This includes minimum thickness, plating quality, and base metal specifications.

---

### **9. Additional Information to Be Included with Gold Marks**
For certain quality marks (especially gold), the following may be added **immediately before** the quality mark:
- A **fraction** showing the ratio of the **weight of gold** to the **gross weight** of the article.
- A **statement of gold quality** in karats or decimals.

> All numerals and characters in such statements must:
- Be of **equal size**.
- Not be **larger** than the quality mark itself.

---

### **10. Thickness Statements for Plated Articles**
- For **gold or silver plating of at least 1 micrometre** (µm), a statement of thickness may be included:
  - Format: whole number + "micrometres" or "vm"
  - Example: "2 vm"

> Applies to plated articles in general, including watch cases and spectacle frames.

---

### **11. Watch Case Marking Requirements**
