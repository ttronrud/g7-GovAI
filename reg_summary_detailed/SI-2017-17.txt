**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Key Provision:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments prepared by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** under subsection **23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act*.

**Context and Legal Basis:**  
- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) was enacted to protect wildlife species at risk of extinction in Canada.
- Subsection 23(1) of SARA requires the Minister of the Environment to, upon request or as part of the process, receive and consider scientific assessments of species’ status conducted by COSEWIC.
- COSEWIC is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada. It evaluates species based on scientific data and determines whether they are at risk of extinction.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
This Order serves as an official recognition and formal acceptance by the federal government (via the Governor General in Council, on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) that the assessments of specific species—listed in the annexed schedule—have been completed and are now available for use in the regulatory and conservation processes under SARA.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Formal Acknowledgment:**  
   The government formally recognizes that COSEWIC has completed its scientific evaluations for the species listed in the attached schedule. This is not a decision to list the species, but rather a procedural step confirming that the scientific basis for potential listing or protection exists.

2. **Trigger for Further Action:**  
   Once the assessments are acknowledged, the Minister of the Environment may proceed with:
   - Determining whether a species should be listed as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under SARA.
   - Developing recovery strategies and action plans.
   - Implementing protective measures or designating critical habitat.

3. **Transparency and Scientific Integrity:**  
   The regulation underscores the importance of science-based decision-making in wildlife conservation. By acknowledging COSEWIC assessments, the government affirms its reliance on expert scientific analysis to inform policy.

4. **Annexed Schedule:**  
   The schedule attached to the Order lists the specific species for which assessments have been completed. These species are typically those that have been identified as being at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, climate change, invasive species, or population decline.

5. **Procedural Compliance:**  
   This Order ensures compliance with the procedural requirements of SARA, specifically the requirement that assessments be formally received and considered before any listing or protection measures are implemented.

**Significance:**

- This regulation marks a critical step in the conservation process: the official government recognition of scientific findings.
- It enables the Minister to move forward with formal designations and protective actions based on sound, peer-reviewed science.
- It strengthens public trust in the government’s conservation decisions by demonstrating transparency and adherence to scientific standards.

**Example of Species That Might Be Listed (Illustrative):**  
While the actual list is in the annex, examples may include species such as:
- The **Canadian lynx**
- The **Atlantic salmon**
- The **blanding’s turtle**
- The **peregrine falcon**

(Note: The actual species in the annex must be consulted for precise details.)

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and administrative instrument that formalizes the government’s acceptance of COSEWIC’s scientific assessments under SARA. It does not itself list species as at risk, but it is a necessary step that enables the Minister to proceed with official designations and conservation actions. It reflects Canada’s commitment to science-based, transparent, and legally sound wildlife conservation policy.
