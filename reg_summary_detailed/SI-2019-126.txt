### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: SI/2018-76**

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation, formally known as **Order in Council P.C. 2018-76**, serves two primary purposes:

1. **Repeal of a Previous Order in Council**  
   It formally repeals **Order in Council P.C. 2018-1021**, dated **July 18, 2018**.  
   - This prior order had established certain administrative or procedural provisions related to the implementation of the Canada Disability Savings Act (CDSA), likely concerning the governance, designation of officials, or operational frameworks for the Disability Savings Program (DSP).

2. **Designation of a Minister for the CDSA**  
   It designates the **Minister of Employment and Social Development** as "the Minister" for the purposes of the Canada Disability Savings Act.  
   - This designation is critical because the Act requires a designated Minister to oversee its implementation, including administrative responsibilities, policy decisions, and reporting obligations.

#### **2. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under **Section 4 of the Canada Disability Savings Act (S.C. 2007, c. 35, s. 136)**.  
- Section 4 of the CDSA empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to:
  - Repeal or amend existing orders or regulations;
  - Designate a Minister of the Crown to act as the official responsible for administering the Act.

This authority ensures that the federal government can adapt administrative structures to meet the evolving needs of the Disability Savings Program.

#### **3. Key Provisions**
- **Repeal Clause**:  
  The regulation explicitly cancels Order in Council P.C. 2018-1021, which may have contained outdated, inconsistent, or no longer necessary provisions. This ensures regulatory clarity and alignment with current policy and legislative intent.

- **Designation Clause**:  
  The Minister of Employment and Social Development is formally named as "the Minister" under the CDSA. This means:
  - The Minister is responsible for all administrative, policy, and oversight functions related to the Canada Disability Savings Program.
  - The Minister has the authority to issue directions, make decisions, and report to Parliament on the program’s implementation.
  - The designation provides legal certainty and accountability in the management of the program.

#### **4. Significance and Implications**
- **Clarity in Governance**: By designating a specific Minister, the government establishes clear accountability and ensures that the CDSA is administered by a single, responsible official.
- **Policy Continuity**: Repealing an older order removes potential confusion or conflicting directives, ensuring that the program operates under current, up-to-date regulations.
- **Alignment with Government Structure**: The Minister of Employment and Social Development is a natural fit, as the department oversees programs related to disability, employment, and social services — directly relevant to the CDSA’s goals.

#### **5. Context and Background**
- The **Canada Disability Savings Act** was enacted in 2007 to establish a national savings program that helps people with disabilities build financial security through tax incentives.
- The **Disability Savings Program (DSP)** allows eligible individuals to save for disability-related expenses, with contributions being tax-free and growing over time.
- The 2018 order (P.C. 2018-1021) may have been a transitional or interim measure. Its repeal and replacement with a formal designation reflect a move toward more stable, long-term governance of the program.

#### **6. Legal Citation**
- **Statute**: Canada Disability Savings Act  
- **Section**: Section 4 (Authority to designate Minister and repeal orders)  
- **Citation**: S.C. 2007, c. 35, s. 136  
- **Regulation**: SI/2018-76  
- **Date of Issuance**: July 2018 (specific date not provided in the excerpt)

### **Conclusion**
