**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Turkey Order**

---

**Title:**  
*The Saskatchewan Turkey Order*  
This regulation is formally cited as the *Saskatchewan Turkey Order* and serves to establish the regulatory framework governing the marketing of turkeys in Saskatchewan, particularly in interprovincial and export trade.

---

**Key Definitions and Interpretations:**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act of Saskatchewan* (French: *Loi sur le marché des produits naturels*). This foundational legislation provides the legal authority for the Commodity Board to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including turkeys.

2. **"Commodity Board"**  
   Refers to the *Saskatchewan Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board* (French: *Office de commercialisation*), an entity established under the Natural Products Marketing Act. Its primary role is to oversee and regulate the marketing of turkeys within Saskatchewan, with specific powers extending to interprovincial and international (export) trade.

3. **"Turkey"**  
   Defined broadly as *any turkey of any variety, grade, or class that is raised or kept for slaughter within the Province of Saskatchewan and sold for slaughter*. This definition ensures that only turkeys produced within Saskatchewan are subject to the regulation, regardless of their specific type or quality.

**Core Regulatory Powers of the Commodity Board:**

The Commodity Board is granted specific powers to regulate the marketing of turkeys in **interprovincial and export trade**, which are analogous to the powers it already holds for local marketing within the province. These powers are derived from **paragraph 15(l) of the Natural Products Marketing Act**.

This means that the Board may, by issuing orders, regulate activities related to the sale, distribution, pricing, and movement of turkeys beyond Saskatchewan’s borders — including sales to other Canadian provinces and to foreign markets — with the same level of authority it has over domestic marketing.

---

**Levies and Charges:**

A central component of the Order is the Board’s authority to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or businesses engaged in the **production or marketing of turkeys** within Saskatchewan.

These levies are not arbitrary; they are applied in a structured and equitable manner through:

- **Classification of persons into groups** based on factors such as size of operation, type of involvement (e.g., producers vs. marketers), or other relevant criteria.
- **Setting different levies or charges** for members of each group, ensuring that the financial burden is proportionate to the level of participation or impact on the market.

For example:
- Small-scale producers may be charged a lower rate than large-scale operations.
- Marketing entities (e.g., processors, distributors) may be subject to different rates than farmers who raise turkeys.

---

**Use of Levies and Charges:**

The funds collected through these levies and charges are not restricted in their use. The Commodity Board may utilize them for a variety of purposes, including:

1. **Creation of reserves** – to build financial buffers for future market volatility or downturns.
2. **Payment of expenses and losses** – such as costs incurred during marketing, transportation, or losses due to poor market conditions.
3. **Equalization or adjustment of profits among producers** – to ensure that producers receive a fair share of revenue generated from turkey sales, especially during periods of fluctuating market prices or uneven market performance.

This mechanism helps to **mitigate economic disparities** among producers and promotes market stability by smoothing out the financial impacts of market fluctuations.

---

**Periodicity and Duration:**

The Board may determine the **time periods** over which these levies or adjustments are applied. This allows flexibility in response to market conditions, such as seasonal demand, supply shocks, or changes in international trade.

For instance, levies might be applied annually or during specific market cycles (e.g., during peak holiday seasons when turkey demand surges).

---

**Revocation Note:**

An earlier version of this provision (previously cited as *SOR/80-90*) has been **revoked**. This indicates that the current regulation supersedes outdated or obsolete language, reflecting updates to the regulatory framework or changes in policy direction.

---

**Overall Purpose and Significance:**

The Saskatchewan Turkey Order establishes a transparent, equitable, and market-responsive system to manage the marketing of turkeys beyond provincial borders. By enabling the Commodity Board to:

- Classify producers and set fair levies,
- Collect funds for market stability and loss mitigation,
- Use those funds to support producers and ensure fair returns,

the Order helps protect the interests of turkey producers, maintain market integrity, and promote sustainable growth in the turkey industry in Saskatchewan.

---

**Conclusion:**

This Order is a critical piece of agricultural regulation that enhances the economic resilience of the Saskatchewan turkey sector. It ensures that producers are not left vulnerable to market volatility, provides a mechanism for fair financial distribution, and supports the long-term viability of turkey production and export in the province.
