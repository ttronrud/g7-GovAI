**Detailed Summary of the Natural Gas and Gas Liquids Tax Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Natural Gas and Gas Liquids Tax Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to **paragraph 25.19(c) of the Excise Tax Act**. These regulations establish specific definitions, exemptions, and tax rates applicable to **marketable pipeline gas** and **gas liquids** (such as ethane, propane, and butanes) in Canada.

The regulations are designed to implement a tax regime that applies to certain uses of natural gas and gas liquids, with a focus on distinguishing between commercial production and non-commercial or minor production activities. Importantly, the tax structure includes **time-bound transitional rates** that were phased out after 1984, reflecting a shift toward a zero tax for most marketable gas and gas liquids after that date.

### **1. Prescribed Uses and Sources of Marketable Pipeline Gas**

The regulations define specific **uses and sources** of marketable pipeline gas that are eligible for exemption or special treatment under paragraph 25.19(c) of the Excise Tax Act.

#### **Eligible Uses by Producers:**
The following uses of natural gas are **exempt from taxation** under the regulation:

- **Compressors** used in a **field gathering system** to transport gas to a gas processing plant.
- **Line heaters** used in a gas gathering system to maintain temperature and prevent freezing.
- **Pilot lights** in **flare stacks** located within a gas gathering system or gas field.
- **Buildings or structures** designed and used to house the above equipment (or equipment related to it).

> ✅ These are considered **non-commercial or operational uses** directly tied to the infrastructure required for gas transportation and safety, and thus are exempt from excise tax.

#### **Eligible Wells:**
The following types of wells are also exempt:

- Wells that are **not part of a business** engaged in producing, distributing, or processing natural gas.
- Wells whose **annual gas production does not exceed 1,000 gigajoules (GJ)** in a calendar year.

> ⚠️ This exemption applies only to **non-commercial operations** with **limited output**. If a well is part of a commercial gas operation or produces more than 1,000 GJ annually, it is subject to the applicable tax rates.

> 🔍 *Note:* This provision effectively targets small-scale or marginal producers who do not engage in commercial gas operations, reducing the tax burden on low-volume, non-commercial activity.

### **2. Tax Rates for Natural Gas and Gas Liquids**

The regulations prescribe specific **excise tax rates** for various types of gas and gas liquids, based on **when the gas was received** (i.e., the year of receipt). The rates are structured in **phased transitions**, reflecting policy changes over time.

#### **A. Marketable Pipeline Gas (Taxed at 45 cents/GJ – Transitional Rate)**

| Receipt Period | Tax Rate |
|---------------|---------|
| After Jan 31, 1983 <br> but before Aug 1, 1983 | **45 cents per gigajoule (GJ)** |

> This was a transitional rate applied during the early phase of the tax regime.

#### **B. Marketable Pipeline Gas (Reduced Rate – 1983–1984 Transition)**

| Receipt Period | Tax Rate |
|---------------|---------|
| After Jul 31, 1983 <br> but before Feb 1, 1984 | **15 cents per gigajoule (GJ)** |

> A significant reduction from the previous 45-cent rate, indicating a move toward lower taxation during the transition period.

#### **C. Marketable Pipeline Gas (Zero Rate – Effective from Jan 31, 1984 Onward)**

| Receipt Period | Tax Rate |
|---------------|---------|
| After Jan 31, 1984 | **0 cents per gigajoule (GJ)** |

> From this date onward, **marketable pipeline gas is completely exempt from excise tax**.

> ✅ This marks a **permanent elimination** of the excise tax on marketable pipeline gas, which is a major policy shift.

---

#### **D. Gas Liquids (Ethane, Propane, Butanes)**

The regulations also prescribe tax rates for **gas liquids**, which are separated from natural gas during processing. These rates are set per **cubic metre (m³)** and are also phased over time.

| Gas Liquid | Receipt Period | Tax Rate |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Ethane** | After Jan 31, 1983 <br> but before Aug 1, 1983 | **$8.35 per cubic metre (m³)** |
| **Ethane** | After Jul 31, 1983 <br> but before Feb 1, 1984 | **$2.80 per m³** |
| **Propane** | After Jan 31, 1983 <br> but before Aug 1, 1983 | **$11.45 per m³** |
| **Propane** | After Jul 31, 1983 <br> but before Feb 1, 1984 | **$3.80 per m³** |
| **Butanes** | After Jan 31, 1983 <br> but before Aug 1, 1983 | **$12.75 per m³** |
| **Butanes** | After Jul 31, 1983 <br> but before Feb 1, 1984 | **$4.25 per m³** |
| **All Gas Liquids** | After Jan 31, 1984 | **0 cents per m³** |

> ✅ From **January 31, 1984 onward**, **all gas liquids (ethane, propane, butanes)** are **exempt from excise tax**.

> This reflects a **broader policy shift** to remove excise taxes on gas liquids, particularly as they became more integrated into the energy market and used in industrial and consumer applications.

### **Key Policy Implications**

1. **Phased Elimination of Excise Tax**  
   The regulations show a deliberate and structured **phasing out** of excise taxes on natural gas and gas liquids, starting in 1983 and fully eliminating them by the end of 1984. This suggests a policy objective to:
   - Reduce barriers to energy development.
   - Promote competitiveness in the natural gas and gas liquids sector.
   - Align with broader energy market liberalization efforts.

2. **Exemption for Non-Commercial Activity**  
   By exempting:
   - Field gathering equipment use (compressors, heaters, pilot lights),
   - Low-volume wells (<1,000 GJ/year),  
   the regulations protect small-scale or marginal producers and infrastructure operations from taxation, supporting energy exploration and development at the field level.

3. **Shift from Excise to Market-Based Pricing**  
   The transition from high tax rates (e.g., $12.75/m³ for butanes) to zero tax reflects a move toward **market-based pricing** rather than government-imposed excise duties, which may have been intended to encourage investment and reduce costs for end users.

4. **Historical Context**  
   These rates were introduced during a period of significant change in Canada’s energy sector (late 1980s), including:
   - Increased production of natural gas and gas liquids.
   - Growing use of gas in refining and petrochemical industries.
   - Government efforts to modernize tax policy in response to market dynamics.

### **Conclusion**

The *Natural Gas and Gas Liquids Tax Regulations* represent a **historical, phased elimination of excise taxes** on marketable pipeline gas and gas liquids. Key features include:

- **Exemptions** for operational uses (e.g., compressors, heaters, pilot lights) and low-volume wells.
- A **stepwise reduction** of tax rates from 1983 to 1984, culminating in **zero excise tax** for all marketable pipeline gas and gas liquids after **January 31, 1984**.
- A clear **distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities**, protecting small-scale producers and infrastructure.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These regulations are **no longer in force** as of 1984, when the tax was fully eliminated. They are of **historical significance** and may be referenced in legal or policy analyses of Canada’s excise tax evolution during the 1980s.
