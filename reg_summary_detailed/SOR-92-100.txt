### **Detailed Summary of the Igloolik Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Igloolik Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports in Canada. This specific regulation was developed following a formal publication process outlined in **Section 5.5** of the same Act.

- A **proposed version** of the zoning regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of *Canada Gazette Part I* on **March 9 and 16, 1991**,
  - Two successive issues of *Nunatsiaq News* on **July 5 and 12, 1991**.

This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., local communities, landowners, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the Governor General in Council officially **adopted and enacted** the regulations on the recommendation of the Minister, making them legally binding.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Official Title**: *Igloolik Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Igloolik Airport**, including public road allowances.
- The specific boundaries and areas covered are **detailed in Part VI of the schedule**.

#### **3. Key Definitions and Technical Terms**

The regulation defines several key technical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Igloolik Airport, located near Igloolik in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point located on the centerline of runway 149-329, **579.0 meters from the threshold of runway 149**. Its elevation is **46.1 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 149 and 329). It rises at a **1:30 ratio (1 meter vertically for every 30 meters horizontally)** and reaches a horizontal line **2,500 meters from the end of the strip**, at a height of **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**. The outer ends of this line are **295 meters from the centerline**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the elevation of the airport reference point (i.e., 46.1 + 45 = 91.1 meters above sea level)**. However, **if this plane is less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead defined as **9 meters above ground level**. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area associated with runway 149–329. It is **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,278 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising at a **1:7 ratio (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally)**, extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, until it intersects with the outer surface. |

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Core Prohibition)**

This is the **central regulatory provision**:

> **No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on lands covered by these regulations if the highest point of that structure exceeds**:
> - The **approach surface**,
> - The **outer surface**, or
> - The **transitional surface**.

This means:
- All structures (new or existing) must remain **below the defined imaginary surfaces**.
- Even minor additions (e.g., extensions, antennas, or rooftop features) are subject to this restriction.
- The restriction applies **at every point** of the structure — the peak elevation must not exceed any of the three defined surfaces.

This ensures **safe aircraft operations**, particularly during takeoff and landing, by preventing obstructions that could interfere with visibility or flight paths.

---

#### **5. Geographical and Spatial Boundaries**

The regulation defines the **outer limits** of the regulated area using a geometric boundary:

- The **outer boundary** of the regulated lands is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This circular boundary encompasses all lands within 4 kilometers of the ARP, including adjacent residential, agricultural, or infrastructure zones.

This ensures that **all potential sources of obstruction** within a defined radius are governed by the same height restrictions.

---

#### **6. Basis for Design and Planning**

All defined surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) are derived from the **Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731**, dated **June 19, 1989**. This plan serves as the foundational design document for the airport’s layout and safety zones.

- The **approach surfaces** ensure that aircraft approaching the runway have clear visibility and unobstructed paths.
- The **transitional surfaces** connect the runway edges to the outer surface, providing a gradual slope that prevents sudden changes in elevation.
- The **outer surface** defines the maximum allowable height for all structures beyond the runway and approach zones, protecting against visual and navigational hazards.

---

#### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Safety of Aviation Operations**:
   - Preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
   - Ensuring adequate visibility and flight path clearance.

2. **Environmental and Community Protection**:
   - Limiting development near the airport to preserve the integrity of the airspace and surrounding environment.

3. **Legal Clarity and Predictability**:
   - Providing clear, measurable, and publicly accessible boundaries and height limits for land use.

4. **Compliance with National Aviation Standards**:
   - Aligning with Canadian aeronautical zoning practices and international standards for airport safety.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Violations may result in **fines, demolition orders, or other legal remedies**.
- Local authorities or landowners must ensure compliance during development, construction, or modifications to existing structures.

#### **9. Summary Table of Key Parameters**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Airport Location** | Igloolik, Northwest Territories |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | 579.0 m from threshold of runway 149, elevation: 46.1 m ASL |
| **Runway (Strip)** | 1,278 m long, 90 m wide (45 m on each side) |
| **Approach Surface** | 1:30 slope, rises to 83.3 m above end of strip at 2,500 m horizontal distance; outer ends 295 m from centerline |

### **Conclusion**

The **Igloolik Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, safety-focused set of land-use rules designed to protect aviation operations at Igloolik Airport. By establishing precise geometric and elevation-based boundaries, the regulations ensure that all structures within a 4-kilometer radius of the airport remain below critical flight path surfaces. These measures are grounded in established aeronautical principles, supported by public consultation, and legally enacted under the Aeronautics Act. The regulations serve both **operational safety** and **community planning**, balancing development needs with the essential requirements of safe air travel in remote Arctic regions.
