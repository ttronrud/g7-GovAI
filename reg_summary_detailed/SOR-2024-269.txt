### Detailed Summary of the Regulation:

---

#### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is an **Order Declaring that the *Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations* Do Not Apply in Saskatchewan, 2025**, issued under **subsection 10(3)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), as amended.

CEPA 1999 is a federal law designed to prevent pollution and protect the environment by regulating substances that may cause or contribute to harm to human health or the environment. One of its key provisions involves setting standards and requirements for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions — particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂) — from industrial sources, including coal-fired power generation.

Under **subsection 93(1)d** of CEPA 1999, the federal government can make regulations to reduce CO₂ emissions from coal-fired electricity generation. The *Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations* (the "Federal Regulations") were originally introduced to impose emission limits and compliance obligations on electricity producers.

However, in certain provinces, such regulations may not apply if **equivalent or similar provincial laws already exist** that achieve the same environmental objectives. This is the central rationale behind the current Order.

#### **Background and Key Events**

1. **Proposal and Public Comment Period (July 6, 2024):**  
   On July 6, 2024, the **Minister of the Environment** published a proposed Order in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, declaring that the Federal Regulations **do not apply in Saskatchewan**. This was done under subsection **332(1)a** of CEPA 1999, which allows the Minister to propose such an order when equivalent provincial legislation exists.

   - The public was given the opportunity to:
     - File **comments** on the proposed Order, or
     - File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** to assess whether the proposed exemption was justified.

2. **Agreement Between Federal and Provincial Governments (November 29, 2024):**  
   On November 29, 2024, the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Government of Saskatchewan** entered into a formal written agreement titled:  
   *"An agreement on the equivalency of federal and Saskatchewan regulations for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity producers in Saskatchewan, 2025."*

   This agreement establishes that:
   - Saskatchewan has **provisions in force under its own laws** that are **equivalent** to the federal *Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations* (made under subsection 93(1)d of CEPA 1999).
   - Saskatchewan also has **provisions similar to sections 17 to 20 of CEPA** that govern the **investigation of alleged environmental offences** — ensuring that enforcement mechanisms are comparable.

   This agreement is critical because it provides the legal basis for the federal government to conclude that the federal regulations are **not needed** in Saskatchewan due to the existence of effective, comparable provincial regulations.

3. **Notice of Agreement and Public Comment (July 6, 2024):**  
   The Minister also published in *Canada Gazette, Part I* on July 6, 2024, a notice under **subsection 10(4) and (5)** of CEPA 1999, informing the public of the availability of the agreement. This allowed stakeholders to:
   - Submit **comments** on the agreement, or
   - File a **notice of objection** requesting a board of review.

4. **Summary of Public Feedback (November 2, 2024):**  
   On November 2, 2024, the Minister published a notice in *Canada Gazette, Part I* summarizing how all comments and objections received during the public consultation period were reviewed and addressed. This demonstrates transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.

#### **Final Decision and Order**

Based on the above steps — including the public consultation, the formal agreement between federal and provincial authorities, and the review of objections — **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has **formally issued the Order**.

---

#### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Declaration of Non-Application:**  
   > *"The Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations do not apply in Saskatchewan."*  
   This means that electricity generators in Saskatchewan are **not subject to the federal CO₂ emission limits or compliance requirements** contained in the federal regulations.

2. **Termination Condition:**  
   The Order **ceases to have effect** on the day when the **agreement between the federal government and the Government of Saskatchewan terminates** — either voluntarily or under the terms of subsection **10(8)** of CEPA 1999.  
   This ensures that the exemption is temporary and contingent upon the ongoing validity of the provincial-federal equivalency agreement.

3. **Repeal of the Order:**  
   The Order is **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled) upon termination of the agreement. This means that the exemption is not permanent — it is tied directly to the existence of the agreement.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order **comes into force on January 1, 2025**.

#### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Provincial Sovereignty and Regulatory Equivalency:**  
  The Order reflects a principle of **regulatory harmonization** — where provinces with robust, effective environmental laws can operate independently of federal mandates. This supports **federal-provincial cooperation** and avoids regulatory duplication.

- **Environmental Protection Continuity:**  
  Despite the exemption, Saskatchewan’s own laws (e.g., under S.C. 2023, c. 12, s. 55; and SOR/2012-167) are designed to achieve the same environmental outcomes — reducing GHG emissions from power generation. The federal government affirms that these provincial measures are **sufficient and equivalent**.

- **Enforcement and Accountability:**  
  The inclusion of provisions similar to sections 17–20 of CEPA ensures that Saskatchewan maintains **robust enforcement mechanisms** for environmental offences. This protects against potential loopholes or weak oversight.

- **Transparency and Public Participation:**  
  The process followed — including public comment, review of objections, and publication of summaries — upholds democratic accountability and ensures that decisions are well-informed and justifiable.

#### **Conclusion**

This Order is a **legally binding declaration** that the federal *Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations* **do not apply in Saskatchewan** due to the existence of **equivalent and comparable provincial laws**. It is not a relaxation of environmental standards but rather a recognition that Saskatchewan has developed its own effective regulatory regime for managing greenhouse gas emissions from power generation.

The exemption is **conditional**, temporary, and dependent on the ongoing validity of the federal-provincial agreement. It reflects a collaborative approach to environmental governance, ensuring that both federal and provincial jurisdictions meet environmental goals while respecting regional autonomy and regulatory capacity.

The Order is effective **January 1, 2025**, and will expire when the agreement between the federal and Saskatchewan governments ends — either by mutual agreement or under the terms of the legislation.

**Final Note:**  
This regulation underscores the importance of **intergovernmental cooperation** in addressing climate change, particularly in sectors like electricity generation where emissions reduction is critical. It also demonstrates how federal environmental policy can be adapted to regional contexts through equivalency and shared responsibility.
