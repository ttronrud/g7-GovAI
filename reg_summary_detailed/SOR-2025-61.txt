### **Purpose of the General Permit**

This General Permit allows certain financial and related services to be provided or acquired in specific circumstances where such activities would otherwise be prohibited under the *Special Economic Measures (Syria) Regulations*. The key objective is to support **the democratization and stabilization of Syria** and the **delivery of humanitarian assistance** to or within Syria.

The permit is not a blanket exemption. It is strictly limited to activities that serve these two primary goals — democratic reform, stabilization efforts, and humanitarian aid — and only applies when such activities are genuinely aimed at those ends.

### **Permitted Activities and Transactions**

Any person — whether located in Canada or outside Canada — may carry out the following activities or transactions **under this General Permit**, provided they are directed toward the democratization and stabilization of Syria or the delivery of humanitarian assistance:

1. **Provide financial or related services to or for the benefit of an entity listed in the Schedule**  
   - The entities listed in the Schedule are designated financial institutions in Syria.  
   - These services may include banking, lending, payment processing, or other financial intermediation.

2. **Provide or acquire financial or other related services to, from, or for the benefit of, or on the direction or order of:**  
   - **Syria itself** (the Syrian state)  
   - **Any person in Syria** (including individuals, non-governmental organizations, or entities operating within Syria)

> **Note:** The activities must be directly aimed at:  
> - Promoting democratic reforms in Syria  
> - Supporting political or institutional stabilization  
> - Delivering humanitarian aid (e.g., food, medical supplies, shelter, emergency relief)

### **List of Designated Entities in the Schedule**

The following Syrian financial institutions are included in the Schedule and are subject to the permitted activities under this General Permit:

- Commercial Bank of Syria  
- Real Estate Bank  
- Industrial Bank  
- Popular Credit Bank  
- Saving Bank  
- Agricultural Cooperative Bank  
- Central Bank of Syria  

These institutions are recognized as key financial actors in Syria’s economy and are now eligible for financial services under this permit — **provided** the transactions are aligned with the stated objectives of democratization, stabilization, or humanitarian assistance.

### **Duration and Termination**

- **Effective Date:** The permit comes into force on the day it is registered in the Canada Gazette (i.e., February 27, 2025).  
- **Duration:** The permit is valid for **360 days** from the date of coming into force.  
- **Termination:** The permit automatically ceases to have effect on the **360th day after registration** (i.e., August 26, 2025).  

> This time-limited nature reflects Canada’s cautious approach to economic engagement with Syria, ensuring that any exceptions remain subject to review and policy alignment.

### **Legal and Policy Context**

This General Permit operates within the broader framework of Canada’s *Special Economic Measures (Syria) Regulations*, which are designed to:

- Isolate and restrict financial and economic activities of entities associated with the Syrian government, particularly those involved in human rights abuses or undermining democratic processes.  
- Prevent the use of financial systems to support authoritarian regimes or destabilize fragile societies.

However, this permit represents a **targeted exception** — allowing limited engagement with Syrian financial institutions when such engagement serves humanitarian or democratic stabilization goals. It is a mechanism to balance national security and foreign policy objectives with the need to support peace and recovery in Syria.

### **Key Conditions and Limitations**

1. **Intent Requirement:** The activities must be **aimed at democratization or stabilization** or **humanitarian assistance**.  
   - Activities that serve other purposes (e.g., supporting government revenue, commercial trade, or private investment) are not permitted.

2. **No Automatic Authorization:** The permit does not authorize all financial dealings with Syrian entities. It only applies to specific, clearly defined activities that meet the stated objectives.

3. **No Extension:** The permit is not renewable. It expires after 360 days and must be reauthorized if renewed policy goals require continued engagement.

4. **Compliance Obligations:** Persons carrying out these activities remain subject to Canadian anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism laws. They must maintain records and ensure transparency in their transactions.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- This permit enables Canadian financial institutions, foreign investors, and humanitarian organizations to engage more directly with key Syrian financial institutions — **without violating the general prohibitions** under the Special Economic Measures Regulations.  
- It supports international efforts to provide humanitarian aid and to promote democratic reforms in Syria, particularly in the context of ongoing conflict and political instability.  
- It reflects a shift toward **targeted, outcome-based engagement** rather than broad economic isolation — a more nuanced approach to foreign policy in complex conflict zones.

### **Conclusion**

The General Permit issued on February 27, 2025, is a carefully crafted regulatory tool that allows limited, purpose-driven financial transactions with designated Syrian financial institutions. It enables Canada to support humanitarian relief and democratic development in Syria while maintaining strict compliance with its economic sanctions regime. The permit is temporary (valid until August 26, 2025), and its scope is strictly limited to activities that serve stabilization or humanitarian goals — reinforcing Canada’s commitment to both human rights and international peace.

> **Final Note:** This permit does not override other sanctions or restrictions. It only applies in specific, narrowly defined circumstances and remains subject to review by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance.
