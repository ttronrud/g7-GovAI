**Detailed Summary of the United Kingdom Trade Continuity Remission Order, 2021**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *United Kingdom Trade Continuity Remission Order, 2021* is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This action is authorized under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)), which provides the legal framework for granting remissions of customs duties in specific circumstances related to trade disruptions, particularly those arising from the UK's departure from the European Union.

This Order is also referenced in **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which establishes general provisions for customs duty remissions and related administrative mechanisms.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **provide a remedy for Canadian importers who paid or would have paid higher customs duties on goods imported from the United Kingdom (UK) after January 1, 2021**, due to the UK’s exit from the European Union (EU) and the subsequent loss of the benefits previously enjoyed under the **Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)** between Canada and the EU.

Specifically, the Order aims to **offset the increased customs duties** that arose because the UK ceased to be a party to CETA after December 31, 2020. This ensures that Canadian businesses are not unfairly burdened by the transition costs caused by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU trade framework.

### **3. Key Definitions**

- **Agreement**:  
  Refers to the *Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)* between Canada and the European Union and its Member States, signed in Brussels on **October 30, 2016**. This agreement previously provided preferential tariff treatment for goods traded between Canada and EU countries, including the UK while it was part of the EU.

- **Goods**:  
  Means goods that **would have been eligible for the lower duty rate under CETA** had the Agreement continued to apply to the UK after December 31, 2020. In other words, these are goods that, under the original agreement, would have been subject to reduced or zero customs duties.

- **United Kingdom**:  
  Defined to include:
  - The **Channel Islands**
  - **Gibraltar**
  - The **Isle of Man**  
  *Excludes*:
  - Anguilla  
  - British Antarctic Territory  
  - British Indian Ocean Territory  
  - Bermuda  
  - British Virgin Islands  
  - Cayman Islands  
  - Falkland Islands  
  - Montserrat  
  - Pitcairn  
  - Saint Helena and Dependencies (Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha)  
  - South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands  
  - Turks and Caicos Islands  

  This definition clarifies the geographical scope of the Order — it applies only to trade with the UK as a whole, not with its overseas territories.

### **4. Scope of the Remission**

A **customs duty remission** is granted for goods imported from the UK during the following period:

> **From January 1, 2021, until the day the Trade Continuity Agreement between Canada and the UK comes into force.**

The remission amount equals the **difference between two duty amounts**:

1. **The customs duty paid or payable at the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) rate** under the Canadian Customs Tariff and the regulations governing it.  
   → This represents the duty that was actually paid or would have been paid under standard international trade rules (i.e., non-preferential treatment).

2. **The customs duty that would have been payable under the CETA rate** if the goods had qualified for that preferential rate under the Agreement.  
   → This is the lower rate that existed under CETA, which was available to goods traded between Canada and the UK during the period when the UK was part of the EU.

**Therefore, the remission compensates Canadian importers for the "gap" in duty cost** caused by the UK’s exit from CETA — effectively refunding the difference between the higher MFN duty and the lower CETA duty.

### **5. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To be eligible for the remission, a claimant must:

- Have imported the goods from the UK during the specified period (January 1, 2021, to the date the Trade Continuity Agreement comes into force).  
- Submit a **claim to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (MPSEP) **within two years of the date of importation**.

> **Note**: Although the Minister of Finance is involved in the initial recommendation, the actual claims are processed by the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, reflecting the department’s role in managing customs-related financial claims and remissions.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on January 1, 2021** — the start of the period during which the remission is available.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Significance**

- **Economic Protection**: The Order provides **financial relief** to Canadian businesses that faced increased costs due to the UK’s departure from the EU and the loss of CETA benefits.
- **Trade Continuity**: It serves as a transitional mechanism to ensure that trade between Canada and the UK remains stable and predictable, even in the absence of a full trade agreement.
- **Preventive Measure**: By allowing duty remission, the government acknowledges that the UK’s exit from the EU created unintended trade disruptions and seeks to mitigate their economic impact.
- **Limited Duration**: The remission is only available until the **Trade Continuity Agreement between Canada and the UK** is formally implemented and comes into force — meaning the benefit is temporary and tied to the establishment of a new bilateral trade framework.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

The *United Kingdom Trade Continuity Remission Order, 2021* is a targeted and pragmatic regulatory measure designed to:

- **Offset increased customs duties** on UK-origin goods due to the UK’s exit from the EU and the termination of CETA benefits;
- **Support Canadian importers** by providing a financial remedy;
- **Ensure fairness and continuity** in trade relations between Canada and the UK during a period of transition.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to maintaining stable and equitable trade relationships with key international partners, even in the face of geopolitical and economic shifts.

**Note**: This Order is not a permanent trade agreement. It is a **temporary, transitional remedy** that will be superseded once the formal *Trade Continuity Agreement between Canada and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* is signed and implemented.
