**Detailed Summary of the *Liquefied Petroleum Gases Bulk Storage Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Scope**
The *Liquefied Petroleum Gases Bulk Storage Regulations* (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations") establish comprehensive safety, design, construction, and operational standards for **stationary bulk storage facilities** of liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) located on railway right-of-way or leased land under the jurisdiction of a regulatory commission.

These regulations apply to:
- **New installations** and **additions or modifications** to existing ones.
- Installations on **railway-owned or leased property**.
- Facilities that store LPG in bulk (i.e., large-volume tanks), **excluding small cylinders**.

> ⚠️ **Exemption**: Installations with a total water capacity of **2,000 Imperial gallons or less** (measured at 60°F) are exempt from certain provisions—provided they otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Design Pressure** | Synonymous with *Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP)* as defined in the **ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Unfired Pressure Vessels)**. |
| **Filling Density** | Percentage of the maximum allowable liquid weight divided by the water capacity of the tank (at 60°F), multiplied by 100. Limits are based on fire safety standards (e.g., NFPA 58). |
| **Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPGs)** | Gases derived from petroleum or natural gas that are liquid under pressure. Common types: propane, butane, propylene, isobutane, butylenes. |
| **Main Track** | A track operated by timetable, train order, or block signaling; used for regular train operations. |
| **Owning/Operating Company** | The entity owning or operating the facility, which applies for Commission approval on behalf of itself. |
| **Private Track** | Tracks not owned by the carrier, either through lease or written agreement; treated as equivalent to ownership. |
| **Team Track** | A track used by multiple companies or entities for loading/unloading purposes. |
| **Shall** | Mandatory requirement (must be followed). |
| **Should** | Recommended guidance (not legally binding). |

### **3. Regulatory Requirements for Construction and Approval**

#### **3.1. Pre-Construction Approval Required**
- No construction of LPG storage facilities may begin without **prior written approval from the Commission**.
- Approval is obtained via an application submitted to the **Secretary of the Commission**.

#### **3.2. Required Documentation**
Applications must include **four copies of detailed plans and profiles**, complying with sections 8–13. Key requirements:

##### **Plan Requirements:**
- Scale:  
  - Plan: **Not less than 50 feet to 1 inch**  
  - Profile: **Not less than 20 feet to 1 inch**
- Must be dated, bear an identification number, and include the applicant’s name.
- Must show distances from:
  - Loading/unloading rack or point to:
    - Nearest rail (gauge side) of loading/unloading track
    - Schools, hospitals, residential areas, public assembly places within **250 ft**
    - Engine houses, railway shops, grain elevators, etc., within **150 ft**
  - Centre line of loading/unloading track to:
    - Nearest rail of main track
    - Nearest rail of adjacent non-serving track
  - Location of:
    - All tanks, pumphouses, warehouses, structures
    - Property boundaries
    - Adjacent tracks, roads, pipelines, sewers, ditches, watercourses
    - Right-of-way and fences

##### **Profile Requirements:**
- Shows elevation of installation relative to loading/unloading track and main track within **200 ft** of nearest tank.
- A **second profile** is required if:
  - Drainage direction needs to be shown
  - Major site features require clarity

##### **Notes/Legend Must Include:**
1. **Written confirmation** from the **Provincial Fire Marshal or local authority** that they have no objection to the installation.
2. **Statement** that tank design has been approved by the **Pressure Vessel Inspection Branch (PVIB)** of the provincial government before fabrication.
3. Size, contents, and water capacity (in Imperial gallons) of all tanks.
4. Type and construction of buildings (pumphouse, warehouse, vapourizer house, etc.).
5. Type of motive power (e.g., diesel engine) for pumps/compressors.
6. Type of heating used for vapourizers.
7. Whether the serving tracks are **team tracks** or **private tracks**.

#### **Recordkeeping**
- After Commission approval, the railway company must **retain copies of all drawings**:
  - For the **entire life** of the facility
  - For **at least two years after decommissioning**

### **4. Minimum Distances and Spatial Requirements**

All distances are measured from the **gauge side of the nearest rail** (main track or adjacent track), unless otherwise specified.

| Feature | Minimum Distance |
|--------|------------------|
| **Loading/Unloading Track to Main Track** | **50 feet** |
| **Loading/Unloading Track to Adjacent Non-Serving Track** | **20 feet** (50 feet if adjacent track is a main track) |
| **Overhead Structures >4 ft above rail** | **6 feet** from gauge side |
| **Overhead Structures ≤4 ft above rail** | **3 feet 7¼ inches** (3 feet 10 inches in Newfoundland) |
| **Curved tracks** | Add **1 inch per degree of curvature** to clearance |
| **Loading/Unloading Terminal (height <4 ft)** | **6 feet** from gauge side |
| **Loading/Unloading Rack to Public Assembly (station, office, etc.)** | **200 feet** |
| **Rack to Schools, Hospitals, Residential Areas** | **Recommended: 200 feet** |
| **Rack to Engine Houses, Railway Shops, Grain Elevators** | **100 feet** (unless exempt) |
| **Rack to Company-Exclusive Buildings** | **10 feet** |
| **Storage Tank to Nearest Rail (any track)** | **20 feet** (from nearest point on tank shell) |
| **Tank to Main Track (gauge side)** | As per specific subsections below |

#### **Distances from Tanks to Other Structures**

| Scenario | Minimum Distance |
|--------|------------------|
| **Tank to Highway Right-of-Way** | **Half the distance** prescribed in subsection (2) (i.e., half of 50 ft = 25 ft) |
| **Tank >2,000 gal capacity to other property (buildable)** | **50 feet** |
| **Tank ≤2,000 gal capacity to other property** | As per **NFPA 58** (current edition) |
| **Tank >2,000 gal to public assembly (station, office)** | **400 feet** |
| **Tank >2,000 gal to schools, hospitals, theatres, residential areas** | **Recommended: 400 feet** |
| **Tank ≤2,000 gal to public assembly** | As per **NFPA 58** |
| **Tank >2,000 gal to engine houses, shops, grain elevators** | **200 feet** |
| **Tank ≤2,000 gal to such buildings** | As per **NFPA 58** |
| **Tank >100 gal to company-exclusive buildings** | **10 feet** |
| **Tank ≤100 gal to building opening at same level or below** | **5 feet** |

| **Tanks of different groups (per Section 22)** | **25 feet** apart |

> ✅ **Exception**: Where physical distances cannot be achieved due to terrain or site constraints, the Commission may approve **lesser distances** if:
> - Suitable **fire barrier walls** are installed
> - Effective **fire control systems** (e.g., sprinklers, detection) are in place
