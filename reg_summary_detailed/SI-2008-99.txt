**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Certain Marine Carriers Remission Order"**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** and the **Treasury Board**. This decision is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the government to make remission orders—i.e., the waiver or cancellation of certain fees—when it is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

This specific order is found in:
- **Statutory Citation:** S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)
- **Relevant Statute:** R.S., c. F-11 (the *Oceans Act*)

**Purpose of the Order:**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **remit (waive) fees** that marine carriers (shipping companies) were required to pay to the **Canadian Coast Guard** for marine navigation services. These fees are established under **subsection 47(1) of the Oceans Act**, which mandates the collection of fees for specific services provided by the Canadian Coast Guard.

The remission applies specifically to the **years 2008, 2009, and 2010**, reflecting a temporary, time-limited relief measure.

**Scope of the Remission:**

1. **Fees in Question:**
   - The fees are those **fixed under subsection 47(1) of the Oceans Act**.
   - These are fees for **marine navigation services** provided by the Canadian Coast Guard.

2. **Applicable Entities:**
   - The remission applies to **marine carriers** (i.e., shipping companies operating vessels).

3. **Geographic Scope:**
   - The fees are waived for ships operating **between two locations**:
     - One located **north of 60° North latitude**
     - The other located **south of 60° North latitude**
   - This means the service area spans across the **Arctic and sub-Arctic regions**, covering both northern and southern parts of Canada’s maritime domain.

4. **Time Period:**
   - The remission covers the **fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010**.
   - This is a **three-year period**, indicating a deliberate and targeted intervention during a specific timeframe.

**Public Interest Justification:**

The Governor General in Council determined that it is **in the public interest** to grant this remission. While the specific public interest rationale is not fully detailed in the text, such decisions are typically made to:
- Support **economic activity** in remote or challenging maritime regions (e.g., Arctic shipping).
- Encourage **maritime safety and environmental protection** by reducing financial barriers for carriers operating in high-risk or high-cost areas.
- Promote **national economic development** through enhanced access to and use of Canada’s northern waters.
- Align with broader government policies on **Arctic development**, **climate change adaptation**, or **resource exploration** in northern waters.

---

**Key Implications:**

- **Financial Relief for Carriers:** Marine carriers operating in the specified geographic area and time frame are **not required to pay** the prescribed navigation fees for those years.
- **No Impact on Future Fees:** The remission is **limited to 2008–2010**. Fees for other years or for operations outside the specified geographic boundaries remain subject to the original Oceans Act provisions.
- **No Change to Service Delivery:** The Canadian Coast Guard continues to provide the navigation services; the remission only affects the **fee structure**, not the services themselves.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** The regulation streamlines compliance by clearly defining who is exempt and when, reducing administrative burden for both carriers and government agencies.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a targeted, temporary financial relief measure designed to support maritime operations in Canada’s northern waters during a specific period. By waiving navigation fees for marine carriers operating between latitudes north and south of 60°N from 2008 to 2010, the government aimed to foster economic activity, enhance maritime safety, and promote development in Canada’s Arctic and sub-Arctic regions—all in the public interest.

It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and strategic policy goals related to Canada’s maritime sovereignty and economic growth in remote areas.
