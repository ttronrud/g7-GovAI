**Detailed Summary of the CETA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **CETA Tariff Preference Regulations** are issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)). This provision grants the government the authority to establish specific tariff preferences under the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).

These regulations are a key implementation mechanism of CETA, which aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs on goods traded between Canada and EU member states (and other CETA beneficiary countries), provided those goods meet certain origin requirements.

### **2. Definition of "Originating" Products**

In these regulations, the term **"originating"** refers to goods that qualify as **originating in the territory of a Party (Canada or an EU country)** under the **rules of origin** established in the **Protocol on Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures of the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement**.

- This means that for a product to be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under CETA, it must meet the specific origin criteria defined in the Protocol — such as the value of locally produced inputs, the degree of transformation, or the percentage of value added in the exporting country.
- Only goods that are **originating** are entitled to the reduced or zero tariffs under the CETA tariff schedule.

### **3. Conditions for Tariff Preference under Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the *Customs Tariff*, products exported from an **EU country or other CETA beneficiary** are entitled to the benefit of the Canada–European Union Tariff if they meet **one of the following two conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipment to Canada (No Third Country Involvement)**

If the product is shipped directly from an EU country or other CETA beneficiary to Canada **without passing through another country**, then the importer is entitled to preferential tariff treatment **if**:

- The shipment is conducted via a **through bill of lading**, or  
- The shipment is **not** via a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, **upon request by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Clearly shows the **shipping route**;
  - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada.

> This requirement ensures transparency and traceability of the product’s journey, even when a through bill of lading is not used.

#### **Condition 2: Shipment Through a Third Country**

If the product is shipped **to Canada through another country (a third country)**, the importer must provide, upon request by a customs officer:

1. **Documentary evidence** showing:
   - The **complete shipping route**;
   - All **points of shipment and transhipment** before entry into Canada.

2. A **copy of the customs control documents** that demonstrate the product **remained under customs control** throughout its stay in the third country.

> The requirement that goods remain under customs control is critical. It ensures that the product did not undergo any unauthorized processing or de-origination in the third country — which could jeopardize its status as originating.

### **4. Effective Date and Registration Timeline**

The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 97 of the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 6 of the Statutes of Canada, 2017) comes into force.

- **However**, if the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the regulations are aligned with the broader implementation timeline of CETA and allows for administrative flexibility during the registration process.

---

### **5. Reference to Existing Legal Framework**

- The regulations are referenced as being in force on **September 21, 2017**, under **SI/2017-47** (Statutory Instrument 2017-47).
- This indicates that the regulations were formally published and became effective on that date, marking a key milestone in Canada’s full implementation of CETA.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Promotes Trade**: Enables Canadian importers to benefit from reduced or eliminated tariffs on eligible goods originating in EU countries or other CETA partners.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Requires detailed documentation to verify the origin and movement of goods, preventing fraud or misuse of preferential treatment.
- **Protects Originating Status**: Prevents goods from being "de-origined" in third countries by requiring proof of customs control during transit.
- **Supports Trade Transparency**: Mandates clear records of shipping routes and transshipments, enhancing accountability and auditability.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **CETA Tariff Preference Regulations** establish clear, enforceable rules for when Canadian importers can claim preferential tariff treatment for goods originating in EU or other CETA beneficiary countries. By defining the conditions for direct and indirect shipments, and requiring verifiable documentation, the regulations ensure that only genuinely originating products benefit from CETA’s tariff reductions. These rules are essential for maintaining the integrity of the agreement and supporting fair, transparent, and efficient trade between Canada and the European Union.
