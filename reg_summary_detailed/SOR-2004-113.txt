**Detailed Summary of the Introduced Forest Pest Compensation Regulations**  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1990, c. 22 (as amended and in force as of the date of registration)*  
*Made under paragraph 47(q) of the Plant Protection Act*

---

### **Overview**

The *Introduced Forest Pest Compensation Regulations* establish a framework for providing financial compensation to individuals who lost host trees due to the disposal of trees affected by or at risk of infestation by the **Asian Long-horned Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis)**. These regulations were introduced in response to the ecological and economic threat posed by this invasive species, which can severely damage or kill trees in urban, rural, and forested areas.

The compensation program applies specifically to host trees — those belonging to certain genera that are vulnerable to the beetle — that were disposed of between **April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019**, as a result of inspections or official notices issued under the *Plant Protection Regulations*.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Host Tree**:  
  Any tree of the following genera:  
  *Acer (maple), Aesculus (horse chestnut), Albizia (acacia), Betula (birch), Celtis (hackberry), Cercidiphyllum (katsura), Koelreuteria (Chinese flame tree), Platanus (plane tree), Populus (poplar), Salix (willow), Sorbus (rowan), or Ulmus (elm)*.  
  A host tree is considered infested if the Asian Long-horned Beetle is present in it. It also includes trees that *could have been* infested or that posed a biological obstacle to beetle control.

- **Infested**:  
  Means the Asian Long-horned Beetle is currently present in the tree.

- **Person**:  
  Refers to an individual or entity that:
  - Owned, had possession, care, or control of a host tree at the time of disposal; **or**
  - Is named in a notice issued by an inspector under the *Plant Protection Regulations* during the specified period.

### **Eligibility for Compensation**

A person may be eligible for compensation **only if** they meet **all** of the following conditions:

1. **Loss of Host Trees**:  
   The person lost one or more host trees from their property as a result of disposal (e.g., removal due to infestation or risk of infestation).

2. **Replacement Planting**:  
   The person planted one or more trees on the **same property** to replace the lost host trees.

3. **Timely Application**:  
   The application for compensation must be submitted to the Minister **on or before December 31, 2020**.

> *Note: This deadline was set to ensure timely processing and closure of the program, which was tied to the original disposal period (2013–2019).*

---

### **Exclusions from Compensation**

Compensation will **not** be paid in the following cases:

1. **Trees Planted in Areas Where Host Trees Were Previously Destroyed**  
   If a replacement tree is planted in a location where host trees were already destroyed due to infestation or potential infestation (i.e., the area was already declared a high-risk zone), compensation is excluded.

2. **Certain Land Uses (Where Disposal Occurred)**  
   Compensation is **not payable** for host trees disposed of on:
   - Natural or wild areas (excluding land used for woodlots, parks, sportsfields, recreation trails, golf courses, educational institutions, or hospitals);
   - Drainage ditches;
   - Utility or railway right-of-ways.

> These exclusions reflect the government’s intent to prioritize compensation for property owners with direct, residential, or developed land use, rather than public or ecologically sensitive areas.

---

### **Compensation Rates (by Location Type)**

The amount of compensation depends on the **location** of the original host tree and the **type of land use**:

| Location Type | Compensation Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Residential, commercial, industrial, or educational/hospital zones** (not in excluded areas) | **$300 per host tree** | Applies to urban or developed land. |
| **Public land** (e.g., parks, sportsfields, recreation trails, similar recreational areas) | **$150 per host tree** | Applies to public or community spaces. |
| **Woodlots** in areas zoned for **commercial/industrial** or **agricultural use** (livestock/vegetation-based) | **$40 per host tree** | Lower rate due to lower value or land use. |

> The rates are **caps** — no compensation exceeds the stated maximum per tree.

---

### **Application Requirements**

To qualify, applicants must complete a form provided by the Minister and include the following:

1. **Personal Information**:  
   - Full name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address (if available).

2. **Corporate Applicants**:  
   - Names, addresses, and phone numbers of all directors.

3. **Statement of Replacement Costs**:  
   - A detailed statement of how much the applicant spent to replace the lost trees (e.g., purchase price of replacement trees).

4. **Original Locations of Lost Trees**:  
   - Precise locations where the host trees were located before disposal.

5. **Documents Related to Disposition**:  
   - Copies of all notices, inspection reports, or other official documentation received by the applicant regarding the disposal of the trees.

6. **Evidence of Replacement Planting**:  
   - **Receipts** or **solemn declarations** proving:
     - The number of replacement trees purchased;
     - The number of trees actually planted;
     - The locations where the replacement trees were planted.

> This ensures transparency and verifies that the compensation is tied to actual loss and replacement efforts.

### **Amendments and Late Submissions**

- **Amendments**:  
  Applications may be amended **at any time** before the December 31, 2020, deadline.

- **Late Submissions (Exceptional Circumstances)**:  
  An application may be submitted **after December 31, 2020**, **only if**:
  1. The applicant faced **exceptional circumstances beyond their control** (e.g., natural disaster, illness, legal issues, or other unforeseen events); and  
  2. The application is submitted **within 14 days** after the circumstances cease.

> This provision provides limited flexibility for hardship cases, ensuring fairness without undermining the overall timeline.

---

### **Obligations of the Recipient**

- The recipient must **maintain books and records** (e.g., receipts, planting logs, invoices) for **at least three years** after the date the replacement trees are planted.

> This requirement supports auditability and accountability in the compensation process.

---

### **Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the **date of registration** with the Statutory Instruments Register.

> *Note: The regulation was repealed in part by SOR/2016-71, s. 3 — however, the compensation provisions remain in effect as a standalone rule, likely due to their specific and limited scope.*

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Mitigate Economic Impact**:  
   To support property owners who suffered financial loss due to the removal of valuable trees under public health and safety measures.

2. **Promote Tree Replacement**:  
   To encourage reforestation and landscape restoration on affected properties, maintaining green space and ecological balance.

3. **Support Pest Management Efforts**:  
   To align with broader plant protection strategies by removing infested or at-risk trees and preventing the spread of the Asian Long-horned Beetle.

4. **Ensure Fairness and Accountability**:  
   Through clear eligibility criteria, defined compensation tiers, and rigorous documentation requirements, the program balances fairness with administrative feasibility.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Introduced Forest Pest Compensation Regulations* provide a structured, equitable, and transparent mechanism for compensating individuals who lost host trees due to the Asian Long-horned Beetle threat between 2013 and 2019. By setting clear eligibility, exclusion, and compensation thresholds, the regulations ensure that support is targeted to those most affected while maintaining public accountability and environmental safeguards.

While the program has a defined end date (December 31, 2020), it remains a significant policy tool in the long-term management of invasive species and the protection of Canada’s urban and rural tree canopy.
