### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis Agreement on Social Security (1992)**

This regulation is a **Proclamation issued by the Government of Canada** on **January 7, 1994**, formalizing the entry into force of the **Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis**, signed on **August 17, 1992**, in Ottawa. The agreement establishes reciprocal social security rights and obligations between the two parties, enabling citizens, residents, and dependants of either country to access pension, disability, survivor, and funeral benefits under the other’s system under specific conditions.

---

## **I. Background and Legal Framework**

### **1. Proclamation Authority**
- The proclamation is issued under **Order in Council P.C. 1993-2123**, dated December 15, 1993.
- It follows the **Old Age Security Act (OASA)**, specifically **subsection 42(2)**, which governs when an Order in Council becomes effective.
- The Order in Council was laid before Parliament on **February 23, 1993**.
- No motion to revoke it was filed within 20 sitting days.
- Therefore, it came into force on the **30th sitting day after laying**, which was **April 21, 1993**.
- Instruments of ratification were exchanged on **September 30, 1993**.
- The agreement entered into force in Canada on **January 1, 1994**, as required by **Article XXIII** of the original agreement (the first day of the fourth month following the exchange of ratifications).

> **Key Point**: The agreement is not immediately effective upon signing. It requires formal ratification and a defined timeline before becoming legally binding in Canada.

## **II. Scope of the Agreement**

The Agreement applies to specific social security legislation in both countries:

### **Canada:**
- **Old Age Security Act (OASA)** and its regulations
- **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** and its regulations

### **St. Kitts and Nevis:**
- **Social Security Act #13 of 1977** and its subsidiary legislation, specifically covering:
  - Age (contributory) pension
  - Invalidity (disability) pension
  - Survivor’s pension
  - Funeral grant

> **Note**: The agreement applies to all aspects of St. Kitts and Nevis’ social security laws as referenced in Article II, paragraph 1(b), unless otherwise restricted.

## **III. Key Principles and Obligations**

### **1. Reciprocal Eligibility for Benefits**
- Any person who has been subject to the social security legislation of either country, or who is a dependent or survivor of such a person, is entitled to receive benefits from the other country under the **same conditions as a citizen of that country**.
- This includes:
  - Age pensions
  - Disability pensions
  - Survivor benefits
  - Funeral grants

> **Core Principle**: Reciprocity — if you are covered under one country’s system, you can access benefits from the other, provided you meet eligibility criteria.

---

### **2. No Reduction or Suspension of Benefits Due to Residency**
- Benefits are **not reduced, suspended, or canceled** solely because a beneficiary resides in the territory of the other country.
- Benefits are **paid in the territory of the other country** where the person resides.

> **Exception**: Benefits are paid in a **third state** if the person is subject to the legislation of both Canada and St. Kitts and Nevis (e.g., a dual-resident or dual-eligible individual).

---

### **3. Work-Based Residency and Jurisdiction Rules**

| Scenario | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Employed person working in a Party’s territory** | Subject only to that Party’s legislation (e.g., working in Canada → subject to Canada’s rules) |
| **Self-employed person working in the other Party’s territory** | Subject only to the legislation of the Party where they **ordinarily reside** |
| **Employee performing services abroad for the same employer** | Subject only to the legislation of the **first Party** (where employment began), unless the assignment exceeds 60 months without mutual consent |
| **Seafarers (crew members)** | Subject only to Canada if they **ordinarily reside in Canada**; otherwise, subject to St. Kitts and Nevis |
| **Government employees working abroad** | Subject only to the legislation of the **host country** if they are a citizen or reside there; otherwise, may elect to be covered by the home country |

> **Note**: These rules prevent "double coverage" and ensure clear jurisdictional boundaries.

### **4. Creditable Periods and Totalization of Contributions**

This is a critical mechanism for individuals who have worked or lived in both countries.

#### **A. Creditable Periods**
- A "creditable period" is a period of:
  - Contributions (paid or credited)
  - Residence used to qualify for a benefit
- For **Canada**, includes periods during which a disability pension is payable under the CPP.

#### **B. Totalization of Periods**
- If a person does **not meet minimum contribution requirements** in one country, the total number of creditable periods (from both countries) may be combined to determine eligibility.
- The totalization applies only if the person is not entitled to a benefit solely based on contributions in one country.

##### **Specific Rules for Periods:**

| Situation | How Periods Are Counted |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Residence in St. Kitts and Nevis** | A period of residence in St. Kitts and Nevis (after age eligibility and post-February 1978) counts as a period of residence in **Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (if not covered by employment in St. Kitts). |
| **Residence in Canada** | A period of residence in Canada **does not** count toward Canada’s residence requirement if the person is covered by St. Kitts and Nevis due to employment. |
| **Self-employed person in Canada** | Period of presence and employment in Canada counts as residence in Canada **only for purposes of this Agreement**. |
| **CPP Contributions in St. Kitts and Nevis** | A calendar year with at least **13 weeks (3 months)** of contributions in St. Kitts and Nevis counts as **one year of CPP contributions**. |
| **1978 Calendar Year** | Counted as **47 weeks** of contributions in St. Kitts and Nevis. |
| **Years after February 1, 1978** | Counted as **52 contribution weeks**. |
| **Weeks under OASA (not CPP)** | Weeks of OASA contributions (post-1978) not part of CPP are counted as **one contribution week** in St. Kitts and Nevis. |

> **Purpose**: Allows individuals with interrupted or partial work histories to build up sufficient contribution history across borders.

### **5. Determining Benefit Amounts**

#### **A. Old Age Security (OAS) Pension**
- If a person is entitled to OAS **only through totalization**, the amount is calculated based on:
  - **Partial pension or spouse’s allowance rules** under the OASA
  - **Only the periods of residence in Canada** are considered (not totalized periods)
- OAS is **only paid outside Canada** if totalized residence meets the **minimum Canadian residence requirement**.
- Spouse’s allowance and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) are paid **only to the extent permitted by OASA**.

#### **B. CPP Pension (Earnings-Related Portion)**
- The earnings-related portion is calculated **exclusively on pensionable earnings under the CPP**.
- The flat-rate portion is calculated using a **fraction**:
  $$
  \text{Flat-rate portion} = (\text{CPP flat-rate}) \times \left( \frac{\text{CPP contributions}}{\text{minimum qualifying period}} \right)
  $$
  - The fraction **cannot exceed 1** (i.e., no more than 100% of the flat-rate).

#### **C. Invalidity or Age Pension in St. Kitts and Nevis**
- If a person would qualify via totalization, the **Canadian creditable periods** are counted **only to the extent needed** to meet the minimum requirement.
- The **average annual wage** used in calculating the pension is based **only on wages earned under St. Kitts and Nevis legislation**.

#### **D. Pension Amount Based on Totalization**
- The final pension amount is determined by the **ratio** of:
  $$
  \frac{\text{Contributions under St. Kitts and Nevis}}{\text{Minimum required contributions under St. Kitts and Nevis}}
  $$
- This ratio determines the percentage of the full pension payable.

#### **E. Deduction of Previous Grants**
- If a person previously received a **non-pension grant** (e.g., funeral grant) before the agreement took effect, and later qualifies for a pension under totalization, the **amount of the grant is deducted** from the pension.

### **6. Exemptions and Administrative Provisions**

#### **A. Tax and Fee Exemptions**
- Any tax, legal dues, consular fees, or administrative charges waived for certificates or documents under one country’s legislation are **extended** to the other country.

#### **B. Document Authentication**
- Official documents required under
