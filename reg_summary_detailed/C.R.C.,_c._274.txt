**Detailed Summary of the *Saskatchewan Hog Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Saskatchewan Hog Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and serves to establish the framework for a service charge applied specifically to the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs in Saskatchewan.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the regulation defines several key terms:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972* of Saskatchewan (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal authority for the establishment and operation of the hog marketing system, including the Commission and its regulatory powers.

- **Assembly Yard**: A designated premises where producers deliver their hogs for temporary holding, grouping, or processing prior to slaughter. These are central to the logistics of hog marketing.

- **Assembly Yard Operator**: The individual or entity (owner or operator) responsible for managing an assembly yard.

- **Commission**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission*, established under the Act and the accompanying *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*. The Commission is the governing body that collects and administers the service charge.

- **Hog**: Any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) that is produced in Saskatchewan. This includes all age and gender categories, except those explicitly excluded.

- **Plan**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. It outlines the rules, objectives, and strategies for hog marketing, including pricing, distribution, and service charges.

- **Processor**: Any individual or business engaged in the processing of hogs (e.g., butchering, rendering) or using hogs as raw materials in manufacturing.

- **Producer**: Broadly defined and includes:
  - Individuals or businesses involved in producing or feeding hogs and making them available for slaughter;
  - Employers of such persons;
  - Persons entitled to a share of hogs under lease or agreement;
  - Persons who take possession of hogs as security for a debt.

- **Small Processor**: A processor that, in the prior calendar year, processed **less than 2% of all hogs slaughtered in Saskatchewan**, based on official reports from the *Department of Agriculture of Canada*. This threshold defines eligibility for specific service charge obligations.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **only** to:
- The **marketing of hogs** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada);
- Persons and property **located within the Province of Saskatchewan**.

> **Important Note**: The regulations do **not** apply to transactions involving hogs for personal consumption, certain types of breeding stock, or sales to specific research entities.

---

### **4. Service Charge Obligations**

A **service charge of $0.50 per hog** is payable to the Commission by every producer who markets a hog for slaughter, **provided the hog is part of interprovincial or export trade**.

#### **How the Charge is Collected and Remitted**:

- **General Rule (Producer to Commission)**:
  - The service charge must be **deducted from the amount payable to the producer** by the Commission.
  - This ensures that producers bear the cost directly when they receive payment from the Commission.

- **Small Processors (Direct Purchases)**:
  - If a **small processor** purchases hogs **directly from a producer**, the service charge must be:
    1. **Deducted from the payment** made to the producer;
    2. **Remitted monthly** to the Commission.

- **Assembly Yard Operators (Auction of Sows)**:
  - When an assembly yard operator conducts an **auction of sows**, the service charge for those sows must be:
    1. **Deducted from the proceeds paid to the producer**;
    2. **Remitted monthly** to the Commission.

> This ensures that even indirect marketing channels (like auctions) contribute to the service charge system.

---

### **5. Exemptions**

The service charge **does not apply** to producers who meet **any of the following conditions**:

1. **Hold a Dispensation Certificate**:
   - Producers who have obtained a formal dispensation (exemption) under **Section 8** of the *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations* are exempt.

2. **Slaughter Hogs for Personal Consumption**:
   - Hogs slaughtered solely for the producer’s own use are not subject to the service charge.

3. **Sell Hogs to Consumers for Consumption**:
   - Sales to end consumers (for personal eating) are exempt.

4. **Sell Hogs to Commission-Designated Research Processors**:
   - Hogs sold to a processor specifically designated by the Commission to collect **research data** are exempt.

5. **Marketing Specific Classes of Hogs**:
   - The service charge does **not apply** to the following classes of hogs:
     - **Breeding stock** (e.g., sows, boars used for reproduction);
     - **Weanling pigs** (young pigs 3–6 weeks old);
     - **Feeder pigs** (pigs raised for growth before slaughter);
     - **Boars** (male pigs used for breeding).

> These exemptions protect specific segments of the hog industry that are not intended for commercial marketing or resale, preserving flexibility in breeding and early-stage pig production.

### **6. Purpose and Policy Implications**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:
- Generate a **revenue stream** for the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission to support the administration and development of the hog marketing system;
- Ensure **fair and equitable funding** for marketing activities, including research, market information, and trade promotion;
- Encourage transparency and accountability in interprovincial and export hog transactions;
- Maintain a **clear distinction** between commercial marketing and private or research-related transactions.

---

### **7. Key Features and Observations**

- **Equity and Fairness**: The $0.50 per hog charge is a small, standardized fee that is collected at the point of sale, ensuring all producers involved in interprovincial/export trade contribute equally.

- **Exemptions Reflect Industry Needs**: The exemptions for breeding stock, weanlings, feeders, and personal consumption recognize that not all hogs are marketed for profit or resale and that certain operations (e.g., breeding farms) may not be directly involved in commercial trade.

- **Small Processor Inclusion**: The regulation specifically addresses small processors, who may have limited resources, by requiring them to remit the charge monthly and deduct it at the point of purchase — promoting compliance without imposing disproportionate administrative burdens.

- **Transparency and Compliance**: The requirement to deduct and remit the charge monthly ensures clear record-keeping and accountability, which supports auditability and trust in the system.

### **Conclusion**

The *Saskatchewan Hog Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations* establish a clear, targeted, and equitable mechanism for collecting a service charge of **$0.50 per hog** from producers engaged in interprovincial and export marketing. The charge is collected through direct deduction from payments to producers or processors and remitted monthly to the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission. The regulations are designed to fund marketing and research activities while excluding transactions involving personal consumption, breeding stock, and research purposes — reflecting a balanced approach that supports both commercial efficiency and industry-specific needs.

This regulation operates within the broader framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972*, and is a critical tool in ensuring sustainable and transparent hog marketing in Saskatchewan.
