Certainly. Below is a **detailed, clear, and structured summary** of the regulation you provided:

### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers and Functions from the Minister of Finance to Other Ministers**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**.
- It is based on **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which allows for the transfer of powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers.
- The transfer concerns specific **fiscal responsibilities** under the **Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act (the "Act")**, particularly related to **special adjustment payments** to provinces.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Transfer**
The primary objective is to **reallocate certain financial decision-making powers** from the **Minister of Finance** to two other federal ministers:
- The **Minister of National Health and Welfare**
- The **Minister of Employment and Immigration**

This reallocation is designed to improve **accountability, expertise, and policy alignment** by placing financial responsibilities in the hands of ministers with direct oversight of health and post-secondary education.

#### **3. First Transfer: To the Minister of National Health and Welfare**

##### **Powers Transferred:**
- The power, duties, and functions of the Minister of Finance under **subsection 23.1(1)** of the Act to make **special adjustment payments** to provinces.

##### **Nature of the Payment:**
- The payment is a **portion of the total special adjustment payment** to all provinces.
- The size of the portion is calculated based on a **proportional formula** that reflects the relative entitlements of provinces in two key health-related programs:

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Insured Health Services Program** | The portion of the total entitlements of all provinces under this program, as determined by **subsection 15(1)** of the Act. |
| **Extended Health Care Services Program** | The amount payable to provinces under this program, as determined by **subsection 23(2)** of the Act. |

##### **Proportional Formula:**
The portion assigned to each province in the special adjustment payment is:
> **(Sum of the amounts for both programs)**  
> ÷  
> **(Total sum of all provincial entitlements under both programs)**  
> ×  
> **Total special adjustment payment to all provinces**

In simpler terms:
- The proportion of the special adjustment payment allocated to a province is **the same** as the proportion of the total provincial entitlements (from both insured and extended health programs) to the total entitlements across all provinces.
- This ensures **fairness and equity** in how funds are distributed based on actual provincial needs and entitlements.

#### **4. Second Transfer: To the Minister of Employment and Immigration**

##### **Powers Transferred:**
- The power, duties, and functions of the Minister of Finance under **subsection 23.1(1)** of the Act to make **special adjustment payments** to provinces.

##### **Nature of the Payment:**
- The payment is a **portion of the total special adjustment payment** to all provinces.
- This portion is specifically tied to the **post-secondary education financing program**.

##### **Proportional Formula:**
The amount allocated to each province in this portion is:
> **(Sum of the entitlements of all provinces under the post-secondary education financing program)**  
> ÷  
> **(Total sum of entitlements across all provinces under both the insured health services and post-secondary education programs)**  
> ×  
> **Total special adjustment payment to all provinces**

- This ensures that provinces receive a share of the adjustment payment that reflects their **relative entitlements in post-secondary education financing**, as defined in **subsection 15(2)** of the Act.

#### **5. Key Principles Underlying the Transfer**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proportional Equity** | Payments are not arbitrary; they are based on a formula that reflects each province’s relative entitlements in the relevant programs. |
| **Fiscal Responsibility** | The transfer ensures that financial decisions related to health and education are made by ministers with direct policy responsibility. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | The use of clearly defined entitlements (from subsections 15(1), 15(2), and 23(2)) ensures that the distribution is transparent and based on objective criteria. |
| **Inter-Governmental Fairness** | Provinces receive funding that mirrors their actual needs and contributions to federal programs. |

---

#### **6. Implications and Significance**

- **For Health Programs:** The transfer to the **Minister of National Health and Welfare** strengthens the link between federal health funding and provincial health needs, ensuring that provinces with greater health service entitlements receive a corresponding share of the adjustment payment.
- **For Post-Secondary Education:** The transfer to the **Minister of Employment and Immigration** reflects the federal government’s recognition of the importance of education funding and the need for dedicated oversight in this area.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** It streamlines governance by placing financial authority in the most relevant ministerial hands, reducing bureaucratic overlap and improving responsiveness.

---

#### **7. Legal and Procedural Notes**
- The transfer is **not a change in the law**, but a **reassignment of ministerial responsibilities** under existing legislation.
- All calculations and determinations of entitlements remain governed by the **Act**, particularly:
  - Subsection **15(1)**: Entitlements in insured health services
  - Subsection **15(2)**: Entitlements in post-secondary education financing
  - Subsection **23(2)**: Payments to provinces for extended health care
  - Subsection **23.1(2) and (3)**: Determination of the total special adjustment payment
- The **Minister of Finance** continues to determine the total amount of the special adjustment payment, but the **distribution** of that amount among provinces is now governed by the new proportional formulas.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant **restructuring of federal fiscal responsibilities**. It transfers specific financial decision-making powers from the Minister of Finance to the Ministers responsible for health and post-secondary education. The transfers are grounded in **proportional equity**, ensuring that provinces receive their fair share of special adjustment payments based on their **actual entitlements** in health and education programs.
