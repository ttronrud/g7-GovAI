**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization to Prescribe Fees for Maps, Navigation Charts, and Interpretive Publications in National Parks

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, pursuant to paragraph 13(b) of the *Financial Administration Act*.

**Purpose:**  
The regulation authorizes the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (commonly referred to as the Minister) to issue orders that establish fees or charges to recover the costs associated with providing maps, navigation charts, and interpretive publications to users of national parks.

**Legal Basis:**  
The authority to impose such fees is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision permits the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board) to authorize the government to establish fees or charges to cover the costs of administering or delivering certain services, including those related to public access and information.

**Scope of Authority:**  
The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is empowered to prescribe fees or charges specifically for:
- **Maps** (including topographic, trail, and area-specific maps),
- **Navigation charts** (such as those used for waterways, trails, or wilderness areas),
- **Interpretive publications** (such as brochures, guidebooks, educational materials, or visitor information).

These materials are provided to **users of national parks**, which may include recreational visitors, hikers, campers, researchers, and other individuals engaging in park-related activities.

**Key Implications:**
- The fees are intended to **recover the direct costs** of producing, printing, distributing, and maintaining these materials.
- The fees are not intended to be punitive or discriminatory but are designed to ensure the **sustainability and ongoing provision** of essential visitor services.
- The Minister has discretion in setting the fees, which may vary based on the type of publication, format (e.g., digital vs. printed), distribution method, or the specific park involved.
- The regulation emphasizes that the fees are **authorized by federal statute** and operate under the framework of financial accountability and transparency required by the Financial Administration Act.

**Administrative Process:**  
- The Minister will issue a formal **order** to establish or modify fees.
- Such orders will likely be subject to public consultation, transparency requirements, and potential review by relevant oversight bodies or the Treasury Board.
- The fees may be applied in a consistent or tiered manner, depending on user type (e.g., individual visitors vs. groups or institutions).

**Relevance and Context:**  
This regulation reflects a broader government effort to manage public service costs efficiently. It allows the federal government to fund essential visitor services without relying solely on general taxation or budget allocations. Given that national parks are often remote and resource-intensive to maintain, the cost of producing and distributing accurate, up-to-date materials is significant. This authorization ensures that these services can continue to be delivered in a financially sustainable way.

**Limitations or Exclusions:**  
- The regulation does **not** authorize fees for park entry, accommodation, or other services.
- It does **not** apply to services provided by provincial or territorial governments or to non-park-related programs.
- The fees are limited to **informational and navigational materials**, not to park operations or maintenance.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a legally sound and administratively flexible mechanism for the federal government to cover the costs of supplying essential maps, navigation tools, and interpretive materials to national park users. By authorizing the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to prescribe fees under the Financial Administration Act, the government ensures that critical visitor services remain available and well-maintained while maintaining fiscal responsibility and accountability.

*Note: While the regulation appears to involve the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, it is important to note that the Minister of Environment and Climate Change or the Minister of Parks, Heritage, and Recreation (depending on jurisdiction) may be more directly responsible for national parks. The naming of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in this context may be a procedural or administrative oversight, as national parks are typically under the jurisdiction of the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada. However, the regulation as written stands as a formal authorization based on statutory authority.*
