The regulation you have provided is a formal government instrument issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)** in Canada. Below is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) – Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments

**Legal Basis:**  
- **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **subsection 23(1)**  
- Issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of the Environment**  
- Published in **S.C. 2002, c. 29** (Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 29)

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   This regulation serves as an official acknowledgment by the federal government that it has received and recognized the scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**. These assessments were carried out pursuant to **subsection 23(1) of SARA**, which mandates that COSEWIC evaluate the status of wildlife species in Canada and provide scientific assessments to inform conservation decisions.

2. **Scope of the Assessment:**  
   The assessments cover specific species listed in the **annexed schedule** (not included in the text provided). These species are evaluated based on criteria such as:
   - Population size and trends
   - Geographic distribution
   - Threats (e.g., habitat loss, climate change, invasive species)
   - Conservation status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern)

3. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent scientific committee composed of experts in wildlife biology, ecology, and conservation. It provides objective, science-based assessments of the risk status of species. Its evaluations are critical in determining whether a species qualifies for listing under SARA.

4. **Government Action and Legal Implication:**  
   By acknowledging receipt of these assessments, the Governor General in Council (acting on the Minister of the Environment’s recommendation), the federal government formally recognizes the scientific findings. This step is a **mandatory procedural requirement** under SARA and serves as a foundation for the next phase of species protection, which may include:
   - Listing a species as endangered, threatened, or special concern
   - Developing recovery strategies
   - Implementing conservation measures

5. **Timeline and Effectiveness:**  
   The Order takes effect upon its **making** (i.e., coming into force), which typically occurs upon publication in the Canada Gazette. It does not alter the scientific findings themselves but affirms the government’s acceptance of COSEWIC’s conclusions and signals the beginning of formal conservation actions.

6. **Legal Authority:**  
   The power to issue such an order is derived from **SARA, section 23**, which empowers the Minister of the Environment to act on COSEWIC assessments to determine the status of species and to take appropriate actions under the Act.

**Significance:**

- This regulation is a **critical step in the conservation process** under SARA. It ensures that scientific evaluations are formally recognized and used to inform policy and legal decisions.
- It demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to **science-based conservation** and transparency in species management.
- It sets the stage for potential **protection measures**, such as habitat protection, species recovery plans, and restrictions on activities that threaten the species.

---

**Limitations and Notes:**

- The Order itself **does not list species** or impose direct protections. That comes later through formal listing decisions.
- The annexed schedule (which is not included in the provided text) would list the specific species assessed.
- The regulation is procedural and administrative, not substantive in terms of conservation outcomes.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a foundational administrative action under the Species at Risk Act that formally recognizes and accepts the scientific assessments of species’ status by COSEWIC. It marks the official start of the government’s responsibility to respond to those assessments with conservation actions, such as listing, recovery planning, and protection measures—thereby fulfilling the Act’s mandate to protect Canada’s biodiversity.
