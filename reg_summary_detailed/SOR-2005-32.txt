It appears that you've started a request to provide a detailed summary of a regulation, but no specific regulation has been included in your message. Could you please provide the full text or reference to the regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the regulation (e.g., a statute, rule, policy, or legal document), I will offer a comprehensive, clear, and accurate summary covering:

- The purpose and scope of the regulation  
- Key definitions and terms  
- Applicable entities or jurisdictions  
- Specific requirements or obligations  
- Enforcement mechanisms or penalties  
- Exemptions or exceptions  
- Impact on stakeholders  
- Relevant legal basis or authority  

Please paste the regulation text or provide a link or reference so I can assist you effectively.
