**Detailed Summary of the Solvency Special Payments Relief Regulations, 2020**

---

### **Overview**

The *Solvency Special Payments Relief Regulations, 2020* were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under specific provisions of the *Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985* (the "Act"). These regulations provide temporary relief from the requirement to make **solvency special payments** for certain pension plans during a defined period — specifically, from the date of coming into force until December 30, 2020.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **alleviate financial pressure on pension plans** that were required to make mandatory solvency special payments under the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985*, particularly in the context of the economic disruptions caused by the global pandemic (which began in early 2020). The relief is targeted at ensuring plan stability while allowing for a more equitable and practical approach to solvency obligations.

### **Legal Authority**

These regulations are made under the following provisions of the *Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985*:

- Paragraphs **39(1)(e)** and **(e.1)a** – Authority to make regulations relating to solvency special payments.
- Subparagraph **39(1)(e.2)(v)a** – Specific authority to modify or relieve solvency special payment obligations.
- Paragraphs **39(1)(h.2)b** and **(o)** – Authority to adjust payment schedules and related financial obligations.

These provisions empower the government to introduce temporary relief measures when necessary to maintain the financial integrity and sustainability of pension plans.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985*, which sets the framework for pension plan solvency standards and payment requirements.

2. **"Solvency special payment"**  
   A special payment required under **paragraph 9(4)(c) or (d)** of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985*. These payments are made when a pension plan fails to meet minimum solvency ratios and are intended to restore financial stability.

### **Core Provisions and Their Impacts**

#### **1. Reduction of Solvency Special Payments for a Plan Year**

- Solvency special payments required for a given plan year are **reduced** by the total amount of all instalments that would have become due during a specific period:
  
  - **Period 1**: April 1, 2020, to the day before the regulations come into force  
    *(unless the plan year ended more than 30 days before the regulations come into force)*  
    → This means that if a plan year ended before the regulations took effect, the reduction does not apply.

  - **Period 2**: From the day the regulations come into force to December 30, 2020  
    → Payments due during this period are **not required** under the rules, even if they would have been due under normal regulations.

> **Result**: The total amount of solvency special payments owed for a plan year is effectively reduced or eliminated for the portion falling within this period.

---

#### **2. No Payments Required Between the Effective Date and December 30, 2020**

- Despite the requirement in **paragraph 9(14)(b)** of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations*, **no solvency special payment instalments are required** during the period from the **day these regulations come into force** to **December 30, 2020**.

> This is a significant relief measure — it effectively **waives** the obligation to pay any instalments during this time, preventing financial strain on pension plans during a period of uncertainty.

---

#### **3. Deduction of Early-Paid Installments**

- If a solvency special payment instalment becomes due **after March 31, 2020**, and is paid **no later than the day the regulations come into force**, then:
  - That amount **can be deducted** from the total amount of all future instalments due under **paragraphs 9(14)(a) and (b)** of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations* during the period from the effective date to December 30, 2020.
  - Additionally, the corresponding **contributions** and **going concern special payments** (under paragraphs 9(4)(a) and (b)) are also **reduced accordingly**.

> This allows plans to "offset" early payments against future obligations, reducing the overall financial burden.

---

#### **4. No Interest on Late-Due Installments**

- Despite **paragraph 10(2)(b)** of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations*, **no interest** is payable on a solvency special payment instalment that:
  - Became due **after March 31, 2020**
  - But **before** the regulations came into force

> This removes the financial penalty associated with delayed payments, further easing the burden on pension plans during a transitional period.

---

#### **5. Exemption from Subsection 9(6) of the Regulations**

- Subsection **9(6)** of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations* normally applies to additional payments (e.g., penalties or extra charges) that are not fully covered by solvency special payments.
- However, **this subsection does not apply** to any portion of an additional payment that **would have been payable as a solvency special payment** **but for these regulations**.

> This means that if a payment was intended to be a solvency special payment and would have been made under normal rules, it is not subject to additional charges or penalties under section 9(6).

---

#### **6. Reduction of Letter of Credit Face Value**

- For a **letter of credit (LC)** that was **provided or transferred before** the regulations come into force:
  - Its face value may be **reduced** by an amount **not exceeding** the total amount of all instalments referred to in **paragraphs 2(a) and (b)** of these regulations that were **to be replaced** by the LC.
  - This reduction is in addition to any reduction allowed under **subsections 9.1(2) to (4)** of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations*.

> **Key consequence**: If a plan used a letter of credit to cover solvency special payments, the face value of that LC can be reduced proportionally to reflect the relief provided by these regulations.

- **Deemed reduction**: The reduction is treated as if it had already occurred under the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations*.
- **No default**: The **non-renewal** of the letter of credit for its full face value **does not constitute a default** under **section 9.1** of the Regulations.

> This protects pension plans from being penalized for failing to renew a letter of credit due to the temporary relief provided.

---

#### **7. Temporary Solvency Ratio Level**

- For the period from the **effective date** to **November 30, 2020**, the **prescribed solvency ratio level** under **paragraphs 10.1(2)(c) and (d)** of the Act is set at **1.05**.

> This is a temporary adjustment to the standard solvency ratio (which is typically higher), allowing plans more flexibility in meeting their financial obligations during a period of economic stress.

---

#### **8. Additional Reporting Requirements**

- For any plan year where a solvency special payment is reduced under **section 2** of these regulations, the following information must be reported in addition to standard reporting requirements (under subsections 23(1) and (1.1) of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations*):
  - The **amount of the reduced solvency special payments** for that plan year.
  - The **amount of solvency special payments that would have been required** for that plan year **but for these regulations**.

> This ensures transparency and accountability — regulators and stakeholders can assess the financial impact of the relief.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette*).

> This ensures immediate application and clarity for pension plan administrators, trustees, and regulators.

---

### **Purpose and Context**

These regulations were introduced in response to the **economic challenges of early 2020**, including the **global pandemic**, which led to significant volatility in pension plan finances. Many plans faced unexpected declines in assets or increased liabilities, making it difficult to meet solvency requirements.

By providing temporary relief from solvency special payments and associated interest, penalties, and reporting obligations, the government aimed to:

- Prevent financial distress in pension plans.
- Maintain the long-term sustainability of the pension system.
- Allow time for recovery and stabilization of plan finances.
- Support the broader economic recovery.
