**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 3**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

This regulation is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 29(1)(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**. The Order is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This indicates that the decision is part of a formal, government-approved process rooted in Canadian land legislation.

The Order is formally titled:  
**Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 3.**

---

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize a specific employee of the Government of Canada** to acquire an interest in certain **territorial lands located in the Northwest Territories**. This is a special provision allowing government employees to obtain land rights for official or operational purposes, typically in the interest of public service, administrative efficiency, or infrastructure development.

**3. Key Details of the Land Acquisition:**

- **Employee Authorized:**  
  **Kenneth James McGilvray**, a Peace Officer with the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, based in the Town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta.

- **Type of Acquisition:**  
  The acquisition is by **assignment from the current lessee**. This means that McGilvray is not purchasing the land directly from the Crown but is taking over the rights from the current holder (lessee) under a legal transfer of leasehold interest.

- **Location of the Land:**  
  The parcel is situated on the **southerly shore of Schaefer Lakes** in the Northwest Territories.  
  It is located within **Quad 75 D/3** of the Northwest Territories land survey system.

- **Description of the Parcel:**  
  The specific boundaries of the parcel are defined by its **outline in red** on a sketch plan.  
  The plan is referenced as **file 33-1-12** and is held in the **Land Management Division of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)** in Ottawa. This ensures that the land description is officially documented and verifiable.

**4. Exceptions and Reservations:**

The Order explicitly **saves and reserves** the following rights and interests from the acquisition:

- All **mines and minerals**, including:
  - Solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons (such as oil, gas, and natural gas).
- The **right to work** these mineral resources.

This means that while the employee acquires surface rights (e.g., for use, access, or administrative purposes), the Crown retains all subsurface mineral rights and the legal right to explore, extract, or develop any minerals beneath the land.

---

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance:**

- This Order demonstrates a **limited exception to standard land tenure rules**, allowing a government employee to acquire land under specific conditions.
- The involvement of the **RCMP** suggests the land may be relevant to law enforcement operations, security, or monitoring activities in a remote area like Schaefer Lakes.
- The fact that the land is being acquired by assignment from a current lessee implies that the previous lessee has already been granted a lease, and the transfer is a legal continuation of that arrangement.

---

**6. Implications:**

- **Public Service Use:** The acquisition supports the operational needs of a government employee, likely enhancing access to remote areas for law enforcement or administrative functions.
- **Mineral Rights Protection:** The reservation of mineral rights ensures that future exploration or development activities (e.g., oil and gas) remain under Crown or regulatory oversight, protecting the interests of the federal government and potential resource industries.
- **Land Use and Governance:** This Order reflects the balance between enabling government employees to operate effectively in remote regions and maintaining control over land and natural resources.

**7. Citation and Record-Keeping:**

The Order is to be cited as:  
**Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 3**  
and is recorded in the official land records of the Northwest Territories.

---

**Conclusion:**

This Order is a formal, legally binding instrument authorizing a specific RCMP officer to take over surface rights to a parcel of land in the Northwest Territories. It is grounded in the Territorial Lands Act and operates under a clear framework that protects mineral rights and ensures transparency through documented land descriptions and administrative records. The acquisition serves public service needs while preserving critical resource rights under federal jurisdiction.
