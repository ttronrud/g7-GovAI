The provided text consists of **repeated entries** indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2012-256, section 73**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Date and Legal Instrument**: It was repealed by **Regulation SOR/2012-256, section 73**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on **March 20, 2012**.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 73 of SOR/2012-256 explicitly removes or cancels the previously existing regulation. This means the legal provisions, rules, or requirements associated with that regulation no longer apply.
- **Frequency of Repeated Entries**: The repeated line "[Repealed, SOR/2012-256, s. 73]" suggests that the repeal was applied to multiple provisions or sections, possibly indicating a broad repeal of a set of rules or a list of regulations that were consolidated or removed under this single section.

### Interpretation:
While the original regulation is not provided, the summary implies that:
- A set of rules (possibly related to licensing, compliance, or administrative procedures) was **formally removed** from the legal framework.
- The repeal was part of a **regulatory modernization or consolidation effort** by the federal government, likely to streamline legislation, eliminate outdated provisions, or align with new policy directions.
- The repeal does not imply that the subject matter is now unregulated — it simply means that the specific rules previously governed by that regulation are no longer in force.

### Practical Implications:
- Any legal, administrative, or operational obligations derived from the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Organizations or individuals previously bound by the regulation must now refer to **current, active regulations** that govern the same area of activity.
- Legal or compliance teams should review updated legislation to ensure they are not operating under outdated or invalid rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided text does **not contain the content of the original regulation**, only a repeated declaration of its repeal. Therefore, the detailed summary is limited to the **status and legal mechanism of repeal**. To understand the actual scope, purpose, or content of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal — which is no longer in effect.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> The regulation referenced has been **repealed** by **SOR/2012-256, section 73**, meaning it is no longer legally valid or enforceable. This repeal was part of a broader legislative update to remove outdated or redundant rules. The specific content of the original regulation is not included in the provided text, and therefore cannot be summarized in detail. Any reference to this regulation in current legal practice is now obsolete.
