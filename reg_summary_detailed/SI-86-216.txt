The reference "[Repealed, SI/2014-88, s. 1]" indicates that the regulation in question has been formally repealed by **Statutory Instrument 2014 No. 88**, specifically under **section 1** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2014 No. 88* (SI/2014-88), commonly referred to as the "Statutory Instrument 2014-88".
- **Repeal Provision**: Section 1 of SI/2014-88 contains the specific provision that **revokes or cancels** the previously enacted regulation.
- **Effective Date**: While the exact date is not specified in the reference, Statutory Instruments typically come into force on a date set in the instrument itself. In this case, SI/2014-88 would have been laid before Parliament and came into effect on the date specified in the instrument (commonly the day it is made, or a subsequent date, such as 15 April 2014, depending on the instrument's wording).
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because:
  - The original regulation was outdated or redundant.
  - It was superseded by a more modern, comprehensive, or better-suited legislative framework.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with current laws or policy objectives.
  - It caused administrative or legal confusion, or was no longer necessary.

### Implications:
- Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal entities, individuals, or government bodies must now refer to the current legislation or regulations that have replaced it (if any).
- The repeal does not imply that the subject matter of the regulation is being abandoned—only that the specific text is no longer in force.

### Note:
Without access to the full text of SI/2014-88 or the original regulation, the precise subject matter of the repealed regulation cannot be determined. To identify the nature of the repealed rule (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.), one would need to consult:
- The full text of SI/2014-88,
- The original regulation being repealed,
- The explanatory notes or legislative intent accompanying the repeal.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **officially repealed** under **section 1 of Statutory Instrument 2014 No. 88**. It is no longer valid or enforceable. Its repeal reflects a change in legislative policy or administrative structure, and practitioners or regulators should refer to current, active legislation for compliance purposes.
