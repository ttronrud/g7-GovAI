**Detailed Summary of the *Nova Scotia Turkey Marketing Levies Order***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled the **Nova Scotia Turkey Marketing Levies Order** and may be cited as such. It establishes a framework for the collection of levies on turkeys sold by producers in Nova Scotia who exceed their allocated market share.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the regulation of turkey marketing in the province. This Act empowers the Commodity Board to manage turkey markets, set quotas, and implement levies.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Nova Scotia Turkey Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), established under the Natural Products Marketing Act. It is responsible for administering the turkey marketing system, including setting market allotments, overseeing the Plan, and collecting levies.

- **Market Allotment**: The total quantity of turkey meat (in weight) that a producer is permitted to market—whether domestically (intraprovincial), across provinces (interprovincial), or internationally (export)—as determined by:
  - The *Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations*, and  
  - Orders issued by the Commodity Board under the *Plan*.

- **Plan**: The *Nova Scotia Turkey Marketing Plan*, which is established and amended over time under the Natural Products Marketing Act. The Plan sets out the rules, quotas, and objectives for managing turkey production and marketing in Nova Scotia. It serves as the governing document for all marketing decisions, including allotment allocations and levy structures.

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the production of turkeys within the Province of Nova Scotia. This includes farms, poultry operations, or other entities involved in raising turkeys for slaughter.

- **Turkey**: A turkey that is six months of age or younger, of any variety, grade, or class, raised or kept for slaughter within Nova Scotia and sold for slaughter. This definition excludes older turkeys and those not raised or sold within the province.

### **3. Levy Structure and Application**

- **Levy Rate**: Every producer who sells turkeys **in excess of their market allotment** must pay a levy of **$0.05 per pound of live weight** on each such turkey.

  - This levy applies only to turkeys sold beyond the producer’s allocated market share.
  - Producers are **not required to pay the levy** on turkeys sold within their market allotment.

- **Purpose of the Levy**: The levy is designed to ensure that market demand does not exceed supply, to prevent overproduction, and to maintain market stability. It also helps fund the administration of the marketing system and supports the Commodity Board’s oversight functions.

### **4. Payment Obligations**

#### **(a) Buyers of Turkeys (Retailers, Distributors, etc.)**
- Any person who purchases turkeys from a producer **must deduct the applicable levy** from the total payment due to the producer.
- The deducted amount must be **paid directly to the Commodity Board**:
  - At the Commodity Board’s office in **Port Williams, Nova Scotia**.
  - **No later than the 10th day of the month following** the month in which the turkeys were sold.

> Example: If turkeys are sold in May, the levy must be paid by June 10.

#### **(b) Producers (Direct Payment)**
- If a producer **fails to have the levy deducted by a buyer**, they are still responsible for paying the levy themselves.
- Producers must pay all levies that were not deducted by buyers:
  - To the Commodity Board at its office in **Port Williams, Nova Scotia**.
  - **No later than the 10th day of the month following** the month in which the turkeys were sold.

> Example: If turkeys are sold in June, the producer must pay any unpaid levies by July 10.

### **5. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulation imposes **strict deadlines** for levy payments (10th day of the following month), ensuring timely collection and financial accountability.
- The Commodity Board has the authority to enforce compliance, and failure to pay levies may result in penalties or administrative action, though such penalties are not explicitly detailed in this Order.
- The system is designed to ensure that the financial burden of exceeding market quotas is shared fairly and transparently between producers and buyers.

  - Prevent market oversupply and price instability.
