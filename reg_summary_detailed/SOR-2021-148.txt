### **Detailed Summary of the Formaldehyde Emissions from Composite Wood Products Regulations (Canada)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The **Formaldehyde Emissions from Composite Wood Products Regulations** were made under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, following a formal process that included:

- **Public consultation**: On June 29, 2019, the Minister of the Environment published a proposed regulation in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, inviting public comments and objections.
- **Notice of objection**: Individuals or organizations could file a notice of objection, requesting a board of review if they believed the proposed rules were inadequate or inconsistent with environmental or health protections.
- **Advisory input**: The National Advisory Committee was given the opportunity to provide expert advice under section 6c of CEPA 1999.
- **No regulatory overlap**: The Administrator in Council concluded that these regulations do not conflict with or duplicate provisions in other federal statutes and provide sufficient protection to human health and the environment.

As such, the regulations were formally adopted by the **Government of Canada in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, pursuant to CEPA 1999.

#### **2. Scope and Applicability**

##### **What the Regulations Apply To**
- All **composite wood products** that contain formaldehyde.
- These include:
  - **Composite wood panels**:
    - Hardwood plywood
    - Particleboard
    - Medium-density fibreboard (MDF)
    - Thin medium-density fibreboard (T-MDF)
  - **Laminated products** (e.g., panels with veneer glued to a core)
  - **Component parts** (finished goods into which these are incorporated)
  - **Finished goods** (products sold to end-users)

> **Note**: The regulations apply only to products *intended for sale or use in Canada*, not to those used solely in manufacturing, research, or export.

#### **3. Exclusions from the Regulations**

The following composite wood products are **exempt** from these formaldehyde emission limits:

| Excluded Product Type | Reason |
|------------------------|--------|
| **Curved plywood** | Not covered under standard testing methods |
| **Finger-jointed lumber** | Not a composite panel or laminated product |
| **Structural wood products** with moisture-resistant adhesives (e.g., plywood, OSB, glued-laminated timber, I-joists, CLT) | Comply with existing structural standards (CSA, NIST, ASTM) that already regulate emissions |
| **Hardboard** | Excluded due to different manufacturing process and resin types |
| **Spools, packaging, pallets, crates, dunnage** | Non-end-use items |
| **Products used in vehicles** (e.g., cars, rail, aircraft, vessels) | Not for consumer use in dwellings or homes |
| **Windows** where composite wood represents <5% of volume | Minor component; low emission risk |
| **Exterior or garage doors** where composite wood is <3% of volume or uses no-added or ultra-low-emitting resins | Minimal contribution to indoor air quality |
| **Products for R&D or laboratory use** | Not intended for consumer exposure |
| **Products manufactured or imported solely for export** | No domestic market exposure |
| **Second-hand goods or goods acquired by consumers for personal use** | Post-sale use; not at risk of new emissions |

> **Important Note**: A person who *only installs* composite wood products (e.g., a contractor) is **not considered a seller or offeror** under these regulations.

#### **4. Formaldehyde Emission Limits**

The regulations set **maximum allowable formaldehyde emissions** when tested using approved methods:

| Product Type | Maximum Formaldehyde Emission |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Hardwood plywood** | 0.05 ppm |
| **Particleboard** | 0.09 ppm |
| **Medium-density fibreboard (MDF)** | 0.11 ppm |
| **Thin MDF (T-MDF)** | 0.13 ppm |
| **Laminated products** | 0.05 ppm |

> These limits apply **to the panel or product itself** before it is incorporated into a finished good.

Additionally, **correlated limits** are established under a **Directive (Government of Canada, June 2023)** and verified by **third-party certifiers**. These correlated limits are used when testing is conducted using alternative methods (e.g., ASTM D6007), ensuring equivalent environmental safety.

---

#### **5. Testing and Certification Requirements**

##### **A. Mandatory Testing and Verification for Manufacturers**

Every manufacturer must ensure that their products meet emission limits through a **systematic testing and verification process**:

- **Specimen selection**:
  - Must be conducted **four times per year**.
  - Must occur **between 60 and 120 days** after the previous selection.
  - Selection must be done by a **third-party certifier**.

- **Testing Method**:
  - Must be conducted using **ASTM E1333** (large chamber method), **unless equivalence** to ASTM E1333 is established.
  - If using **ASTM D6007** (small-scale chamber method), the manufacturer must:
    - Have an **accredited laboratory** establish equivalence between D6007 and E1333.
    - Have this **equivalence verified by a third-party certifier**.
    - **Re-establish and re-verify** equivalence annually for the first **three years**, then **every two years** thereafter.
    - Re-evaluate equivalence if there is a change in:
      - Equipment
      - Testing procedures
      - Personnel
      - Evidence that the equivalence is no longer valid

> **Purpose**: Ensures that alternative testing methods yield results comparable to the more rigorous ASTM E1333.

##### **B. Frequency of Testing Based on Production Volume**

Testing frequency depends on the **volume of production** per week/month:

| Product Type | Testing Frequency |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Hardwood plywood or laminated products** |  
- ≤ 9,290 m²/month → once per month  
- > 9,290 m²/month but ≤ 18,581 m²/week → once every 9,290 m²  
- > 18,581 m²/week but < 37,161 m²/week → twice per week  
- ≥ 37,161 m²/week → four times per week  
|  
| **Particleboard, MDF, T-MDF** |  
- Once every 8–12 hours, depending on shift length (±1 hour)  
|  

> This ensures higher monitoring for high-volume producers.

##### **C. Additional Testing Triggers**

Testing must be conducted **immediately** if any of the following occur:
- Change in resin composition that increases the formaldehyde-to-urea ratio
- Increase of >10% in formaldehyde resin per m² or per panel
- Increase of >20% in adhesive application rate
- Decrease of >20% in press time
- Manufacturer believes emissions exceed the limit

> These triggers ensure responsiveness to process changes that could increase formaldehyde emissions.

##### **D. Verification of Testing Results**

- A **third-party certifier** must verify all test results.
- Verification must be performed **quarterly**.
- Re-verification is required if:
  - Two consecutive tests (per ASTM E1333) exceed the limit
  - Test results from ASTM E1333 and ASTM D6007 do not align with the established correlation

---

#### **6. Recordkeeping and Compliance Obligations**

Manufacturers must maintain and provide the following:

- **Declaration of Certification**:
  - Must retain a copy for each product type.
  - Must provide a copy to the **Minister upon request** (under section 29(6.2)).

- **Information Submission**:
  - Must submit information to the Minister under **section 31**, including details on:
    - Product type
    - Resin composition
    - Testing results
    - Production volumes
    - Compliance status

> This ensures transparency and enables the government to monitor compliance and environmental impact.
