### **4. Key Components Explained**

- **Shareholders’ Equity**:  
  This refers to the net assets of a company after deducting liabilities. It represents the ownership interest of shareholders and is typically calculated as:  
  *Shareholders’ Equity = Assets – Liabilities.*

- **Minority Interests**:  
  These are the ownership stakes held by non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries or other entities that are controlled by the parent company (e.g., an insurance company or holding company).  
  - A minority interest arises when a company owns less than 100% of another entity and thus does not have full control.  
  - These interests are included in the consolidated financial statements and are recognized as part of the parent’s equity for regulatory purposes.

- **Consolidated Financial Statements**:  
  These are financial statements prepared by combining the financial results and position of a parent company and its subsidiaries.  
  - The use of consolidated statements ensures that the total equity of the group is accurately reflected, providing a complete picture of the financial health of the entire corporate structure.

### **5. Regulatory Context and Application**

These regulations are directly aligned with the **Insurance Companies Act** and are designed to support the **solvency and stability** of insurance organizations. By clearly defining equity, the regulations enable:
- Accurate assessment of capital adequacy,
- Effective monitoring of financial risk,
- Compliance with solvency and capital requirements,
- Consistent application of financial reporting standards across insurance firms.

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **date on which Section 1021 of the Insurance Companies Act** is enacted.  

Specifically, this date is set by **Section 465 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (FCACA)**, which amended the ICA.  
- The amendment was enacted through **S.C. 2001, c. 9**, and  
- Came into force on **October 24, 2001**.

Thus, these regulations **came into force on October 24, 2001**.

- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465** (the enabling provision),

### **8. Significance and Impact**

- **Clarity in Financial Reporting**: Provides a clear, consistent, and legally binding definition of equity, reducing ambiguity in financial disclosures.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: Enables regulators (such as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions – OSFI) to assess the financial strength and risk profile of insurance companies and holding companies.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensures that minority interests are not overlooked in capital calculations, promoting transparency in ownership structures.
