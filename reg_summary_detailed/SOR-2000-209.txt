|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* |
| **Category I Nuclear Material** | Listed substances in Schedule 1, in specified form and quantity (column 1–2–3). Highest risk category. |
| **Category II Nuclear Material** | Same as Category I, but in quantity specified in column 4 of Schedule 1. Medium-high risk. |
| **Category III Nuclear Material** | Same as above, in quantity specified in column 5 of Schedule 1. Lower risk than I/II. |
| **Design Basis Threat (DBT)** | The hypothetical adversary used to design and evaluate physical protection systems. It defines the capabilities and intentions of potential attackers. |
| **Direct Visual Surveillance** | A person physically present at a site observing activities in real time. |
| **Effective Intervention** | A timely and powerful response that prevents sabotage or unauthorized removal of nuclear material. |
| **Explosive Substance** | Includes devices intended to cause explosions, incendiary devices (e.g., Molotov cocktails), and delay mechanisms. |
| **High-Security Site** | A nuclear power plant or facility where Category I or II nuclear material is processed, used, or stored. |
| **Inner Area** | An area inside a protected zone, surrounded by a barrier meeting section 13 requirements. Used for Category I material. |
| **Licensee** | A person authorized to operate nuclear material or facilities under a license. Defined differently across sections: (i) for material handling; (ii) for high-security sites; (iii) for nuclear facilities in Schedule 2. |
| **Nuclear Power Plant** | A commercial-scale fission-reactor installation generating electricity. |
| **Nuclear Security Officer** | A trained, authorized individual responsible for security at high-security sites. Must have firearms authorization and training. |
| **On-Site Nuclear Response Force** | A team of nuclear security officers permanently stationed at a high-security site, trained and authorized to use firearms. |
| **Off-Site Response Force** | A local, provincial, or federal police unit not physically located at the site but capable of responding to incidents. |
| **Physical Protection System (PPS)** | All physical measures (barriers, detection systems, surveillance) in place to protect against threats. |
| **Physical Protection Measure** | Individual components of the PPS (e.g., fences, alarms, surveillance). |
| **Potential Adversary** | Any individual (authorized or unauthorized) who might attempt sabotage or unauthorized removal of nuclear material. |
| **Prescribed Information** | Sensitive data (e.g., material locations, quantities) protected under section 21 of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations. |
| **Protected Area** | A zone enclosed by a barrier meeting section 9 requirements. |
| **Vital Area** | A critical area within a protected zone containing equipment or nuclear substances whose sabotage would pose an unreasonable risk to health, safety, or the environment. |
| **Weapon** | Any device capable of causing death, injury, or intimidation (including firearms). |
| **Unobstructed Area** | *Repealed* (SOR/2006-191, s.2). Previously required to be free of obstructions and uniformly illuminated. |
| **Vehicle Portal** | A structure on the perimeter with two movable gates allowing land vehicles to enter/exit; must not be open simultaneously unless in emergency. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Some terms (e.g., *nuclear security guard*, *response force*) were **repealed** in 2006 (SOR/2006-191, s.2) and replaced with more robust definitions.

### **3. Licensing Requirements and Application Submissions**

#### ✅ **Applications for Licences (General Requirements)**

All licence applications for **Category I or II nuclear material** (excluding transport) and **nuclear facilities** must include:

1. **Copy of arrangements under section 35** (security planning and procedures).
2. **Site plan** (as per section 16).
3. **Description of proposed security equipment, systems, and procedures**.
4. **On-site and off-site communication arrangements** (e.g., emergency coordination).
5. **Structure and organization of the nuclear security officer service**, including:
   - Duties and responsibilities
   - Training requirements
6. **Plan and procedures for responding to breaches of security**.
7. **Current threat and risk assessment**.

#### ✅ **Applications for Category III Nuclear Material**

Must include:
- A description of measures to ensure compliance with:
  - Subsection 7(3)
  - Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (related to physical protection and access control)

#### ✅ **Transport Licences (Category I, II, III)**

Must include a **written transportation security plan** containing:

- Name, quantity, radiation level (Gy/h), chemical/physical characteristics, and isotopic composition of the material.
- **Threat assessment**: Nature, likelihood, and consequences of threats to material or prescribed information.
- Description of the conveyance (vehicle type, route).
- Proposed security measures (e.g., armed guards, tracking).
- Communication arrangements among:
  - Licensee
  - Transport operator
  - Recipient
  - Off-site response forces along the route
- Arrangements with off-site forces (e.g., coordination, access).
- **Planned route** and **alternate emergency route**.

> ✅ **Exemption Note**:  
> A licensee may **transport Category I, II, or III nuclear material within an area where it is required to be processed, used, or stored**, **without a separate licence**, provided it is within the scope of the existing licence.  
> ⚠️ This exemption applies **only to that specific activity** and **does not relieve the licensee of other licensing obligations** under section 26 of the Act.

### **4. Storage and Handling Requirements by Category**

| Category | Storage Requirement |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Category I** | Must be stored in an **inner area** (totally enclosed, accessible only under controlled conditions). |
| **Category II** | Must be stored in a **protected area** (enclosed by a physical barrier). |
| **Category III** | May be stored in **one of three options**:  
1. In a **protected area**  
2. In an area under **direct visual surveillance**  
3. In an area with **controlled access** designed to prevent unauthorized access using **hand-held tools** |

> 🔍 **Additional Requirement for Category III (Option 3)**:  
> If stored in a tool-accessible area, the licensee must ensure the area is equipped with:
> - Intrusion detection
> - Unauthorized removal detection
> - Tampering detection (to prevent system failure)
> - A **continuous audible and visible alarm** triggered upon detection, accessible to on-site personnel or an alarm monitoring service.

> ✅ **Exception**:  
> A licensee **does not need to comply** with the above if **physical protection measures** (e.g., fencing, surveillance) provide **equivalent protection**.

> 🚨 **Mandatory Alarm Monitoring Requirement**:  
> Every licensee must make **written arrangements** with an **off-site response force** capable of making an **effective intervention** at a Category III site.

> These arrangements must include:
> - **Annual familiarization visits** by off-site force members to the site.
> - **Joint development of a contingency plan** to enable rapid and effective intervention.

> 📢 If the licensee lacks alarm monitoring capability:
> - The **alarm monitoring service** must **notify both the licensee and the off-site response force immediately** upon alarm activation.
