### **Detailed Summary of the Exporters' and Producers' Records Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Basis**

The **Exporters' and Producers' Records Regulations** are a set of administrative rules implemented under the **Customs Act** (Canada), specifically to fulfill obligations arising from the **Canada-International Free Trade Agreements (CIFTA)** and related trade agreements such as NAFTA, CCFTA, CEFTA, and others.

- These regulations **do not introduce new substantive changes** to existing requirements but rather **implement a provision of CIFTA**.
- As such, they fall under **paragraphs 164(4)(a.03)a and (d)** of the Customs Act, which state that regulations that make no material substantive change to existing rules are **not required to be published under subsection 164(3)** of the Act.
- The regulations were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to:
  - Subsection **97.2(1)c** of the Customs Act,
  - Paragraph **164(1)(i)d**,
  - Subsection **164(1.1)e** of the Customs Act.

This means the regulations were issued through a standard administrative process, without requiring public consultation or publication under the usual notice provisions due to their minor, interpretive nature.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish **specific record-keeping obligations** for **exporters and producers of commercial goods**, particularly in the context of **origin rules and compliance with free trade agreements (FTAs)**.

These records are essential for:
- Demonstrating compliance with **rules of origin**,
- Supporting **advance rulings** (formal determinations by customs authorities on whether goods meet origin criteria),
- Enabling **verification visits** by customs administrations of free trade partners,
- Ensuring transparency and accountability in the production and export processes.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency in application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Customs Act*. |
| **Advance ruling** | A formal determination by the customs authority of a free trade partner (e.g., under Article 509 of NAFTA, Article 5.8 of CIFTA, or similar provisions in other FTAs) that goods meet the rules of origin. |
| **Commercial goods** | Goods exported for sale or for industrial, commercial, institutional, or other uses — not just for personal or non-commercial purposes. |
| **Material** | Any good used in the production of another good, including parts, ingredients, or components. |
| **Indirect material** | Goods not physically incorporated into the final product but used in production, testing, or maintenance. Examples include: <br> - Fuel and energy <br> - Tools, dies, molds <br> - Spare parts and lubricants <br> - Safety equipment <br> - Testing/inspection equipment <br> - Catalysts and solvents <br> - Any other item reasonably demonstrable as part of production. |
| **Producer** | A person who grows, mines, harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes, or assembles a good. |
| **Production** | Any of the activities listed above in the definition of "producer". |

These definitions are critical because they determine what constitutes a "material" or "indirect material" for record-keeping purposes and help clarify the scope of required documentation.

#### **4. Record-Keeping Obligations**

##### **A. General Exporters (Who Export Commercial Goods)**

Every person who exports commercial goods and is required under **subsection 97.2(1)** of the Customs Act to maintain records must keep the following for **six years after the export date**:

1. **Origin, purchase, importation, costs, and value** of the commercial goods;
2. **Payment records** related to the commercial goods;
3. **Usage of the goods in Canada** (e.g., whether they were sold, used in manufacturing, etc.);
4. **Exportation details** (how and when the goods were exported);
5. **Source of all materials**, including both **direct and indirect materials**, used in the production of the goods.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This includes detailed documentation of all inputs — even those not physically part of the final product (e.g., lubricants, tools, energy).

---

##### **B. Exporters with an Advance Ruling Certificate**

An exporter who has completed and signed a certificate under **subsection 97.1(1)** of the Act must, in addition to the above records, maintain for **six years from the date the certificate was signed**:

1. **Records relating to applications for or receipt of advance rulings** from the customs administration of the applicable free trade partner;
2. **If the exporter is not a producer**, they must also keep **written representations from the producer** stating that the goods meet the rules of origin under the applicable FTA.

> 💡 This ensures that exporters can demonstrate compliance with origin rules when challenged by a free trade partner.

---

##### **C. Producers of Commercial Goods**

A producer who has signed a certificate under subsection 97.1(1) and is required to keep records must maintain for **six years from the date of the certificate**:

1. **Purchase, cost, value, and payment records** for the commercial goods themselves;
2. **Purchase, cost, value, and payment records** for all materials and indirect materials used in production;
3. **Applications for or receipt of advance rulings** from the customs administration of the applicable free trade partner.

> 🔍 This places a strong obligation on producers to document every input into the production process, including indirect materials, which are often overlooked.

---

#### **5. Availability of Records for Verification**

Any person required to maintain records under these regulations must:

- **Provide access** to those records upon **written notification** from the customs administration of a free trade partner requesting a **verification visit**;
- Allow inspection at **all reasonable times**;
- Provide a **facility for inspection** (e.g., a secure office or digital system).

> ✅ This enables free trade partners to verify compliance with origin rules and ensures transparency in the supply chain.

---

#### **6. Format and Storage of Records**

The regulations allow flexibility in how records are stored, provided they are reliable and accessible:

- **Machine-sensible data media** (e.g., digital files, databases) are acceptable **if**:
  - They can be traced back to original source documents; and
  - The system can produce **accessible and readable copies** (e.g., PDFs, printouts).

- **Microfilm** is also permitted **if** it complies with **National Standard of Canada CAN2-72.11-79** ("Microfilm as Documentary Evidence"), published by the Canadian General Standards Board and amended from time to time.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The microfilm provision was later **repealed** (removed), indicating that digital formats are now preferred and sufficient.

---

#### **7. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 38 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 1996, c. 33)** comes into force.

- As noted in the footnote, **January 1, 1997**, is the effective date of the regulations in force.

---

#### **8. Repealed Provisions**

- A prior provision (repealed by **SOR/97-330, s. 6**) was previously included but has been removed.
- The microfilm requirement, though listed, was later **repealed**, reflecting a shift toward digital record-keeping.

| **Focus on Origin Compliance** | The rules ensure that both exporters and producers can prove that goods meet origin requirements under FTAs. |
| **Comprehensive Record-Keeping** | Covers not just direct inputs but also indirect materials (e.g., lubricants, tools, energy), which are often overlooked. |
| **Advance Ruling Support** | Requires documentation of advance rulings, which are critical for certainty in cross-border trade. |
| **Transparency & Verification** | Enables free trade partners to verify compliance through inspections, promoting trust in trade flows. |
| **Digital Flexibility** | Allows modern storage solutions (digital files) as long as traceability and accessibility are maintained. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Exporters' and Producers' Records Regulations** provide a clear, enforceable framework for maintaining accurate, detailed, and accessible records related to the production and export of commercial goods under Canada’s free trade agreements.
