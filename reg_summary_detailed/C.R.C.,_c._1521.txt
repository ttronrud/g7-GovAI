**Detailed Summary of Oil and Gas Land Order No. 1-1962**

---

**Order Citation:**  
This regulation is officially cited as *Oil and Gas Land Order No. 1-1962*.

---

**Governing Framework:**  
- The term *"Regulations"* refers to the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations*.  
- All words and phrases used in this Order are interpreted in accordance with their definitions and meanings within those Regulations.

### **1. Tender Terms for Exploratory Permits**

Tenders for exploratory permits on lands specified in **subsection 32(1)** of the Regulations may be issued under **one of two conditions**:

#### **Option A: Cash Bonus**
- The permittee must pay a **fixed sum of money** (a cash bonus) to Her Majesty (the Crown).
- In addition to this, the permittee must comply with all other provisions of the Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations.

#### **Option B: Exploratory Work Bonus**
- The permittee must **deposit with the Chief** (the regulatory authority) either:
  - Cash,
  - A bond, or
  - An approved promissory note (of value),
- The amount of the deposit must be **equal to the total amount the permittee commits to spend** on exploratory work within the first term of the permit.
- This commitment is governed by **Section 36** of the Regulations, which defines the initial term of a permit.

> **Key Point:** The exploratory work bonus is a performance-based condition tied directly to actual expenditures on exploration activities.

### **2. Tender Structure – Single Permit vs. Block of Permits**

- Tenders may be called for:
  - A **single exploratory permit**, or  
  - A **block of permits** (multiple permits together).

#### **Block of Permits Rule:**
- If a block of permits is granted, **no individual permit within that block may be granted separately**.
- The notice calling for tenders must **clearly state** whether permits are being offered singly or as a block.

> This ensures that permits in a block are treated as a unified unit for regulatory and operational purposes.

---

### **3. Management of Exploratory Work Bonus Deposits**

When a permit or block is granted **on the condition of an exploratory work bonus**, the following rules apply:

#### **a. Determination of Allowable Expenditure**
- The amount of expenditures deemed allowable (i.e., eligible) under the bonus condition is calculated **in the same way** as allowable expenditures under **Section 43** of the Regulations.
- This ensures consistency with the established rules for cost eligibility and audit.

#### **b. Return of Deposit**
- After the period specified in the condition (e.g., the initial term of the permit), the portion of the deposit that corresponds to **allowable expenditures** is **returned to the permittee**.
- The **remaining portion** of the deposit (i.e., unspent or unallowable amounts) is **forfeited to Her Majesty**.

#### **c. Use of Expenditures**
- All expenditures made to fulfill the exploratory work bonus must be **directed toward exploratory work** within the boundaries of the permit or block.

> This ensures that funds are used for legitimate exploration and not diverted to other activities.

---

### **4. Grouping of Permit Areas (for Coastal Coverage)**

#### **Exception for Coastal Areas:**
- If, in the opinion of the Chief, **any part of the permit area(s)** is covered by **seacoast waters**, and the permittee would otherwise be unable to meet the work bonus requirement due to geographical constraints:
  - The permittee may **apply to the Chief** to **group** multiple permit areas (even if they were originally granted separately) to fulfill the work bonus condition.
- This grouping is only permitted when **the entire or a significant portion** of a permit area lies within coastal waters.

#### **Governing Rules for Grouping:**
- The grouping must comply with **Sections 48 to 50** of the Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations.
- These sections likely cover:
  - Criteria for allowable grouping,
  - Operational feasibility,
  - Shared expenditure accountability,
  - Reporting and oversight requirements.

> This provision provides flexibility in areas where offshore or coastal exploration makes it impractical to conduct work in isolation.

---

### **5. Extension of Period for Drilling Operations**

#### **When Drilling Begins Before the Deadline:**
- If drilling operations **commence prior to the end** of the specified period under the exploratory work bonus condition, and the Chief determines that the operations will **continue beyond that period**:
  - The Chief may **extend** the deadline for completing the required work.
- However, **no extension may exceed**:
  - The original term of the permit, or
  - The term of any renewal of the permit.

> This ensures that work remains within the permit’s legal timeframe and prevents indefinite delays.

### **Key Objectives and Implications of the Order**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Encourage Exploration Investment** | By offering performance-based bonuses (work bonuses), the regulation incentivizes companies to invest in exploration, with financial returns tied to actual work. |
| **Ensure Accountability** | The deposit system and allowable expenditure rules ensure that funds are not misused and that only legitimate exploration costs are recognized. |
| **Promote Efficiency in Coastal Areas** | The grouping provision allows for practical exploration planning in coastal or offshore zones where isolated operations may be inefficient or uneconomical. |
| **Maintain Regulatory Oversight** | The Chief retains authority to approve groupings, extend periods, and determine allowable expenditures, ensuring consistent and fair enforcement. |
| **Balance Flexibility and Control** | The rules provide flexibility in operations while maintaining strict compliance with regulatory standards and financial accountability. |

### **Conclusion**

*Oil and Gas Land Order No. 1-1962* establishes a structured, transparent, and performance-based framework for issuing exploratory permits in Canada. It balances the need to attract investment in exploration with strong regulatory oversight. The dual tender options (cash bonus vs. work bonus), the block-granting mechanism, the deposit return system, and the flexibility for coastal area grouping reflect a pragmatic approach to managing oil and gas exploration on Crown lands. The rules ensure that expenditures are legitimate, funds are used appropriately, and the Crown retains control over the process while supporting responsible exploration activities.

This Order remains a foundational element in Canada’s regulatory approach to oil and gas land administration, particularly in the early stages of exploration.
