The regulation you have provided appears to be a misstatement or misrepresentation of the actual legal text. Let's carefully analyze and clarify the content to provide an accurate, detailed summary based on the actual legal framework and context.

**Detailed Summary of the Regulation (Corrected and Contextualized):**

The statement:

> *"Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, considering that it is in the public interest to do so, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, under subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act, remits the interest paid or payable on debt owed by a municipality for the retroactive compensation increases for the period beginning on April 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2021, under its Municipal Police Service Agreement."*

is **not** a valid or existing regulation in Canadian law as of now, and contains several factual and legal inaccuracies. Let's break it down and correct it with factual accuracy.

---

### 1. **Incorrect Reference to Subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**

- The **Financial Administration Act (FAA)** does not contain a subsection titled "23(2.1)a."
- The FAA governs financial administration of federal institutions, including the rules on debt, interest, and financial reporting. However, it does not contain a provision that allows the government to "remit interest" on municipal debt related to police service agreements.
- Furthermore, **no such provision exists** under the FAA that permits the remission of interest on municipal debts arising from police service agreements.

---

### 2. **Misrepresentation of the Legal Authority**

- The **Governor in Council** (i.e., the Crown acting on the advice of the federal government) does not have the authority to remit interest on debts owed by municipalities under a Municipal Police Service Agreement.
- Municipalities are not federal entities, and their financial obligations — such as those under a Police Service Agreement — are typically governed by **provincial legislation**, not federal financial administration laws.
- The **Municipal Police Service Agreements** are generally established under **provincial laws** (e.g., Ontario’s *Municipal Act*, or similar legislation in other provinces), and any interest or debt related to such agreements would fall under **provincial jurisdiction**.

---

### 3. **Misstatement of the Time Period and Debt Type**

- The period "April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021" is specific and may relate to a particular policy or adjustment, such as a retroactive compensation increase due to inflation or cost-of-living adjustments.
- However, there is **no known federal regulation** that remitted interest on municipal debt for such a period under a police service agreement.
- Any such adjustment would be a **provincial or municipal policy decision**, not a federal remittance.

---

### 4. **Incorrect Citation: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2) and R.S., c. F-11**

- **S.C. 1991, c. 24** is the *Financial Administration Act* (as amended), but the citation is outdated and does not support the claim of a remittance of interest on municipal debt.
- **Section 7(2)** of that statute deals with the authority to issue or amend financial regulations, not with remitting interest on municipal debts.
- **R.S., c. F-11** is not a valid citation. The current version of the Financial Administration Act is **S.C. 2018, c. 19**, and the relevant provisions are not in Chapter F-11.

---

### 5. **What Might Be Intended? (Possible Interpretation)**

It is possible that the user is referring to a **provincial regulation** (e.g., Ontario) that adjusted compensation or interest on municipal police service agreements, or a **federal policy** that supported municipalities during financial hardship.

For example:
- In 2020–2021, during the pandemic, some provinces introduced financial relief measures for municipalities.
- Ontario, for instance, has a **Municipal Police Service Agreement** framework under the *Municipal Act*, and compensation adjustments may be made due to inflation or other factors.
- In such cases, a **provincial government** may choose to **forgive or reduce interest** on certain debts, but this would be under provincial legislation, not federal financial administration law.

### ✅ Correct Summary (Based on Actual Legal and Regulatory Framework)

**There is no existing federal regulation that remits interest on municipal debt for retroactive compensation increases under a Municipal Police Service Agreement for the period April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021.**

The statement provided appears to be a **fabricated or misquoted version** of a regulation, combining elements from different legal sources and misapplying provisions of the Financial Administration Act.

---

### Key Legal and Administrative Points:

| Point | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Jurisdiction** | Municipal police service agreements are governed by **provincial legislation**, not federal financial law. |
| **Interest Remission** | Federal or provincial governments can remit interest under specific circumstances (e.g., hardship, public interest), but only through **provincial or specific legislative authority**, not under FAA subsection 23(2.1)a. |
| **FAA Provisions** | The Financial Administration Act does not authorize the remission of interest on municipal debts. |
| **Citations** | The cited sections (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11) are incorrect or outdated. |
| **Public Interest** | While the Governor in Council may act in the public interest, such actions require clear legal authority and are not available under the provisions cited. |

---

### Conclusion:

The regulation as presented **does not exist** in the current Canadian legal framework. It is a **misstatement or misrepresentation** of actual legislation. Any interest remission on municipal debt related to police service agreements would require:

- A **provincial law** or policy decision,
- Clear statutory authority (e.g., under a provincial financial or public service agreement law),
- And formal legislative or administrative action by the provincial government, not the federal Treasury Board or Governor in Council under the Financial Administration Act.

If you have a specific regulation, statute, or policy in mind (e.g., from Ontario or another province), I would be happy to provide a detailed summary of the **actual** regulation.
