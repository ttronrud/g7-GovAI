**Detailed Summary of the Origin Regulations (Safeguard Measures in Respect of the People’s Republic of China)**  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1997, c. 36 (as amended by S.C. 2002, c. 19 – Act to amend certain Acts as a result of the accession of the People’s Republic of China to the WTO)*

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**
These Origin Regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **paragraph 16(2)(a) of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules regarding the origin of goods for the purpose of determining whether a product qualifies as originating in a specific country—here, the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

The regulations were introduced in the context of **Canada’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)** in 1995 and the subsequent need to align Canadian trade laws with international obligations, particularly those under the **Agreement Establishing the WTO**. This particular set of origin rules ensures that Canada can apply appropriate trade measures—such as safeguard measures—based on whether a product originates in the PRC.

### **2. Definition of "People’s Republic of China" for Regulatory Purposes**
The regulations define **"People’s Republic of China"** as encompassing:
- The **customs territory** of the PRC,
- Including specific designated areas such as:
  - **Border trade regions**
  - **Minority autonomous areas**
  - **Special Economic Zones (SEZs)**
  - **Open coastal cities**
  - **Economic and technological development zones**
  - Other areas that operate under **special tariff, tax, or regulatory regimes**

> ✅ **Key Clarification**: The definition explicitly **excludes** any part of the customs territory of a **WTO Member other than the People’s Republic of China**.  
> This means that even if a product is manufactured in a special economic zone within China, it is still considered to originate in the PRC. However, if a product is produced in, say, Hong Kong or Macau (which are Special Administrative Regions of China but not part of the PRC customs territory under this definition), it would **not** be considered to originate in the PRC under these rules—unless those regions are specifically included in the definition (which they are not).

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: While Hong Kong and Macau are part of China, they are **not** included in the customs territory of the PRC under this regulation. Therefore, goods produced there would not be considered to originate in the PRC unless otherwise specified by law.

### **3. Criteria for "Origin" of Goods**
For the purposes of several key Canadian trade laws, a **good is said to originate in the People’s Republic of China** if it is:
- **Grown**
- **Produced**, or  
- **Manufactured**  
in the customs territory of the PRC.

This criterion is applied under the following legislative provisions:
- **Sections 77.1 to 77.8 of the Customs Tariff** (which govern the determination of origin for tariff treatment and preferential trade agreements)
- **Sections 30.2 to 30.25 of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act** (which relate to the adjudication of origin disputes and the role of the Tribunal)
- **Section 5.4 of the Export and Import Permits Act** (which determines whether a product qualifies for certain export or import permit exemptions or safeguards)

> 🔍 This means that even if a product undergoes partial processing or assembly in China, as long as the essential character of the product is created or formed in China through growth, production, or manufacturing, it will be deemed to originate in the PRC.

> ❌ Conversely, if a product is wholly or substantially transformed in another country (e.g., a component assembled in Canada), it will not be considered to originate in China.

### **4. Effective Date**
These Origin Regulations come into force on the date when **sections 4, 7, and 13** of the **Act to amend certain Acts as a result of the accession of the People’s Republic of China to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization** (chapter 19 of the Statutes of Canada, 2002) come into force.

- This date was **September 30, 2002**, as noted in the official notice.
- Therefore, the regulations became effective on **September 30, 2002**.

> This alignment ensures that Canada’s origin rules for Chinese goods were fully implemented in coordination with its WTO accession obligations and domestic legislative updates.

---

### **5. Purpose and Significance**
The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To provide **clarity and consistency** in determining the origin of goods from the PRC.
- To support Canada’s **compliance with WTO obligations**, particularly regarding the treatment of goods from member countries.
- To enable the application of **safeguard measures** (e.g., temporary import restrictions or duties) when necessary to protect domestic industries from unfair or excessive surges in imports from China.
- To ensure that **trade policy decisions** are based on accurate origin determinations.

These rules are foundational for:
- Determining eligibility for **preferential tariff treatment** (e.g., under free trade agreements)
- Applying **anti-dumping or countervailing duties**
- Conducting **origin investigations** under the Canadian International Trade Tribunal
- Administering **export and import permits** under the Export and Import Permits Act

### **Conclusion**
The Origin Regulations (Safeguard Measures in Respect of the People’s Republic of China) establish a clear, legally binding framework for determining whether goods originate in China. By defining the scope of the PRC customs territory and setting a strict threshold for origin (growth, production, or manufacturing), these regulations support Canada’s ability to enforce trade policies in a manner consistent with international commitments and domestic legal requirements. They remain a critical component of Canada’s trade administration system, especially in the context of safeguard measures and origin disputes involving Chinese imports.
