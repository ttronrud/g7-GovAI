    - Old age pension
    - Widow/widower pension
    - Orphan’s pension

  - That time **does not count** toward Finnish residency requirements for pension eligibility.

### 7. **Replacement of Article IX (Pension Entitlement Rules)**
A **new Article IX** replaces the old one, providing detailed rules for pension eligibility in Finland:

#### ➤ Entitlement Conditions:
| Benefit | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Old Age Pension** | Resided in Finland for **at least 3 years after age 16**, continuously |
| **Widow/Widower Pension** | Spouse and deceased spouse both resided in Finland for ≥3 years after age 16; deceased spouse was a citizen of one party |
| **Orphan’s Pension** | Deceased parent resided in Finland for ≥3 years after age 16 and was a citizen of one party |

#### ➤ Continuity of Benefits:
- If a person receives a pension in Finland and later moves to Canada, they **retain eligibility** to receive the pension in Canada **if they met the 3-year residency requirement**.

#### ➤ Future Period Credit (Disability/Death)
- If a person becomes disabled or dies and **fails to meet Finnish residency requirements** for future periods:
  - **Canada Pension Plan (CPP) creditable periods** will be counted **as if completed in Finland**, **provided they do not overlap**.
- If employment/self-employment in Finland ends and the pension no longer includes future periods:
  - CPP creditable periods will be used to meet future period requirements.

#### ➤ Benefit Calculation Rules:
- For cases involving both Finnish and CPP periods:
  - **Actual Finnish creditable periods** are used to calculate the benefit under Finnish law.
  - **Future period benefit** is prorated based on the ratio:
    - (Actual Finnish creditable periods) / 480 months (i.e., 40 years)
  - This ensures proportionality and fairness.

#### ➤ Retroactive Application:
- **Creditable periods completed before January 1, 1997** are valid for determining eligibility under the new Protocol.
- **No right to benefits before January 1, 1997** is created by this Protocol.

  - **Pre-1997 period**: Benefit calculated under **previous agreement**.
  - **Post-1997 period**: Benefit recalculated under **new Protocol terms**.
  - **Only if the new calculation results in a more favorable outcome** for the beneficiary.
