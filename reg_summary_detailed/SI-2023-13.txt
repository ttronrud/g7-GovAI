The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Below is a detailed summary of its content, context, and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) – Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is made under **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29). This subsection empowers the Governor General in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the scientific assessments of species at risk conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Acknowledgment of Assessments:**  
   The Governor General in Council formally acknowledges receipt of the COSEWIC assessments for specific species listed in the **annexed schedule**. This means that the federal government has officially recognized the scientific evaluations completed by COSEWIC regarding the status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern) of these species.

2. **Scientific Basis for Designation:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent, expert committee composed of scientists and conservation professionals. Its assessments are based on rigorous scientific data, including population trends, distribution, threats, and ecological requirements. The acknowledgment in this regulation validates that these assessments have been reviewed and accepted as the foundation for further regulatory actions under SARA.

3. **Trigger for Regulatory Action:**  
   Under subsection 23(1) of SARA, once the Minister of the Environment receives and acknowledges a COSEWIC assessment, it serves as the basis for the government to determine whether a species should be listed as **endangered**, **threatened**, or **special concern** in the official *List of Species at Risk*. This step is critical because listing triggers legal protections and management responsibilities under the Act.

4. **Timing and Process:**  
   This Order is made *on the making of the Order*—meaning the acknowledgment occurs immediately upon the issuance of the regulation. It does not require additional steps or delays, streamlining the process of transitioning from scientific evaluation to legal classification.

5. **Scope:**  
   The regulation specifically refers to species listed in an **annexed schedule**, which is not included in your text. In practice, such schedules typically include species such as the **Atlantic salmon**, **wood bison**, **boreal caribou**, or other wildlife species identified by COSEWIC as being at risk. The exact list would be detailed in the attached schedule to the regulation.

6. **Purpose and Significance:**  
   - Ensures transparency and accountability in species protection decisions.  
   - Establishes a formal link between scientific assessment and legal action.  
   - Supports the implementation of conservation measures, such as habitat protection, recovery plans, and restrictions on activities that threaten the species.

**Context within the Species at Risk Act (SARA):**

- SARA, enacted in 2002, is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife at risk of extinction.  
- The Act establishes a three-step process:  
  1. Scientific assessment by COSEWIC.  
  2. Formal listing of species by the federal government (via this type of Order).  
  3. Development of recovery strategies and action plans.  
- This regulation represents the second step in that process.

---

**Implications:**

- Once a species is formally acknowledged and listed under SARA, it becomes subject to legal protection.  
- The government must then develop a recovery strategy and, if necessary, implement recovery actions.  
- Prohibitions on activities that harm or destroy habitat, or that interfere with the species’ survival, may be introduced.  
- Stakeholders (e.g., Indigenous communities, industry, environmental groups) may be consulted during the recovery planning phase.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a critical administrative step in Canada’s species conservation framework. By formally acknowledging COSEWIC’s scientific assessments, the federal government affirms the credibility of the evaluation and commits to taking legal action to protect the listed species. It marks the official transition from scientific identification to legal protection under the *Species at Risk Act*, ensuring that conservation efforts are grounded in sound science and responsive to ecological needs.
