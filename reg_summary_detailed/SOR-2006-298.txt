Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, legal basis, procedural background, and key implications:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Legal Framework and Statutory Authority**
The regulation is issued under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, specifically:
- **Section 332(1)a**: This section empowers the Minister of the Environment to publish a *proposed Virtual Elimination List* (VEL) in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*. The VEL identifies substances that are considered to have no significant risk to human health or the environment and are therefore not subject to further regulatory action—effectively being "virtually eliminated" from regulatory oversight.
- **Section 65(2)**: This section authorizes the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health to **finalize and adopt** a Virtual Elimination List after receiving public comments and addressing objections, provided that the proposed list has been properly reviewed and the public has had a meaningful opportunity to participate.

#### **2. Procedural Background**
- On **August 16, 2003**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed Virtual Elimination List** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*. 
- The proposed list was presented in an annexed format and was intended to identify certain chemical substances that were deemed to pose negligible risk to human health or the environment.
- The public was given a **formal opportunity to comment** on the proposed list. Individuals, organizations, or stakeholders could:
  - Submit written comments in support or opposition to the inclusion of specific substances.
  - File a **notice of objection**, which would trigger the establishment of a **Board of Review** to examine the objection and determine whether the substance should remain on or be removed from the list.
- This public consultation process is a critical element of CEPA’s requirement for transparency, public participation, and scientific justification in regulatory decisions.

#### **3. Finalization and Adoption**
- Following the public comment period, the Ministers of the Environment and Health jointly **adopted the Virtual Elimination List** on:
  - **August 21, 2006** (Minister of the Environment: Rona Ambrose)
  - **November 22, 2006** (Minister of Health: Tony Clement)
- The adoption is formalized under **Section 65(2)** of CEPA 1999, which allows for the finalization of the list after public input and review.
- The list is **registered** and becomes legally binding upon registration in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, which serves as the official publication of federal regulations.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The Virtual Elimination List becomes effective on the **date of registration** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*. This ensures that the list is formally recognized and enforceable in Canadian environmental and health policy.

#### **5. Key Objectives and Implications**
- **Risk Reduction**: The list serves to eliminate substances that are not considered to pose a significant risk, thereby reducing regulatory burden and administrative costs.
- **Scientific Justification**: Substances are included only after rigorous risk assessment, ensuring that decisions are based on scientific evidence.
- **Public Participation**: The process ensures transparency and accountability by allowing stakeholders to voice concerns and request review.
- **Regulatory Efficiency**: By identifying substances that are "virtually eliminated," the government streamlines regulatory oversight, focusing resources on substances that actually present risks.

#### **6. Role of the Ministers**
- The **Minister of the Environment** leads the environmental assessment and regulatory decision-making.
- The **Minister of Health** provides a health-based review, ensuring that the absence of risk to human health is adequately substantiated.
- Their joint approval reflects the inter-agency coordination required under CEPA, particularly where health and environmental risks intersect.

#### **7. Limitations and Scope**
- The term *“virtual elimination”* does **not** mean the substances are completely harmless or safe. Rather, it means that the risk is so low that regulatory action is not justified under CEPA.
- The list is **not a blanket exemption**. It is based on specific scientific assessments and risk evaluations.
- The list is **periodic** and may be reviewed or updated in response to new scientific data or public concerns.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a formal, legally binding step in Canada’s environmental governance framework. It reflects the government’s commitment to science-based, transparent, and efficient regulation of chemical substances. By adopting the Virtual Elimination List after a public consultation and inter-ministerial review, the Canadian government ensures that regulatory efforts are focused on substances that actually pose risks, while minimizing unnecessary oversight for those with negligible impacts.

This process aligns with CEPA’s broader goals of protecting human health and the environment through proportionate, evidence-based regulation.
