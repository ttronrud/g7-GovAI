### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Buyer** | A person who acquires or receives wood that is subject to the *Plan* from a producer. (French: *acheteur*) |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Syndicat des propriétaires forestiers de la région de Québec* (Quebec Region Wood Producers’ Syndicate). This body is responsible for collecting and managing levies. |
| **Plan** | The *Plan conjoint des producteurs de bois de la région de Québec* (Joint Plan of Wood Producers in the Quebec Region), found in *RLRQ, c. M-35.1, r. 124*. This is the overarching framework governing wood production, marketing, and financial obligations. |

### **3. Obligation to Pay Levies**

Every **producer** who markets wood in **interprovincial or export trade** is legally required to pay levies to the **Commodity Board**. These levies are specified in two primary regulations:

1. **Règlement sur les contributions des producteurs de bois de la région de Québec**  
   *(Regulation on Producer Contributions – RLRQ, c. M-35.1, r. 117.1)*  
   → This regulation sets out the **specific contribution rates** or levies that producers must pay based on the volume, type, or value of wood marketed.

2. **Règlement sur les fonds du Syndicat des propriétaires forestiers de la région de Québec**  
   *(Regulation on Syndicate Funds – RLRQ, c. M-35.1, r. 121.1)*  
   → This regulation governs the **management, allocation, and use of funds** collected from producers, including how revenues are used for forest-related initiatives, research, or support programs.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These regulations are subject to amendment over time. The levies are adjusted as necessary to reflect market conditions, policy goals, or administrative needs.

### **4. Payment Mechanisms**

The levies can be paid in one of several ways, depending on the circumstances:

- **Direct payment by the producer** to the Commodity Board at its head office in **Quebec City, Quebec**.
- **Deduction from the sale price** by the Commodity Board, which is then remitted to the producer (i.e., the producer receives the sale proceeds minus the levy).
- **Deduction by the buyer**, with the buyer remitting the levy directly to the Commodity Board.

> 🔍 This flexibility allows for different trade arrangements and ensures that the levy is collected efficiently whether through the producer, the seller, or the buyer.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The provisions regarding deductions and payment mechanisms were **repealed** by:
> - **SOR/2009-312, s. 3** (repealed the deduction clauses)
> - **SOR/2014-245, s. 2** (repealed the reference to the levy regulations)

This indicates that the **original payment mechanisms have been replaced or superseded**, likely by updated regulatory frameworks or administrative procedures. The current Order may now serve more as a formal recognition of the levy structure than a detailed instruction on how to pay.

### **5. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**: The Order came into force on **May 1, 1998**.
- **Enforcement**: The levies apply to all wood marketed outside Quebec (interprovincial trade) or exported from Quebec. Producers are legally bound to comply with the levy requirements under the authority of the *Quebec Wood Order, 1983* and the *Plan*.

---

### **6. Key Observations and Implications**

- **Purpose**: The Order ensures that producers contributing to the regional wood industry contribute financially to the sustainability, development, and support of the sector through the Commodity Board.
- **Funding Use**: Funds collected are likely used for:
  - Forest management and conservation
  - Research and innovation in wood production
  - Market development and promotion
  - Environmental protection and long-term planning
- **Regulatory Evolution**: The repeal of specific payment mechanisms (in 2009 and 2014) suggests that the regulatory framework has evolved to modernize collection processes, possibly introducing digital systems, direct billing, or new governance models.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Quebec Region Wood Producers’ Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that ensures **financial accountability and sustainability** in Quebec’s wood industry. It mandates that producers of wood marketed outside Quebec or exported pay levies to the Commodity Board, as defined in two key regulations. While the original payment mechanisms have been repealed, the Order continues to establish the legal basis for levy collection and underscores the role of the Quebec Wood Producers’ Syndicate in managing forest sector revenues.

This Order reflects a long-standing commitment to balancing producer obligations with the broader economic and environmental interests of the Quebec forestry sector.

---

**Final Note**: Given the repeals of specific provisions (2009 and 2014), this Order should be interpreted in the context of **current, updated regulations** that may have replaced the payment mechanisms. It remains a key historical and legal reference for the levy structure established in the 1990s.
