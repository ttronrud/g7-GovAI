**Detailed Summary of the Northwest Territories Borrowing Limits Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Source**
The *Northwest Territories Borrowing Limits Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 20(5)a of the Northwest Territories Act**.  
- **Statutory Citation**: S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 214(2); R.S., c. N-27  
- These regulations establish the definition and scope of what constitutes "borrowing" for the purposes of borrowing limits and financial disclosure requirements under the *Northwest Territories Act*, specifically subsections 28(2) and (4).

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

#### **Definition of "Government"**
- The term **"government"** refers to the **Government Reporting Entity (GRE)** as defined in the *CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook*, as amended from time to time.  
- This ensures consistency in financial reporting and accountability across public sector entities within the Northwest Territories.

### **3. What Constitutes Borrowing (Section 2(1))**

Under these regulations, the following are considered **borrowings** for the purposes of borrowing limits and financial disclosure under the Northwest Territories Act:

#### **(a) Loans Received by Government**
- Any obligation arising from a loan of money received by the government, including:
  - Bonds, debentures, notes, or other instruments of indebtedness issued or sold by the government.
- **Value Calculation**:
  - Equals the **sum of outstanding principal and accrued interest**.
  - For **discount bonds**, the value is the **principal repayable at maturity**.
  - **Exclusion**: Amounts held in **custodial accounts** that are outside the government’s control and used solely for loan repayment are **excluded** from the borrowing value.

> *Example*: If the government issues a bond with a $10 million face value and $500,000 in accrued interest, the borrowing value is $10.5 million. If a portion of the funds is held in a non-controllable custodial account, that portion is not included.

#### **(b) Capital Leases**
- A capital lease entered into by the government is considered a borrowing **if its value exceeds the threshold for disclosure required in the Territorial Accounts**.
- The **value of the lease obligation** is determined in accordance with the **CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook**, as amended.

> *Note*: This applies only when the lease value exceeds the disclosure threshold. If the lease is below that threshold, it does not count as borrowing for regulatory purposes.

#### **(c) Sale-Leaseback Transactions**
- A liability arises when the government **sells a tangible capital asset** and then leases it back.
- This constitutes a borrowing **only if the value of the liability exceeds the disclosure threshold** in the Territorial Accounts.
- The **value of the liability** is determined according to the **CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook**, as amended.

> *Example*: If the government sells a building for $5 million and leases it back for $1 million per year, and the lease liability exceeds the disclosure threshold, it counts as a borrowing.

#### **(d) Loan Guarantees**
- A **contingent liability** incurred when the government provides a **loan guarantee** is considered a borrowing.
- The value of this contingent liability is equal to the **full amount disclosed in the Territorial Accounts**.

> *Note*: This is a contingent liability — it only becomes a real obligation if the underlying loan defaults. However, it is still counted as borrowing for regulatory and transparency purposes.

### **4. What Does NOT Constitute Borrowing (Section 2(2))**

The following **do not** count as borrowing:

#### **(a) Internal Transactions Between Government Entities**
- Any obligation, liability, or contingent liability arising from transactions **between two parties within the government** (e.g., between the Department of Finance and the Department of Transportation).
- These are excluded because they are internal and do not represent external debt or exposure to creditors.

> *Rationale*: To prevent double-counting and ensure that borrowing limits reflect actual external financial exposure.

#### **(b) Specific Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Loans**
- Portions of loans from the **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** to the **Northwest Territories Housing Corporation (NTHC)** are **excluded** from borrowing if:
  - The loan was made for projects under **Section 79 of the National Housing Act** or for a purpose under **Section 82 of the National Housing Act as it read before June 17, 1999**.
  - The loan amount has been **used to reduce the outstanding balance** of the original loan.
  - The funding from CMHC has been **used to reduce the debt** owed.

> *Key Exception*: This exclusion applies **only** to those specific types of loans and only when the funds have been applied to reduce the loan balance.

> *Note*: This provision recognizes historical and targeted housing financing arrangements and prevents overstatement of borrowing in those specific cases.

### **5. Purpose of the Regulations**

These regulations serve several key functions:

1. **Clarity in Defining Borrowing**  
   - Establishes clear, standardized definitions of when a financial obligation counts as "borrowing" for regulatory and reporting purposes.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**

3. **Compliance with Public Sector Accounting Standards**  
   - Aligns borrowing calculations with **CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook**, ensuring consistency with national public sector accounting practices.

4. **Prevention of Overstatement**  
   - Excludes internal transactions and certain CMHC loans to avoid inflating borrowing totals and misrepresenting financial risk.

5. **Support for Borrowing Limits**  
   - Provides a basis for setting and monitoring borrowing limits under the *Northwest Territories Act*, which helps ensure fiscal responsibility and prudent financial management.

### **6. Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Division 4 of Part 4 of the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.
