**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1996, No. 1**

---

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act* of Canada, specifically **paragraph 29(1)(a)**. This provision allows the Governor in Council (the federal government’s highest executive body) to authorize certain government employees to acquire an interest in territorial lands, subject to specific conditions and procedures. The order is made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, reflecting the department’s responsibility for land and resource management in northern Canada.

**2. Official Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1996, No. 1**  
This citation enables legal reference to the order in land records, court proceedings, and administrative documents.

---

**3. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize a specific employee of the Government of Canada** to acquire a legal interest in certain lands located in the **Northwest Territories (NWT)**. This is a special exception to standard land use policies, permitting a government employee to hold or transfer land interests under defined circumstances—typically to support personal or family needs, such as housing or investment—while maintaining accountability and transparency.

**4. Authorized Employee and Land Description**  
The employee authorized under this Order is:  
**Patricia Jane Knutson**, an employee of the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (now known as the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada).

The land interest being acquired is:  
- **Lot 1012** in **Quad 85 I/12**  
- Located in the **Northwest Territories**  
- As shown on a **plan of survey** recorded under number **65767** in the *Canada Lands Surveys Records* at Ottawa  
- A copy of this survey is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife**, under reference number **1316**

---

**5. Nature of the Acquisition**  
The Order authorizes the acquisition of an **indirect or equitable interest** in the land. This means that while Patricia Jane Knutson is not directly purchasing the land, she is acquiring a legal interest through a **lease assignment** from the current lessee to her spouse.

Specifically:  
- The lease covering **Lot 1012** is being **assigned** to **Dana Benjamin Knutson**, Patricia Jane Knutson’s spouse.  
- The assignment covers the **entire parcel** of the lot.  
- The assignment is effective as of the date of the Order.

**6. Exclusions and Reservations**  
Crucially, the Order includes **specific exclusions and reservations** of rights:  
- **All mines and minerals**, including **hydrocarbons** (such as oil, gas, or natural gas), are **excluded** from the acquisition.  
- These include **solid, liquid, and gaseous** forms of mineral resources.  
- The right to **work or extract** these minerals is **reserved** to the Crown or any future rights holder under applicable mineral rights legislation.  

This ensures that the government retains control over valuable natural resources on the land, even if the employee acquires surface rights or equitable interests.

---

**7. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The Order is a formal legal instrument that creates a binding interest in the land under territorial land laws.  
- It is subject to review and compliance with the *Territorial Lands Act* and related regulations.  
- The fact that the employee is from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development may imply a connection to Indigenous land governance or northern development policy, though the Order does not explicitly link the acquisition to Indigenous rights or land claims.  
- The land registration and survey documentation ensures transparency and legal enforceability.

---

**8. Significance and Context**  
This Order reflects a rare and limited use of federal land acquisition authority for government employees. Such provisions are typically used in cases where:  
- Employees require land for personal or family use (e.g., housing, retirement, or family business).  
- The land is not subject to major development or mineral extraction.  
- The Crown maintains control over valuable subsurface resources.  

It also underscores the balance between allowing government personnel to benefit from land use and preserving public interest in natural resource management.

The *Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1996, No. 1* authorizes **Patricia Jane Knutson**, an employee of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, to acquire an **indirect equitable interest** in **Lot 1012, Quad 85 I/12** in the Northwest Territories via assignment of a lease to her spouse, Dana Benjamin Knutson. The acquisition is fully documented, legally grounded, and includes a clear reservation of all mineral rights—including hydrocarbons—ensuring that the Crown retains control over subsurface resources. This Order is a specific, limited exception to standard land use policies and serves both administrative and personal purposes under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act*.
