**Detailed Summary of the *Special-purpose Vessels Regulations* (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Special-purpose Vessels Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities**, under specific provisions of the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001** (specifically **paragraph 35(1)(e)a**, **section 100**, and **subsection 120(1)**). These regulations establish mandatory safety standards for **inflatable vessels used in excursion activities in Canadian waters**, particularly those involving **persons on remuneration** (i.e., commercial excursions).

These regulations are **not applicable** to **motorized rigid-hull inflatable vessels (RIVs)**, which are governed by different rules.

---

### **Scope of Application**

- Applies to **Canadian vessels that are inflatable** and carry **persons on an excursion in Canadian waters for remuneration**.
- Does **not apply** to:
  - Motorized rigid-hull inflatable vessels (RIVs).
  - Non-excursion activities or private use.

---

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Class 3 or above waters** | Waters with rapids that have moderate to irregular waves, or stronger rapids with more obstructions or navigational difficulty than typical. |
| **Guide** | Refers to the master or operator of the vessel (the person in charge). |
| **Helmet** | A helmet with a fastening system designed to protect the head from the forehead to the back of the crown. |

### **Core Safety Requirements**

#### **1. Vessel Condition and Design**
- Every vessel must be of **sound construction** and in **good condition** to withstand expected weather and water conditions.
- Must have a **becketed line or safety straps** around the outside (gunwale) for handgrips.
- Must maintain **buoyancy even if one buoyancy chamber deflates** (i.e., must be safe in case of puncture or failure).
- Must have **sufficient seating** so that every person on board can be seated.

#### **2. Loading Restrictions**
- No vessel may be loaded beyond the **manufacturer’s capacity recommendations**.

#### **3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Requirements**

| Scenario | Required Equipment |
|--------|---------------------|
| All persons on an excursion (excluding guide) | Must be provided with a **properly sized small-vessel lifejacket or white-water vest**. |
| Before January 1, 2012 (in waters not Class 3+) | A **personal flotation device (PFD)** may be used instead of a lifejacket or vest. |
| Guide on excursion | Must have a **properly sized small-vessel lifejacket, white-water vest, or inherently buoyant PFD with a quick-release harness**. |
| In Class 3 or above waters (excluding motorized vessels >6 m) | Every person (excluding guide) must wear a **helmet**. |
| In Class 3 or above waters where water temperature <15°C (excluding motorized vessels >6 m) | Must wear **thermal protection gear** (e.g., wetsuit) to protect core body temperature. |

> **Note**: These requirements are **conditional**—they only apply in Class 3 or above waters, and with exceptions for certain vessel types (e.g., vessels over 6 meters long).

#### **4. Equipment Markings and Maintenance**
All PPE must:
- Be **marked in English and French**.
- Meet specific **Canadian standards**:
  - **Small-vessel lifejackets**: Must meet **CAN/CGSB-65.7-M88** (Inherently buoyant type) or **CAN/CGSB-65.7-2007** (Class 2 lifejacket).
  - **Personal flotation devices (PFDs)**: Must meet **CAN/CGSB-65.11-M88** (Type I PFD).
  - **White-water vests**: Must be **approved by the U.S. Coast Guard** for commercial white-water use.
- **Not be altered** in a way that:
  - Compromises structural integrity.
  - Diminishes readability of labels or markings.
- Must be in **good condition** and **maintained or replaced** according to manufacturer’s instructions.

> **Exception**: A person who provides their own compliant gear is considered to have been provided with it.
