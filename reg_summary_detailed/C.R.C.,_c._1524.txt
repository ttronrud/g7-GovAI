This regulation outlines the **permits, restrictions, responsibilities, and procedural requirements** for activities involving the use of land for exploration, development, or infrastructure work.

Below is a **comprehensive, detailed summary** of the regulation, organized by key themes and sections for clarity and understanding.

## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation governs **land use operations** (i.e., any work or undertaking on territorial lands that requires a permit), including drilling, excavation, construction, and surveying. It establishes:

- Definitions of key terms
- Applicable geographic zones
- Types of permits (Class A and Class B)
- Prohibited or restricted activities without permits
- Environmental and cultural protection obligations
- Permit application and approval process
- Restoration and reporting requirements
- Emergency provisions

> ⚠️ **Important Note**:  
> This regulation has been **repealed or amended** in parts over time:
> - **SOR/2003-126, s. 4** was repealed (as noted in the text).
> - **SOR/2016-132, s. 1** repealed the definition of "territorial lands" — indicating that the scope of the regulation may no longer apply in full.
> - The regulation is largely **historical**, reflecting policies from the early 2000s, and may no longer be in force or fully applicable in current land management frameworks.

However, the **structure, content, and principles** of this regulation remain **highly relevant** to understanding past land use controls in Canada’s northern territories.
