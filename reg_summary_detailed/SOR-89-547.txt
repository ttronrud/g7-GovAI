These regulations, made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, are designed to establish a standardized and legally sound form for deeds related to the **acceptance, renunciation, or settlement of a succession** involving Cree or Naskapi beneficiaries.

(Can be cited as: *Form of Deeds Relating to Certain Successions of Cree and Naskapi Beneficiaries Regulations*)

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **"Deed"**: Refers specifically to a legal instrument that relates to the **acceptance, renunciation, or settlement of a succession** as defined in **Section 177 of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act**.

### **Mandatory Requirements for a Valid Deed**

Every deed must contain the following elements:

1. **Date of Execution**  
   The deed must clearly state the date on which it was made.

2. **Place of Execution**  
   The location (city, province, etc.) where the deed was signed must be specified.

3. **Identification of Parties**  
   Each party involved (e.g., beneficiary, heir, or person with legal incapacity) must be:
   - Clearly named;
   - Adequately identified (e.g., by full name, birth date, tribal affiliation, or other identifying information).

4. **Precise Description of Property**  
   The deed must provide a **clear, accurate, and legally precise description** of the property involved. This includes:
   - Movable property (e.g., vehicles, personal belongings);
   - Immovable property (e.g., land, buildings);
   - Traditional property (e.g., cultural or ceremonial items, ancestral lands, or heritage assets).

> *Note:* This requirement ensures that property interests are unambiguously defined, which is essential for legal recognition and registration.

### **Form of the Deed: Authentic vs. Non-Authentic**

#### **1. Authentic Form (Preferred)**
- A deed may be executed in **authentic form**, which typically means:
  - Signed in the presence of two witnesses;
  - Verified by a notary public or authorized official;
  - Follows formal legal procedures recognized in Quebec law.
- Authentic deeds are considered more secure and are generally preferred for legal enforceability and registration purposes.

#### **2. Non-Authentic Form (Alternative)**
- If a deed is **not made in authentic form**, it must still be valid and legally binding.
- In such cases, the deed must be **signed by each party**.

---

### **Special Provisions for Parties Unable to Sign**

A party who is **unable to sign** their name due to physical, mental, or legal incapacity may still participate in the deed through one of the following methods:

1. **Marking the Deed**  
   - The party may make a **clear, identifiable mark** (e.g., a signature-like symbol) on the deed.  
   - The deed must include a **declaration** stating:
     - That the party is unable to sign their name;
     - That the mark is their intention to acknowledge the deed.

2. **Proxy Signature (with Witness)**
   - A **third party** may sign on the party’s behalf.
   - This proxy must:
     - Be authorized by the incapacitated party;
     - Sign in the **presence of the party**;
     - Follow the party’s instructions.
   - The deed must include a **declaration** stating:
     - That the party is unable to sign;
     - That the person signing on their behalf did so **in the presence of and according to the instructions of the party**.

> *This provision respects the autonomy and rights of individuals with legal incapacity while ensuring legal validity.*

### **Witnessing Requirements for Non-Authentic Deeds**

For every party (including those represented by a proxy), the deed must be signed by:

- **Two witnesses** who:
  - Know the party personally;
  - Are not related to the party (see below);
  - Are not mentally incapacitated;
  - Are of **age of majority** (18 years or older in Quebec);
  - Have **no financial or personal interest** in the deed.

> *Exception:* If a person signs on behalf of a party (a proxy), then **that proxy person** must also be listed as a witness.

Each witness must attach an **affidavit** to the deed that includes:

1. A declaration that:
   - The witness personally knows the party (or the proxy);
   - The witness knows the party’s identity and the circumstances of the signature or mark.

2. A certification of:
   - The **signature** of the party (or the proxy’s signature), confirming its authenticity.

> *Purpose:* The affidavit serves as a legal verification of the identity and consent of the parties involved, strengthening the deed’s validity.

- Have **not reached the age of majority** (i.e., under 18);
- Is **mentally incapacitated**;
- Has a **direct financial or personal interest** in the deed;
- Is the **spouse or a relative of the first degree** (e.g., parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild) of the party.

> *Rationale:* This exclusion prevents conflicts of interest, fraud, or undue influence, particularly in matters involving Indigenous land and cultural property.

### **Limitation on Exemption from Other Regulations**

- All deeds must comply with the **land registry requirements** governing:
  - Registration procedures;
  - Property descriptions;
  - Public recordkeeping;
  - Access and transparency.

> *This ensures that even if a deed is properly formatted under these regulations, it remains subject to the full legal and administrative framework of the land registry system.*
