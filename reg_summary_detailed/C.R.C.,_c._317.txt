### **Detailed Summary of the Adjustment Assistance Benefit Regulations (Footwear and Tanning Workers)**

These regulations establish a specific framework for providing **pre-retirement benefits** to employees of Canadian manufacturers in the **footwear and tanning industries** who have been laid off due to **import competition**. The goal is to offer financial assistance during periods of unemployment, particularly when such layoffs are linked to external market pressures, and to ensure that affected workers are not left without support before reaching retirement age.

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

- The regulations are known as the **Adjustment Assistance Benefit Regulations (Footwear and Tanning Workers)**.
- They apply **only to employees in the footwear and tanning industries** in Canada.
- The primary objective is to provide **temporary financial assistance** (a pre-retirement benefit) to workers who have lost their jobs due to **reductions in employment caused by import competition** — specifically, when foreign-made footwear increases market share in Canada and reduces domestic production.

> These regulations are **not general unemployment benefits**, but rather a targeted program designed to assist those in specific sectors facing economic disruption from international competition.

## **3. Eligibility Requirements for Certification**

The **Enterprise Development Board (Board)** must certify a group of workers or a class of workers as eligible to apply for the pre-retirement benefit **only if**:

### ✅ **Conditions for Certification:**
1. **Workforce Reduction:**
   - The lay-off must reduce the workforce by **at least 10% or 50 employees**, whichever is **smaller**.
   - The reduction must occur over a **minimum period of four weeks**.

2. **Cause of Lay-off: Import Competition**
   - The lay-off must be **directly attributable** to increased market share in Canada of **foreign-made footwear**.
   - This must result in a **decline in domestic footwear production** by the manufacturer.

> ⚠️ **Exclusion Clause**:  
> The Board **will not certify** any lay-off that occurred:
> - **Before January 1, 1976**, or  
> - **After December 31, 1982**,  
> **if** the lay-off was due to increased foreign competition and declining domestic output.

> This effectively limits the program to a defined period (1976–1982), focusing on a time when such import competition was most acute.

---

## **4. Who Can Apply for the Benefit?**

Applications must be submitted by:
- A **labor union** or **worker representative group** representing employees of a Canadian manufacturer.

The Commission (CEIC) administers the process and will:
- Review applications.
- Determine eligibility.
- Pay benefits if conditions are met.

---

## **5. Conditions for Receiving a Pre-retirement Benefit**

An employee may receive the benefit **only if** they meet **all** of the following conditions:

| Requirement | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1. Employment History** | Employed by a Canadian manufacturer for **at least 10 of the 15 years** immediately before the lay-off. Must have worked **at least 1,000 hours per year** in each of those 10 years. |
| **2. Age** | Must be **at least 54 years old** but **under 65 years old** at the time of lay-off. |
| **3. Certification** | Must be certified by the Commission as a **resident of Canada** with **no prospect of re-employment**, either: <br> - With or without training/relocation assistance, or <br> - Accepting employment with earnings **less than their average weekly insurable earnings**. |

> This ensures that the benefit is reserved for workers who are genuinely displaced and not simply seeking a job at a lower wage.

---

## **6. Review and Suspension of Certification**

- The Commission **reviews the eligibility of each certified employee at least every 12 months**.
- If the employee no longer meets the requirements (e.g., finds employment or resumes work), the certification is **suspended**.
- If the certification is suspended, **benefits are suspended** for that employee.

> This ensures ongoing accountability and prevents long-term benefits from being paid to workers who become employable.

---

## **7. False Statements and Disqualification**

- If an employee makes a **false or misleading statement** in their application, the Commission may declare them **disqualified**.
- The disqualification applies to **up to the first three weeks** after the date of the false statement.
- The amount deducted is **1/5 of the weekly benefit** for each day of disqualification.

> This protects the integrity of the program by deterring fraud.

---

## **8. Duration and Termination of Benefit**

- The **pre-retirement benefit period** begins when the employee's **unemployment insurance benefit period ends**.
- It **ends when**:
  - The employee reaches **age 65**, or  
  - Becomes eligible for a **retirement pension** under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or **Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)** — whichever comes first.

> The benefit is **not available after age 65**, ensuring it supports workers transitioning into retirement.

---

## **9. Benefit Amount and Calculation**

- **Maximum Weekly Benefit**:  
  = **66⅔%** of the employee’s average weekly insurable earnings  
  → Rounded to the **nearest cent**.

> Example: If average weekly earnings = $500 → Benefit = $333.33

> **Insurable Earnings Rule**:  
> For any week under an agreement (e.g., part-time work), the insurable earnings are:
> - The amount the employee would have earned had they worked a full week, or  
> - The maximum weekly insurable earnings under the Act — whichever is **lesser**.

---

## **10. Deductions from Benefits**

Employees must have **deductions** made from their pre-retirement benefits for income earned during the benefit period:

| Source of Income | Deduction Rate |
|------------------|----------------|
| Earnings from employment or self-employment | $0.66⅔ per dollar earned |
| Pension benefits from employer plans | $0.66⅔ per dollar earned |
| Vacation pay | $0.66⅔ per dollar earned |
| Other income (e.g., dividends, interest) | $0.66⅔ per dollar earned |
| Unemployment insurance benefits | $1.00 per dollar received |

> These deductions ensure that the benefit is not a free handout and reflects the employee’s other income.

---

## **11. Annual Adjustment of Benefits**

- The monthly benefit is **adjusted annually** based on changes in the **Pension Index**.
- Formula:
  > New Monthly Benefit = (Old Monthly Benefit) × (Pension Index of current year / Pension Index of lay-off year)

> The Pension Index is defined in **section 43.1 of the CPP Regulations**.

> This adjustment ensures that the benefit keeps pace with inflation and changes in the cost of living.

---

## **12. Adjustment Rules for Precision**

To ensure consistency in rounding:

### For the **product** (new benefit amount):
- If the product has a fractional part of $1:
  - Express it as a decimal with **three or more digits** after the decimal.
  - **Drop digits** after the third if the third digit is **less than 5**.
  - **Increase the second digit by 1
