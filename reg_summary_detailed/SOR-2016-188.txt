**Detailed Summary of the Phthalates Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Phthalates Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, are a set of rules designed to protect children from potential health risks associated with certain phthalates—chemicals commonly used to increase flexibility, durability, and transparency in plastics. These regulations specifically limit the levels of specific phthalates allowed in **toys** and **child care articles**, particularly those that may be placed in a child’s mouth.

The regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, and came into force on the day of registration.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Child Care Article**  
   - A product intended to facilitate:  
     - Relaxation  
     - Sleep  
     - Hygiene  
     - Feeding  
     - Sucking  
     - Teething  
   - Applies to products used by children **under four years of age**.  
   - Examples: pacifiers, bottles, sippy cups, teething rings, crib bedding, baby mats.

2. **Toy**  
   - A product intended for use by children **under 14 years of age** in **learning or play**.  
   - Examples: blocks, dolls, vehicles, action figures, educational toys.

3. **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)**  
   - Refers to internationally recognized standards for conducting safety and toxicity testing.  
   - Based on the **OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice**, specifically **ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17**, published in 1998 (English and French versions).  
   - Ensures that test methods are scientifically valid, reproducible, and reliable.  
   - This standard is used to validate the testing procedures for phthalate levels in products.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Limit on Phthalates in Vinyl (General Rule)**  
- **All vinyl** (a type of plastic) in **toys or child care articles** must not contain more than **1,000 mg/kg** of any of the following three phthalates:  
  - **Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)**  
  - **Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)**  
  - **Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)**  
- This limit applies **regardless of the product's intended use**, as long as it contains vinyl.

> 🔍 *Note:* This applies to the entire vinyl component of the product, not just parts that may be ingested.

#### **2. Stricter Limit for Parts That Can Be Placed in a Child’s Mouth (Under Four Years Old)**  
- Any **part of a toy or child care article** that can, in a **reasonably foreseeable manner**, be placed in the mouth of a child under four years of age must not contain more than **1,000 mg/kg** of any of these phthalates:  
  - **Diisononyl phthalate (DINP)**  
  - **Diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)**  
  - **Di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP)**  

> ⚠️ *This is a stricter restriction than the first rule, especially because phthalates can leach into food or body fluids when ingested, posing potential health risks.*

### **Determining When a Part Can Be Placed in a Child’s Mouth**

A part qualifies as being "capable of being placed in a child’s mouth" **if both** of the following conditions are met:

1. **It can be brought to the child’s mouth and kept there** such that it can be:
   - Sucked (e.g., a pacifier or teething ring)
   - Chewed (e.g., a chewable toy or teething ring)

2. **One of its dimensions is less than 5 cm**  
   - This threshold is designed to identify small, easily accessible parts that children are likely to put in their mouths.

> ✅ Example: A teething ring with a diameter of 4 cm qualifies because it is less than 5 cm and can be sucked.  
> ❌ Example: A large, flat toy with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm would not qualify, even if it has a small corner that might be chewed.

---

### **Special Case: Inflatable Toys**

- If a part is **inflatable**, its dimensions must be measured in its **deflated state** when determining whether it meets the 5 cm threshold.  
- This ensures that even if the toy expands when inflated, the risk assessment is based on the actual size when it is in a child’s mouth (i.e., when not inflated).

> 📌 Example: An inflatable ball that is 30 cm when inflated but 10 cm when deflated — only the deflated size is used to determine if it falls under the mouth-contact rule.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

- The regulations include a **repeal clause** indicating that any prior conflicting or outdated rules are being replaced by these new provisions.  
- This ensures clarity and consistency in the regulatory framework.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*).  
- This allows immediate enforcement and compliance with the new standards.

---

### **Purpose and Health Rationale**

- Phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can interfere with hormone systems.  
- Children, especially under four years of age, are particularly vulnerable due to their developing bodies and higher exposure through ingestion and skin contact.  
- By limiting phthalate levels in toys and child care products, the regulation aims to:
  - Reduce exposure to harmful chemicals
  - Protect children’s health and development
  - Ensure consumer safety in the marketplace

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of toys and child care articles must ensure compliance with these limits.
- Products must be tested using methods that adhere to **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)** to verify phthalate content.
- Regulatory authorities (e.g., the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety or the Consumer Product Safety Act enforcement body) may conduct inspections, testing, or take enforcement action if violations are found.

### **Summary Table**

| Regulation | Phthalate Type | Maximum Level | Applies To |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| General vinyl limit | DEHP, DBP, BBP | 1,000 mg/kg | All toys and child care articles with vinyl |
| Mouth-contact limit | DINP, DIDP, DNOP | 1,000 mg/kg | Any part that can be sucked or chewed and is <5 cm in one dimension |

### **Conclusion**

The *Phthalates Regulations* represent a significant step in protecting children from exposure to potentially harmful chemicals in everyday products. By setting clear, science-based limits on specific phthalates in vinyl materials—especially in items that children are likely to put in their mouths—the regulations align Canada with international standards and promote safer consumer products. The use of GLP ensures the scientific rigor of testing, and the inclusion of practical criteria (such as size thresholds) makes enforcement both feasible and child-focused.

These regulations reflect a proactive approach to consumer safety, emphasizing prevention of harm during early childhood development.
