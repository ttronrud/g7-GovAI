**Detailed Summary of the Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order, C.R.C., c. 126 (Revoked and Replaced)**

---

### **Overview**

The regulation in question, titled *The Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order, C.R.C., c. 126*, was **revoked** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **section 3.4 of the Aeronautics Act**. This revocation was not a new regulation but a formal replacement of an earlier authorization order — specifically, the original *Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order, C.R.C., c. 126* — with a new, updated version that grants the Minister of Transport expanded authority to establish charges related to various aeronautical services and facilities.

This new Order is **issued pursuant to section 3.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which provides the Minister of Transport with the legal power to authorize the creation of regulations imposing fees or charges for specific services or facilities related to aviation operations in Canada.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Statutory Authority**: Section 3.4 of the *Aeronautics Act* (formerly known as the *Aviation Act*) empowers the Minister of Transport to make regulations that impose charges for the use of certain aviation-related facilities, services, or documents.
- **Purpose of the Order**: To provide the Minister of Transport with the legal authority to create and enforce regulations that establish fees or charges in specific contexts, ensuring that the costs of providing aeronautical services are fairly and systematically recovered.

### **Key Provisions of the Authorization**

The Minister of Transport is authorized to make regulations imposing charges in the following areas:

#### 1. **Use of Facilities or Services for Aircraft**
The Minister may impose charges for the use of:
- Any facility or service provided by or on behalf of the Minister of Transport for or in respect of **any aircraft**, regardless of:
  - Whether the flight **originates or terminates in Canada**.
  - Whether **any portion of the flight passes over Canada**.
- This includes services such as:
  - Air traffic control.
  - Navigation support.
  - Aircraft maintenance or inspection services.
  - Ground handling at airports.
  - Use of air navigation systems or surveillance equipment.

> **Key Point**: The scope is **broad and inclusive** — even if an aircraft operates entirely outside Canada, or only flies over Canadian airspace, the use of Canadian-provided services may trigger charges.

#### 2. **Use of Facilities or Services at Aerodromes**
The Minister may impose charges for:
- Any facility or service provided at any **aerodrome** (airfield) operated by or on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- This includes:
  - Runway or taxiway usage.
  - Parking or hangar services.
  - Lighting, signage, or ground support equipment.
  - Fueling or refueling services.
  - Security or customs services at the aerodrome.

> **Note**: The authorization applies to **all aerodromes under Canadian jurisdiction**, whether they are major international hubs or small remote fields.

#### 3. **Issuance or Renewal of Aviation Documents**
The Minister is authorized to impose charges for:
- The **issuance, renewal, amendment, or endorsement** of any document issued or to be issued under **Part I of the Aeronautics Act**.
- This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Airworthiness certificates.
  - Operator licenses (e.g., for airlines or flight operators).
  - Pilot licenses (e.g., private, commercial, airline transport).
  - Aircraft registration certificates.
  - Flight plans or permits.
- Charges may also cover **preparatory actions** leading to the issuance of such documents (e.g., application processing, inspections, or administrative review).

> **Important**: The fee applies regardless of whether the document is actually issued or not — even if the application is rejected or withdrawn.

---

### **Scope and Implications**

- **Geographic Reach**: Charges can apply even when flights or operations are **outside Canada**, as long as Canadian services or facilities are used.
- **Flexibility**: The Minister has broad discretion to determine the **nature, amount, and structure** of the charges, subject to regulatory oversight and public accountability.
- **Revenue Purpose**: The fees are intended to:
  - Recoup the **costs of providing services**.
  - Ensure **fair and equitable funding** for infrastructure and administrative support.
  - Support the **sustainability and efficiency** of Canada’s aviation system.

---

### **Citation and Legal Status**

- The Order is officially cited as: **Ministerial Regulations Authorization Order, C.R.C., c. 126**.
- It is **not a fee schedule** itself but a **legal authorization** allowing the Minister to create future regulations that specify the actual charges.
- It is **renewed or updated** through subsequent regulations (e.g., the *Aeronautics Regulations*, C.R.C., c. 126) that set out the specific fees and their application.

---

### **Historical Context**

- The original Order (C.R.C., c. 126) was enacted in **1985 (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)** as part of the modernization of Canada’s aviation regulatory framework.
- The revocation and replacement reflect a **restructuring or refinement** of regulatory authority to better align with evolving aviation needs, including international operations, digitalization of services, and increased demand for air traffic management and document processing.

### **Conclusion**
