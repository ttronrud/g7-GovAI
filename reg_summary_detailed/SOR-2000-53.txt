**Detailed Summary of the *Prescribed Deposits (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations***  
*Issued under the Bank Act, S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 35(1); S.C. 1991, c. 46*

---

### **Overview**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* are a regulatory instrument issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsections 545(3)a and (6)a of the Bank Act**. These regulations define what constitutes a "prescribed deposit" and establish the conditions under which authorized foreign banks in Canada may accept such deposits. The primary objective is to **identify and regulate specific types of deposits made by certain public or institutional entities to foreign banks operating in Canada**, with the aim of ensuring financial stability, protecting depositors, and maintaining oversight over cross-border financial activities.

These regulations are designed to apply to deposits that are **less than $150,000** and are made by designated entities to an **authorized foreign bank** (a foreign bank that is licensed or authorized to operate in Canada under the Bank Act).

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Deposit**  
   - The term "deposit" has the same meaning as defined in the **Schedule to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act**, **but excluding subsections 2(2), (5), and (6)** of that schedule.  
   - This means the definition of "deposit" is limited to deposits that are eligible for CDIC insurance under normal circumstances, excluding deposits that are specifically excluded by those subsections (e.g., certain types of non-insurable deposits or deposits held by specific entities).

2. **First Deposit Transaction**  
   - Refers to the **initial deposit** made between a person and an authorized foreign bank in relation to a prescribed deposit.  
   - This is a key milestone used to determine eligibility for the prescribed deposit status and the associated regulatory treatment.

### **What Constitutes a "Prescribed Deposit"?**

A prescribed deposit is defined as a deposit of **less than $150,000** made by one of the following entities to an authorized foreign bank:

#### **1. Entities of the Canadian Government or Its Agents**
- Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province;
- An agent of Her Majesty in either of those rights (e.g., municipal or public bodies with government functions);
- An entity controlled by Her Majesty in either of those rights.

> *Example:* A provincial government or a municipal corporation (e.g., a city council) making a deposit to a foreign bank.

#### **2. Foreign Government Entities**
- The government of a foreign country or any of its political subdivisions (e.g., a state or province);
- Agencies of the foreign government or its political subdivisions;
- Entities controlled by such governments or subdivisions.

> *Example:* A foreign central bank or a state-owned enterprise making a deposit to a Canadian foreign bank.

#### **3. International Agencies (with Canada as a member)**
- International financial institutions of which Canada is a member, including:
  - Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
  - Asian Development Bank (ADB)
  - Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
  - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
  - Any other regional international bank to which Canada belongs
- Any international agency that is a member of the **World Bank Group** and of which Canada is a member.

> *Note:* These institutions are considered to have a strong policy and financial relationship with Canada, and their deposits are subject to specific regulatory scrutiny.

#### **4. Financial Institutions**
- Any entity that is recognized as a financial institution (e.g., insurance companies, investment firms, credit unions, etc.).

> *Note:* This is a broad category and includes institutions engaged in financial services.

#### **5. Pension Funds**
- A pension fund maintained for a **pension plan registered for income tax purposes**;
- The fund must have **total assets under administration exceeding $100 million** at the time of the first deposit transaction.

> *Example:* A large, publicly registered pension fund such as a provincial pension board.

#### **6. Mutual Funds**
- A mutual fund regulated under:
  - An Act of a provincial legislature, or
  - The laws of a jurisdiction outside Canada
- The fund must have **assets managed by a person with total assets under management exceeding $10 million** at the time of the first deposit.

> *Example:* A mutual fund managed by a private fund manager with $15 million in total managed assets.

#### **7. Entities with High Revenue**
- Any entity that, at the time of the first deposit transaction, has **gross revenues exceeding $5 million** during the fiscal year immediately preceding the deposit.

> *Example:* A large private corporation or non-profit organization with strong financial activity.

#### **8. Other Entities (with Specific Services)**
- Any other entity where the deposit facilitates one or more of the following services provided by the authorized foreign bank:
  - **Lending money** (e.g., providing loans to the entity)
  - **Dealing in foreign exchange** (e.g., currency trading)
  - **Dealing in securities**, **excluding debt obligations of the authorized foreign bank**

> *Note:* This provision allows flexibility to include other entities if the deposit supports core financial services, but excludes debt instruments issued by the foreign bank itself.

### **Key Regulatory Implications**

1. **Deposit Limitation**  
   - All prescribed deposits are capped at **less than $150,000**. This helps maintain a focus on smaller, non-systemic deposits and reduces the risk of systemic exposure.

2. **Oversight and Insurance**  
   - Because the deposit is defined under the CDIC Act (with exclusions), it may be eligible for **deposit insurance**, provided it meets the criteria of a "deposit" under that Act. This ensures that depositors are protected in the event of bank failure.

3. **First Deposit Transaction as a Trigger**  
   - The "first deposit transaction" is the key moment that determines whether an entity qualifies as a prescribed depositor. This is a critical point in the regulatory timeline and may trigger reporting, compliance, or insurance obligations.

4. **Scope of Foreign Bank Authorization**  
   - The regulations apply only to **authorized foreign banks** — those that have been formally licensed by the Bank of Canada to operate in Canada. This ensures that only regulated institutions are involved in such transactions.

5. **Exclusion of Debt Obligations**  
   - The provision for "dealing in securities" explicitly excludes **debt obligations of the authorized foreign bank**. This prevents circular or self-dealing arrangements and avoids conflicts of interest.

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.  
- This ensures immediate applicability upon official publication, allowing financial institutions and government bodies to adjust their practices accordingly.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

- **Financial Stability**: By defining and limiting prescribed deposits, the regulations help prevent foreign banks from taking on excessive or unregulated exposure from large or high-risk entities.
- **Deposit Insurance Protection**: Ensures that only qualifying deposits (under $150,000) are covered by CDIC insurance, protecting Canadian depositors.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Clarifies who can make deposits to foreign banks and under what conditions, promoting transparency in cross-border financial dealings.
- **Risk Management**: Limits exposure by focusing on entities with specific financial characteristics (e.g., revenue, asset size, service use), reducing systemic risk.
- **International Engagement**: Recognizes the role of international institutions and foreign governments in Canada’s financial ecosystem, while maintaining regulatory control.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* establish a clear, structured framework for identifying and regulating deposits of less than $150,000 made by specific public, governmental, institutional, or financially active entities to authorized foreign banks in Canada. The regulations balance **international cooperation** with **domestic financial stability**, ensuring that deposits are transparent, insured where applicable, and subject to appropriate oversight. By focusing on the "first deposit transaction" and defining eligibility through financial thresholds and service provisions, the rules provide a practical and risk-sensitive approach to managing foreign bank deposits within Canada’s financial system.
