The provided text consists of four repeated statements indicating that a specific regulation has been repealed:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2014-177, s. 4]"

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked).
- **Repeal Date/Notice**: It was repealed by **Regulation SOR/2014-177**, under **section 4** of that regulation.
- **SOR/2014-177**: This stands for *Supplemental Regulation 2014-177*, which is a legal document issued by the Government of Canada (typically under a federal department or agency) to amend or repeal existing regulations.
- **Section 4**: This section specifically identifies the provision that formally repeals the targeted regulation. The repetition of the same line four times suggests a possible typographical or formatting error in the original source—such as a copy-paste issue or a technical flaw in the document's presentation—rather than indicating multiple instances of repeal or different provisions.

### Interpretation:

The repeated line does **not** indicate multiple regulations being repealed or different versions of the same regulation. Instead, it is a formatting artifact or duplication error. The accurate interpretation is:

> The regulation referenced in this entry has been formally repealed by **Section 4 of Supplemental Regulation SOR/2014-177**, which was published in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* (SOR) database on or around April 2014.

### Legal Implications:

- The regulation is **no longer in force**.
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by the regulation are **no longer applicable**.
- Entities or individuals who were previously subject to the regulation must now comply with the current, surviving provisions of the relevant statute or regulation.

### Conclusion:

The statement "[Repealed, SOR/2014-177, s. 4]" (repeated four times) is a **duplicate or erroneous repetition** of a single repeal notice. The actual legal effect is that the regulation was **repealed by Section 4 of SOR/2014-177**, meaning it is **no longer valid or enforceable** under Canadian law. No further details about the original regulation’s content or purpose are available from this summary, as the original regulation has been removed from the legal framework.

To obtain the original regulation’s content or context, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation or the official publication of SOR/2014-177 prior to its repeal.
