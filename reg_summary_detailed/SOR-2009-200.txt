**Detailed Summary of the CEFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *CEFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision enables the Canadian government to establish tariff preferences for products originating in specific countries within the **European Free Trade Association (EFTA)** — namely, **Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein**.

These regulations are part of Canada’s implementation of the **Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)**, which was signed on **January 26, 2008**, and entered into force to provide preferential tariff treatment for certain agricultural and other products originating in EFTA countries.

### **2. Definitions in the Regulations**

Key definitions clarify the meaning of "originating product" and the specific categories of agricultural products:

- **Agricultural product originating in Iceland**:  
  A product that qualifies for the **Iceland Tariff**, but is **excluded** from the benefits of the Norway Tariff and the Switzerland–Liechtenstein Tariff.

- **Agricultural product originating in Norway**:  
  A product that qualifies for the **Norway Tariff**, but is **excluded** from the benefits of the Iceland Tariff and the Switzerland–Liechtenstein Tariff.

- **Agricultural product originating in Switzerland or Liechtenstein**:  
  A product that qualifies for the **Switzerland–Liechtenstein Tariff**, but is **excluded** from the benefits of the Iceland Tariff and the Norway Tariff.

- **Originating product**:  
  Defined as per the **Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement (signed January 26, 2008)**. This term refers to goods that meet the rules of origin established in the agreement — typically meaning that the product has been produced or processed in the EFTA country and meets specific criteria (e.g., substantial transformation, use of locally sourced inputs).

> These definitions ensure that each country's tariff preference is **non-overlapping** and **distinct**, preventing a product from being eligible for more than one EFTA tariff.

### **3. Eligibility for Tariff Preference**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, and subject to **Section 3** of these regulations, **originating products exported from Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, or Liechtenstein** are entitled to preferential tariff treatment — specifically the **Iceland Tariff, Norway Tariff, or Switzerland–Liechtenstein Tariff**, depending on the country of origin — **if** the following conditions are met:

#### **Case 1: Shipment Without Transit Through Another Country**

If the product is shipped **directly from the EFTA country to Canada**, without passing through any third country, the importer is entitled to the applicable tariff **if**:

- The shipment is carried on a **through bill of lading**, OR  
- The shipment is **not** on a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, **when requested by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** showing:
  - The complete **shipping route**
  - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada

> This ensures transparency and verifiability of the product’s origin and movement.

#### **Case 2: Shipment Through Another Country (Transit)**

If the product is shipped **through another country**, the importer must provide:

1. **Documentary evidence** showing:
   - The full **shipping route**
   - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada

2. **A copy of customs control documents** that prove:
   - The product **remained under customs control** during its stay in the transit country

> This requirement ensures that the product did not undergo unauthorized processing or re-export, which could disqualify it from tariff preference.

> Importantly, **customs control** is a key safeguard — it confirms that the product was not subjected to duties or modifications that would alter its origin status.

### **4. Application by Country of Origin**

Each EFTA country has its own specific eligibility:

| Country | Eligible Tariff | Conditions |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Iceland** | Iceland Tariff | Must meet either: (a) through bill of lading or (b) documentary proof of route + customs control during transit |
| **Norway** | Norway Tariff | Same conditions as above |
| **Switzerland or Liechtenstein** | Switzerland–Liechtenstein Tariff | Same conditions as above |

> These rules are **symmetrical** across the four EFTA countries, reflecting the structure of the CEFTA agreement.

---

### **5. Effective Date and Registration Provisions**

- The regulations **come into force on July 1, 2009**.
- If the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after July 1, 2009**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provision allows for administrative flexibility in case of delays in formal publication or amendments.

### **6. Purpose and Significance**

The CEFTA Tariff Preference Regulations serve several key functions:

1. **Promotes Trade**: Facilitates trade between Canada and EFTA countries by reducing or eliminating tariffs on qualifying agricultural products.
2. **Supports Regional Trade Agreements**: Implements the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement, enhancing economic ties with key European partners.
3. **Ensures Origin Verification**: Requires documentation and customs control to prevent fraud, misrepresentation, or unauthorized processing of goods.
4. **Protects Canadian Interests**: Maintains compliance with international trade rules and safeguards against non-originating goods claiming preferential treatment.

### **7. Key Compliance Requirements for Importers**

Importers must ensure:

- They can **prove the origin** of the product (via documentation or bill of lading).
- They provide **detailed shipping route information** if the goods transit through a third country.
- They maintain **customs control documentation** for any transit — confirming the product was not released or processed outside the EFTA country.
- They do **not** claim a tariff benefit for a product that is eligible under more than one EFTA tariff (e.g., a product from Iceland cannot claim the Norway Tariff).

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CEFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* establish a clear, transparent, and enforceable framework for granting preferential tariff treatment to **agricultural products originating in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, or Liechtenstein**. By requiring verifiable documentation and customs control, the regulations ensure that only genuine originating products benefit from tariff reductions, while protecting the integrity of Canada’s trade policy and the rules of origin under the CEFTA Agreement.

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s broader strategy to strengthen economic relationships with EFTA nations and promote sustainable, transparent international trade.
