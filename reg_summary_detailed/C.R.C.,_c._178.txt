**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Berry-for-Processing Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Ontario Berry-for-Processing Order* and may be cited as such. This document establishes specific rules and authorities governing the marketing of certain berries in Ontario, particularly those intended for processing rather than direct consumer sale.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **Act**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal framework under which the regulation operates. It grants regulatory powers to bodies such as the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Berry Growers’ Marketing Board.

- **Berries**: Specifically defined as *strawberries and raspberries produced in Ontario that are used by a processor for processing*. This definition is critical because it limits the scope of the regulation to berries that are not sold fresh to consumers but are instead used in manufacturing (e.g., jams, juice, frozen products). It excludes berries intended for retail or direct consumption.

- **Board**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (Régie). This is a provincial regulatory body responsible for overseeing the marketing of farm products, including berries, in interprovincial and export markets.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Ontario Berry Growers’ Marketing Board*, established by Order in Council under the authority of the Farm Products Marketing Act. This board is specifically focused on the marketing and economic interests of Ontario berry growers.

- **Provincial Regulations**: Refers to *O. Reg. 260/57*, a regulation made by the Board under the Farm Products Marketing Act. This regulation contains the detailed rules governing the marketing of berries, including pricing, quality standards, marketing quotas, and distribution mechanisms. The current Order incorporates and references these existing rules.

**3. Regulatory Authority and Scope**  

The Order grants both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** the authority to regulate the marketing of berries in two key areas:

- **Interprovincial Trade**: The movement of berries from Ontario to other provinces for processing or resale.
- **Export Trade**: The sale of Ontario-grown berries outside of Canada (e.g., to the United States or other international markets).

This authority enables both bodies to enforce rules related to pricing, quality, volume limits, and market access, ensuring fair and orderly trade practices.

**4. Powers Under the Regulation**  

With respect to persons and property located within the Province of Ontario, both the Board and the Commodity Board are authorized to exercise the same powers as those granted to them under the *Provincial Regulations* (O. Reg. 260/57). These powers are specifically divided as follows:

- **Board's Powers (under Sections 4 to 6 of O. Reg. 260/57)**:  
  These powers typically include:
  - Setting marketing standards and quality requirements.
  - Establishing pricing mechanisms (e.g., minimum or maximum prices).
  - Regulating the volume or quantity of berries that can be marketed.
  - Administering marketing agreements or quotas.
  - Enforcing compliance through inspections or penalties.

- **Commodity Board's Powers (under Sections 7 to 14 of O. Reg. 260/57)**:  
  These powers are more focused on the interests of growers and local market dynamics and may include:
  - Managing grower participation in marketing programs.
  - Allocating shares or quotas among growers.
  - Establishing pricing formulas or revenue-sharing models.
  - Setting rules for the collection and use of marketing data.
  - Ensuring fair distribution and preventing market manipulation.

By allowing both bodies to exercise these powers, the Order creates a dual regulatory structure that balances broader market oversight (by the Board) with grower-specific interests (by the Commodity Board).

**5. Purpose and Objectives**  

The primary objectives of this Order are:

- To ensure fair and stable marketing conditions for Ontario berry producers.
- To prevent market distortions, such as oversupply or price manipulation, in interprovincial and export markets.
- To support the economic viability of Ontario’s berry processing industry by establishing predictable pricing and quality standards.
- To promote equitable access to markets for growers, especially small or medium-sized producers.
- To maintain quality and consistency in berries used for processing, which is essential for downstream manufacturers.

---

**6. Applicability**  

The Order applies specifically to:
- Strawberries and raspberries grown in Ontario.
- Berries that are not intended for direct retail sale but are instead destined for processing (e.g., juice, jam, frozen products).
- All persons and property located within the Province of Ontario involved in the marketing of such berries.

It does **not** apply to berries sold directly to consumers, nor to berries grown outside Ontario.

---

**7. Legal Basis**  

The Order is enacted under the authority of *The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario*, which empowers the Board and the Commodity Board to regulate the marketing of farm products. The specific powers are derived from the *Provincial Regulations (O. Reg. 260/57)*, which provide the operational details of how these regulations are implemented.

---

**Conclusion**  

The *Ontario Berry-for-Processing Order* establishes a clear, legally grounded framework for regulating the marketing of strawberries and raspberries grown in Ontario that are used in processing. By granting both the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Berry Growers’ Marketing Board the authority to enforce market rules—specifically those outlined in O. Reg. 260/57—the Order promotes fairness, stability, and economic sustainability in the province’s berry processing sector. It ensures that interprovincial and export trade is conducted under consistent, transparent, and equitable conditions, benefiting both producers and processors.
