The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and implications:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under Section 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Purpose:**  
This regulation formally acknowledges the receipt of scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** under **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act**. These assessments evaluate the current status of specific wildlife species in Canada and determine whether they are at risk of extinction.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is grounded in **Section 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act*, which empowers the Minister of the Environment to, upon receiving a COSEWIC assessment, designate a species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" based on the scientific evaluation.

2. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species at risk. Its assessments are based on the best available scientific and commercial data and are critical to informing government decisions under SARA.

3. **Content of the Assessment:**  
   The regulation references the **annexed schedule**, which lists specific species that have been assessed by COSEWIC. These assessments include information on:
   - Population size and trends
   - Distribution and habitat
   - Threats (e.g., habitat loss, climate change, invasive species)
   - Conservation status (e.g., "endangered," "threatened," "special concern")
   - Risk of extinction

4. **Formal Recognition and Implementation:**  
   By acknowledging receipt of these assessments, the Governor General in Council formally recognizes that the scientific evaluation has been completed and is now available for use in decision-making. This step is a prerequisite for the Minister to proceed with designating species under the Act.

5. **Procedural Significance:**  
   This acknowledgment serves as an official government action that:
   - Validates the scientific basis for species status designations
   - Triggers the next phase of the regulatory process—formal listing of species under SARA
   - Enables the development of recovery strategies and action plans
   - Supports the implementation of conservation measures, such as habitat protection, restrictions on activities that harm species, or species-specific protections

6. **Legal and Policy Impact:**  
   Once a species is formally listed as at risk, it becomes subject to legal protections under SARA, including:
   - Prohibitions on activities that harm or destroy habitat
   - Requirements for environmental assessments
   - Mandates for recovery planning
   - Funding and support for conservation efforts

**Context and Importance:**

This regulation is part of Canada’s broader effort to conserve biodiversity and protect species at risk. It reflects a science-based, transparent, and legally grounded approach to wildlife conservation. By relying on COSEWIC assessments, the government ensures that decisions are informed by independent, peer-reviewed science.

It also demonstrates the interplay between scientific bodies and government institutions in environmental policy—where scientific findings are formally adopted into legislation.

**Conclusion:**

This Order (S.C. 2002, c. 29) is a procedural but essential step in the implementation of the *Species at Risk Act*. It formally recognizes the completion and validity of COSEWIC assessments for species listed in the annexed schedule, thereby laying the foundation for official designations and subsequent conservation actions. It underscores Canada’s commitment to protecting biodiversity through evidence-based policy and legal protection of at-risk species.

*Note:* This regulation is typically issued annually or as species assessments are completed. The specific species listed in the annexed schedule would need to be referenced in the full text of the regulation for detailed species-level information.
