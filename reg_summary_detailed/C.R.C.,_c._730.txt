**Detailed Summary of the Revenue Trust Account Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Revenue Trust Account Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish the rules governing the creation, operation, and management of **Revenue Trust Accounts** in Canada.

---

### **2. Definitions**

#### **Financial Institution**
A "financial institution" is defined broadly and includes:
- A member of the **Canadian Payments Association (CPA)**;
- Any **local cooperative credit society** that is a member of a **central cooperative credit society** which itself is a member of the CPA;
- Any **fiscal agent or financial institution** designated by the **Minister of Finance** under subsection 17(2) of the *Financial Administration Act*.

> *Purpose*: This ensures that only authorized and regulated financial entities can hold and manage Revenue Trust Accounts, maintaining financial accountability and integrity.

---

#### **Revenue Trust Account**
A **Revenue Trust Account** is:
- An account established in a financial institution specifically for the **deposit of money paid to the credit of the Receiver General**;
- But **not public money** (i.e., funds that are already part of the public treasury or government funds).

> *Key distinction*: Unlike public money, funds in a Revenue Trust Account are **not immediately part of the government’s general revenue**. They are held in trust for specific purposes and subject to specific conditions.

---

### **3. Scope and Applicability**
Unless otherwise specified, **these Regulations override**:
- The *Repayment of Receipts Regulations*;
- The *Receipt and Deposit of Public Money Regulations*.

> *Implication*: Even when other regulations would normally govern the handling of public funds, **the Revenue Trust Account Regulations take precedence** in situations involving Revenue Trust Accounts. This ensures consistent and clear rules for trust account management.

---

### **4. Establishment of Revenue Trust Accounts**
A Revenue Trust Account may be established:
- In the **Northwest Territories** or **Yukon Territory**, where money is paid to a public officer;
- Or in **any other area** where the **Minister of Finance** has authorized the creation of such an account for a specific purpose.

> *Purpose*: Allows flexibility in managing funds in remote or special-purpose areas, where traditional public money systems may not be practical.

---

### **5. Deposit of Money as a Security Deposit**
If a public officer receives money as a **deposit to ensure the performance of a specific act or obligation** (e.g., securing the completion of a contract or service), and that money is deposited into a Revenue Trust Account:
- **Upon completion of the act or thing**, or when the deposit is no longer needed, the money must be **repaid** to the original payer or their legal representative.

> *Exception*: If the deposit **exceeds** the amount prescribed for that purpose (or if no prescribed amount exists, exceeds the amount required), the **excess must also be repaid**.

> *Rationale*: Prevents misuse or retention of funds beyond what is necessary to secure performance.

---

### **6. Repayment When Purpose Is Not Met**
If the money is paid into a Revenue Trust Account for a specific purpose, and:
- The **purpose has not been fulfilled**, and  
- **No service has been rendered on behalf of Her Majesty (the Crown)**,

Then the **entire amount** may be repaid to the person who paid it or their legal representative.

> *Purpose*: Ensures accountability and prevents unjust retention of funds when the intended purpose fails.

---

### **7. Handling Funds When Purpose Is Met**
If the purpose for which the money was paid **has been fulfilled**, then:
- The amount paid **less any excess** over what was required for the purpose shall be:
  - **Deposited to the credit of the Receiver General** at least **once per week**;
  - In accordance with the *Receipt and Deposit of Public Money Regulations*.

> *Note*: This means that after fulfilling the purpose, the net amount (after excess) becomes part of government revenue, subject to standard public money procedures.

---

### **8. Handling Funds When Purpose Is Not Met but Service Is Rendered**
If:
- The purpose has **not been fulfilled**, but  
- A **service has been rendered by or on behalf of Her Majesty (the Crown)**,

Then the **appropriate Minister** must refer the matter to the **Treasury Board** with a full statement of facts.

> *Purpose*: Recognizes that some value may have been provided to the Crown even if the original purpose failed — allowing for a review and potential retention of a portion of the funds.

---

### **9. Treasury Board Determination and Disbursement**
Upon receiving the referral, the **Treasury Board** will:
- Determine **how much**, if any, of the funds should be **retained by Her Majesty** (the Crown) as compensation for the service rendered;
- The **amount retained** will be:
  - Deposited to the credit of the Receiver General (in accordance with public money rules);
- The **remainder** (if any) will be **repaid** to the original payer or their legal representative.

> *Key Outcome*: Balances accountability with recognition of value provided to the Crown. It allows for a fair and transparent process where partial retention is justified based on actual service.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives of the Regulations**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trust-Based Management** | Funds are not treated as public money until their purpose is fulfilled and they are properly accounted for. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Clear rules govern when funds are repaid, retained, or deposited. |
| **Prevention of Misuse** | Excess deposits and failed purposes trigger repayment. |
| **Recognition of Service** | Even if a purpose fails, service to the Crown may justify partial retention. |
| **Integration with Public Finance System** | Once funds are used for their intended purpose, they enter the formal public revenue stream. |

---

### **Practical Examples**

1. **Security Deposit for a Construction Contract**  
   - A public officer collects a $10,000 deposit to ensure a contractor completes a road project.  
   - The project is completed → $10,000 is deposited to the Receiver General (no excess).  
   - If the project fails → the full $10,000 is repaid to the payer.  
   - If the project fails but a surveyor's service is rendered → the Minister refers it to Treasury Board. The Board may retain $1,000 for service, and repay $9,000.

2. **Deposit for a Licensing Fee**  
   - A business pays $5,000 as a deposit to ensure compliance with environmental regulations.  
   - Compliance is verified → $5,000 is deposited to the Receiver General.  
   - If compliance is not achieved → the full amount is repaid.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Revenue Trust Account Regulations** provide a structured, accountable framework for managing funds that are not public money but are collected for specific purposes by public officers. They ensure:
- Funds are not retained indefinitely;
- Excess or failed-purpose deposits are returned;
- Value provided to the Crown is recognized and fairly compensated;
- All transactions are transparent and subject to oversight by the Treasury Board.

By establishing clear rules for when money is repaid, retained, or deposited, these regulations enhance **financial integrity**, **public trust**, and **accountability** in government operations, especially in remote or specialized jurisdictions like the Northwest Territories and Yukon.

> **Final Note**: These regulations are essential for managing non-public revenue streams while maintaining alignment with broader public finance principles and constitutional accountability.
