## **3. Conditions for Approval of a Direct Loan**

A direct loan may only be approved if the Minister is satisfied that **all of the following conditions are met**:

#### **(a) Purpose of the Loan**
- The loan must finance a business enterprise that will or may contribute to the economic development of Indians.
- Alternatively, it may provide equity in such a business.

#### **(b) Financing Need**
- For **non-professional businesses**: The applicant cannot obtain financing on reasonable terms except under this Order.
- For **professional businesses**: The applicant cannot obtain a loan except under this Order due to being unable to provide satisfactory security under **Section 89 of the Indian Act** (which restricts certain types of security for Indigenous individuals).

#### **(c) Refinancing Restrictions**
- Loans are **not permitted for refinancing existing debt**, unless:
  - The refinancing is incidental to the main purpose of the loan;
  - In the Minister’s opinion, it improves the security of the loan;
  - It is desirable in the case of an existing loan or one made under this Order;
  - It has been approved by the Minister of Finance.

#### **(d) Aggregate Loan Limits**
- The total amount of:
  - Principal of the new loan;
  - Outstanding balances of all direct loans to the applicant;
  must not exceed the total amount authorized by law from the Account at the time of disbursement.

#### **(e) $500,000 Threshold**
- If the total of:
  - Principal amount of the new loan;
  - Outstanding and undisbursed amounts of all other direct loans;
  - Outstanding and undisbursed amounts of all guaranteed loans under Vote L53b;
  - Grants, contributions, or payments for Indian economic development;
  - Loans, grants, contributions, and development incentives under the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion;
  - Federal loans (by departments, Crown corporations, or agencies) to or on behalf of the applicant or the business enterprise

  then the loan must be **approved by the Treasury Board**.

#### **(f) Applicant's Contribution Requirement**
- The applicant must contribute **at least 20% of the estimated total cost** of the business enterprise from their own assets.

> **Exception**: If the applicant cannot meet the 20% contribution, the Minister may approve the loan **only if**:

> - The applicant is an Indian, a group of Indians, an Indian band, or a corporation controlled by one or more Indians;
> - In the Minister’s judgment, the loan is warranted by the circumstances.

## **4. Interest Rates**

Interest on direct loans is **simple interest** and varies based on the total outstanding loan balance.

### **Rate Structure:**
- **If total loan balance (principal + all other outstanding direct loans) ≤ $75,000**:
  - Interest rate = **1% above** the simple average prime commercial lending rate of the seven major Canadian chartered banks, rounded to the nearest **one-quarter of one percent**.
  - The average rate is based on the closing day of December, March, June, or September — whichever is closest to the date the loan agreement is signed.

- **If total balance > $75,000**:
  - First $75,000: at the rate above.
  - Amount above $75,000: at a rate **2% higher** than the rate above.

> Example: If the average prime rate is 3.5%, the interest rate would be:
> - 4.5% on first $75,000;
> - 6.5% on any amount over $75,000.

---

## **5. Repayment Terms**

- **Frequency**: Repayments on the principal amount must be made **no less frequently than annually**.
- **Term**: The loan must be repaid **within 15 years** from the date of disbursement.
- **Extension**: Extensions beyond 15 years are **only allowed with Treasury Board approval**.

---

## **6. Security Requirements**

The Minister may require the borrower to provide one or more forms of security, including:

- A **mortgage on real property** or a **chattel mortgage on personal property**;
- A **guarantee** specifying interest rate and repayment terms;
- A **promissory note** specifying interest rate and repayment terms;
- Any other security deemed appropriate by the Minister.

> The security may be of any rank and may include charges or liens imposed by the Minister at their discretion.

---

## **7. Restrictions on Borrower Actions**

The borrower is prohibited from:

- Selling, leasing, or otherwise disposing of or encumbering any security given for the loan, or any property purchased with loan proceeds;
- Making **capital expenditures** not authorized by the direct loan agreement.

> These restrictions ensure that funds are used solely for the intended business development and not diverted to unrelated investments.

---

## **8. Accounting and Reporting Obligations**

- The borrower must:
  - Maintain **books and accounting records** in a form satisfactory to the Minister;
  - Permit inspection of these records by the Minister or an authorized representative at any reasonable time until full repayment;
  - Provide **invoices, receipts, cancelled cheques, or other documentation** proving that loan proceeds were used for the purpose stated in the application.

> This ensures transparency and accountability in fund usage.

---

## **9. Early Repayment and Loan Modifications**

- The Minister may, at the request of the borrower, **accept early repayment** of all or part of the loan before the scheduled due date.

- If a borrower is in **default** (fails to repay or violates terms), the Minister may:
  - Declare the **entire outstanding balance immediately due and payable** (under Section 12).
  
- If the borrower is in default or warns the Minister that default may occur, and the Minister believes a revision of terms could prevent default, the Minister may, **with the borrower’s consent**, revise or alter the loan terms by:
  - Increasing or decreasing the frequency of repayments (but **no less than annually**);
  - Extending the repayment period (but **no extension beyond 15 years without Treasury Board approval**);
  - Adjusting the amount of each repayment (increasing or decreasing) where the repayment period is being extended.

> These provisions offer flexibility during financial hardship while maintaining financial discipline.

---

## **10. Enforcement and Collection**

If the borrower defaults and the balance becomes due:

- The Minister may take **any necessary steps**, including:
  - Legal action to recover the balance;
  - Obtaining additional security;
  - Realizing on existing security (e.g., selling mortgaged property);
  - Negotiating compromises or concessions with third parties (excluding the borrower).

> This ensures that the government can protect its investment in case of non-performance.

## **11. Recordkeeping and Reporting**

- The Minister is required to **maintain a registry** of all loans made under this Order.
- Annually, in **January**, the Minister must prepare a report on the administration of the Order for the previous fiscal year.
