### **Detailed Summary of the Olympic and Paralympic Marks Regulations (S.C. 2007, c. 25)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- This issuance is authorized under **subsection 12(1) of the Olympic and Paralympic Marks Act**.
- This means the regulations are a formal administrative instrument designed to implement specific provisions of the Act, particularly those relating to the protection, use, and management of Olympic and Paralympic Marks.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
- The primary purpose is to **establish rules and definitions** governing the use of Olympic and Paralympic Marks in Canada.
- These rules are intended to ensure that the marks are used **only in accordance with the law**, to **protect the integrity** of the Olympic and Paralympic brands, and to **prevent unauthorized or misleading use** that could harm the reputation of the Games or the respective organizations.

#### **3. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to the following provisions of the **Olympic and Paralympic Marks Act**:
- **Paragraph 3(4)(a)**: Defines the conditions under which certain uses of the marks are permitted.
- **Subsection 4(1)**: Governs the registration and use of marks by authorized entities.

- **Paragraph 8(2)(a)**: Specifies conditions related to the display and dissemination of the marks.

These provisions are now implemented through the specific rules laid out in the Regulations.

#### **4. Prescribed Period of Application**
- The **prescribed period** (i.e., the timeframe during which certain provisions of the Act apply) begins on the **day the Regulations come into force** and ends on **December 31, 2010**.
- This period is significant because it establishes a **limited window** during which certain rights, obligations, or transitional measures apply—particularly in relation to the use, licensing, or registration of Olympic and Paralympic Marks.
- This time-bound period may be used to:
  - Allow organizations to transition to compliant use of the marks.
  - Provide a clear deadline for compliance with new rules.
  - Facilitate a structured phase-out or review of prior practices.

#### **5. Date of Coming Into Force**
- The Regulations come into force on the **same day that subsection 12(1) of the Olympic and Paralympic Marks Act comes into force**.
- This ensures that the regulations are implemented **concurrently** with the enabling provision of the Act, maintaining legal consistency and immediate applicability.
- According to the note at the end of the regulation, these regulations were **first issued on December 17, 2007** (as referenced in SI/2007-117 — Statutory Instrument 2007-117).

#### **6. Key Implications**
- The regulations establish a **clear legal framework** for the use of Olympic and Paralympic Marks in Canada.
- They reinforce the **exclusive rights** of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to use and control the marks.
- Unauthorized use of the marks during the prescribed period (until December 31, 2010) may be considered a violation of the Act and could lead to penalties or enforcement actions.
- The period ending in 2010 may reflect a transitional phase, possibly to allow for the integration of new licensing models or to align Canadian practices with international standards.

#### **7. Historical Context**
- The regulation is part of Canada’s broader effort to **protect intellectual property** associated with major international sporting events.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **respecting international standards** set by the IOC and IPC, and to ensuring that the Olympic and Paralympic brands are not diluted or misused in commercial or public contexts.
