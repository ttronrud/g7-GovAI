---

### **Overview**
The *Receipt and Deposit of Public Money Regulations, 1997* are a set of administrative rules issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada** under **section 17a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. These regulations establish specific requirements for how public money—defined as funds held or collected by government entities or service providers—must be recorded, received, and deposited into the account of the **Receiver General** for the Government of Canada.

The regulations were originally enacted in 1997 and came into force on **February 23, 1998**. They were **repealed in part** and **expired on March 31, 2018**, with certain provisions being replaced or updated by subsequent legislation.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Breakdown**

---

### **1. Definitions**
The regulations define key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), which provides the legal framework for financial administration of public funds.
- **Business day**: A day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday. This is used to define timelines for depositing public money.
- **Service provider**: A corporation that has entered into an agreement under **subsection 6.2(1) of the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act**. These are entities (e.g., universities, loan servicing agencies) that manage or administer financial assistance programs for students.

> ⚠️ *Note: The definition of "financial institution" was repealed by SOR/2008-44, s. 1 and is no longer in force.*

---

### **2. Recordkeeping Requirements**
Every person who collects or receives public money **must maintain a register** that includes the following:

- The **date of every receipt or deposit**;
- The **amounts received, deposited, or withheld**;
- **All other information necessary for identification or audit purposes** (e.g., reference numbers, source of funds, names of payees).

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and enables effective financial audits by government oversight bodies.

Additionally, upon request or at the direction of the **appropriate Minister**, the person must issue a **receipt or acknowledgment** for any public money collected or received.

---

### **3. Timeliness of Deposit to the Receiver General**
Public money must be deposited into an account established under **subsection 17(2) of the Financial Administration Act** in accordance with the following rules:

#### **A. Electronic Receipts**
- If public money is collected or received **electronically**, it must be **deposited without delay** into the Receiver General’s account.

#### **B. Non-Electronic Receipts**
- If public money is received **by non-electronic means** (e.g., cash, check), deposits must occur:
  - **Once per day**, unless it is **not cost-effective** to do so;
  - In such cases, deposits may be made:
    - **Once per week**, or
    - **Once per month**, **only in exceptional circumstances** and **with authorization from the Receiver General**.

> This rule balances administrative efficiency with the need for timely accounting and audit readiness.

---

### **4. Special Rule for Repayment of Student Financial Assistance and Interest**
Despite the general rule in section 3 of the FAA (which may limit the timing of deposits), the following **public money** must be deposited **within two business days** after collection or receipt:

#### Types of Money Covered:
- Repayment of:
  - Financial assistance under the *Canada Student Financial Assistance Regulations* (as defined in subsection 2(1));
  - A guaranteed student loan under the *Canada Student Loans Act* (as defined in subsection 2(1));
- Payment of **interest** on such assistance or loans;
- Interest earned by the **service provider** on the above-referenced money.

> This provision ensures that student loan repayments and interest payments are processed quickly to maintain financial accountability and prevent delays in government revenue collection.

> Applies only to **service providers** who are authorized under the *Canada Student Financial Assistance Act*.

---

### **5. Withholding of Fees or Commissions**
A person collecting public money is authorized to **withhold fees or commissions** from payments to the Receiver General **if**:

- The fees are determined under:
  - An **enactment** (i.e., a law, as defined in the *Interpretation Act*), or
  - A **contractual arrangement** entered into between **Her Majesty** (the Crown) and the service provider.

#### Allowed Fee Structures:
- A **lump sum**;
- A **percentage** of each amount collected or received; or
- A **flat-rate amount** per transaction.

> This allows service providers (e.g., universities, loan servicers) to recover reasonable administrative or operational costs without violating financial accountability rules, provided the fees are legally or contractually justified.

> ⚠️ *Note: The phrase "repeal" in the original text appears to indicate that this section was later repealed or replaced, though the current version retains the structure.*

---

### **6. Chargeback Mechanism for Dishonoured Payments**
If a payment instruction (e.g., a cheque or electronic transfer) to the Receiver General is **dishonoured after being credited**, the person who collected the money may:

- **Debit the account** into which the instruction was originally credited with the amount of the dishonoured payment; and
- **Provide the Receiver General with confirmation** of the chargeback.

> The Receiver General is then required to **notify the appropriate Minister** of any such chargebacks.

> This mechanism protects government accounts from fraudulent or invalid payments and ensures that financial records accurately reflect actual disbursements.

---

### **7. Expiration and Legal Status**
- The regulations **expired on March 31, 2018**.
- While the original 1997 regulations are no longer in force, their core principles (e.g., timely deposit, recordkeeping, accountability) have likely been incorporated into updated regulations or policy frameworks.
- Some provisions—especially those related to student loan repayments and service provider fees—may have been **replaced or amended** by newer regulations, such as those under the *Canada Student Financial Assistance Regulations* or the *Canada Student Loans Act*.

> The repeal of "financial institution" and the inclusion of a "repeal" note suggest that the scope of the regulations was narrowed or modernized over time.

1. **Ensure transparency and accountability** in the handling of public funds.
2. **Standardize procedures** for recording, receiving, and depositing public money across government and service providers.
