**Detailed Summary of the *Prescribed Deposits (Banks without Deposit Insurance) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Bank Act**:

- **Subsection 413(5)a** and **(6)a** of the *Bank Act*  
These provisions authorize the government to designate certain deposits as "prescribed deposits" for the purpose of applying specific rules related to deposit insurance and banking supervision — particularly in cases where banks are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).

This regulatory instrument establishes a framework to define which deposits are considered "prescribed deposits" and how they are treated under the Bank Act, especially in the context of **banks that are not covered by deposit insurance**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:

- Identify specific types of deposits that are **exempt from CDIC deposit insurance** due to their nature or source.
- Ensure that **certain high-risk or non-residential deposits** — typically involving governments, international institutions, or large financial entities — are not subject to the standard deposit insurance regime.
- Provide clarity on the conditions under which a deposit qualifies as a "prescribed deposit" and thus falls outside the scope of CDIC coverage.

This helps maintain financial stability by allowing banks to accept deposits from entities that may pose systemic or sovereign risk, without the need for insurance coverage that could be financially unsustainable in such cases.

### **3. Definitions Used in the Regulations**

Key definitions used throughout the regulations:

#### **Act**
- Refers to the *Bank Act*, which governs the operations, supervision, and regulation of banks in Canada.

#### **Deposit**
- Defined as the meaning of "deposit" as it would be given in the **Schedule to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act**, **but excluding** subsections 2(2), (5), and (6) of that schedule.
- This is crucial because those subsections typically define what deposits are *exempt* from insurance (e.g., deposits from foreign governments or certain types of institutional accounts). By excluding them, the regulation ensures that **only deposits falling under the prescribed list are excluded** from insurance, and not all deposits from certain entities.

#### **First Deposit Transaction**
- Refers to the **initial deposit** made between a person and a bank that is referred to in **paragraph 413(1)(b) or (c)** of the *Bank Act*.
- This is significant because the classification of a deposit as "prescribed" is **triggered at the first transaction** with the bank, not at any subsequent deposit.

### **4. What Constitutes a "Prescribed Deposit"?**

A deposit is considered a **prescribed deposit** if it meets **one of the following criteria**:

#### **A. Deposits from Sovereign or Government Entities**
- From **Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province**, or an **agent** of those authorities (e.g., municipal or public bodies with governmental functions).
- From the **government of a foreign country**, including its political subdivisions (e.g., states, provinces), agencies, or entities controlled by them.
- From **entities controlled** by any of the above.

> *Note:* This includes sovereign wealth funds, government departments, or public utilities acting in a governmental capacity.

#### **B. International Agencies (with Canada as a member)**
- From an **international agency** to which Canada is a member, such as:
  - Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
  - Asian Development Bank (ADB)
  - Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
  - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
  - Any other regional bank to which Canada is a member
- Also includes **international agencies that are members of the World Bank Group**.

> *Note:* These institutions often provide financing or development loans, and their deposits may be used to fund lending or investment activities.

#### **C. Financial Institutions**
- Any financial institution (e.g., investment banks, insurance companies, credit unions) that meets the definition under Canadian law.

#### **D. Pension Funds**
- A pension fund maintained under a **tax-registered pension plan** (for income tax purposes) with **total assets under administration exceeding $100 million** at the time of the first deposit transaction.

> *Rationale:* Large pension funds are significant financial actors; excluding them from deposit insurance may reflect their stability and risk profile.

#### **E. Mutual Funds**
- A mutual fund that is:
  - Regulated under a **provincial Act** or **laws outside Canada**, and
  - Managed by a person (or fund manager) whose **total managed assets exceed $10 million** at the time of the first deposit transaction.

> *Rationale:* This ensures that only large, well-capitalized mutual funds are included, reducing systemic risk.

#### **F. Entities with High Revenue**
- An entity that, at the time of the first deposit transaction, has **gross revenues exceeding $5 million** during the **immediately preceding fiscal year**.

> *Rationale:* This criterion targets financially robust entities that are likely to have strong creditworthiness and operational stability.

#### **G. Other Entities (Conditional)**
- Any other entity where the deposit facilitates one or more of the following services:
  - **Lending money**
  - **Dealing in foreign exchange**
  - **Dealing in securities (excluding debt obligations of the bank)**

> *Note:* This is a catch-all provision to cover deposits that enable the bank to engage in **highly active or complex financial services**, which may carry higher risk and are not suitable for standard deposit insurance.

### **5. Key Provisions and Implications**

- **Exclusion from CDIC Insurance**:  
  All prescribed deposits are **not covered** by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). This means that in the event of a bank failure, these deposits are **not protected** under the standard $100,000 insurance limit.

- **Trigger Point is the First Transaction**:  
  The classification as a prescribed deposit begins at the **first deposit transaction** between the entity and the bank. Subsequent deposits from the same entity are not re-evaluated unless new conditions arise.

- **No Insurance for Risky or Complex Transactions**:  
  The rules ensure that banks can accept deposits from high-risk or complex sources (e.g., foreign governments, international agencies, or large institutional investors) without being required to offer insurance, which could increase the cost of banking operations or expose the system to unforeseen losses.

- **Risk-Based Approach**:  
  The criteria are designed to identify deposits from **stable, large, or systemically relevant entities** — not random or small-scale deposits — thereby balancing financial stability with access to capital.

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the *Statutes of Canada* (S.C.).  
This means they become effective immediately upon publication and registration, without a specified delay.

---

### **7. Historical Context and Relevance**

- These regulations were first introduced in **1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 46) and **amended in 1999** (S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 21.1).
- They reflect Canada’s effort to **manage financial risk** in the banking system by distinguishing between:
  - **Standard retail deposits** (covered by CDIC)
  - **Institutional or sovereign deposits** (not covered due to systemic or sovereign risk)
- They are part of a broader framework to ensure that **deposit insurance is not misapplied** to deposits that are inherently different in nature, size, or risk profile.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Banks without Deposit Insurance) Regulations* serve as a **targeted exclusion mechanism** from CDIC deposit insurance. They allow banks to accept deposits from **sovereigns, international bodies, large institutions, and high-revenue entities** without being required to provide insurance — a decision based on risk assessment and financial stability considerations.

By clearly defining what constitutes a prescribed deposit and establishing a threshold-based approach (size, revenue, asset base, service provision), the regulations provide **clarity, consistency, and proportionality** in how deposit insurance applies across the Canadian banking system.

These rules are essential for maintaining the integrity of the financial system, especially in the context of international finance and large-scale institutional investment.

**Note**: These regulations do not apply to regular retail deposits. They are specifically designed for institutional and government-level transactions where the risk profile justifies the absence of deposit insurance.
