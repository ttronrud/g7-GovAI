**Detailed Summary of Order No. 96-R-275 – Railway Traffic and Passenger Tariffs Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

**Order No. 96-R-275**, issued on **July 2, 1996**, is a regulatory instrument adopted by the **Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)** under the authority of the **Canada Transportation Act (CTA)**. This order establishes the **Railway Traffic and Passenger Tariffs Regulations**, which set out the mandatory requirements for how railway companies must structure, issue, publish, and maintain their traffic and passenger tariffs.

The regulations came into force on **July 3, 1996**, and are codified in *Statutory Instrument 1996, Chapter 10 (S.C. 1996, c. 10)*.

---

### **Legal Basis**

The regulations are made pursuant to:
- **Subsection 117(2)** of the *Canada Transportation Act*, which authorizes the CTA to establish rules governing railway tariffs.
- **Subsection 36(1)** of the CTA, which empowers the Minister of Transport to approve regulations recommended by the CTA.

This reflects a collaborative process where the CTA develops the rules, and the federal government formally approves them.

---

### **Key Definitions**

Two primary forms of tariff issuance are defined:

1. **Electronic form**  
   – Refers to a digital format in which a tariff is made available for public inspection via electronic means (e.g., website, online database).  
   – Requires specific disclosure rules regarding version history and amendments.

2. **Printed form**  
   – Includes physical formats such as books, pamphlets, single sheets, or loose-leaf sheets.  
   – Must still meet the same content requirements as electronic forms.

These definitions ensure consistency in transparency regardless of the delivery medium.

### **Mandatory Content in Every Tariff (Under Part III of the CTA)**

Every traffic or passenger tariff issued and published by a railway company must include the following elements:

| Requirement | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rate Information** | Clear statement of rates in **dollars and cents** for each: <br> - Designated unit of weight or volume <br> - Type of equipment or service <br> - Passenger class or service type |
| **Brief Description of Category** | A concise explanation of the type of traffic or passenger being transported (e.g., freight, express mail, passenger rail service). |
| **Origin and Destination** | Clearly stated point of origin and destination for each rate. |
| **Route Description** | Either a direct description of the route over which the rate applies, or a reference to a **routing guide** that describes the route. |
| **Tariff Dates** | Must specify: <br> - Date of issuance <br> - Date of coming into force <br> - Date of expiration |
| **Terms and Conditions** | Must include: <br> - Any specific terms and conditions of carriage (e.g., for persons with disabilities) <br> - A reference to where full terms can be found (e.g., in a separate document or section of the tariff) |
| **Explanation of Symbols/Abbreviations** | A clear explanation of any symbols, abbreviations, or codes used in the tariff (to ensure public understanding). |

> This ensures **transparency, clarity, and accessibility** for shippers, passengers, and the public.

### **Additional Requirements for Amended Tariffs**

When a railway company updates or amends its tariff, the revised version must include additional information to ensure accountability and traceability:

#### For **Printed Form Tariffs**:
- **Highlighted changes**: All changes made from the previous tariff must be clearly marked and highlighted (e.g., in bold or with a different font).
- **Supplement references**:
  - If changes are included in a supplement, a reference must be provided to any **cancelled supplements** and where they can be found.
  - A **list of all currently effective supplements** must be included.
- This ensures that users can track the evolution of the tariff and understand what has been added, removed, or modified.

#### For **Electronic Form Tariffs**:
- A **reference to all previous versions** of the tariff items that are being amended must be included.
- This enables users to compare current and prior versions and understand the nature and scope of changes.

> This requirement promotes **accountability, auditability, and public access** to tariff evolution.

### **Repeal Clause**

The document contains two "[Repeal]" entries, which likely indicate that previous tariff regulations or provisions being replaced by this new order are formally repealed. While no specific prior regulations are named in the text provided, this reflects standard regulatory practice where outdated or superseded rules are removed to ensure legal clarity and consistency.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on **July 3, 1996**.
- This date marks the beginning of their legal application across all railway companies operating under Part III of the Canada Transportation Act.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Transparency**  
   – Ensures that all stakeholders (shippers, passengers, competitors, regulators) can easily understand the pricing and service terms offered by railways.

2. **Public Accountability**  
   – Requires clear, accessible, and consistent presentation of tariffs, reducing ambiguity and potential for disputes.

3. **Standardization**  
   – Applies uniform requirements regardless of whether the tariff is printed or electronic, promoting fairness and comparability.

4. **Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities**  
   – Mandates inclusion of terms and conditions related to the carriage of persons with disabilities, promoting inclusivity and compliance with accessibility standards.

5. **Support for Regulatory Oversight**  
   – Provides a clear framework for the CTA and other oversight bodies to monitor and evaluate railway pricing practices.

### **Conclusion**

Order No. 96-R-275 establishes a comprehensive, transparent, and standardized framework for railway tariffs in Canada. By requiring detailed, accessible, and clearly labeled rate information—both in printed and electronic formats—and by mandating clear tracking of amendments, the regulations enhance public trust, promote fair competition, and support effective regulatory oversight.

This regulation remains a foundational piece of Canadian transportation policy, reflecting a commitment to openness, accountability, and consumer protection in the railway sector.

**Note**: Although the regulations were issued in 1996, they remain relevant and have been referenced in subsequent regulatory updates and interpretations, especially in relation to digital access and accessibility standards.
