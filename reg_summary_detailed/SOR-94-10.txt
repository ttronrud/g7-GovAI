### ⚠️ **4. Prohibition of Misleading Markings**

If any of the following appear on goods **outside** the country-of-origin marking:
- “Canada”, “Canadian”, “canadien”, or any abbreviation of these
- The name of another country or place

→ **This may mislead** the purchaser or recipient.

➡️ **Requirement**:
- The **country-of-origin marking must be placed in close proximity** to such a word.
- It must include one of the following expressions:
  - “made in”
  - “produced in”
  - “printed in”
  - Or any equivalent expression in the applicable language(s)

> This ensures that consumers are not misled into thinking the product was made in Canada or another country when it was not.

### 📅 **7. Timing of Marking (When and How)**

#### ✅ General Rule:
- Goods **must be marked before importation** into Canada.

#### ✅ Exceptions (Marking After Importation):
Marking **may occur after importation** but **before release**, **only if**:

1. The goods are **not imported as mail**
2. **No notice** has been served under subsection 35.02(2) of the *Customs Act* regarding:
   - Similar goods
   - Identical goods
   (OR the notice was served **less than 30 days or more than 2 years** before importation)
3. The importer provides **written notice** to a customs officer **before importation** that marking will be done in Canada, **OR**
   - At the time of importation, provides notice **with proof** that prior notice was not possible
4. The importer **complies with any instructions** given under **Section 15**

> 🔍 **Section 15 – Officer Instructions**  
After receiving such a notice, the customs officer must provide written instructions specifying:
- The **customs office, bonded warehouse, or sufferance warehouse** where marking will occur
- The **time limit** for completing the marking
- The **location** where the goods must be made available for inspection after marking

> 📝 Importers must **present a copy of these instructions** to an officer at:
- Time of **reporting under Section 12** of the Act
- Time of **accounting under subsection 32(1) or (2)** of the Act

> ⚠️ **If goods are delivered to a bonded warehouse before marking**:
- Marking must be completed **before** a transfer document is submitted under Section 18 of the *Customs Bonded Warehouse Regulations*

---

### 📜 **8. Application to Prior Imports**

> The **old marking rules** (as they existed immediately before the coming into force of these regulations) **apply retroactively** to goods imported **before** the coming into force of **Section 183 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act (2020)**.

This ensures **legal continuity** for goods already imported and helps avoid retroactive penalties or enforcement actions.

> 📌 Note: Section 183 (which replaced earlier provisions) was introduced in 2020 to further refine country-of-origin marking under CUSMA. The 1993 regulations remain in force **for pre-2020 imports**.
