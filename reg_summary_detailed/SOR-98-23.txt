**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Remission Order in Respect of Goods Under the Customs Duties Reduction or Removal Order, 1988*

### **Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff Act** (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)), based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **grant a remission (i.e., refund or cancellation) of customs duties** that were previously paid or were payable on certain goods, specifically those listed in the *Customs Duties Reduction or Removal Order, 1988*. The remission applies to the **difference between the original customs duty rates** and the **reduced or removed duty rates** established under that 1988 Order.

This is a **corrective or compensatory measure**, ensuring that importers are not penalized for duties that were already reduced or eliminated under the 1988 Order.

### **Key Provisions and Conditions:**

#### **1. Remission for Goods in Part 1 of the Schedule (Section 1)**  
- **Applicable Goods:**  
  Goods described in the **codes listed in Part 1 of the Schedule** to this Order.  
  These goods must be those as described in the *Customs Duties Reduction or Removal Order, 1988*, as they existed **during the period referred to in Section 3** of the 1988 Order.

- **Timing Condition:**  
  The goods must have been **imported between July 1, 1991, and the date this Order comes into force** (December 29, 1997).

- **Amount of Remission:**  
  The amount remitted equals the **difference** between:  
  - The customs duty amount payable under **Schedule I of the Customs Tariff** (the original, pre-reduction rate),  
  - The customs duty amount specified in **Column IV** of the *Customs Duties Reduction or Removal Order, 1988* (the reduced or removed rate).

> ✅ *Example:* If the original duty was 10% and the reduced duty is 2%, the remitted amount is 8%.

#### **2. Remission for Goods in Part 2 of the Schedule (Section 2)**  
- **Applicable Goods:**  
  Goods described in the **codes listed in Column 1 of Part 2 of the Schedule** to this Order.

- **Timing Condition:**  
  The goods must have been imported during a **specific period** defined in **Column 2 of Part 2 of the Schedule**.  
  This period starts on **July 1, 1991**, and ends on the **corresponding date** listed in Column 2 (e.g., January 31, 1993, or another specific date).

> ⚠️ *Note:* This provision allows for **different importation periods** for different goods, reflecting targeted or phased reductions.

- **Amount of Remission:**  
  Same calculation as in Section 1:  
  **Difference between original duty (Schedule I)** and **reduced duty (Column IV of the 1988 Order)**.

---

### **General Conditions:**

- **Section 3 and Section 4 Reference:**  
  The descriptions of goods in the schedules are interpreted **as they existed during the relevant period** (Section 3 for Part 1, Section 4 for Part 2). This ensures consistency with the original intent of the 1988 Order.

- **Remission is Conditional:**  
  The remission is **not automatic**. It is granted **only if** the goods were imported within the specified time frames.

- **Repeal Note:**  
  This regulation was **repealed by SOR/2001-73, Section 7**.  
  > ⚠️ **Important:** Although the regulation was issued in 1997 and came into force on December 29, 1997, it was **officially repealed in 2001**. This means that **the remission provisions no longer apply** under current law.  
  > The repeal indicates that the government has discontinued the financial relief for these goods, likely due to changes in trade policy, tariff structure, or the obsolescence of the 1988 Order.

---

### **Effective Date:**  
- **Date of Coming Into Force:** **December 29, 1997**  
  This is the date from which the remission applies to goods imported within the specified timeframes.

### **Interpretation and Implications:**

- This regulation was a **temporary, targeted relief measure** to correct or compensate importers who had paid higher duties than were later reduced or removed under the 1988 Order.
- It reflects a **policy of duty reduction** aimed at promoting trade, especially in specific product categories (e.g., agricultural, manufactured, or consumer goods).
- The **repeal in 2001** suggests that the original reduction policy has been revised, or the goods are no longer considered eligible for duty relief under current tariff arrangements.

---

### **Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a detailed framework for refunding customs duties on specific imported goods that were subject to reductions under the 1988 Order. However, **it is no longer in effect**, having been formally repealed in 2001. As such, **no remission is currently available** under this Order, and importers must now comply with current duty rates as set out in the Customs Tariff Act and its schedules.

> 🔍 **Note for Practitioners:** This Order should not be relied upon for current duty claims. All claims for duty remission must be evaluated under **current legislation**, and the repeal in 2001 renders this regulation legally obsolete.

✅ **Final Note:** This is a **historical regulatory instrument** with no current legal effect.
