---

### **Overview**

The *Immigration Appeal Division Rules, 2022*, approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration under **subsection 161(1)a of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**, establish the procedural framework governing appeals before the **Immigration Appeal Division (Division)** of the **Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)**. These rules provide detailed guidance on how appeals are initiated, managed, and resolved, with a strong emphasis on **efficiency, fairness, accessibility, and compliance**.

The rules were issued on **October 21, 2022**, by the Chairperson of the IRB in consultation with Deputy Chairpersons, and are designed to ensure that all appeals—whether involving sponsorship, removal orders, residency obligations, or ministerial appeals—are processed in a timely, transparent, and equitable manner.

## **Core Principles and Flexibility**

1. **Informal and Expedited Resolution**  
   The rules emphasize resolving appeals as **informally and quickly as possible**, while respecting **fairness and natural justice**.

2. **Flexibility in Procedures**  
   The Division has broad discretion to:
   - Act on its own initiative (without a party requesting it);
   - Modify, excuse, extend, or shorten time limits;
   - Change procedural requirements.

3. **Non-Invalidation of Proceedings**  
   A failure to follow any rule does **not invalidate** the appeal proceedings, unless declared invalid by the Division.

4. **Communication Requirements**  
   All communications must be directed to the **registry office**. This ensures centralized, recordable, and accessible administrative processes.
