**Detailed Summary of the Sydney Pilots’ Pension Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Sydney Pilots’ Pension Regulations* are a statutory instrument enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** and the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966**. These regulations implement a transition of pension obligations from a prior, district-specific by-law system (the *Sydney Pilotage District General By-law*) to the national public service pension framework governed by the **Public Service Superannuation Act (Act)**.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **reform and standardize pension entitlements** for Sydney pilots who ceased employment before October 1, 1966, and to ensure that pilots who began service on or after that date are treated under the uniform, national public service pension scheme.

### **Key Provisions and Timeline**

#### **1. Transfer of Pension Fund Assets (Effective by March 31, 1967)**

- **Mandatory Transfer**: By **March 31, 1967**, the **Pilotage Authority** is required to:
  - Pay to the **Minister of Finance**:
    - All remaining funds in the **Sydney Pilots’ Pension Fund**, including **accrued interest**.
  - Transfer to the Minister of Finance:
    - All **securities** held in the Pension Fund, along with **accrued interest** on those securities.

> This ensures a complete liquidation of the old, localized pension fund and its assets into the national public service system.

---

#### **2. Reinvestment into the Public Service Superannuation Account (By March 31, 1968)**

- The **Minister of Finance** must:
  - Deposit all funds received from the Authority into the **Superannuation Account**.
  - **Liquidate** all transferred securities.
  - Pay the **proceeds from liquidation** into the Superannuation Account **by March 31, 1968**.

> This ensures that the pension assets are fully integrated into the national public service pension system, where they can be managed under uniform, standardized rules.

---

#### **3. Payment of Pensions to Former Pilots (Post-Transition)**

- Starting on the **first day of the month following the completion of the transfer** (i.e., after March 31, 1967), the Superannuation Account shall pay:
  - Any pension **already being paid** out of the old Pension Fund on that date.
  - Any pension or amount that **would have been payable** under **Part II of the By-law as it read on October 1, 1966**, for individuals who **ceased employment as pilots before October 1, 1966**.

> This provision ensures **continuity of pension payments** for former pilots, preserving their entitlements under the old system while transitioning to the new one.

---

#### **4. Terms and Conditions of Payments**

- All pensions or amounts paid under this transition are to be issued **subject to the same terms and conditions** as they would have been under **Part II of the By-law as it existed on October 1, 1966**.

> This maintains legal and financial consistency with the previous system, protecting the rights of former pilots.

---

#### **5. New Contributors from October 1, 1966 Onward**

- Every pilot who began employment in the Public Service on or after **October 1, 1966** is **deemed to have become a contributor** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* from that date.

> This ensures that new pilots are automatically covered under the national pension scheme, eliminating any gap in coverage.

---

#### **6. Recognition of Prior Service (Pensionable Service)**

For pilots who had active service **before October 1, 1966**, the regulations establish a method to **recognize their prior service** as pensionable under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

##### **Key Assumptions for Service Recognition**:

- The pilot’s **pensionable service** as of October 1, 1966, is deemed to be:
  - The **most recent portion** of their active service under the old by-law.
  - Calculated based on **accumulated contributions** under the old system, adjusted to reflect the new Act.

##### **Calculation Method**:

The Minister (President of the Treasury Board) shall calculate pensionable service under the following **hypothetical conditions**:

| Condition | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Contribution Rate** | The accumulated contributions under the old by-law are assumed to be equivalent to contributions under the Act, **at twice the rate** of the applicable contribution rate for a corresponding period of service in the Public Service. |
| **2. Salary Equivalent** | The salary paid to the pilot during the service period is assumed to be equal to the **actual compensation** paid as a pilot. |
| **3. Interest on Contributions** | Interest is assumed to be paid on contributions at a rate **equal to the interest rate** under the Public Service Superannuation Act during that period, calculated from the **middle of each fiscal year** until October 1, 1966. |

> This method effectively converts historical service and compensation into a standardized, actuarially equivalent pensionable service under the national system.

---

#### **7. Accumulated Contributions (Definition)**

- For a pilot described in subsection (1), **accumulated contributions** are defined as:
  - The total amount of contributions **already in the Pension Fund**.
  - Plus **interest** at a rate of **3% per annum, compounded annually**, calculated from the **middle of each fiscal year** during the pilot’s active service until October 1, 1966.

> This interest is applied to preserve the value of past contributions and reflects a fair adjustment for time value of money.

### **Key Objectives and Impacts**

1. **Transition to National System**:
   - Moves Sydney pilots from a localized, by-law-based pension system to a **national, standardized public service pension system**.

2. **Continuity of Benefits**:
   - Ensures that former pilots (who left before October 1, 1966) continue to receive pensions as they would have under the old rules.

3. **Fair Treatment of New Pilots**:
   - Ensures that pilots starting work on or after October 1, 1966 are automatically covered under the national pension scheme.

4. **Fair Recognition of Prior Service**:
   - Uses a fair, transparent method to convert historical service into pensionable service under the new Act, using adjusted contribution rates and interest.

5. **Financial Accountability**:
   - Establishes clear timelines and responsibilities for the transfer of funds and securities, ensuring proper financial management and auditability.

### **Conclusion**

The *Sydney Pilots’ Pension Regulations* represent a **structured and equitable transition** from a regional, ad hoc pension system to a unified national public service pension framework. By clearly defining timelines, financial obligations, and the treatment of prior service, the regulations ensure **legal consistency, financial integrity, and fairness** for both former and new pilots.

This transition not only modernizes pension administration but also aligns the Sydney pilotage community with broader federal public service standards, promoting long-term stability and retirement security.

> **Note**: These regulations were enacted in 1966 and are historically significant as an early example of federal integration of regional occupational pension systems into a national superannuation framework.
