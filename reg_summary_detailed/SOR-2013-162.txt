**Detailed Summary of the Least Developed Country Tariff Withdrawal Order (2013 GPT Review)**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 38a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended), specifically through a decision made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This means that the government, acting on financial and trade policy advice, formally enacts this order as a binding administrative measure.

The regulation is formally referenced under:
- **S.C. 2011, c. 24, s. 119** (a provision authorizing tariff adjustments based on trade agreements and development status)
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** (the original Customs Tariff Act, which provides the legal framework for tariff treatment of goods)

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this **Least Developed Country Tariff Withdrawal Order (2013 GPT Review)** is to **withdraw the benefit of preferential tariff treatment** (i.e., reduced or zero tariffs) that had previously been granted to goods originating from two specific countries:  
- **Equatorial Guinea**  
- **Maldives**

This withdrawal is based on a **review of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)**, specifically the 2013 GPT (GSP-T) review conducted by Canada. The GSP-T program provides tariff reductions for goods from least developed countries (LDCs), but eligibility can be revoked if a country fails to meet the criteria for LDC status (such as economic development, human development, or governance standards).

---

**3. Scope of the Withdrawal**  
- The preferential tariff treatment (benefit of LDC tariff rates) is **fully withdrawn** for **all goods** that originate in **Equatorial Guinea** and **Maldives**.
- This means that, effective from the date of enforcement, such goods will be subject to **normal Canadian tariff rates** (i.e., non-preferential duties), unless otherwise exempted by other provisions.

---

**4. Exemption for Goods in Transit**  
A key exception is provided under **Section 1** of the Order:  
- The withdrawal of LDC tariff benefits **does not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada before January 1, 2015**.  
- This provision ensures that goods already in the process of being transported into Canada prior to the effective date of the order are not subject to retroactive tariff changes or penalties.  
- This exception is intended to provide **commercial stability and fairness** to importers and carriers who were already engaged in cross-border shipments before the policy change.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
- The Order **comes into force on January 1, 2015**.  
- All goods originating from Equatorial Guinea and Maldives that are imported into Canada on or after this date will no longer qualify for LDC tariff treatment.

---

**6. Legal and Policy Implications**  
- This order reflects Canada’s ongoing review and adjustment of its GSP-T program to ensure that preferential treatment is only granted to countries that meet strict LDC criteria.
- The decision to withdraw benefits from Equatorial Guinea and Maldives may be based on findings during the 2013 GPT review that these countries no longer meet the required thresholds for LDC status—such as levels of economic development, human development indicators, or progress toward poverty reduction.
- It also demonstrates Canada’s commitment to **trade policy transparency**, accountability, and alignment with international development standards.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation formally ends the preferential tariff treatment for goods from Equatorial Guinea and Maldives under Canada’s Least Developed Country (LDC) program. It applies to all new imports from these countries starting January 1, 2015, with a critical exemption for goods already in transit prior to that date. The order is grounded in statutory authority and reflects Canada’s periodic review of its trade preferences to ensure alignment with development goals and policy objectives.
