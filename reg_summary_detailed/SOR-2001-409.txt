---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulations are issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This authority is derived from **subsection 983(16)a of the Bank Act** (as amended).

- The Bank Act is a key piece of Canadian financial regulation that governs the operations, oversight, and conduct of banks and bank holding companies.
- Subsection 983(16)a empowers the government to establish rules regarding the use of a bank’s or bank holding company’s name in securities-related transactions, ensuring clarity, transparency, and compliance with legal and reputational standards.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear conditions under which a bank or bank holding company may use its name** in connection with securities-related transactions.

This includes:
- Public disclosures such as **prospectuses**
- **Offering memoranda**
- **Takeover bid circulars**
- **Advertisements** for securities transactions
- Any other document used in connection with a securities-related transaction

The goal is to **protect investors**, **maintain financial integrity**, and **prevent misleading or unauthorized use of a financial institution’s name**, which could lead to confusion or reputational harm.

### **3. Conditions for Name Use**

A person (e.g., an investment firm, underwriter, or issuer) may use the name of a bank or a bank holding company in a securities-related document **only if one of the following conditions is met**:

#### **(a) Required by Law**
- The use of the name is mandated by applicable laws or regulatory requirements.  
  *Example*: A legal requirement in a securities offering or under a statutory obligation (such as disclosure rules under securities legislation).

#### **(b) Written Permission from the Bank or Bank Holding Company**
- The bank or bank holding company must have **explicitly given written consent** to the use of its name in the document.
- This consent must be **specific and documented**, ensuring that the use is authorized and not implied or assumed.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The use of a bank’s name **without legal requirement or written permission** is prohibited. This prevents unauthorized promotion or association, which could mislead the public or violate fiduciary obligations.

### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- **Banks** (as defined under the Bank Act)

The rules cover all forms of **securities-related transactions**, including:
- Initial public offerings (IPOs)
- Private placements
- Takeover bids

- The regulations were officially published and came into effect on **October 24, 2001**, as noted in the statutory instrument **SI/2001-102**.
