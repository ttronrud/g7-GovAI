## **Remission Provisions**

### **1. Remission for Denim Fabric Producers (Section 3)**  
*Applies to denim fabrics imported from the U.S. by a denim fabric producer.*

- **Remission Granted**:  
  For each calendar year from **1989 to 1993**, the customs duties on **U.S.-produced denim fabrics imported into Canada** are remitted **if** the volume of such fabrics sold to an apparel manufacturer equals **20% of the total volume of Canadian-produced denim fabric** sold by the producer to apparel manufacturers **in that same calendar year**.

> Example:  
> If a denim fabric producer sold 10,000 square meters of Canadian denim fabric to apparel manufacturers in 1990, they may claim remission on up to 2,000 square meters (20%) of U.S.-produced denim fabric imported during that year.

- **Volume Adjustment Rule (Reduction Clause)**:  
  If the total volume of Canadian denim fabric sold by the producer **in a given year is less than the previous year**, the remission volume for the **next year is reduced** by **1.5% for every 1% decrease** in volume.

> Example:  
> If sales drop by 5%, the remission volume for the following year is reduced by 7.5% (5 × 1.5%).

- **Exemptions from Reduction Clause**:  
  This volume reduction rule **does not apply** to:
  - The **1991** or **1992** calendar years.
  - The **1993** calendar year.

> This was likely intended to provide stability during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility.

### **2. Remission for Apparel Manufacturers (Section 5)**  
*Applies to denim fabrics imported by an apparel manufacturer for use in Canadian apparel manufacturing.*

- **Remission Rate Depends on Proportion of Canadian Denim Fabric Used**:

| Proportion of Canadian Denim Fabric Used | Remission Rate |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| ≥ 80% of total volume used             | **100% remission** of customs duties |
| < 80% of total volume used            | **100% remission minus 10 percentage points per 1 percentage point below 80%** |

> Example:  
> If an apparel manufacturer uses 10,000 square meters of denim fabric and purchases only 70% Canadian denim (i.e., 7,000 m²), the remission is **100% – 10% = 90%** of customs duties.

> Example:  
> If only 60% Canadian denim is used (6,000 m²), remission is **100% – 20% = 80%**.

> This creates a **strong incentive** for apparel manufacturers to source Canadian denim, reducing reliance on imported U.S. denim.

   - The *Shirting Fabrics Remission Order, 1988*  
   - The *Outerwear Fabrics and Outerwear Apparel Remission Order*  
   - The *Outerwear Greige Fabrics for Converting Remission Order*

## **Policy Objectives and Context**

- **Support for Canadian Industry**:  
  The Order aims to strengthen the **Canadian denim manufacturing sector** by reducing the cost of importing U.S. denim fabric, especially during a period when Canadian producers were trying to compete with lower-cost U.S. and global alternatives.

- **Encouraging Domestic Sourcing**:  
  By offering **greater remission** when Canadian denim is used, the policy incentivizes apparel manufacturers to source from Canadian producers, thereby promoting **domestic value addition** and **job creation**.

- **Temporary Nature**:  
  The Order is limited to the **1989–1993** period, reflecting a **short-term economic intervention** designed to stimulate growth in a specific sector during a transitional phase.

- **Sector-Specific Focus**:  
  The policy is targeted at **denim apparel**, not broader textiles or other clothing types, indicating a strategic focus on a high-value, export-oriented sector.
