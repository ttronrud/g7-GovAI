---

### **Overview**

The *Electronic Payments Regulations*, made under **paragraph 10(f) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, establish a comprehensive framework governing how payments are issued from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF)** of Canada using **electronic instructions for payment**. These regulations ensure the **security, accuracy, integrity, and accountability** of electronic payments made by the federal government to individuals or entities (payees) through financial institutions.

The regulations came into force on **February 23, 1998**, and apply to all payments made from the CRF via electronic means.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), the primary legislation under which these regulations are made. |
| **Chargeback** | A mechanism by which a financial institution adjusts the amount payable or claimed due to a refusal by the Receiver General to redeem an electronic payment instruction. It serves as a corrective measure when a payment fails. |
| **Digital Signature** | A cryptographic method that verifies both the origin of a message and its integrity. It ensures that only the intended sender can produce the signature, and that the message has not been altered since signing. |

| **Financial Institution** | Includes banks, trust companies, and cooperative credit societies that hold client deposits and honor payment instructions. Defined broadly to include entities incorporated under federal or provincial law or foreign jurisdictions. |
| **Media** | Any physical electronic storage device such as magnetic tapes, disks, or diskettes used to store electronic payment instructions. |
| **Payee** | The individual or entity receiving the payment. |
| **Payment Date** | The date on which the payment is required to be made. |
| **Revoke** | The act of issuing a countermand or cancellation instruction to cancel a previously issued electronic payment. |

## **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **every payment made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund** using an **electronic instruction for payment**.

---

## **Requirements for Issuing an Electronic Instruction for Payment**

Every such instruction must:

1. **Be issued by or under the direction and control of the Receiver General**  
   → Ensures that only authorized government officials can initiate payments, maintaining accountability and preventing unauthorized transactions.

2. **Include the following elements**:
   - The **amount of the payment**
   - A **unique payment reference number** (for tracking and audit purposes)
   - The **name of the payee**
   - The **payee’s financial institution number, branch number, and account number**
   - The **payment date**

3. **When issued via on-line transfer**, it must be **authorized by a digital signature**  
   → This enhances security and authenticity of online transactions, ensuring the instruction originates from a verified source and has not been tampered with.

## **Receiver General’s Responsibilities (Security & Integrity)**

The Receiver General must take all necessary measures to ensure:

- **Security** of the system used to transmit electronic instructions  
- **Confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity** of data during transmission or while under the Receiver General’s control  
- **Security, integrity, and safekeeping** of the physical media (e.g., tapes, disks) while under the Receiver General’s control or in transit to a financial institution  

→ These obligations protect against data breaches, unauthorized access, alteration, or loss of payment data.

---

## **Media Requirements**

All physical media used to issue electronic instructions must contain **internal labels** identifying the media with the following information:

- Originating data centre  
- Processing data centre  
- File creation date and file number  
- Date and time of release of the media  
- System, file identification number, volume serial number, and sequence of the originator’s file  

→ This allows for full traceability and auditability of each payment instruction.

When delivered to a financial institution, the media must be accompanied by a **transmittal document** that includes the same information (as per subparagraphs a)(i) to (v) above), and this document must be:

- Signed by the **Deputy Receiver General** or by a person **authorized in writing** by the Deputy Receiver General.

→ Ensures accountability and provides a formal record of delivery and content.

Additionally, the **Deputy Receiver General must provide** to each financial institution:

- The **names** and **specimen signatures** of all individuals authorized to sign transmittal documents addressed to that institution.  
→ Prevents forgery and ensures that only authorized personnel can authorize payment transfers.

---

## **Verification and Acknowledgment by Financial Institutions**

- Every electronic instruction received by a financial institution must be **acknowledged**.
- Every electronic authorization must be **verified** by the financial institution to ensure the **integrity** of the instruction.  
→ Ensures that the instruction is valid, complete, and has not been altered during transmission.

---

## **Timing of Fund Availability to Payees**

A financial institution that accepts an electronic instruction must make the funds available to the payee **by the following deadlines**:

- **Not later than the opening of business on the payment date**, if the instruction is received **before** the payment date.  
- **On receipt**, if the instruction is received **on or after** the payment date.

→ Ensures timely disbursement of funds while allowing flexibility in timing based on when the instruction arrives.

---

## **Replacement Payment Mechanism (Chargeback Process)**

If a payment has **not been credited** to the designated account by the payment date (as per the financial institution’s agreement), and it is confirmed with the institution that the payment was not credited:

A **replacement payment** may be issued **to the same amount** as the original payment **only if**:

1. The electronic instruction for payment has been **revoked** (cancelled), and  
2. The amount already paid to the financial institution (if any) has been **recovered** through:
   - A **chargeback**, or  
   - Other means (e.g., reversal)

→ This safeguards against failed payments and ensures that the government is not financially liable for uncredited payments due to system errors or misdirected instructions.

---

## **Repeal Clause**

The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that any prior conflicting or outdated rules are superseded by these new regulations.

## **Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Enhance Security** | Digital signatures, secure transmission, and encrypted data protect against fraud and unauthorized access. |
| **Ensure Accountability** | Detailed labeling, transmittal documents, and authorized signatories ensure traceability and auditability. |
| **Guarantee Timeliness** | Clear deadlines for fund availability ensure payees receive funds when due. |
| **Provide a Recovery Mechanism** | Chargeback and replacement rules allow for correction of errors without financial loss. |
| **Modernize Government Payments** | Enables efficient, scalable, and secure electronic payment systems, reducing reliance on paper-based or manual processes. |

## **Conclusion**

The *Electronic Payments Regulations* represent a foundational step in the modernization of federal government financial operations. By establishing clear, enforceable standards for the issuance, transmission, verification, and recovery of electronic payments, the regulations:

- Improve **efficiency** and **accuracy** in government payments  
- Strengthen **financial security** and **data integrity**  
- Provide **transparency** and **accountability**  
- Enable the use of **digital technologies** in public finance  

These provisions remain relevant today, serving as a model for secure, standardized electronic payment systems in public administration.
