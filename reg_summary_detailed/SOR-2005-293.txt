**Detailed Summary of the Basin Head Marine Protected Area Regulations**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 1996, c. 31*  
*Made under subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act*

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**
The Basin Head Marine Protected Area (MPA) Regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, pursuant to **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to designate marine protected areas to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

These regulations formally establish the **Basin Head Marine Protected Area (Area)**, a designated region in the Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic waters off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, with specific boundaries and management rules designed to protect marine life and habitats.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Area"**: Refers to the Basin Head Marine Protected Area as designated under Section 2 of the Regulations. It is a legally defined zone of marine waters, seabed, and subsoil.
  
- **"Vessel"**: Defined in accordance with **Section 2 of the Canada Shipping Act**, meaning any watercraft used in navigation or transport, including boats, ships, and barges.

- **"Waters"**: Includes not only surface waters but also the **seabed and subsoil** beneath the surface, extending down to a depth of **two meters**. This ensures that both surface and near-bottom ecological features are protected.

- **Geodetic Reference System**: All coordinates in the schedule are expressed in the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)**, ensuring accuracy and consistency in mapping and boundary demarcation.

- **Rhumb Lines**: In the schedule, lines connecting points are drawn as **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing), which are used for navigation and boundary definition rather than straight or great-circle lines. This simplifies mapping and ensures consistency in maritime navigation.

### **3. Geographic Boundaries of the Basin Head Marine Protected Area**

The Area is composed of three distinct management zones — **Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3** — each with specific boundary descriptions derived from rhumb lines and natural features.

#### **Zone 1**
- Located **generally northeast** of a rhumb line connecting:
  - 46°23′20″ N, 62°06′10″ W  
  - 46°23′18″ N, 62°06′08″ W
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line of the harbour** (the edge of the water at low tide)
  - The rhumb line connecting the above two points, intersecting the low-water line

> *Zone 1 is the most restricted zone, with strict protections due to its sensitivity and proximity to the harbour.*

#### **Zone 2**
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line of the harbour**
  - Two rhumb lines:
    1. From 46°23′20″ N, 62°06′10″ W to 46°23′18″ N, 62°06′08″ W  
    2. From 46°22′39″ N, 62°06′29″ W to 46°22′40″ N, 62°06′29″ W

> *Zone 2 allows limited human activities, including recreational and commercial fishing, and includes areas near infrastructure such as boat launches.*

#### **Zone 3**
- Bounded by:
  - The **low-water line of the Northumberland Straight** (a navigable waterway)
  - Four rhumb lines:
    1. From 46°22′39″ N, 62°06′29″ W to 46°22′40″ N, 62°06′29″ W  
    2. From 46°23′51″ N, 62°04′30″ W to 46°22′55″ N, 62°04′02″ W  
    3. From 46°22′55″ N, 62°04′02″ W to 46°21′07″ N, 62°07′36″ W  
    4. From 46°21′07″ N, 62°07′36″ W to 46°22′04″ N, 62°08′04″ W

> *Zone 3 is more remote and extends into deeper waters, with fewer permitted activities.*

---

### **4. Prohibited Activities in the Area**

No person may:
- **Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove** any living marine organism or any part of its habitat within the Area.
- **Deposit, discharge, or dump** any substance (including waste, pollutants, or debris) in a way that could lead to such disturbance, damage, or destruction.

> These prohibitions apply to all forms of human activity, including construction, dredging, anchoring, or dumping of materials.

---

### **5. Exceptions to Prohibitions**

Despite the above prohibitions, the following activities are **permitted**:

#### **Fishing Activities**
- **Aboriginal Communal Fishing**: Fishing conducted under **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations** (supports Indigenous rights and traditional practices).
- **Recreational Fishing**:
  - In **Zone 2 or 3**, permitted under:
    - *Maritime Provinces Fishery Regulations* (general jurisdiction)
    - *Wildlife Conservation Act of Prince Edward Island* (R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. W-4.1)
- **Commercial Fishing**:
  - In **Zone 2 or 3**, permitted under:
    - *Atlantic Fishery Regulations 1985*
    - *Maritime Provinces Fishery Regulations*

> *Note: Fishing must be conducted in accordance with existing fishery regulations and permits.*

#### **Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair**
- In **Zone 2**: Maintenance, repair, or removal of **bridges, wharfs, or boat launches**.
- In **Zone 3**: Maintenance, repair, or removal of **bridges or wharfs**.

> *These activities are permitted if they are necessary for infrastructure upkeep and do not cause significant ecological harm.*

#### **Public Safety, National Defence, National Security, and Law Enforcement**
- Any activity related to:
  - Public safety (e.g., emergency response)
  - National defence or security
  - Law enforcement (e.g., patrol, search and rescue)

> *These are considered essential and exempt from the general prohibitions.*

#### **Emergency Response**
- Activities carried out in response to emergencies (e.g., oil spills, natural disasters) are exempt.

### **6. Scientific and Educational Activities**

Any person proposing to carry out a **scientific or educational activity** in the Area must submit a **detailed plan** to the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** at least **60 days before the activity begins**.

#### **Required Components of the Plan**
The plan must include:
1. Contact information for the lead individual or organization.
2. A detailed description of:
   - Purpose of the activity
   - Duration (periods of operation)
   - Location (with a map)
   - Types of data to be collected and methods (sampling protocols)
   - Equipment to be used (including anchoring/mooring methods)
   - Vessels involved (type, identity)
   - Substances to be deposited, discharged, or dumped (if any)
3. An **environmental impact assessment** evaluating likely effects on marine organisms and habitats.
4. A list of all relevant **licences, permits, authorizations, or consents** obtained or applied for.

#### **Minister’s Approval Criteria**
The Minister shall **approve** the plan if:
- The activity is **not likely to damage or destroy** the habitat of living marine organisms.
- For **scientific activities in Zone 1**:
  - The activity is for **managing the Area** or **monitoring conservation measures**.
- For **educational activities in Zone 1**:
  - The activity aims to **increase public awareness** or **inform the public about conservation efforts**.

#### **Cumulative Environmental Effects**
The Minister **shall not approve** a plan if:
- The **cumulative environmental effects** of the proposed activity — combined with **past and current activities** in the Area — are likely to harm or destroy marine habitats.

> This reflects a precautionary approach, emphasizing long-term ecological sustainability.
