**Detailed Summary of the Children’s Jewellery Regulations (S.C. 2016, c. 9, s. 67; SOR/2016-168)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The *Children’s Jewellery Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Health**, under **Section 37a of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. This provision empowers the federal government to establish specific safety standards for consumer products, particularly those that pose a risk to children.

These regulations were formally published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, and came into force on a date determined by the publication schedule (see below).

### **2. Scope and Definitions**

#### **Definition of "Children’s Jewellery"**
- **Children’s jewellery** refers to any item of jewellery that:
  - Is **manufactured, sized, decorated, packaged, advertised, or sold** in a manner that **appeals primarily to children under 15 years of age**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Does **not include** merit badges, medals for achievement, or other similar items that are:
    - Worn only occasionally.
    - Not designed or marketed primarily for children.
- This definition ensures that only products intended for or marketed to young children are subject to these safety standards.

> Example: A charm bracelet marketed as a "kids' birthday gift" would fall under this definition. A traditional medal awarded at a school event would not.

#### **Definition of "Good Laboratory Practices" (GLP)**
- GLP refers to the **principles outlined in the OECD document** titled:
  - *OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice, Number 1*, specifically **ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17**.
  - Published in English on **January 21, 1998**, and in French on **March 6, 1998**.
- These practices ensure that:
  - Laboratory testing is conducted in a **reproducible, reliable, and scientifically valid** manner.
  - Data generated is **accurate, traceable, and credible**.
- The use of GLP is required to validate the safety testing of children’s jewellery for lead and cadmium content.

### **3. Key Safety Limits**

#### **Lead Content Limit**
- Children’s jewellery **must not contain more than 90 mg/kg of lead** when tested using good laboratory practices.
- This limit applies to **all children’s jewellery**, regardless of size or design.

> Rationale: Lead is a toxic heavy metal that can cause serious health issues in children, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, and neurological damage. This limit is designed to protect young children who may ingest small parts or come into contact with lead through touch or chewing.

#### **Cadmium Content Limit (Conditional)**
- Children’s jewellery **must not contain more than 130 mg/kg of cadmium** **only if**:
  - The item is **small enough to be fully enclosed** within the **small parts cylinder** (a standardized test device) when a force of **no more than 4.45 N (Newtons)** is applied.
- This condition applies to **small parts** that could be a choking hazard or ingested by children.
- If the item is **not small enough** to fit into the cylinder under this force, the cadmium limit does **not apply**.

> Example: A large, oversized pendant that cannot fit into the small parts cylinder would be exempt from the cadmium limit. However, a small pendant or bead that fits into the cylinder would be subject to the 130 mg/kg cadmium cap.

> Rationale: Cadmium is also toxic, especially in high concentrations. It can accumulate in the body and cause kidney damage and respiratory problems. The conditional limit protects children from exposure to small, potentially ingestible components.

### **4. Repeal of Previous Regulations**
- The **previous Children’s Jewellery Regulations** are **repealed** by this new regulation.
- This indicates that the current rules represent a **revised, updated, and more specific** set of safety standards, replacing outdated or less protective provisions.

---

### **5. Effective Date and Enforcement Timeline**

- The regulations come into force on:
  - The **day in the sixth month** after the month in which they are published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, **that has the same calendar date as the publication date**.
  - If no such day exists in that sixth month (e.g., if the publication date is on the 31st, and June has no 31st), then the regulations come into force on the **last day of that sixth month**.

> Example: If the regulations are published on **October 5, 2016**, then:
- The sixth month after October is **April 2017**.
- April has a 5th → regulations come into force on **April 5, 2017**.

> This staggered implementation allows manufacturers and importers time to adjust their production and compliance processes.

---

### **6. Key Dates and Status**
- **Date of Publication**: Not explicitly stated in the excerpt, but implied to be in 2016 (S.C. 2016, c. 9).
- **Effective Date**: As per the above calculation, likely **April 5, 2017** (if published in October 2016).
- **Status in Force**: As of **November 2, 2018**, these regulations were in effect.

---

### **7. Purpose and Public Health Impact**
- The primary goal of these regulations is to **protect children from exposure to toxic heavy metals** (lead and cadmium) in products they are likely to touch, wear, or ingest.
- By setting **science-based, internationally recognized standards** (aligned with OECD GLP), the regulations ensure:
  - Consistent and reliable testing methods.
  - Protection of vulnerable populations (children under 15).
  - Harmonization with international safety practices.

### **8. Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**
| Stakeholder | Key Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Manufacturers** | Must ensure all children’s jewellery complies with lead (≤90 mg/kg) and conditional cadmium (≤130 mg/kg) limits. Must conduct testing under GLP. |
| **Importers** | Must verify compliance before bringing products into Canada. |
| **Retailers** | Must ensure products on sale meet the standards and are not misrepresented. |
| **Regulatory Authorities** | Enforce compliance through inspections, product testing, and market monitoring. |

### **Conclusion**
The *Children’s Jewellery Regulations* establish clear, science-based safety standards for children’s jewellery in Canada. They protect young children from exposure to harmful levels of lead and cadmium, particularly in small, ingestible components. By relying on internationally recognized good laboratory practices and applying conditional limits based on physical size, the regulations balance safety with practicality for manufacturers. These rules replaced older regulations and came into force in 2017, with ongoing enforcement to ensure consumer safety.

> **Note**: These regulations are part of a broader framework under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* to protect children from unsafe products. They reflect Canada’s commitment to public health and international safety standards.
