The reference "[Repealed, SI/2008-16]" indicates that the regulation in question has been officially repealed by a Statutory Instrument (SI) dated 2008, specifically SI/2008-16.

However, **no specific regulation is named or described** in your query. The phrase "[Repealed, SI/2008-16]" alone does not identify the actual regulation that was repealed. Statutory Instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (and other jurisdictions), and SI/2008-16 refers to the 16th SI issued in 2008.

To provide a detailed summary, we would need to know the **full title or subject matter** of the regulation being referenced (e.g., "The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 2007" or "The Food Safety (General) Regulations 2006").

### What SI/2008-16 Actually Is (as of public records)

As of publicly available information from the UK Statutory Instruments database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk), **SI 2008/16** is titled:

> **The Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/16)**

**Important Note**: This SI was **not** a repeal instrument. It was a *new* set of regulations introduced to implement or update health and safety standards in workplaces. It was **not** used to repeal an existing regulation.

Therefore, the statement "[Repealed, SI/2008-16]" is **incorrect or misleading** in this context.

### Possible Interpretation of the Query

It is possible that the user intended to reference a regulation that was **repealed by** SI 2008/16 — for example, a prior regulation that was replaced or revoked by that instrument.

However, **SI 2008/16 did not repeal a significant, widely known regulation**. Instead, it introduced new health and safety requirements. It may have amended or replaced certain provisions under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, but not in a way that would be widely referred to as "repealing" a major piece of legislation.

---

### Conclusion

❌ **There is no widely recognized regulation that was repealed by SI/2008-16.**  
✅ SI 2008/16 is the *Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2008*, which introduced new workplace health and safety standards — not a repeal instrument.  
❌ The label "[Repealed, SI/2008-16]" is therefore **inaccurate or misapplied**.

### Recommendation

To provide a detailed summary of a regulation that was **repealed** by SI 2008/16, we would need the **original title or subject** of the regulation being repealed (e.g., "The Dangerous Substances and Explosives (Safety) Regulations 1995").

If you can provide the **full name of the regulation** you are asking about, I can give you a detailed, accurate summary of its content, purpose, key provisions, and how it was repealed.

Until then, the statement "[Repealed, SI/2008-16]" does not correspond to a valid or known regulation repeal in the UK legislative record.
