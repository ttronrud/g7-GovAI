Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, which outlines the authority and conditions under which inspectors designated by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food can issue a **Certificate of Age and Origin** for distilled spirits produced or packaged in Canada.

## 📝 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation on the Certificate of Age and Origin for Distilled Spirits**

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- **Statutory Authority**: The regulation is issued under **Section 4a of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Act** (S.C. 1994, c. 38, s. 4a).
- This section grants the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food broad powers over all matters related to agriculture and agricultural products, **unless otherwise assigned** to another government department.
- The Minister is empowered to delegate specific functions to designated inspectors, as outlined in **Section 5.01c** of the same Act.

> ✅ **Key Point**: The Minister authorizes inspectors to issue **Certificates of Age and Origin** for distilled spirits produced or packaged in Canada, based on the Minister’s statutory mandate.

---

### **2. Scope of the Certificate**
- The Certificate of Age and Origin applies to **distilled spirits** that are:
  - Produced from **botanical substances or products derived from agriculture**.
  - **Manufactured or packaged in Canada**.
- The certificate attests to two key facts:
  - The **age** of the spirits (i.e., how long they have been aged in casks).
  - The **origin** of the spirits (i.e., whether they are Canadian-made).

> ✅ **Rationale**: Distilled spirits are considered agricultural products due to their origin in botanical sources (e.g., grains, corn, barley, grapes), thus falling within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

---

### **3. Requirements for Issuance of a Certificate**

#### 🔹 Mandatory Verification Requirement:
> A Certificate of Age and Origin **shall not be issued** unless:
> - The information in the certificate can be **verified from the producer’s or packager’s official records**.

> ✅ This ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability of the spirits’ age and origin.

#### 🔹 Cask Marking Requirement:
> All casks, barrels, and drums used for storing or delivering spirits must be:
> - **Clearly and legibly marked** with:
>   - The **month and year of original warehousing**.

> ✅ This provides a physical record of when the spirits were first stored, which is essential for determining age and authenticity.

---

### **4. Restrictions on Import-Related Certificates**

> An inspector **shall not accept** a certificate attesting to the **age of spirits brought into a Canadian producer or packager’s facility** unless:
> - The certificate has been **endorsed by a government official of the country of origin**.

> ✅ This ensures that imported spirits are properly verified and that age claims are credible and traceable to their source.

---

### **5. Specific Rules for Blended Whisky (Exported Whisky with Imported Spirits)**

> If a whisky to be exported is a **blend containing more than 9.090% imported spirits**, then:
> - The Certificate of Age and Origin must:
>   - **Specify the percentage of domestic and imported spirits** in the blend.
>   - **Not refer to the whisky as**:
>     - Rye Whisky  
>     - Canadian Whisky  
>     - Canadian Rye Whisky  

> ✅ Purpose: Prevents misleading labeling that could imply Canadian origin or composition when the product contains a significant amount of foreign spirits.

---

### **6. Age Determination for Blended Spirits (Flavoured or Blended with Wine or Spirits)**

> For spirits that are **flavoured by blending additional domestic or imported spirits or wine**, the resulting product is deemed to have been:
> - **Warehoused for the same period as the most recently warehoused spirit** in the blend.

> **Exception**:  
> If the **absolute ethyl alcohol content** of the added spirits or wine does **not exceed 9.090%** of the total absolute ethyl alcohol in the final product:
> - The resultant blended product is deemed to have been warehoused for the **same period as the spirit to which it was added**.

> ✅ This rule ensures that blending does not artificially inflate the age of the product unless the added components are substantial in volume or alcohol content.

---

### **7. Rules for Canadian Brandy Blends**

> A Certificate of Age and Origin **shall only be issued** for Canadian brandy blended with other brandies (domestic or imported) **if at least 75% of the absolute ethyl alcohol content** comes from **Canadian brandy**.

> ✅ Ensures that blended brandy maintains a minimum Canadian content threshold to qualify for a Canadian-origin certificate.

---

### **8. Labeling Restrictions (Export Bottled Spirits)**

> A Certificate of Age and Origin **shall not be issued** for spirits bottled for export that:
> - Bear a **label containing any reference to Canada**, including:
>   - The word **“Canadian”** in the trade name or description.

> **Unless**:
> - At least **75% of the absolute ethyl alcohol content** of the bottled spirits is derived from **domestic (Canadian) spirits**.

> ✅ This prevents false or misleading claims about Canadian origin in export products, protecting Canadian trade interests and consumer trust.
