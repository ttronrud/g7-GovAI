The regulation referenced — "[Repealed, SI/2015-100]" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 2015-100 has been formally repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter of the regulation — e.g., environmental standards, employment law, transport rules, etc.), a detailed summary cannot be provided. In general, when a statutory instrument is marked as "repealed," it means:

🔹 The regulation was officially canceled or replaced by a newer law or amendment.  
🔹 It is no longer in force and has no legal effect.  
🔹 The repeal was enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument or legislation, typically in a formal legislative update or amendment.  
🔹 The repeal date is usually specified in the SI itself or in the official legislation database.

For example, SI/2015-100 might have been a regulation concerning workplace safety, building standards, or licensing procedures, and it would have been repealed by a later amendment or new legislation (such as a bill passed in Parliament) to modernize or replace outdated rules.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
- Full title of the repealed regulation
- The enabling act (e.g., Health and Safety at Work Act)
- The subject area (e.g., food safety, transport, education)
- The date of repeal and the instrument that repealed it

In the absence of such details, the most accurate and responsible summary is:

👉 **Summary**:  
The Statutory Instrument SI/2015-100 has been formally repealed. This means the regulation is no longer in force and has been legally replaced or withdrawn. The repeal was likely enacted through a subsequent legislative or regulatory update. As such, the content, provisions, and legal effects of SI/2015-100 are now obsolete and should not be referenced in current legal or administrative practice. For accurate and current information, reference should be made to the replacement regulation or the latest version of the relevant enabling legislation.

If you can provide the full title or subject of SI/2015-100, I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
