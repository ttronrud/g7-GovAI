Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Canadian Tourism Commission Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Rearrangement Act").
- This provision enables the government to transfer powers, duties, and functions between different federal ministers within the Public Service, particularly when there is a reorganization of ministerial responsibilities.

#### **2. Subject Matter of the Transfer**
- The regulation transfers **specific powers, duties, and functions** previously held by the **Minister of State styled the Minister of Small Business and Tourism**.
- These powers and responsibilities were originally transferred to the **Minister of Small Business and Tourism** under **Order in Council P.C. 2017-71**, dated **February 1, 2017**.
- The transfer in this regulation moves those same powers and functions **from the Minister of Small Business and Tourism to the Minister of La Francophonie**.

#### **3. Legal Basis of the Original Transfer (P.C. 2017-71)**
- On **February 1, 2017**, the Government of Canada issued **Order in Council P.C. 2017-71**, which transferred certain responsibilities related to tourism policy and promotion from the Minister of Small Business and Tourism to the Minister of Small Business and Tourism — a procedural error in the original phrasing, but in context, it means the transfer was made *to* that Minister.
- The purpose of this earlier transfer was to consolidate tourism-related responsibilities under a single minister, aligning them with the broader goals of promoting Canadian tourism and economic development.

#### **4. Current Transfer (This Regulation)**
- This current regulation **revises** the ministerial assignment by transferring those same powers and functions **from the Minister of Small Business and Tourism to the Minister of La Francophonie**.
- This reflects a broader government restructuring aimed at aligning tourism policy with **francophone interests and priorities**.
- The Minister of La Francophonie is responsible for promoting French language, culture, and Canadian francophone communities across Canada. This transfer allows the Minister to play a more active role in **tourism development within French-speaking regions**, including Quebec and other francophone communities.

#### **5. Statutory References**
- The regulation is cited under:
  - **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** – Section 207 of the *Statutes of Canada 2003*, Chapter 22 (likely the enabling provision for ministerial transfers).
  - **R.S., c. P-34** – *The Public Service Act* (or similar reference to the Public Service framework).
  - **S.C. 2000, c. 28** – Possibly the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* or related legislation.
  - **SI/2017-5** – A Statutory Instrument issued in 2017 (likely the Order in Council P.C. 2017-71, or a related instrument).

#### **6. Purpose and Implications**
- **Strategic Realignment**: The transfer supports the federal government’s strategic goal of strengthening **francophone tourism** and ensuring that French-speaking regions benefit from targeted tourism promotion.
- **Improved Coordination**: By placing tourism responsibilities under the Minister of La Francophonie, the government aims to improve coordination between tourism policy and language/cultural promotion initiatives.
- **Policy Continuity**: The core functions under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act* — such as policy development, funding, marketing, and international promotion — are preserved, but now fall under a different ministerial portfolio.

#### **7. Scope of the Transfer**
- The transfer applies **only to the powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of Small Business and Tourism under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*.
- It does **not** extend to other acts or responsibilities outside of the Canadian Tourism Commission Act.
- The transfer is **not a dissolution or abolition** of the functions — they are simply reassigned to a different minister.

#### **8. Effective Date and Implementation**
- The regulation is effective upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and is part of a broader administrative reorganization.
- Implementation will involve coordination between the Department of Tourism, the Office of the Minister of La Francophonie, and relevant federal agencies to ensure continuity of operations and service delivery.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **ministerial reallocation** of tourism-related responsibilities from the Minister of Small Business and Tourism to the Minister of La Francophonie. It is a strategic move to align tourism policy with the promotion of French-speaking communities and to strengthen the role of the francophone sector in Canada’s tourism economy. The transfer is legally valid, based on established statutory authority and a prior Order in Council, and ensures continuity in the delivery of tourism services under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*.

**Note**: While the original text appears to contain a typographical or structural error (e.g., "transfers from the Minister of State styled the Minister of Small Business and Tourism to the Minister of La Francophonie the powers... that were transferred to that Minister by Order in Council P.C. 2017-71"), the context clearly indicates that the intent is to transfer powers **from the Minister of Small Business and Tourism to the Minister of La Francophonie**, even though the original Order in Council (P.C. 2017-71) had previously transferred those powers *to* the Minister of Small Business and Tourism. This suggests a **reversal or reallocation** of those functions.

Thus, the regulation reflects a **corrective or strategic shift** in ministerial responsibility within the federal government.
