### **3. Conditions for the Acquisition of Delivery Shares (Under Section 75.1(1) of the Act)**

These conditions must be met **before** a trust and loan company issues delivery shares to a particular subsidiary:

1. **Fair Market Value Consideration**  
   - The consideration received by the trust and loan company for the delivery shares must equal the **fair market value** of those shares at the time of issuance.

2. **Active Trading Requirement**  
   - The class of shares to which the delivery shares belong must be:
     - **Widely held**, and
     - **Actively traded** on **one of the following Canadian stock exchanges**:
       - Canadian Venture Exchange (CVE)
       - Montreal Exchange (MX)
       - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)

3. **Sole Purpose of Acquisition**  
   - The **only purpose** of the acquisition by the particular subsidiary of the delivery shares is to **transfer them** to the shareholders of **another body corporate**, as specified in paragraph 3(b) of the regulations.

4. **Arm’s Length Transactions**  
   - Immediately before the acquisition:
     - The **other body corporate** and its **shareholders** must deal with both the trust and loan company and the particular subsidiary **at arm’s length**.
     - "Arm’s length" is determined in accordance with the **Income Tax Act** (i.e., transactions between unrelated parties at market value).

5. **Non-Residency Requirement**  
   - Immediately before the acquisition:
     - **Neither the particular subsidiary nor the other body corporate** may be **resident in Canada** for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.

> These conditions are designed to ensure that the transaction is legitimate, transparent, and not used to artificially shift income or assets to Canada for tax purposes.

### **4. Conditions for the Transfer of Delivery Shares (Under Section 75.1(2) of the Act)**

These conditions apply **after** the acquisition of delivery shares and before the transfer to shareholders:

1. **No Beneficial Interest in the Shares**  
   - The particular subsidiary must **not acquire a beneficial interest** in the delivery shares as a result of the acquisition.  
   - The beneficial interest must instead be acquired **by the shareholders of the other body corporate**.

2. **Immediate Transfer Requirement**  
   - The acquisition must be **immediately followed** by a transfer of the delivery shares to the shareholders of the other body corporate.

3. **Non-Residency After Transfer**  
   - Immediately **after** the transfer:
     - **Neither the particular subsidiary nor the other body corporate** may be **resident in Canada** under the Income Tax Act.

4. **Subsidiary Relationship After Transfer**  
   - **After the transfer**, the **other body corporate must become a subsidiary** of the particular subsidiary.

> This ensures that the transaction serves a genuine corporate restructuring purpose and not a tax evasion scheme.

### **5. Obligations Upon Breach or Termination of Conditions (Section 75.1(3))**

If **any of the conditions in Sections 2 or 3** are **not met or cease to be met**, the trust and loan company must act within **30 days** to:

1. **Cancel the Delivery Shares**  
   - The delivery shares must be canceled.  
   - **Exception:** If the trust and loan company’s by-laws limit the number of authorized shares, the delivery shares may be restored to the status of **authorized but unissued shares** (i.e., they remain in the company’s authorized share capital but are not issued or outstanding).

2. **Return Consideration to the Particular Subsidiary**  
   - The consideration (i.e., the amount paid for the delivery shares) must be **returned** to the particular subsidiary.

3. **Cancel the Entry in Stated Capital**  
   - The entry reflecting the consideration in the trust and loan company’s **stated capital account** must be canceled.

> This creates a **recovery mechanism** to reverse any improper or non-compliant transaction and protects the integrity of the financial and tax systems.

### **6. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The regulations come into force on:
  - The day that **Section 343 of the *Statutes of Canada, 2007*** (An Act to amend the law governing financial institutions and to provide for related and consequential matters) comes into force, **or**
  - If later, on the day the regulations are **registered** with the government.

> This ensures alignment with broader financial institution reforms and provides a clear timeline for implementation.

> **Note:** These regulations were in force as of **March 8, 2008** (SI/2008-33).

## **Key Objectives and Policy Rationale**

1. **Prevent Tax Avoidance**  
   - The rules are designed to prevent trust and loan companies from using delivery shares to transfer assets or income into Canada under the guise of legitimate corporate restructuring.

2. **Ensure Transparency and Legitimacy**  
   - Transactions must be transparent, with arm’s length dealings and clear purposes (e.g., transfer of shares to shareholders of another entity).

3. **Maintain Non-Residency Requirements**  
   - Ensures that both the acquiring subsidiary and the target entity are **outside Canada** at key stages to avoid Canadian income tax implications.

4. **Protect Shareholder Interests**  
   - Prevents the particular subsidiary from gaining a beneficial interest in the shares, preserving ownership with the original shareholders.

5. **Enforce Accountability**  
   - Provides a clear **30-day corrective action timeline** upon failure of conditions, ensuring compliance and restoring financial integrity.

## **Summary in Plain Language**

This regulation governs how trust and loan companies can issue shares (called "delivery shares") to a subsidiary for a specific corporate purpose — namely, to transfer those shares to the shareholders of another company. The rules are strict and designed to ensure:

- The shares are issued at fair market value.
- The shares are traded on major Canadian exchanges.
- The only reason for the transfer is to give the shareholders of another company the shares.
- All parties involved (the trust company, the subsidiary, and the other company) are **not residents of Canada** at key stages.
- The transaction is done fairly (at arm’s length).
- If any rule is broken, the trust company must **cancel the shares**, **return the money**, and **remove the entry from its capital records** within 30 days.

This framework helps prevent abuse of corporate structures to avoid Canadian income tax and ensures that financial transactions involving trust and loan companies remain transparent and compliant with tax and corporate laws.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Corporate Interrelationships (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* serve as a **critical compliance mechanism** within the Canadian financial regulatory framework. They balance the flexibility of corporate restructuring with strong safeguards against tax avoidance, ensuring that transactions involving delivery shares are legitimate, transparent, and aligned with Canadian tax principles.

These regulations are particularly relevant for trust and loan companies engaged in cross-border or intercompany share transfers and underscore the importance of **residency, arm’s length dealings, and clear transaction purposes** in financial regulation.
