### **Detailed Summary of the Procurement Ombudsman Regulations**

The **Procurement Ombudsman Regulations**, made under **section 23.1a of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act** (commonly referred to as the *Public Works and Government Services Act*), establish the framework for the **Procurement Ombudsman** to review complaints and disputes related to government procurement processes in Canada. These regulations were enacted on **May 5, 2008**, following the coming into force of **Section 307 of the Federal Accountability Act (S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 307)** and are designed to promote **fairness, openness, transparency, and accountability** in how the federal government acquires goods and services.

## **I. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- The regulations are created by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**.
- They operate under **section 23.1a of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act**, which empowers the creation of a procurement ombudsman mechanism to address complaints about government procurement practices.
- The primary goal is to ensure that procurement decisions are **fair, transparent, and consistent with public policy**, financial regulations, and principles of competition.

## **II. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Department of Public Works and Government Services Act*. |
| **Contracting Department** | The department responsible for awarding a contract. |
| **Working Day** | A day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday. |

## **III. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply differently depending on the type of complaint or review:

| Provision | Scope |
|--------|--------|
| **Sections 7 to 14** | Apply to contracts for the acquisition of **materiel or services** awarded **after the coming into force** of these regulations. |
