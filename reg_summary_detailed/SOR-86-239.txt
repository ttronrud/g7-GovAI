*SOR/85-1105, 1985 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 4815; Effective: Tillsonburg, Ontario, February 26, 1986*

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of this regulation is to establish a system for the **fixing, imposition, and collection of licence charges** on **licensed producers of flue-cured tobacco** in Ontario who engage in the **interprovincial and export marketing** of their tobacco. This ensures that the marketing of Ontario-produced tobacco is properly regulated and that a fair, standardized fee is collected to support the broader marketing and distribution framework established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**
The regulation is made under **Section 4** of the *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Order*, which authorizes the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board (the "Commodity Board") to establish and enforce licence charges related to the marketing of flue-cured tobacco.

### **3. Citation and Applicability**
- **Title:** *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Licence Charges (Interprovincial and Export) Order*  
- **Applicable Scope:**  
  - Applies **only** to the **marketing of unmanufactured flue-cured tobacco** in **interprovincial trade** and **export trade**.  
  - Applies to **persons and property located within the Province of Ontario**.  
  - Does **not** apply to manufacturing, processing, or domestic retail sale of tobacco.

---

### **4. Key Definitions**
- **Act:** The *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* – the enabling legislation that establishes the legal framework for commodity marketing boards and their regulatory powers.
- **Commodity Board:** The *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act and the *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Plan*. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and financial management of flue-cured tobacco.
- **Licensed Producer:** A producer who has been issued a valid licence by the Board to produce tobacco. **Excludes** producers whose licences have been **suspended or revoked**.
- **Plan:** The *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Plan*, which outlines the policies, objectives, and operational framework for the marketing of Ontario flue-cured tobacco. Any amendments or regulations made under this Plan are also considered part of the scope.
- **Tobacco:** Refers specifically to **unmanufactured flue-cured tobacco produced in Ontario**. This excludes processed or manufactured forms (e.g., cigarette blends, cigars, or tobacco for use in manufacturing).

---

### **5. Licence Charges**
- **Rate:** Every licensed producer must pay a licence charge of **2.5 cents per pound or fraction thereof** of flue-cured tobacco marketed.
  - Example: If a producer markets 10.3 pounds of tobacco, the charge is calculated as **2.5¢ × 10.3 = 25.75¢**.
- **Scope of Application:** The charge applies only to tobacco **marketed outside Ontario** (interprovincial trade) or **exported** from Ontario.
- **Payment Requirement:** The charge must be paid directly to the Commodity Board.

---

### **6. Deduction from Marketing Payments**
- The Commodity Board has the authority to **deduct the licence charge** from any **moneys paid by the licensed producer** to the Board for the tobacco marketed.
- This means that instead of making a separate payment, the producer pays the licence charge **automatically** when they settle their marketing account with the Board.
- This simplifies compliance and ensures timely collection without requiring additional administrative steps.

---

### **7. Key Provisions and Implications**
- **Fairness and Standardization:** The fixed rate (2.5¢ per pound) ensures consistency and transparency in the cost of marketing, providing predictability for producers.
- **Revenue for the Board:** The collected charges contribute to the financial sustainability of the Commodity Board, which supports market development, price stabilization, and marketing initiatives.
- **Exclusion of Suspended/Revoked Producers:** Only active, licensed producers are subject to the charge, ensuring that the system does not penalize those who are no longer in compliance.
- **No Application to Domestic Sales:** The regulation does not apply to sales within Ontario, which are outside the scope of interprovincial or export trade.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Oversight**
- The Commodity Board is responsible for:
  - Administering the charge collection process.
  - Ensuring accurate tracking of tobacco volumes marketed.
  - Maintaining records and enforcing compliance.
- Producers are required to report their marketing volumes and pay the applicable charges in accordance with the Board’s procedures.

### **9. Historical and Contextual Background**
This regulation was introduced in 1985 as part of a broader effort to modernize and formalize the marketing of Ontario’s flue-cured tobacco. It reflects the role of commodity marketing boards in supporting farmers through structured, market-based pricing and revenue mechanisms. The 2.5¢ per pound rate was likely based on a cost-benefit analysis of administrative costs, market access, and fair distribution of marketing expenses.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Licence Charges (Interprovincial and Export) Order* establishes a clear, enforceable, and equitable system for collecting licence fees from Ontario producers who market flue-cured tobacco outside the province or abroad. By setting a fixed rate of **2.5 cents per pound**, and allowing automatic deduction from marketing payments, the regulation ensures transparency, compliance, and financial sustainability for the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board. It remains a key component of Ontario’s agricultural marketing policy, specifically tailored to support the unique needs of flue-cured tobacco producers in a competitive and evolving market.
