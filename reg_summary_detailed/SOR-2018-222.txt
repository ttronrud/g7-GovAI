**Detailed Summary of the CPTPP Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *CPTPP Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish specific rules of origin for goods that fall outside the standard categories of imported goods intended for sale or industrial use.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)* – Provides the legal foundation for the regulation.  
  - *S.C. 1997, c. 36* – Likely refers to a prior enabling statute or related customs legislation.

### **Definition of "Casual Goods"**

The term **"casual goods"** is defined as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other like use**.  

- In simpler terms, casual goods are **non-commercial, non-industrial items** that are imported for personal, domestic, or incidental purposes—such as for personal use, household needs, or as gifts—rather than for resale, manufacturing, or business operations.
- These goods do not enter the supply chain for economic activity and are therefore treated differently under origin rules.

### **Origin Determination for Casual Goods**

Under **Section 2 and 3**, casual goods acquired in a **CPTPP country** are considered to **originate in that country** and are entitled to the **preferential tariff treatment** provided by the CPTPP, **subject to specific marking conditions**.

#### **Rule 1: Marking in Accordance with the Country’s Laws**

Casual goods are considered to originate in a CPTPP country **if**:
1. The **marking of the goods** complies with the **marking laws of that CPTPP country**, and  
2. The marking **indicates that the goods are either**:
   - The product of that CPTPP country, **or**
   - The product of Canada.

👉 *Implication*: If the goods are properly marked (in accordance with local law) and clearly state they are from the country of origin (either the CPTPP country or Canada), they qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the CPTPP.

#### **Rule 2: No Marking or Ambiguous Marking**

If the goods:
- **Do not bear any mark**, and  
- **Nothing on the goods indicates** that they are neither the product of the CPTPP country nor Canada,

👉 Then they are **still considered to originate in that country** and are entitled to the CPTPP tariff applicable to that country.

#### **Rule 3: Marking Indicates Origin in Another CPTPP Country (or Canada)**

If the goods:
- Are marked in accordance with the marking laws of the CPTPP country,  
- And the marking **indicates that the goods are the product of a CPTPP country other than the one where they were acquired, or Canada**,  

👉 Then the goods are considered to originate in the **specific CPTPP country indicated by the marking**, and are entitled to the **preferential tariff treatment applicable to that country**.

> This rule allows for **origin tracing** based on visible product markings, even if the goods were purchased in one country but are marked as originating elsewhere.

### **Application of CPTPP Tariffs**

- The **CPTPP tariffs** referred to in Sections 2 and 3 are the **preferential tariff rates** applicable to a particular CPTPP country, as listed in the **"Tariff Treatment / Other" column** in the **List of Countries** found in the **Schedule to the Customs Tariff**.
- These tariffs are determined by the CPTPP agreement and reflect the tariff reductions or exemptions available for goods originating in a specific member country.

---

### **Effective Date and Implementation**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 43 of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation Act (CPTPP Implementation Act)** comes into force.
- **Section 43** of the CPTPP Implementation Act (Chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada 2018) is the enabling provision that establishes the legal framework for the implementation of the CPTPP, including the rules of origin.
- **Exception**: If the regulations are **registered (published or officially adopted) after** the date when Section 43 comes into force, then they will come into effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures a smooth transition and allows for administrative flexibility during the implementation phase.

---

### **Note on Existing Regulations**

- These regulations were **in force as of December 30, 2018**, and are referenced in:
  - **SI/2018-101**  
  - **SI/2018-108**

> These are statutory instruments (SIs) issued by the federal government to implement CPTPP obligations. Their inclusion in the 2018 list confirms their official adoption and legal status.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Simplify Origin Determination** | By focusing on visible markings and use, the rules reduce the need for complex documentation or value-based analysis for casual goods. |
| **Support Trade Facilitation** | Enables easier access to preferential tariffs for non-commercial goods (e.g., personal items, gifts, samples), which may otherwise be excluded from origin rules. |
| **Compliance with CPTPP Standards** | Ensures alignment with the CPTPP’s rules of origin, which require clear and verifiable evidence of origin. |
| **Consumer and Importer Protection** | Requires markings to comply with local laws, preventing misleading claims about origin. |

### **Practical Examples**

1. **Example 1 – Properly Marked Personal Item**  
   A Canadian citizen purchases a pair of shoes in Japan. The shoes are marked in Japanese with "Made in Japan" and comply with Japanese marking laws. → The shoes are considered to originate in Japan and are eligible for Japan’s preferential tariff rate under CPTPP.

2. **Example 2 – Unmarked Goods**  
   A Canadian imports a set of kitchen utensils from Australia with no visible marking. No indication suggests they are from Canada or another country. → The goods are considered to originate in Australia and qualify for Australia’s CPTPP tariff.

3. **Example 3 – Misleading Marking**  
   A product is marked "Made in Mexico" but was purchased in Canada. If the marking is valid under Mexican law, the goods would be considered to originate in Mexico, even if acquired in Canada. → This could lead to unintended tariff consequences.

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- **Section 4** (not detailed in the provided text) likely contains **exceptions or conditions** that may apply in specific cases (e.g., goods that are clearly not for casual use, or where origin is disputed).
- The rules **do not apply to goods imported for commercial or industrial purposes**, which are subject to different origin rules under the CPTPP.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CPTPP Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a **clear, accessible, and practical framework** for determining the origin of non-commercial goods imported into Canada from CPTPP countries. By relying on **visible product markings** and **compliance with local marking laws**, the rules ensure that casual goods—such as personal items, samples, or gifts—can benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the CPTPP, while maintaining transparency and legal integrity.

This regulation enhances trade efficiency and supports the broader goals of the CPTPP to reduce trade barriers and promote regional economic integration, particularly in the context of non-commercial or incidental imports.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
Casual goods (non-commercial goods) imported from a CPTPP country are considered to originate in that country if properly marked or unmarked with no indication of non-origin, and are entitled to the CPTPP tariff applicable to that country—coming into force on the date Section 43 of the CPTPP Implementation Act takes effect.
