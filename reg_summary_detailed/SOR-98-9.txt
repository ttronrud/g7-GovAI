The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> [Repealed, SOR/2006-145, s. 1]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2006-145, s. 1]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2006-145, s. 1]

### Detailed Summary:

This entry indicates that a specific regulation (or provision) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2006-145** (Statutory Order 2006, No. 145).

- **SOR/2006-145** is a Statutory Instrument issued in Canada, typically under the authority of a federal or provincial government. In this case, it is likely a regulation made under a parent act (such as the *Canada Labour Code*, *Ontario Labour Relations Act*, or another relevant statute), and it formally removes a prior rule or provision.
  
- **Section 1** of that Statutory Instrument (SOR/2006-145) contains the repeal clause — it specifically designates the prior regulation or provision as being no longer in force.

- The repetition of the same line three times suggests a possible formatting or data entry error, such as duplication in a database or document, but it does not indicate that multiple distinct regulations were repealed.

### Interpretation:

There is **no substantive regulation content** provided in the original text — only a repealing reference. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself (e.g., its purpose, scope, requirements) **cannot be provided**, because the regulation has been **repealed** and is no longer in effect.

### Conclusion:

The entry confirms that a previously existing regulation has been **officially canceled** by SOR/2006-145, section 1. Since the regulation is now repealed, it is **no longer applicable or enforceable**. Any prior interpretation or application of that regulation is invalid under current law.

> ✅ **Summary**: The referenced regulation has been repealed by Statutory Instrument SOR/2006-145, section 1. As a result, it is no longer in force. No detailed content of the regulation exists in the provided text, and therefore no substantive summary can be offered. The entry serves only as a notice of repeal.
