### **Detailed Summary of the Mutual Property and Casualty Insurance Company Having Only Mutual Policyholders Conversion Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations, made under the authority of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act), establish a comprehensive framework for the **conversion of mutual property and casualty insurance companies into companies with common shares**. This process allows mutual insurers — where all policyholders hold mutual policies and have voting rights — to transition into publicly traded or shareholder-owned entities while ensuring fairness, transparency, and protection for policyholders.

The regulations are enacted pursuant to:
- **Sections 237(2)a and (3)b** of the *Insurance Companies Act*  
- **Section 1021c** of the Act  
- Legislative references: S.C. 2014, c. 20, ss. 211(1) and (2); S.C. 1999, c. 1, s. 5(4); S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 364; S.C. 1991, c. 47

#### **2. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply **only to mutual property and casualty insurance companies** in which:
- All policyholders hold **mutual policies**, meaning policies that entitle holders to vote at policyholder meetings.
- The company has **no common shares** prior to conversion.

> *Note: Policies issued or assumed by a company with common shares that amalgamated with a mutual company after the eligibility date are excluded from the definition of "mutual policy."*
