**Detailed Summary of the Shared Premises Regulations (Retail Associations)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Shared Premises Regulations (Retail Associations)** were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **paragraph 378.4(4)(a)a of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act**.

This provision grants the government the authority to make regulations that clarify or implement specific operational conditions for cooperative credit associations—particularly those involving shared physical premises.

The regulation is part of **Statutes of Canada, 2007, Chapter 6, Section 160**, and is also referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 48**, which provides the broader legislative framework for financial institutions.

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Member institution"** is defined consistently with its meaning in **Section 2 of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act**.  
  This means a financial institution that is affiliated with or part of a cooperative credit association, such as a credit union or cooperative bank, and is eligible for deposit insurance under CDIC.

---

### **3. Scope of the Regulation**

The regulation applies specifically to **retail associations** that fall under **paragraphs 378.1(1)(b) or (c)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. These paragraphs define certain types of retail associations—typically credit unions—that are eligible to operate in Canada under specific conditions.

These associations may operate **on shared premises** with a **member institution that is affiliated** with them (e.g., a parent cooperative or a sister institution).

However, the regulation imposes a strict condition to ensure **consumer protection and separation of services**.

### **4. Core Requirement: Separation of Workspaces**

A retail association may operate on premises shared with an affiliated member institution **only if**:

> When a customer requests in person to open a **deposit account** with the retail association, the retail association must open that account **in a work space that is separate and distinct** from every work space where the member institution carries on business.

This means:
- The retail association must have a **physically distinct workspace** for account opening.
- The shared premises may be used for general operations (e.g., office space, reception), but **account opening must occur in a dedicated, non-overlapping area**.
- There must be **no overlap** between the areas where the retail association and its affiliated member institution serve customers.

This requirement ensures that:
- Customers are not confused about which institution is providing the service.
- There is a clear and transparent separation between the retail association and its member institution, especially in terms of financial services and deposit-taking.
- Consumer trust and regulatory compliance are maintained.

---

### **5. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 160 of the Act (S.C. 2007, c. 6) comes into force**.
- If the regulations are **registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

This phased implementation allows for a smooth transition and ensures that all financial institutions are given adequate time to comply with the new rules.

---

### **6. Reference to Existing Regulations**

The regulations are noted as being in force as of **March 8, 2008**, under **SI/2008-33** (Statutory Instrument 2008-33). This indicates that the regulation was officially adopted and published in the official gazette on that date and became effective accordingly.

---

### **7. Purpose and Regulatory Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **protect consumers** by ensuring transparency in financial services delivery.
- To **prevent confusion** between a retail association and its affiliated member institution.
- To **maintain regulatory oversight** and ensure compliance with financial institution standards.
- To support the **cooperative model** by allowing shared infrastructure where necessary, while preserving clear boundaries in service delivery.

### **8. Significance in the Financial Sector**

These regulations are particularly relevant in the context of **cooperative credit associations**, such as credit unions, which often operate under a networked structure with shared resources and affiliations. The rule ensures that even when physical spaces are shared, **account opening remains a distinct and identifiable service** provided by the retail association itself.

This supports **financial integrity**, **accountability**, and **consumer confidence**, especially in a complex financial environment where multiple institutions may operate in close proximity.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Shared Premises Regulations (Retail Associations)** establish a clear and enforceable standard for how retail credit associations (such as credit unions) can operate on shared premises with affiliated member institutions. The central requirement—**separate and distinct workspaces for account opening**—ensures that customers are not misled and that regulatory and operational boundaries are maintained. The regulation reflects a balance between operational efficiency and consumer protection, aligning with broader financial sector standards and the principles of cooperative governance.
