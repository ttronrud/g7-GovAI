### **Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Withdrawal of General Preferential Tariff Benefits:**  
   The regulation formally withdraws the entitlement of Canadian importers to the *General Preferential Tariff* (GPT) for all goods that originate in **Bulgaria** and **Romania**.  
   - This means that goods originating in these two countries will no longer be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Canadian system.  
   - As a result, such goods will be subject to standard (non-preferential) tariff rates upon entry into Canada, which are typically higher than preferential rates.

2. **Exemption for Goods in Transit Prior to August 1, 2007:**  
   Section 1 of the Order contains a specific exception:  
   - The withdrawal of preferential tariff benefits **does not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada before August 1, 2007**.  
   - This provision ensures that goods already in the process of being transported into Canada at the time of the Order’s enactment are not retroactively affected.  
   - This is a common legal safeguard to avoid disrupting legitimate trade flows that were already underway.

3. **Legal Basis:**  
   The Order is enacted under paragraph 34(1)(b) of the *Customs Tariff Act*, which grants the Minister of Finance (and, by extension, the Governor General in Council) the authority to withdraw or modify preferential tariff benefits when necessary—such as due to changes in trade agreements, political considerations, or compliance with international obligations.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on **August 1, 2007**.  
   - All goods entering Canada after this date that originate in Bulgaria or Romania will be subject to standard tariff rates unless they qualify under other applicable trade agreements or exceptions.  
   - The retroactive effect of the withdrawal is limited to goods arriving *after* August 1, 2007.

### **Implications and Context:**

- This regulation likely reflects a shift in Canada’s trade policy toward Bulgaria and Romania, possibly due to:
  - A withdrawal of a previous trade agreement or preferential arrangement.
  - A change in the terms of Canada’s broader trade relations with the European Union or with these specific countries.
  - A decision to align tariff treatment with new economic or political realities (e.g., changes in EU trade policy, regional integration, or concerns about compliance with trade rules).

- The exclusion of goods in transit before August 1, 2007, protects existing trade operations and avoids penalties or delays for shipments that were already in motion.

### **Conclusion:**

This General Preferential Tariff Withdrawal Order formally removes the preferential tariff treatment for goods originating in Bulgaria and Romania, effective August 1, 2007. It ensures that future imports from these countries will be subject to standard tariff rates. However, it provides a critical exemption for goods already in transit to Canada prior to the effective date, preserving the integrity of ongoing trade activities. The Order is grounded in statutory authority and reflects a deliberate policy decision to adjust Canada’s preferential trade framework in response to evolving international trade dynamics.
