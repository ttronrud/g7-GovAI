## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Cyprus Agreement on Social Security (1991)**

### 🔹 **Overview**
This is a **bilateral social security agreement** between **Canada** and the **Republic of Cyprus**, signed on **January 24, 1990**, and officially entered into force in Canada on **May 1, 1991**. The agreement establishes rules for the **recognition, calculation, and payment of social security benefits** (such as pensions, disability benefits, widow’s/orphan’s benefits, and funeral grants) for individuals who have worked, lived, or resided in either country.

The primary objective is to **avoid double contribution or benefit denial** by enabling mutual recognition of periods of contribution, residence, and employment — thereby ensuring that individuals can access benefits in either country based on their combined experience across both jurisdictions.

---

### 3. **Who Is Covered?**

The agreement applies to:
- Individuals who have **lived or worked** in either country
- Their **dependants and survivors** (spouses, children, etc.), as defined under the relevant legislation

> **Special rule**: A citizen of one country who has **never been subject** to that country’s legislation is still eligible for benefits under the other country’s system — provided they meet residency or contribution criteria.

---

### 4. **Residency and Employment Rules**

#### 🟢 **Employed Persons**
- An employed person working in one country is subject **only** to that country’s legislation.
- **Exception**: If the person works in the territory of the other Party for the **same employer**, they remain subject to the legislation of their **home country** (i.e., where they are employed).

> ⚠️ *This coverage may not last beyond 24 months without prior approval from both competent authorities.*

#### 🟢 **Self-Employed Persons**
- A self-employed person who **ordinarily resides** in one country and works in the other is subject **only** to the legislation of their **home country**.

#### 🟢 **Government Employees**
- A government employee working in the territory of the other Party is subject to the legislation of that country **only if**:
  - They are a **citizen** of that country, or
  - They **ordinarily reside** there

> ✅ However, such a person **may elect** to be subject only to the legislation of their home country — **only if they are a citizen of that country**.

> ❌ This right **does not extend** to non-citizens.

> 📝 *Note: This provision allows flexibility for certain public sector workers.*

#### 🟢 **Seabed/Exploration Installations**
- Workers stationed on installations in the **continental shelf** (e.g., for oil/gas exploration) are treated as if the installation is located in the territory of the host country — thus, employment is governed by that country’s rules.

> *Definition: "Continental shelf area" includes all areas beyond territorial waters where a country has rights under international law.*

#### 🟢 **Maritime Crew Members**
- A crew member who would otherwise be subject to both countries’ systems is subject to:
  - **Canada** if they **ordinarily reside** in Canada
  - **Cyprus** otherwise

> This prevents double counting or benefit denial due to maritime employment.

### 5. **Creditable Periods – How They Are Counted**

This section outlines **how time spent in one country can be recognized** as valid for benefit eligibility in the other.

#### 📌 For **Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Canada**:
- If a person is covered by **CPP or provincial pension plans** during residence in Cyprus:
  - That time counts as **residence in Canada** for the individual and their **spouse/dependants** (who are not covered by Cyprus employment).
- If a person is covered by Cyprus legislation during residence in Canada:
  - That time **does not count** as residence in Canada — unless they are covered by CPP or provincial plans.

> 🎯 *Purpose: To prevent double counting of periods where someone is contributing to a pension plan in one country.*

#### 📌 For **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**:
- A year in which at least **25% of basic insurable earnings** are credited under Cyprus legislation is counted as a **contribution year** in Canada.

#### 📌 For **Cyprus Old Age Pension**:
- A week ending on or before **December 31, 1965** that is creditable under OASA counts as a week of contributions in Cyprus at the applicable weekly basic earnings rate.
- From **January 1, 1966 onward**:
  - A CPP creditable period = **52 weeks** of contributions at the weekly basic insurable earnings rate.
  - A non-CPP OASA creditable week (post-1965) also counts as one week of Cyprus contributions.

#### 📌 For **Invalidity, Widow’s, Orphan’s Benefits (Cyprus)**:
- A CPP creditable year (from 1966 onward) counts as **52 weeks** of Cyprus contributions at the weekly basic earnings rate.

---

### 6. **Eligibility and Benefit Calculation**

#### 📌 General Rule:
- If a person is **not entitled** to a benefit based on periods from one country alone, eligibility is determined by **totalizing**:
  - All creditable periods from both countries
  - Any periods from a **third country** under an international social security instrument that allows period totalization

> ❌ **Exception**: If the total creditable periods from one country are **less than one year** and no benefit exists under that country’s law, the competent institution **does not have to pay** benefits for those periods under this agreement.

> ✅ However, those periods **are still considered** when determining eligibility under the **other country’s legislation** (Articles VIII and IX).

---

### 7. **Partial Pensions (When Full Eligibility Is Not Met)**

#### ✅ **Old Age Security (OAS) Pension – Outside Canada**
- If a person is **eligible for OAS in Canada** but lacks sufficient residence in Canada, a **partial pension** may be paid **outside Canada** if the total creditable periods (from both countries) meet or exceed the **minimum residence requirement** for OAS abroad.

> 🔍 **Amount calculation**:
> - Based solely on **OASA rules** for partial pensions
> - Uses only the **periods creditable under OASA**

> ⚠️ **Canada will not pay OAS outside Canada** unless total creditable periods meet the minimum residence requirement.

#### ✅ **Spouse’s Allowance / Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**
- These benefits may be paid **outside Canada** only if allowed under the **OASA**.

---

### 8. **Disability and Survivor Benefits (CPP and Cyprus)**

#### ✅ CPP Disability / Survivor Benefits:
- If a person is not entitled to a CPP benefit solely on CPP contributions:
  - The **earnings-related portion** is calculated using **CPP rules**, based on **pensionable earnings** from both countries.
  - The **flat-rate portion** is calculated as:
    > (Flat-rate amount under CPP) × (Ratio of CPP periods
