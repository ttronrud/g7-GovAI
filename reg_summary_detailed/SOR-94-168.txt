### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act. |
| **Activity** | Any exploration or development activity authorized under **paragraph 142(1)(b)** of the Act. |
| **Eligible Expense** | A **Canadian exploration expense** or a **Canadian development expense** incurred in the Nova Scotia offshore area. |

> These expenses are the only ones eligible for financial assistance under this regulation.

### **3. Timing and Deemed Incurrence of Expenses**

To determine when an eligible expense is considered incurred, the regulation establishes specific rules for different types of expenditures:

| Type of Expense | Deemed Incurrence Rule |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Service-based expense** (e.g., labor, consulting) | Deemed incurred **as the service is rendered** (i.e., in real-time). |
| **Use of property** (e.g., lease, equipment) | Deemed incurred **during the period of use** or existence of the right to use the property, **subject to paragraph (c)** (likely a condition or exception not fully detailed here). |
| **Tangible property intended for consumption** (e.g., fuel, materials used in drilling) | Deemed incurred **at the time the property is actually consumed** in carrying out the activity. |

> This ensures that expenses are recognized in the correct accounting period, aligning with actual use or service delivery.

---

### **4. Application for Payment: Frequency and Limits**

- **General Limit**: NSRV may submit **up to four applications per calendar year** for payment under **Section 240** of the Act.
- **Exception for Well Drilling Activities**:  
  While incurring expenses related to **drilling a well**, NSRV may submit **monthly applications** (as frequently as once per month), regardless of the four-year limit.
  
> This provision provides flexibility during active drilling operations, which are typically high-cost, time-sensitive activities.

---

### **5. Deadline for Submitting Applications**

#### a) **Standard Deadline**  
Applications for eligible expenses incurred in a calendar year must be submitted **not later than six months after the last day of that calendar year**.

> Example: Expenses incurred in 1992 must be reported by June 30, 1993.

#### b) **Application for Expenses Incurred Before Regulation Coming Into Force**  
For eligible expenses incurred **before** these regulations came into effect, applications must be submitted **not later than six months after the date the regulations came into force**.

> This ensures that pre-existing costs are not unfairly excluded from assistance.

#### c) **Equity Exception – Time Limit Extensions**  
If the Federal Minister determines that enforcing the standard time limits would result in an **inequitable outcome** (e.g., due to delays, unforeseen circumstances, or financial hardship), the Minister may **extend** the deadline.

> This provides discretion to avoid unfair outcomes in specific cases.

#### d) **Hard Deadline (Non-Revocable)**  
Despite all other provisions, **no application may be submitted after December 31, 1993**.

> This sets a final, absolute deadline for all applications — likely a legislative or political decision to close the window for claims.

#### e) **Application for Development Assistance (Section 241)**  
An application for payment under **Section 241** (likely for development expenses) must be submitted **not later than six months after the coming into force of these regulations**.

> This ensures timely processing of development-related claims.

---

### **6. Overpayment Reporting and Repayment**

#### a) **Notice of Overpayment**
- If NSRV becomes aware of an **overpayment** under **Part VII** of the Act, it must **immediately** submit a **notice of overpayment** to the Federal Minister.
- The notice must include **all information** the Federal Minister may require.

#### b) **Overpayment After NSRV Ceases to Exist**
- If NSRV **ceases to exist** before submitting a notice of overpayment, the notice must be submitted by or on behalf of those individuals or entities who are **beneficially entitled** to the overpayment (e.g., shareholders, heirs, or successors).
- The notice must be submitted **when those persons become aware** of the overpayment.

#### c) **Repayment of Overpayment**
- Upon submission of a notice of overpayment, the **overpaid amount must be repaid** to the Federal Minister.

---

### **7. Interest on Overpayments**

#### a) **Interest Requirement**
- NSRV is required to **pay interest** on any overpayment received under Part VII of the Act.
- Interest is **not** charged if the overpayment results from the **application of generally accepted accounting principles or procedures in the petroleum industry**.

> This protects against interest being applied in cases of legitimate accounting practices.

#### b) **Calculation of Interest**
- The interest amount is calculated as:
  > **Amount of overpayment × Annual interest rate × (number of months or parts of months)**  
  - Multiplied **monthly** (i.e., interest is compounded or calculated monthly).
- The period begins on the **date the overpayment was received** and ends on the **date it is repaid**.

> Example: If an overpayment of $100,000 is received on January 1, 1993, and repaid on July 15, 1993 (6 months and 15 days), interest would be calculated for 6.125 months at the prescribed rate.

## **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Financial Support for Offshore Exploration & Development** | The regulations provide a structured mechanism for NSRV to claim financial assistance for Canadian-based exploration and development costs in the Nova Scotia offshore area. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Clear deadlines, reporting requirements, and overpayment rules ensure accountability and prevent misuse of funds. |
| **Flexibility During Drilling Operations** | Monthly applications during well-drilling allow timely responses to real-time operational costs. |
| **Equity and Fairness** | The ability to extend deadlines and the protection of legitimate accounting practices ensure fairness in complex financial situations. |
| **Final Closure of Claims Window** | The December 31, 1993 deadline reflects a time-bound policy, possibly due to political or fiscal considerations, and closes the door on future claims. |

## **Conclusion**

These regulations establish a **clear, structured, and time-bound framework** for Nova Scotia Resources (Ventures) Limited to receive financial assistance for eligible offshore petroleum-related expenses. They balance **flexibility** (especially during drilling) with **accountability**, **transparency**, and **fiscal responsibility**. The rules on overpayment and interest ensure that any financial errors are corrected fairly and with appropriate compensation.

While the regulations are specific to NSRV and the Nova Scotia offshore area, they reflect broader principles of **intergovernmental cooperation**, **cost recovery**, and **regulatory oversight** in Canada’s offshore oil and gas sector.
