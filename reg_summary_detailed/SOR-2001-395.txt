**Detailed Summary of the Investment Limits (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Investment Limits (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations*, made under sections 389a, 403a, and 463b of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (the "Act"), establish regulatory limits on the extent to which cooperative credit associations (CCAs) may invest in real property and other assets. These rules are designed to ensure financial stability, reduce systemic risk, and protect members and depositors by imposing prudent investment and capital adequacy requirements—particularly in relation to real estate exposure.

The regulations came into force on **October 24, 2001**, following the enactment of sections 314 and 339 of the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*, S.C. 2001, c. 9.

## **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, several key definitions are introduced:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. |
| **Designated Entity** | Any entity that is *not*: <br> - a joint venture; <br> - an insurance company; <br> - a securities dealer; <br> - a subsidiary of an insurance company or securities dealer. |
| **Insurance Company** | Any insurance company incorporated under Canadian or provincial law. |
| **Joint Venture** | A real property entity formed by an association or designated entity (with control) and one or more others for a specific business purpose, where the association or entity has a *substantial investment* and *joint control* (regardless of equity distribution). |
| **Real Property Entity** | An entity primarily engaged in holding, managing, or dealing with real property, including shares in such entities or ownership interests in unincorporated entities. |
| **Related Real Property Entity (RRPE)** | A real property entity in which the association or a designated entity controlled by it has a *substantial investment*, or a real property entity controlled by another RRPE. |
| **Third Party** | A person who is not: <br> - the association; <br> - a designated entity controlled by the association; <br> - a related real property entity of the association. |
| **Book Value** | For assets (real property, securities, loans), the value that would appear on the association’s consolidated balance sheet under the Superintendent’s prescribed accounting principles (subsection 292(4) of the Act). |

## **Exemption from Sections 401 and 402**

Sections 401 and 402 of the Act impose investment limits on CCAs based on their exposure to real property and equity. However:

> **If the sum of the association’s equity and minority interests in subsidiaries (as reported in consolidated financial statements) is $5 billion or more**, then **sections 401 and 402 do not apply**.

This provides a threshold exemption for large, well-capitalized associations, recognizing that they are more resilient and better able to manage risks.

---

## **Prescribed Subsidiaries**

For the purposes of investment limits, a *prescribed subsidiary* is a subsidiary of the association *excluding*:
- Insurance companies;
- Securities dealers;
- Subsidiaries of insurance or securities dealers.

This means that CCAs can have significant exposure to other types of subsidiaries (e.g., real estate development firms, property management companies) without triggering the investment limits—provided they are not in the regulated financial sectors.

## **Key Investment Ratios: Equity Percentage and Real Property Percentage**

These ratios determine how much of the association’s regulatory capital may be allocated to real property investments.

### **1. Real Property Percentage**
- Formula:  
  $$
  \text{Real Property Percentage} = \frac{\text{Total value of all interests in real property (excluding those excluded by section 397)}}{\text{Regulatory Capital}}
  $$
- Includes:
  - Real property beneficially owned;
  - Debt obligations issued for acquisition or improvement of real property;
  - Interests in related real property entities (RRPEs) and joint ventures;
  - Debt obligations or loans secured by real property in RRPEs or third parties.

### **2. Equity Percentage**
- Formula:  
  $$
  \text{Equity Percentage} = \frac{\text{Total value of participating shares and ownership interests (excluding those in "permitted entities" or excluded by section 397)}}{\text{Regulatory Capital}}
  $$
- Excludes:
  - Participating shares in permitted entities where the association has a substantial investment;
  - Ownership interests excluded under section 397.

## **Prescribed Capital Limits (Under Sections 401 and 402)**

These limits define the maximum percentage of regulatory capital that can be allocated to real property or equity exposure, depending on the association’s business model and level of exposure.

---

### **Section 401 – Investment Limit Based on Equity Exposure**

> This section governs the association’s exposure to *equity* in real property entities.

| Business Type | Maximum Equity Exposure |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Primarily engaged in liquidity management, treasury, clearing, settlement, or payment services** | **35%** |
| **Not in the above, and equity percentage ≤ 30%** | **70%** |
| **Not in the above, and equity percentage > 30%** | **100% – equity percentage** |

👉 *Example*: If an association has an equity percentage of 40%, its maximum allowed exposure is 60%.

---

### **Section 402 – Investment Limit Based on Real Property Exposure**

> This section governs the association’s exposure to *real property*.

| Business Type | Maximum Real Property Exposure |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Primarily engaged in liquidity management, treasury, clearing, settlement, or payment services** | **35%** |
| **Not in the above, and real property percentage ≤ 30%** | **70%** |
| **Not in the above, and real property percentage > 30%** | **100% – real property percentage** |

👉 *Example*: If an association has a real property percentage of 50%, its maximum allowed exposure is 50%.

## **Valuation of Interests in Real Property**

The value of an interest in real property is determined based on **book value** as reported in the association’s consolidated balance sheet under the Superintendent’s accounting standards (subsection 292(4)).

### **Types of Interests in Real Property**

1. **Direct Ownership**
   - Real property beneficially owned by the association or a designated entity.
   - Value = Book value of real property.

2. **Debt Obligations for Real Property**
   - Debt issued to acquire or improve real property.
   - Value = Book value of debt *minus* book value of real property (i.e., excess).

3. **Interests in Related Real Property Entities (RRPEs)**
   - Real property held by a joint venture or RRPE (controlled by the association or a designated entity).
   - Value = Book value of real property.
   - Shares/ownership interests in RRPEs = Book value of shares/interests.

4. **Loans or Debt Obligations to RRPEs or Controlled Entities**
   - Loans to RRPEs or to entities where a securities dealer or insurance company controlled by the association has a substantial investment.
   - Value = Book value of the loan.

5. **Guarantees or Agreements**
   - **Guarantee** to complete development of real property owned by the association, a designated entity, or an RRPE.
     - Value = Estimated cost of completing development.
   - **Agreement to support operating/financing costs**.
     - Value = Amount of funds advanced.

6. **Secured Loans or Debt Obligations (Third Party Secured)**
   - A loan or debt obligation secured by real property or ownership interests of a third party.
   - Value = **Lesser of**:
     - Net realizable value of the third party’s interest in the real property or shares;
     - A calculated formula based on:
       - Book value of the loan or guarantee (if held by or guaranteed by the association);
       - Total net realizable value of other security interests;
       - Value of the underlying real property;
       - Total value of outstanding shares/interests.

   > This ensures that the value of a secured interest is not overstated and reflects actual market value.

---

## **Special Provisions: Interests in Real Property from Realization of Security Interests**

Under subsection 11(3) of the Act, certain interests in real property arise when a security interest is realized on a loan or debt obligation.

These include:
- Real property acquired through the realization of a security interest;
- Debt obligations issued to finance real property acquisition or improvement.

Their value is calculated as per the rules above.

---

## **Exclusions and Special Rules**

- **Section 397 Exclusions**: Certain interests in real property are excluded from valuation (e.g., shares in permitted entities with substantial investment). These are not included in real property percentage or equity percentage calculations.
- **Permitted Entities**: Entities in which the association has a substantial investment are exempt from being counted in equity or real property percentages if they are deemed "permitted" under section 397.

## **Regulatory Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Risk Management**: Limit exposure to real property to prevent over-concentration and financial
