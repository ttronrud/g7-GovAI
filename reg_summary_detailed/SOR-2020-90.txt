**Detailed Summary of the Income Support Payment (Excluded Nominal Income) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Income Support Payment (Excluded Nominal Income) Regulations were issued by the Minister of Employment and Social Development (MESD) on April 15, 2020, under the authority granted in **paragraph 6(3)(a) of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act (CERB Act)**. This provision allows the Minister to make regulations to clarify and implement specific rules related to the eligibility and calculation of benefits under the CERB program.

**Regulatory Purpose**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to define a specific exclusion from the income threshold that would otherwise disqualify individuals from receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). Specifically, the regulations address how nominal or minimal income received during periods when a worker has ceased working is treated in determining eligibility for the benefit.

**Key Provision**  
Under the regulations, **any income received by a worker for employment or self-employment is excluded from the application of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(i) of the CERB Act**, provided that the **total amount of such income received over a period of consecutive days during which the worker has ceased working is $1,000 or less**.

**Explanation of the Rule**  
- **Subparagraph 6(1)(b)(i)** of the CERB Act generally disqualifies individuals from receiving the benefit if they have earned income during the period they are claiming the benefit — specifically, if their total income from employment or self-employment exceeds a certain threshold (originally set at $1,000 per day in the initial implementation of the CERB).
- However, these regulations introduce a **flexible exclusion** for income that is considered "nominal" or minimal.
- If a person receives income (e.g., from part-time work, freelance gigs, or self-employment) over a series of consecutive days during which they have stopped working, and the **total amount of that income does not exceed $1,000**, then that income is **not counted** when assessing whether the individual exceeds the income threshold for CERB eligibility.

**Practical Impact**  
- Workers who may have earned small amounts of income (e.g., $50 per day for 20 days, totaling $1,000) are **not penalized** for that income under the CERB rules.
- This helps ensure that individuals who are temporarily unemployed or working part-time during a period of economic disruption are not unfairly excluded from receiving financial support due to minimal earnings.
- The rule supports the principle that **nominal or incidental income should not disqualify someone from receiving emergency benefits**, especially during a crisis like the pandemic.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on the **day they are made**, which is **April 15, 2020**. This means they were immediately applicable and effective upon publication.

**Legal Context and Significance**  
These regulations reflect a targeted adjustment to the CERB framework to improve accessibility and fairness during a public health emergency. By excluding nominal income up to $1,000 over consecutive days, the government aimed to:
- Prevent unintended disqualification of individuals with minimal or irregular income streams.
- Support vulnerable workers who may have been temporarily displaced from full-time employment.
- Maintain the integrity of the benefit system while ensuring it remains responsive to real-world economic conditions.

**Conclusion**  
The Income Support Payment (Excluded Nominal Income) Regulations provide a clear and practical mechanism to exclude low-level, short-term income from the CERB income threshold. This ensures that individuals who have ceased working but have received only minimal earnings are not automatically disqualified from receiving emergency financial assistance. The rule is both administratively straightforward and aligned with the humanitarian and economic goals of the CERB program during the 2020 pandemic response.
