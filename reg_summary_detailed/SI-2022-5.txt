**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Respecting Ex Gratia Payments to Workers Involved in Chalk River Nuclear Decontamination**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources, establishes a framework for providing **ex gratia (voluntary, non-legal) payments** to certain individuals who participated in nuclear decontamination activities at **Atomic Energy of Canada Limited’s (AECL) Chalk River nuclear facilities** in Ontario during specific historical periods. The payments are intended to recognize the contributions and risks faced by workers during early nuclear operations, without implying legal liability on the part of the Crown.

The Order was issued under **Section 4 of the relevant enabling legislation**, allowing the Minister to authorize payments upon application, subject to defined eligibility criteria and procedural requirements.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited):**  
  The Canadian government-owned corporation responsible for nuclear research, development, and operations, including the Chalk River Laboratories.

- **Minister:**  
  Refers to the **Minister of Natural Resources**, who has the authority to administer and approve the ex gratia payments under this Order.

- **Worker:**  
  Broadly defined to include:
  - Full-time, part-time, seasonal, or casual employees of AECL;
  - Contractors engaged directly by AECL;
  - Subcontractors of those contractors;
  - Employees of those contractors or subcontractors.

This ensures that individuals involved in decontamination efforts—whether directly employed or through third-party contracts—are covered.

---

### **Eligibility for Payment**

Under **Section 2**, the Minister is authorized to make a **one-time ex gratia payment of $28,500** to a worker who:

- Actively participated in **on-site cleanup or decontamination activities** at AECL’s Chalk River facilities during **either or both of the following periods**:
  1. **December 12, 1952 – December 31, 1953**
  2. **May 23, 1958 – December 31, 1958**

> ⚠️ **Important Note:**  
> This Order **does not apply** to individuals who are already eligible for payments under the **Order Respecting Ex Gratia Payments to Veterans and Science and Technology Workers Involved in Nuclear Weapons Testing or Nuclear Decontamination (SI/2008-95)**.  
> Even if a person meets the criteria under this Order, they are **excluded** if they were previously eligible under that earlier legislation.

### **Payments to Deceased Workers (Section 3)**

If a worker who would otherwise qualify under Section 2 has **died**, the Minister may still provide the $28,500 payment under the following conditions:

#### 1. **If the worker died testate (with a will):**
   - **If the estate has not been distributed or liquidated:**  
     Payment goes to the **executor or administrator** of the estate.
   - **If the estate has been distributed or liquidated:**  
     Payment is made to the **natural person entitled to the residue of the estate** who is alive on the date the Order comes into force.  
     If multiple such persons exist, they receive the payment **pro rata** (in proportion to their share).

#### 2. **If the worker died intestate (without a will):**
   - Payment goes to the **adult who was ordinarily living with the worker at the time of death** and who was **primarily responsible for providing unpaid care** to the worker.
   - If more than one such person exists, they receive the payment **pro rata**.

> This provision ensures that the benefit reaches those who were personally involved in caregiving or dependent on the worker, recognizing their emotional and practical support.

---

### **Application Process**

- Applications must be submitted **on or before March 31, 2023**, by:
  - The eligible worker (living), or
  - The designated beneficiary (e.g., executor, estate heir, or caregiver in case of death)

- Applications must be submitted in the **form approved by the Minister** and supported by **any evidence** the Minister deems necessary (e.g., employment records, witness statements, service logs, etc.).

- **Late applications** may be accepted **only if** the applicant can demonstrate that they were **unable to submit the application before March 31, 2023** due to **facts or circumstances beyond their control** (e.g., illness, disability, death, or lack of access to documentation).

---

### **Payment Terms**

- The payment is a **one-time, lump sum** of **$28,500**.
- No payment will be made **after March 31, 2024**, unless:
  - The applicant can show that **circumstances beyond their control** necessitate a later payment (e.g., legal or medical issues preventing timely submission).

> This creates a **strict deadline** for claims, with a limited exception for extenuating circumstances.

---

### **Legal and Ethical Clarifications**

- **No Admission of Liability:**  
  A payment made under this Order **does not constitute an admission of fault, negligence, or liability** by the Crown (i.e., the Government of Canada).  
  It is a **voluntary, compassionate gesture** to acknowledge the historical contributions and risks faced by workers during early nuclear operations.

- **Non-Exhaustive and Non-Exclusive:**  
  The Order does not create a right to compensation under any other legal claim. It is **distinct from claims under workers’ compensation, tort law, or employment standards**.

---

### **Purpose and Context**

This Order responds to long-standing concerns about the **health, safety, and recognition of workers** involved in early nuclear activities at Chalk River—particularly during the 1950s and early 1960s when decontamination procedures were conducted with limited knowledge of radiation risks.

It reflects a **modern effort to address historical injustices** and provide **moral and financial recognition** to individuals who contributed to national nuclear programs under hazardous conditions, without requiring legal action or litigation.

### **Key Dates and Deadlines**

| Date | Significance |
|------|-------------|
| **December 12, 1952 – December 31, 1953** | First eligible period for decontamination work |
| **May 23, 1958 – December 31, 1958** | Second eligible period |
| **March 31, 2023** | Final deadline for applications by living workers or beneficiaries |

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, compassionate, and historically grounded** measure designed to:

- Recognize the contributions of workers involved in decontamination at Chalk River;
- Provide financial support to eligible individuals and their families;
- Ensure equitable distribution of benefits, including to caregivers of deceased workers;
- Maintain a clear, transparent, and time-bound process for claims;
- Avoid any implication of legal liability or wrongdoing by the Crown.

It stands as a significant step in Canada’s efforts to acknowledge and support those who worked in high-risk scientific and industrial environments during the formative years of nuclear science and energy development.
