## **Potential Concerns and Criticisms**

- **Chilling Effect on Legitimate Financial Activity**:  
  Broad definitions and ongoing monitoring may impact legitimate business operations, especially small or cross-border financial services.

- **Lack of Transparency**:  
  The identity of designated persons is not disclosed, raising concerns about accountability and due process.

- **Risk of Overreach**:  
  The Order could be used to target individuals or businesses without clear legal justification or judicial oversight.

- **Privacy Issues**:  
  Mandatory reporting to CSIS may raise privacy and surveillance concerns.

- **Vagueness in "Designated Person" Definition**:  
  Without clear criteria, enforcement could be inconsistent or arbitrary.
