## 📚 **Comprehensive Summary of the Biocides Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Authority**
The Biocides Regulations are made under the following statutes:

- **Section 30a of the Food and Drugs Act (Act)**  
  Grants the Minister of Health the authority to regulate biocides as drugs, subject to specific exclusions.

- **S.C. 2023, c. 12, s. 67**  
  A statutory provision that enables the regulation of biocides under the Food and Drugs Act.

- **R.S., c. F-27**  
  Refers to the *Food and Drug Regulations* (FDR), which contain the detailed rules governing biocides.

- **S.C. 2017, c. 6, s. 113**  
  Supports the regulatory framework for pest control products.

- **S.C. 2002, c. 28**  
  Historical reference to earlier regulatory provisions related to biocides and pesticides.

> **Note**: These regulations are specifically designed to govern **non-liquid, non-living surface biocides**, excluding those used on food surfaces or medical devices.

## 🔍 **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Biocide** | A substance used to destroy or inactivate microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, viruses) on **non-living, non-liquid surfaces**. <br> ❌ Excludes: <br> - Use on food surfaces <br> - Use on contact lenses (medical devices) <br> - Use on invasive medical devices (e.g., IV tubes, catheters) that deliver fluids into the body, even if they destroy pathogens |
| **Active Ingredient** | The component directly responsible for the biocide’s intended effect (e.g., sodium hypochlorite in bleach). |
| **Formulant** | Any component of the biocide **other than** the active ingredient or contaminant. (e.g., solvents, surfactants) |
| **CAS Registry Number** | Unique identifier assigned by the American Chemical Society to a chemical substance. |
| **Conditions of Use** | Includes: <br> - Intended uses/purposes <br> - Settings of use (e.g., industrial floors, equipment) <br> - Risk information <br> - Directions for use <br> - Directions for storage |
| **Expiry Date** | The year and month when the biocide’s shelf life ends. |
| **Foreign Regulatory Authority** | A government or entity outside Canada that regulates biocides and may enforce compliance. <br> Reference: *List of Foreign Regulatory Authorities* (published on Government of Canada website) |
| **Lot Number** | A unique identifier (letters/numbers) used to trace a batch of biocide from production to distribution. |
| **Major Change** | A change that may significantly affect quality, safety, or risk profile. Includes: <br> - Change in method of application (unless similar to approved method) <br> - Addition of a new method of application <br> - Addition/removal of formulant (unless replaced with similar quantity) <br> - Change in formulant quantity <br> - Change in conditions of use (excluding minor adjustments like removing a use or direction) |
| **Minor Change** | A change with minor impact. Includes: <br> - Change in brand name or contact info <br> - Removal of a method of application <br> - Replacement of a formulant with a similar one <br> - Change in importer or manufacturer <br> - Change in manufacturing location |
| **Master Formula** | A detailed document that includes: <br> - Ingredients and quantities <br> - Specifications of the biocide <br> - Manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and storage procedures <br> - Testing methods for packaging <br> - Tolerances for packaging properties |
| **Specifications** | A formal statement of: <br> - Properties and qualities of the biocide and its ingredients <br> - Net quantity, package type, and packaging material properties <br> - Testing methods <br> - Tolerances for properties |
| **Shelf Life** | The period from packaging date during which the biocide retains its stability and claimed qualities when stored properly. |
| **Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR)** | As defined in section 21.8 of the Food and Drugs Act: <br> - In-patient hospitalization <br> - Prolongation of existing hospitalization <br> - Congenital malformation <br> - Chronic or significant disability/incapacity <br> - Life-threatening or fatal outcome |

## ⚖️ **Applicability and Exemptions**

### ✅ **Exemptions from Full Application of the Food and Drugs Act**

1. **Exemption from Subsection 3(1)**  
   A biocide is exempt from being advertised as a treatment or cure for diseases/disorders listed in **Schedule A.1** of the Act **if it is not advertised to the public**.

2. **Exemption from Subsection 3(2)**  
   A biocide is exempt from sale restrictions if:
   - It is **not labeled** as a treatment or cure for any disease/disorder in Schedule A.1  
   - It is **not advertised** to the general public for such purposes

> 💡 *Purpose*: Prevents misrepresentation of biocides as medical treatments when they are only surface disinfectants.

## 🚫 **Prohibitions and Requirements**

### 1. **Prohibition on Import**
- **General Rule**: Importing a biocide is prohibited if its sale in Canada would violate the Act or these Regulations.
- **Exceptions**:
  - If the biocide can be **rebranded or modified** to comply with Canadian regulations.
  - If the **importer provides advance notice** to a Food and Drug Inspector.
- **Requirement**: The **name and civic address of the importer** must be published under subsection 12(2).

> ⚠️ *Note*: Import for **testing only** (to support a market authorization application) is allowed under sections 10 or 26.

### 2. **Export Certificates**
- Must be in the **form specified in Appendix III** of the Food and Drug Regulations.
- The exporter must **retain a copy for at least 5 years** after export.

---

### 3. **Bond Requirement**
- All biocides must be **held in bond** (i.e., under supervision) under paragraph 38(c) of the Act.

---

### 4. **Market Authorization Requirement**
- **No sale, import, or advertising** of a biocide is permitted **unless it has a valid market authorization** issued under **section 11** of the Act.
