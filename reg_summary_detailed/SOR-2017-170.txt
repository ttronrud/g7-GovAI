### **Key Provisions and Content:**

1. **Territories Specified in Schedule 1**  
   - The regulation identifies specific **territories** (geographic areas) within Canada that are designated for the purposes of the Coasting Trade Act.  
   - These territories are **not included** in the definition of "territory" under **subsection 2(1)** of the Coasting Trade Act as defined in the context of the European Union.  
   - This distinction is critical because it clarifies that certain Canadian regions are **not considered "territories"** under EU definitions, which may affect compliance, classification, or regulatory alignment when engaging in international maritime trade with the EU.  
   - The exclusion ensures that Canada maintains regulatory autonomy and avoids unintended overlap or misclassification in international maritime operations.

2. **International Registers in Schedule 2**  
   - The regulation lists specific **international registers** (i.e., registries maintained by recognized authorities) that are recognized under **paragraph 3(2.2)(c)** of the Coasting Trade Act.  
   - These registers are designated as **international** for the purposes of the Act, meaning that vessels registered under these registries may operate in international coastal trade under Canadian jurisdiction, particularly in relation to EU trade agreements.  
   - Recognition of these registers facilitates smoother maritime operations, regulatory compliance, and mutual recognition with international partners—especially in the context of the Canada–EU trade agreement.

3. **Effective Date of the Regulations**  
   - The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 94 of the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2017, c. 6) comes into force**.  
   - However, if any of the regulations are **registered (i.e., formally published or issued) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.  
   - This provision provides flexibility in administrative timing, allowing for phased implementation or adjustments based on regulatory or operational readiness.

4. **Reference to Implementation Date**  
   - The note at the end of the regulation states:  
     > *“Regulations in force September 21, 2017, see SI/2017-47.”*  
   - This confirms that the regulations were officially published and came into effect on **September 21, 2017**, as part of the *Statutory Instrument 2017-47*, which implements Section 94 of the Canada–EU Trade Agreement.

### **Purpose and Significance:**

- **Facilitates Trade with the European Union:**  
  These regulations are a direct result of the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which aims to harmonize trade rules, including in the maritime sector. By specifying which territories and registers are recognized, Canada ensures alignment with EU standards while maintaining regulatory control.

- **Clarifies Jurisdictional Boundaries:**  
  The exclusion of certain territories from the EU definition of "territory" prevents misinterpretation or overreach in international maritime law and ensures that Canadian coastal trade operations are properly classified.

- **Promotes Regulatory Efficiency:**  
  By designating international registers, the regulation streamlines vessel registration, licensing, and compliance for Canadian coastal shipping operators engaged in cross-border trade with the EU.

- **Supports Legal Certainty:**  
  The clear definition of territories and registers provides legal clarity for maritime operators, regulators, and international partners, reducing ambiguity in compliance and operational requirements.

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation serves as a critical implementation tool under the Canada–EU Trade Agreement, formally defining which Canadian territories are subject to the Coasting Trade Act and which international vessel registries are recognized for compliance purposes. It ensures that Canada’s coastal shipping framework is both aligned with international standards and tailored to its own regulatory and geographic realities. The effective date and registration provisions provide a practical mechanism for timely and orderly implementation.
