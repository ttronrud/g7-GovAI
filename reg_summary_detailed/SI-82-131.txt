**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
"Repair Abroad of Canadian Civil Aircraft, Canadian Aircraft Engines and Flight Simulators Remission Order"**

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **tax remission (exemption)** for certain Canadian-made civil aircraft, aircraft engines, flight simulators, and their parts when they are exported abroad for repair and subsequently re-imported into Canada. It replaces the previous Order in Council P.C. 1981-649 (issued on March 6, 1981), which provided similar relief but has now been revoked and superseded by this updated version.

The primary objective is to **support the maintenance and operational efficiency of Canadian aerospace industry assets** by allowing businesses to export these goods for repair abroad without being burdened with additional excise tax upon re-importation — provided specific conditions are met.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**

The regulation is issued under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) to make orders relating to the taxation of goods, including exemptions and remissions.

This authority allows for targeted adjustments in tax policy to promote economic activity, particularly in strategic sectors like aerospace.

### **3. Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies to the following **goods**:

- **Canadian aircraft engines**  
  Defined as engines manufactured in Canada or on which customs duties and excise taxes were previously paid under the Customs Tariff and the Excise Tax Act.

- **Canadian civil aircraft**  
  Civil aircraft (non-military) manufactured in Canada or on which duties and taxes were previously paid under the same legislation.

- **Canadian flight simulators**  
  Flight simulator systems manufactured in Canada or on which duties and taxes were previously paid.

- **Parts thereof**  
  Any part that:
  - Can be classified under **tariff item 9967.00.00** (a category of parts used in aircraft), and  
  - Was manufactured in Canada or on which duties and taxes were previously paid under the Customs Tariff and Excise Tax Act.

> **Note**: The term "parts" is specifically defined to ensure only eligible components are covered.

### **4. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Repair** | Includes maintenance, rebuilding, modification, and conversion of the goods. This broad definition ensures that even significant upgrades or alterations are covered. |
| **Value of the Repair** | Refers to the cost of repair as shown on a repair bill, **less** the direct labour and employee benefits costs (if separately itemized and deemed acceptable by the Minister of National Revenue). This ensures that only the actual cost of materials and work (excluding labour) is considered in calculating the tax remission. |
| **Duty Paid Value of Goods** | The value of the original goods at the time of export, used to calculate the initial excise tax liability. |
| **Value of Repair** | The cost of the repair work, after deducting allowable labour and benefits costs. |

### **5. Conditions for Remission**

A remission of excise tax under Division III of Part IX of the **Excise Tax Act** is granted **only if all of the following conditions are satisfied**:

1. **Export under Customs Supervision**  
   The goods must have been exported from Canada **under customs supervision** (i.e., with proper documentation and oversight by customs authorities). This ensures that the export is legitimate and traceable.

2. **No Drawback Has Been Paid**  
   A "drawback" is a refund of duties or taxes paid on goods temporarily exported. If a drawback has already been claimed or paid for the goods, the remission under this Order **does not apply**. This prevents double benefits.

3. **No Claim for Relief Under Section 101 of the Customs Tariff**  
   The exporter must not have previously filed a claim for tax relief under **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff**, which provides for relief in cases of temporary export. If such a claim exists, the remission is not available.

> These conditions ensure that the remission is not used inappropriately or for goods that have already received tax benefits through other mechanisms.

---

### **6. Calculation of Tax Remission**

The remission amount equals the **difference** between:

- The excise tax paid or payable on the **duty-paid value** of the goods at the time of export, and  
- The excise tax paid or payable on the **value of the repair** (after deducting allowable labour and benefits).

> In simpler terms:  
> **Remission = (Original Tax Liability) – (Tax on Repair Value)**  
> This effectively reduces the tax burden on the re-imported goods based on the cost of the repair work.

---

### **7. Tax Implication**

- The **excise tax** in question is under **Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which governs taxes on certain motor vehicles, aircraft, and other capital goods.
- The remission applies to **excise tax**, not sales tax (though the regulation references sales tax in the title, it is clear that the actual relief is for excise tax).
- This relief is **not a sales tax exemption** but a **specific remission of excise tax** on re-imported repaired goods.

> **Clarification**: The regulation’s title references "sales tax," but the actual tax being remitted is the **excise tax** on aircraft and related equipment. This may reflect outdated or inaccurate terminology in the original publication.

---

### **8. Administrative Oversight**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** has the authority to determine whether:
  - Labour and employee benefits costs are acceptable for deduction from the repair bill.
  - The repair bill reflects accurate and verifiable costs.
- This ensures that the remission is based on **reasonable and verifiable financial records**.

---

### **9. Citation and Legal Status**

- The Order may be cited as:  
  **"Repair Abroad of Canadian Civil Aircraft, Canadian Aircraft Engines and Flight Simulators Remission Order"**
- It is published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, p. 985**, on **SI/81-44**, 1981.

---

### **10. Key Policy Implications**

- **Supports Canadian Aerospace Industry**: Enables Canadian operators and manufacturers to send critical aircraft and engine components abroad for repair without facing a tax increase upon re-entry.
- **Encourages Maintenance Efficiency**: Allows for timely repairs, reducing downtime and improving safety and operational readiness.
- **Promotes Economic Competitiveness**: Helps maintain Canada’s presence in the global aerospace market by supporting the lifecycle management of key assets.
- **Prevents Tax Abuse**: The strict conditions (customs supervision, no prior drawback, no prior claim) prevent misuse and ensure fairness in tax administration.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, well-structured exemption designed to support the maintenance of Canada’s civil aviation and aerospace infrastructure. By allowing a tax remission on re-imported repaired goods — based on the actual cost of repair — it promotes operational efficiency and economic viability for Canadian aerospace operators and manufacturers.

It reflects a balance between **fiscal responsibility** and **industrial support**, ensuring that tax policy serves both revenue goals and national economic interests.

**Note**: This Order is no longer in effect as of the date of the most recent amendments to the Excise Tax Act and related regulations. However, it remains historically significant as a foundational policy in Canadian aerospace tax treatment and is often referenced in discussions about international repair and tax exemptions.
