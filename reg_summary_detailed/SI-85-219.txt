### **Main Provisions: Tax and Duty Remission**

Two types of tax/duty remission are granted under this Order:

#### 1. **Remission of Customs Duties**  
- Applies to **customs duties** paid or payable under **Section 21 of the Customs Tariff**.

- The remission is granted **subject to the conditions** outlined in Section 5.

### **Conditions for Remission (Section 5)**

To qualify for remission, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Date of Import**  
   The merchandise must be imported **on or after January 1, 1984**.  
   → *This establishes a policy start date, ensuring the rule applies to imports from a defined point forward.*

2. **Export or Destruction Within 60 Days**  
   The imported merchandise must be either:
   - **Exported** out of Canada, or  
   - **Destroyed**  
   — under the **supervision of an officer of the Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise**.  
   → *Ensures that the goods are not retained or used for unauthorized purposes.*

3. **Signed Declaration by Importer**  
   The importer must submit a **signed declaration** to a Department officer stating that:
   - The merchandise will **not be used to produce advertising material** or other printed matter that promotes the availability of the merchandise in Canada.  
   → *This safeguards against misuse of the imported goods for commercial promotion.*

4. **Record Keeping Requirement**  
   The importer must maintain **records for a period of three years** that are sufficient to:
   - Demonstrate the **actual use of the merchandise in Canada** and  
   - Show the **production of layouts** for inspection by a Department officer.  
   → *Provides accountability and enables audits to verify compliance.*

5. **Timely Claim for Remission**  
   A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within three years** of the date the goods were accounted for under the Customs Act.  
   → *Sets a clear deadline for claiming the benefit; failure to do so results in forfeiture of the remission.*

### **Policy Objectives and Rationale**

The Order serves several public policy purposes:

- **Supports Canadian editorial content**: Enables publishers to include authentic, real-world product images in their magazines, enhancing journalistic and educational value.
- **Reduces administrative and financial burden**: Temporarily imports goods to avoid the full cost of duty and tax, which would otherwise be prohibitive for editorial illustration.
- **Prevents misuse**: Through strict conditions (especially the declaration and record-keeping requirements), the government ensures the imported goods are not diverted to advertising or commercial promotion.
- **Promotes transparency and accountability**: Mandatory records and inspections ensure compliance and prevent fraud or abuse.

---

### **Key Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excludes photographic equipment and film**: These are not considered "merchandise" under the definition and thus are not eligible for remission.
- **Excludes advertising material**: Any use of imported goods to produce brochures, price lists, or promotional displays is prohibited.
- **Limited to periodicals**: Only publications published at least four times per year qualify. This excludes newspapers, one-off magazines, or digital-only platforms not meeting the frequency threshold.
- **Time-bound eligibility**: The import date must be on or after January 1, 1984, and claims must be made within three years of accounting.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise** (now part of Revenue Canada) is responsible for:
  - Reviewing declarations,
  - Inspecting records,
  - Verifying exports or destruction,
  - Ensuring compliance with all conditions.
- Violation of any condition (e.g., using imported goods for advertising or failing to maintain records) may result in penalties or revocation of remission.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Merchandise for Photographic Layouts Remission Order* is a targeted, well-structured regulatory measure designed to:

- Facilitate the production of authentic, editorial-quality content in Canadian periodicals,  
- Reduce financial barriers for publishers,  
- Maintain compliance and prevent commercial exploitation of temporarily imported goods.

By balancing flexibility for publishers with strict safeguards against misuse, the Order reflects a pragmatic approach to supporting Canadian media while protecting public revenue and ensuring fair tax administration.
