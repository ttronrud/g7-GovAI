**Detailed Summary of the Nova Scotia Turkey Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled the *Nova Scotia Turkey Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a statutory instrument under the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi), providing specific rules and authority for the regulation of turkey marketing in the province.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi). This is the foundational legislation that authorizes the regulatory bodies involved in managing the marketing of agricultural products, including turkeys.

- **Board**: Refers to the *Nova Scotia Marketing Board* (Régie), a provincial body established under the Act. It has broad authority to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including turkeys, both within the province and in interprovincial and export markets.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Nova Scotia Turkey Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), a specialized body created under the same Act to oversee the marketing of turkeys specifically.

- **Turkey**: Defined as any turkey—regardless of variety, grade, or class—that is raised or kept for slaughter within Nova Scotia and is sold for slaughter. This definition ensures that only turkeys produced and intended for slaughter in the province are subject to the Order’s regulations.

### **3. Regulatory Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**

Both the **Marketing Board** and the **Turkey Marketing Board** are authorized to regulate the marketing of turkeys in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales to other provinces),
- **Export trade** (sales outside Canada).

For these purposes, each body may, by issuing an order, exercise **all or any powers** that they would otherwise have in regulating turkey marketing **within Nova Scotia**, under **Section 4B of the Natural Products Marketing Act**.

This means that the powers granted to these bodies for local marketing (e.g., setting prices, managing supply, enforcing standards) can be extended to interprovincial and export markets, giving them significant flexibility in managing the market.

### **4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board (Relevant Section)**

Although a prior provision (previously in effect under SOR/80-90) has been **repealed**, the current regulation grants the Commodity Board specific authority in relation to the marketing of turkeys in interprovincial and export markets.

#### **Key Powers:**

- **Fixing, Imposing, and Collecting Levies or Charges**:
  - The Commodity Board may establish **levies or charges** on individuals or entities located in Nova Scotia who are involved in:
    - The **production** of turkeys (e.g., farmers),
    - The **marketing** of turkeys (e.g., processors, distributors).

- **Classification of Persons into Groups**:
  - The Board may **categorize** producers and marketers into different groups (e.g., small farms, large producers, exporters) based on size, volume, or type of operation.
  - Different **levies or charges** can be imposed on each group, allowing for equitable and tailored financial arrangements.

- **Use of Levies or Charges**:
  - The funds collected from these levies or charges may be used for:
    - **Creation of reserves** (funds set aside for future use),
    - **Payment of expenses and losses** arising from:
      - The sale or disposal of turkeys,
      - Market fluctuations or downturns,
      - Unforeseen events affecting turkey supply or demand.
    - **Equalization or adjustment of financial outcomes** among turkey producers.
      - This ensures that producers who earn more during a period (e.g., due to high prices) contribute to or share in funds that help those who earn less (e.g., during a market slump).
      - This promotes **market stability** and **fairness** among producers.

- **Time Periods**:
  - The Commodity Board may determine the **duration** (period or periods) for which these levies or adjustments apply. For example, levies could be applied annually or over a multi-year cycle, depending on market conditions.

---

### **5. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

- To **stabilize the turkey market** in Nova Scotia by managing price volatility and ensuring fair returns to producers.
- To **protect producers** from financial losses during downturns through mechanisms like equalization and reserve funds.
- To **ensure equitable financial responsibility** among producers and marketers, based on their size and role in the supply chain.
- To provide **flexibility in interprovincial and export marketing**, allowing the Commodity Board to respond to market dynamics beyond the provincial boundary.

---

### **6. Key Notes and Implications**

- **Repeal of Prior Provision (SOR/80-90)**: The previous version of this regulation, which was in force before 1980, has been formally removed. This indicates a modernization or revision of the regulatory framework to better reflect current market conditions and policy goals.

- **Flexibility and Responsiveness**: The ability to classify producers into groups and set differential charges allows for a more nuanced and responsive system, especially in a diverse agricultural sector.

- **Financial Accountability**: The use of collected levies for reserve creation and loss compensation ensures that the system is financially sustainable and supports long-term producer welfare.

- **Provincial Focus**: All powers and responsibilities are confined to persons and property **within Nova Scotia**, meaning that the Order does not extend to federal or international markets directly, though export marketing is covered under the broader authority.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Nova Scotia Turkey Order* establishes a structured, market-responsive framework for regulating the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys in Nova Scotia. It empowers the **Nova Scotia Turkey Marketing Board** to impose fair and equitable levies or charges on turkey producers and marketers, grouped by type or size, and to use the resulting funds to stabilize markets, manage losses, and ensure fair distribution of financial outcomes. This promotes both economic stability and fairness among producers in a dynamic and competitive market environment.

This regulation is a key component of Nova Scotia’s agricultural marketing policy, designed to protect producers and ensure sustainable development in the turkey sector.
