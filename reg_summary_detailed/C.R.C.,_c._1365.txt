**Detailed Summary of the Public Works Nuisances Regulations**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Public Works Nuisances Regulations*

---

### **Overview**  
These regulations establish strict rules governing the use, access, and modification of public works—such as roads, bridges, construction sites, or infrastructure projects under government control. The primary objective is to prevent unauthorized activity, ensure public safety, maintain order, and preserve the integrity of public infrastructure. The regulations are enforceable by the Minister and peace officers, with clear penalties for violations.

### **Key Provisions and Detailed Explanations**

#### **1. Prohibition of Loitering and Nuisance Activities (Section 1)**  
> *"No person shall loiter or commit any nuisance in, on or about any public work."*

- **Meaning**: Individuals are prohibited from lingering unnecessarily or engaging in behavior that could disrupt public works (e.g., vandalism, noise, littering, or obstructing access).
- **Scope**: Applies to all areas directly associated with public works—on-site, adjacent, or surrounding.
- **Purpose**: Prevents public disturbances and ensures that public works remain safe and functional.

---

#### **2. Restricted Use of Emergency Exits (Section 2)**  
> *"No unauthorized person shall, except in cases of emergency, open or use a door designated as an emergency exit in or on any building under the control of the Minister."*

- **Meaning**: Emergency exits are reserved for use only during actual emergencies (e.g., fire, medical crisis).
- **Prohibited Actions**: Unauthorized individuals (non-authorized personnel) cannot open or use emergency exits for routine purposes.
- **Exception**: Only permitted during emergencies when there is a genuine threat to life or safety.
- **Purpose**: Ensures emergency exits remain functional and accessible only when needed, preventing misuse that could compromise safety.

---

#### **3. Prohibition of Unauthorized Entry (Section 3)**  
> *"No person shall, without the prior authorization of the Minister, enter on or into any public work or portion thereof, to which the public is not permitted entry."*

- **Meaning**: Entry into certain parts of public works (e.g., active construction zones, restricted access areas) is strictly prohibited unless explicitly authorized by the Minister.
- **Public Access Exception**: Only areas designated for public access are open to the general public.
- **Purpose**: Protects ongoing construction, maintenance, or safety operations from uncontrolled access that could endanger workers or damage infrastructure.

---

#### **4. Restriction on Erecting or Posting Items (Section 4)**  
> *"No person shall erect, construct or post any thing, material or object in or upon any public work other than in such places as are specifically designated for such purposes."*

- **Meaning**: No unauthorized structures, signs, banners, or objects may be placed on or within public works.
- **Permitted Exceptions**: Only items placed in areas officially designated for such use (e.g., signage zones, advertising boards approved by the Minister).
- **Purpose**: Prevents obstruction, clutter, or visual pollution of public infrastructure.

---

#### **5. Prohibition of Occupation or Residency (Section 5)**  
> *"No person shall occupy, reside, camp or sleep in or upon any public work or use any vehicle for the purpose of occupying a public work or residing, camping or sleeping thereon."*

- **Meaning**: Public works are not to be used as temporary shelters, campsites, or residences.
- **Prohibited Activities**:
  - Sleeping or camping
  - Residing in any form
  - Using vehicles (e.g., tents, trailers, RVs) to occupy the space
- **Purpose**: Prevents illegal encampments, homelessness, or unauthorized occupation of public infrastructure.

---

#### **6. Restriction on Structures (Section 6)**  
> *"No person shall erect, use, occupy or maintain any structure in or upon any public work except by or under the authority of the Minister."*

- **Meaning**: All structures (e.g., sheds, tents, scaffolding, buildings) must be approved and authorized by the Minister before being erected or maintained.
- **No Exceptions**: Even temporary or small structures require formal authorization.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that all physical modifications to public works are safe, planned, and consistent with public interest and safety standards.

---

#### **7. Prohibition on Altering or Defacing Signs (Section 7)**  
> *"No person shall erect, remove, alter or deface any information sign, regulatory sign, or traffic sign or device on any public work, except by or under the authority of the Minister."*

- **Meaning**: All signs (traffic, regulatory, informational) are protected and cannot be:
  - Removed
  - Altered (e.g., painted over, changed text)
  - Defaced (e.g., scratched, damaged)
- **Exception**: Only authorized by the Minister.
- **Purpose**: Maintains clear, consistent, and reliable communication for public safety and regulatory compliance.

#### **8. Immediate Compliance Upon Notice (Section 8)**  
> *"Any person found contravening section 6 of these Regulations shall forthwith, on receiving notice from the Minister or a peace officer, either orally or in writing, requiring him to cease such activity and to quit the public work, remove his personal property from and quit the public work and shall not thereafter resume the activity to which the notice applies."*

- **Notice Requirement**: A person who violates Section 6 (e.g., unauthorized occupation or activity) must be given a notice—oral or written—by the Minister or a peace officer.
- **Immediate Actions Required**:
  - Cease the prohibited activity
  - Remove personal belongings
  - Quit the public work area
  - Do not resume the activity in the future
- **Purpose**: Provides a clear, enforceable mechanism to stop violations promptly and prevent ongoing disruptions.

---

#### **9. Enforcement by Peace Officers (Section 9)**  
> *"A peace officer may remove from a public work any person who refuses to obey a notice under section 8 and any personal property apparently in the possession of that person."*

- **Authority**: Peace officers have the power to:
  - Remove individuals who ignore or refuse to comply with a notice
  - Remove personal belongings (e.g., tents, vehicles, tools) that appear to belong to the person
- **Application**: Enforced when a person fails to comply with Section 8.
- **Purpose**: Ensures compliance and enforces the rule of law in public spaces.

---

#### **10. Presumption of Ministerial Authority (Section 10)**  
> *"Any information, sign, regulatory sign, or traffic sign or device erected in or upon any public work shall, unless the contrary is established, be presumed to have been erected by or under the authority of the Minister."*

- **Legal Presumption**: If a sign or device is found on a public work, it is **automatically presumed** to have been placed by or under the authority of the Minister.
- **Burden of Proof**: To challenge this presumption, the person must prove otherwise (e.g., through evidence of independent installation).
- **Purpose**: Simplifies enforcement by establishing that all signs are official and legitimate unless proven otherwise.

#### **11. Offences and Penalties (Section 11)**  
> *"Every person who contravenes any provision of sections 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7 is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $400."*

#### **12. Additional Offence for Non-Compliance with Notice (Section 12)**  
> *"Any person who fails to forthwith remove his personal property from and quit a public work after receiving a notice referred to in section 8 or who resumes an activity in respect of which the person has received such a notice is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $400."*

- **New Violation**: Failing to comply with a notice under Section 8 (e.g., not removing belongings or returning to the site after being told to leave).
- **Penalty**: Same as above—summary conviction and a fine of up to **$400**.
- **Purpose**: Deters repeat or willful violations and reinforces the seriousness of compliance.

### **Important Note on Revocation**  
> *[Revoked, SOR/92-737, s. 1 and s. 2]*

- **Section 1 (Section 8)** and **Section 2 (Presumption of Ministerial Authority)** have been **revoked** by **SOR/92-737, sections 1 and 2**.
- This means:
  - The requirement to remove personal property and quit the site upon notice (Section 8) is **no longer in force**.
  - The legal presumption that all signs are erected by the Minister is **no longer valid**.
- **Implication**: The current version of the regulation is **outdated or superseded**. The revocation suggests that these specific provisions were replaced or repealed by later legislation.

> ⚠️ **Critical Caveat**: The summary above reflects the *original content* of the regulation as provided. However, due to the revocation of Sections 1 and 2 (SOR/
