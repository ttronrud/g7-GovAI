**Detailed Summary of the Theratronics International Limited Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Theratronics International Limited Divestiture Regulations* were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under **subsections 9(3)a and (4)** of the *Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act*. These regulations were enacted to govern the transition of public service employees who were previously employed by **Theratronics International Limited (Theratronics)** into new employment arrangements following the divestiture of Theratronics by the Government of Canada.

The regulations came into force on **May 1, 1998**, and apply specifically to employees who transitioned from the Public Service to a new employer as a result of this divestiture.

### **Key Legal Framework**

- **Governing Legislation**:  
  - *Public Service Superannuation Act* (the "Act")  
  - *Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act* (the "Divestiture Act")

- **Purpose**:  
  To ensure that employees who leave the Public Service and are employed by a new employer (a successor entity) are treated fairly under the Public Service Superannuation system, particularly with regard to pension rights, death benefits, and eligibility for options.

---

### **Core Definitions**

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act*, which governs pension and superannuation benefits for public service employees.

2. **New Employer**:  
   A person or body that, by agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, carries out the activities previously conducted by Theratronics International Limited. This includes any individual or entity acting on behalf of or for that body.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to a person who:

- Ceases to be employed in the Public Service and  
- Becomes employed by a **new employer**  
- On or **after May 1, 1998**

**Exclusions**:

- Does **not apply** to:
  - A person who later returns to employment with the new employer (i.e., re-employed).
  - A person who made an election under **paragraph 9(1)(d)** of the Divestiture Act **before May 1, 1998**.

> This means that individuals who opted out of the transition prior to May 1, 1998, are not subject to these rules.

---

### **Specific Provisions and Implications**

#### **Section 4 to 9 – Exclusion for Option Exercise**
- These sections do **not apply** to a person who has exercised an option under **subsection 3(2)** of the Divestiture Act.
- This implies that if an employee exercised a specific option (e.g., to remain in the Public Service or to transfer benefits), they are exempt from certain provisions of the regulations.

#### **Sections 12, 13, and 13.01 – Application Date**
- These sections of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* only apply to a person **on and after the date they cease employment in the Public Service**.
- This means that pension, death benefit, or other entitlements under these sections begin when the individual stops working in the Public Service and starts working with the new employer.

#### **Extended Option Period for Eligible Employees**
- Despite the general rule, **a person who would otherwise be eligible** to exercise an option under:
  - Subsection 12(3) (pension option)
  - Paragraph 13(7)(a) or (b) (death benefit or survivorship option)
  - Section 13.01 (child allowance)
  
  **May exercise such an option no later than one year after** they cease employment in the Public Service and become employed by the new employer.

> This is a significant provision: it **extends the time frame** for exercising certain benefits from the standard period to a **maximum of one year** after the transition date.

#### **Effect of Exercising an Option**
- If a person exercises an option under subsection (2) (i.e., an option to retain benefits or transfer rights), they are:
  - **Deemed not to have become employed** by the new employer for the purposes of:
    - These Regulations
    - Sections 83 to 99 of the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations*
  - **Not entitled** to exercise the option under subsection (1) (i.e., the general option to retain benefits) when they later cease employment with the new employer.

> This prevents double benefits or overlapping entitlements and ensures a clear and final decision point.

#### **Death Benefits (Section 12(8))**
- If a person dies while employed by the new employer:
  - Their **surviving spouse and children** are entitled to a **return of contributions** (i.e., a death benefit equal to the amount of pension contributions made).

#### **Survivor Allowances (Section 13(3))**
- Surviving spouse and children of a deceased employee are entitled to:
  - An allowance as described in **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the Act
  - Subject to the **limitations** in subsections 12(4) and (5) of the Act

> This ensures that dependents receive financial support upon the death of an employee, even if the employee transitioned to a new employer.

#### **Child Allowance (Section 26(2))**
- A child born to, adopted by, or who became a stepchild of the employee **during the period**:
  - From the date the employee **ceases employment in the Public Service**
  - To the date they **cease employment by the new employer**
  
  Is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the Public Service Superannuation Act**.

> This provision recognizes that family formation can occur during the transition period and ensures that such children are not excluded from benefits.

#### **One-Year Period for Section 10(5)**
- For the purpose of **subsection 10(5)** of the Act (which relates to the time frame for claiming certain benefits), the **one-year period begins on the date the person ceases to be employed by the new employer**, not the date they left the Public Service.

> This clarifies the timing for benefit claims, ensuring that the clock starts from the moment of transition to the new employer.

#### **Pensionable Service and Age Determination**
- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period of service with the new employer, from the date the person **ceases employment in the Public Service** to the date they **cease employment by the new employer**.

- The **age of the person** when they cease employment in the Public Service is considered to be their age on the **day they cease employment by the new employer**.

> This ensures consistency in pension calculations and eligibility, even though the employee is no longer in the Public Service.

### **Policy Objectives**

1. **Fair Transition**: Ensure that employees who move from the Public Service to a private-sector successor (Theratronics) are not disadvantaged in terms of pension or survivor benefits.
2. **Clarity and Predictability**: Define clear rules for when benefits apply, when options are available, and how service and age are calculated.
3. **Prevent Abuse**: Prevent individuals from re-entering the system or re-applying for options after already exercising one.
4. **Family Protection**: Protect dependents (spouses and children) in the event of death or during the transition period.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Theratronics International Limited Divestiture Regulations* provide a comprehensive and fair framework for managing the superannuation rights of public service employees who transitioned to new employment following the divestiture of Theratronics. By extending key benefit windows, clarifying service and age calculations, and protecting dependents, the regulations ensure continuity of pension and family benefits during a major organizational change. They represent a carefully balanced approach to maintaining public service employee protections while allowing for the restructuring of government-owned enterprises.

These regulations remain in force as of May 1, 1998, and are binding on all relevant parties — including the new employer, employees, and the Department of Public Service and Procurement (or its successor).
