**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Determination of the Tariff Classification of Sugar, Molasses and Sugar Syrup Regulations (S.C. 1986, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, officially titled *The Determination of the Tariff Classification of Sugar, Molasses and Sugar Syrup Regulations*, was enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, pursuant to **paragraph 164(1)(f) of the Customs Act**. It came into force upon the implementation of that paragraph and provides a standardized, scientifically grounded methodology for determining the **tariff classification** of three key products: **sugar, molasses, and sugar syrup**.

The regulation ensures consistency and transparency in how these products are classified under Canadian customs law, particularly in relation to duties and trade regulations.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- **Section 164(3) of the Customs Act**: Required the publication of proposed regulations in *Part I of the Canada Gazette* to allow interested parties (e.g., industry stakeholders, importers, exporters) to submit representations or objections.
- **Publication Date**: March 15, 1986 – a reasonable opportunity was provided for public comment.
- **Enactment Authority**: The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, formally adopted the regulations under **paragraph 164(1)(f)**, which authorizes the Minister to prescribe rules for determining tariff classifications.

### **Regulation Title**
*Determinations of the Tariff Classification of Sugar, Molasses and Sugar Syrup Regulations*  
(Reference: S.C. 1986, c. 1)

---

### **Key Definitions**
- **ICUMSA (International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis)**:  
  A globally recognized body that develops and maintains standardized analytical methods for measuring sugar content and quality. Its methods are widely accepted in the sugar industry and in international trade.

### **Tariff Classification Methodology**

#### **1. Sugar**
- The tariff classification of **sugar** is determined based on **polarization measurements**.
- The specific method used is **ICUMSA Method No. 1**, first issued in 1958 and subsequently amended.
- This method measures the **optical rotation** (polarization) of sugar solutions, which correlates directly with the concentration of sucrose.
- The analysis must be conducted using equipment and procedures that conform to ICUMSA standards.

> ✅ *Purpose*: To ensure that sugar is classified accurately based on its sucrose content, which is critical for determining applicable duty rates.

#### **2. Molasses and Sugar Syrup**
- The tariff classification for **molasses** and **sugar syrup** is determined based on the **amount of reducing sugars** present.
- Two specific ICUMSA-approved methods are used:
  1. **United Molasses (UM) Modifications of the Lane and Eynon Method**  
     - Adopted in the *Report of the Proceedings of the Eighteenth Session, 1982*, Subject 8, Recommendation 9.
     - This method involves hydrolysis of the sample to break down complex sugars into reducing sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose), which are then measured.
     - The UM modifications improve accuracy and consistency in molasses analysis by adjusting for specific chemical conditions relevant to molasses composition.

  2. **Lane and Eynon Constant Volume Procedure**  
     - Adopted in the *Report of the Proceedings of the Seventeenth Session, 1978*, Subject 14, Recommendation 1.
     - A standard method for measuring reducing sugars by colorimetric reaction with a reagent (e.g., Fehling’s solution or similar).
     - The "constant volume" aspect ensures consistent sample volume during testing, enhancing repeatability.

> ✅ *Purpose*: To provide reliable, objective, and internationally comparable methods for classifying molasses and sugar syrups, which are often subject to varying compositions and duty rates based on their reducing sugar content.

### **Laboratory Requirements**
All equipment and materials used in the analysis must meet the **appropriate ICUMSA standards**, including:
- **Sugar polarimeters** (to measure optical rotation)
- **Polarimeter cells**
- **Volumetric glassware** (e.g., pipettes, flasks)
- **Laboratory reagents** (e.g., reagents for hydrolysis and colorimetric detection)

> ⚠️ *Non-compliance with ICUMSA standards may result in invalid results and potential misclassification of goods for customs purposes.*

---

### **Purpose and Significance**
This regulation:
- Establishes **scientifically sound and internationally accepted standards** for classifying sugar and related products.
- Enhances **accuracy and consistency** in tariff determination, reducing disputes between importers, exporters, and customs authorities.
- Aligns Canada’s customs practices with **global industry standards** (ICUMSA), facilitating international trade and fair competition.
- Provides **clear procedural guidelines** that are transparent and accessible to stakeholders.

---

### **Effective Date**
The regulations came into force **on the date when paragraph 164(1)(f) of the Customs Act was implemented** — this was March 15, 1986 (the date of publication), or shortly thereafter.

### **Key Takeaways**
| Product       | Method Used                              | Standard Reference                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sugar        | ICUMSA Method No. 1 (Polarization)      | 1958 (as amended)                     |
| Molasses     | UM-modified Lane & Eynon Method        | 1982, Session 18, Subject 8           |
| Sugar Syrup  | Lane & Eynon Constant Volume Procedure | 1978, Session 17, Subject 14          |

All analyses must be conducted using **ICUMSA-approved equipment and procedures**.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a foundational step in modernizing Canada’s customs classification system for sugar and related products. By adopting internationally recognized analytical methods from ICUMSA, it ensures that tariff classifications are based on objective, repeatable, and scientifically valid data — promoting fairness, transparency, and efficiency in trade administration.

It remains a key reference in Canadian customs practice and continues to influence how sugar and its byproducts are assessed for duty purposes.
