**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2004-871 and Designation of the Minister of Transport as the Appropriate Minister for the Queens Quay West Land Corporation

**Date of Effectiveness:** February 6, 2006

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under two provisions of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA):

1. **Paragraph (d) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act** – This provision allows the Governor General in Council to designate an appropriate Minister to administer certain government entities or corporations, particularly where the entity is not directly under the jurisdiction of a specific minister.

2. **Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in subsection 83(1) of the Financial Administration Act** – This provision specifically authorizes the designation of an appropriate Minister for the purposes of managing or overseeing a corporation that is established under the authority of the federal government, particularly in relation to financial administration and accountability.

---

**Key Actions Taken:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2004-871 (July 20, 2004):**  
   The regulation formally cancels and replaces the previous Order in Council dated July 20, 2004 (P.C. 2004-871). This earlier order had previously designated a different minister or provided administrative direction for the Queens Quay West Land Corporation. By repealing it, the government removes the prior designation and ensures that the current, updated designation takes effect.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Transport as the Appropriate Minister:**  
   The Minister of Transport is formally designated as the "appropriate Minister" for the **Queens Quay West Land Corporation** under the *Financial Administration Act*. This means that the Minister of Transport now has the authority and responsibility for:
   - Oversight of the corporation’s financial administration;
   - Ensuring compliance with federal financial management and accountability standards;
   - Approving expenditures, financial reports, and other administrative actions of the corporation;
   - Acting as the principal point of contact between the corporation and the federal government for financial and administrative matters.

---

**Purpose and Rationale:**

- The designation reflects a shift in administrative responsibility, likely based on the operational, geographic, or functional alignment of the Queens Quay West Land Corporation with the mandate of the Ministry of Transport.
- The Queens Quay West Land Corporation is a federal Crown corporation responsible for land management, development, or infrastructure related to the Queens Quay area in Toronto. Its operations may involve transportation infrastructure, land use planning, or public development projects.
- By assigning the Minister of Transport as the appropriate Minister, the government ensures that financial oversight is conducted by a minister with relevant expertise and policy alignment—particularly in transportation and urban development.

---

**Effective Date:**  
February 6, 2006 — This is when the repeal and designation take legal effect, and the Minister of Transport assumes the responsibilities of the appropriate Minister under the Financial Administration Act.

---

**Significance:**

- This regulation strengthens the accountability and financial governance of the Queens Quay West Land Corporation by clearly assigning oversight to a responsible minister.
- It demonstrates the flexibility of the *Financial Administration Act* in allowing for ministerial designations based on functional relevance rather than strict statutory assignment.
- It also reflects a broader trend in federal governance of aligning administrative oversight with policy domains.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation effectively updates the administrative structure of the Queens Quay West Land Corporation by repealing outdated ministerial designation and formally assigning oversight to the Minister of Transport. It ensures that financial administration and accountability are properly managed under a minister with relevant expertise and jurisdiction, in accordance with the *Financial Administration Act*.
