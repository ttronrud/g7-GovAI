#### **Exempt from Charges:**
- Loans to:
  - **Boy Scout and Girl Guide Associations**
  - **Dominion and Provincial Rifle Associations**
  - Civil organizations engaged in **non-commercial, charitable, or community activities**

#### **Charges May Be Reduced or Waived**
- In other cases, the Minister may decide to reduce or waive charges if it is in the **public interest**.
- When a **waiver or reduction** results in a borrower being relieved of a charge of **$1,000 or more**, the Minister is required to:
  - Prepare and submit a **report to the Treasury Board** explaining the rationale and financial impact.

#### **Costs to Be Borne by Borrowers**
- Borrowers are responsible for:
  - Transportation costs
  - Losses or damage (deficiencies)
  - Repairs and laundering (where applicable)

> These costs are considered part of the financial responsibility of the recipient and are not borne by the Crown unless otherwise determined.

---

### **6. Cost-Bearing Arrangements**

- **Default Rule**: All loans are **free to the Crown** unless the Minister determines that it is in the public interest for the Crown to **bear part or all of the cost**.
- If the Crown bears any cost:
  - The Minister determines **what portion**, if any, will be charged to the borrower.
- This provision allows flexibility in situations where public interest, such as emergency response or humanitarian aid, justifies Crown cost-sharing.

---

### **7. Prohibition on Consumable Materiel**

- Materiel that is **consumable** (e.g., ammunition, fuel, food supplies that degrade or are used up) **shall not be loaned**.
- However, the Minister may authorize provision of such items **for non-inconsistent purposes** if it is determined that doing so serves the national interest.

> This protects the integrity of essential supplies and prevents wastage or misuse.

---

### **8. Return or Payment Requirements (Unless Otherwise Directed)**

Unless the Governor in Council provides a different directive, a borrower must meet **one of the following conditions** before materiel is provided:

1. **Pay the Receiver General** an amount **equal to or greater than** the Minister’s estimated cost to the Crown; or  
2. **Replace the materiel** by returning an **equal quantity of the same type** to the Minister, at the **borrower’s expense**, under conditions prescribed by the Minister.

> This ensures accountability and recovers the value of the asset.

---

### **9. Agreements for Materiel Loans**

- The Minister may enter into **formal agreements** with organizations or individuals to facilitate the loan of materiel.
- These agreements must comply with the terms and conditions set out in these Regulations.

---

### **10. Final Authority and Flexibility**

- The **Minister of National Defence** retains **final authority** over all decisions regarding:
  - Authorization of loans
  - Determination of charges
  - Conditions of use
  - Return or replacement requirements
  - Waivers or exemptions
- All terms and conditions of loans must be **as directed or prescribed by the Minister**, ensuring consistency and alignment with national defence objectives.
