**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Extension of Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Tariff Benefits to Ferro-Chromium

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **Section 23 of the Customs Tariff** (*R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*), which authorizes the extension of Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment to specific goods under certain conditions.

**Subject Matter:**  
The regulation extends the benefit of **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment** to **ferro-chromium**.

**Specific Tariff Items Affected:**  
- Tariff item **7202.41.00**  
- Tariff item **7202.49.00**

*Note:* These tariff headings classify ferro-chromium, a metal alloy composed primarily of iron and chromium, used in steel manufacturing.

**Origin Requirement:**  
The ferro-chromium subject to this tariff benefit must **originate in a country to which the General Tariff applies**.  
This means the product must be produced or manufactured in a country that is a member of the international trade framework governed by the general tariff schedule (typically under the context of the Canada–World Trade Organization (WTO) framework or similar international agreements).

**Effective Date:**  
The extended MFN tariff benefit becomes effective on **April 15, 1990**.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
- The MFN tariff treatment ensures that ferro-chromium imported into Canada from eligible countries is subject to the **lowest tariff rate available to all countries** under Canada’s general tariff schedule.  
- This provision promotes **fair trade practices** by ensuring that Canadian importers do not receive preferential treatment over other nations.  
- It supports **international trade fairness** and aligns Canada’s tariff policies with its international commitments, particularly under the WTO’s Most-Favoured-Nation principle.  
- It may also help **reduce costs** for Canadian industries that use ferro-chromium in steel production by lowering import duties.

**Contextual Background:**  
Ferro-chromium is a key raw material in the steel industry. By extending MFN status to this product, Canada ensures that imports from countries adhering to the general tariff framework are treated equally, without discriminatory or preferential treatment.

**Legal Citation:**  
R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.) – the *Customs Tariff* of Canada, specifically Section 23, which governs the granting of MFN treatment to goods.

---

**In Summary:**  
On April 15, 1990, Canada extended MFN tariff benefits to ferro-chromium (classified under tariff items 7202.41.00 and 7202.49.00) originating in countries covered by the General Tariff. This measure ensures equitable treatment of such imports by applying the lowest available tariff rates, consistent with international trade principles and Canada’s tariff regulations.
