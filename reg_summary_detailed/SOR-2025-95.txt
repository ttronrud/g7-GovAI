### 🔹 **2. Purpose of the Surtax**
- To impose a **25% surtax** on certain **steel and aluminum products** imported from the **United States**.
- The surtax is applied **on top of the standard customs duty** determined under sections 47 to 55 of the *Customs Act*.
- This measure is intended to:
  - Support domestic manufacturing and industry,
  - Address concerns about trade imbalances and over-reliance on U.S. steel and aluminum,
  - Align with broader trade policy objectives under **CUSMA** and Canada’s strategic industrial goals.

### 🔹 **3. Scope of Goods Subject to the Surtax**

The following goods are **subject to a 25% surtax** if they originate in the United States:

#### ✅ **(A) Goods classified under tariff items in Schedule 1 or Schedule 2**
- These are primary categories of steel and aluminum products.
- The surtax applies directly to goods falling under these schedules.

#### ✅ **(B) Goods classified under tariff items in Schedule 3**
- These items are **otherwise classifiable** under a tariff heading in **Schedule 1**.
- Example: A product may be technically classified under a Schedule 3 item but is actually a steel product that fits within a Schedule 1 category.
- In such cases, the surtax still applies due to the "otherwise classifiable" rule.

#### ✅ **(C) Goods classified under tariff items in Schedule 4**
- These items are **otherwise classifiable** under a tariff heading in **Schedule 2**.
- This ensures that even if a product is classified under a less specific heading, it still falls under the scope of the surtax if it is essentially a steel or aluminum product.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The term “otherwise classifiable” means that despite the specific classification, the product’s nature and composition align with a product in Schedule 1 or 2.

### 🔹 **4. Definition of "Originating in the United States"**

- For a good to be considered "originating in the United States" for the purposes of this surtax:
  - It must be **eligible to be marked as goods of the United States**.
  - This eligibility is determined according to the **Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (CUSMA Countries) Regulations**.
- This ensures that only goods that meet the **CUSMA origin rules** (e.g., sufficient processing or transformation in the U.S.) are subject to the surtax.

> 📌 This prevents non-U.S. origin goods from being unfairly targeted.

### 🔹 **5. Exemptions from the Surtax**

The following goods are **exempt** from the 25% surtax, regardless of their classification:

#### ❌ (A) Goods under Chapter 98 or 99 of the List of Tariff Provisions:

- This exemption applies to:
  - **Chapter 98**: Goods in transit, spare parts, or temporary entries.
  - **Chapter 99**: Miscellaneous goods, including those for personal use or non-commercial purposes.
