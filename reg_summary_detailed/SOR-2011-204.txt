**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation is a **provincial designation order** issued under the **Criminal Code of Canada**, specifically **section 347.1(3)a**, which allows for the application of criminal interest rate provisions in a province that has enacted its own legislation to regulate and limit the cost of payday loans. The purpose of this order is to **align Saskatchewan’s domestic financial regulation with the federal criminal interest rate framework**, ensuring that high-cost lending practices — particularly those involving excessive interest rates — are subject to federal criminal penalties when applicable.

---

### **Background and Legislative Foundation**

1. **Saskatchewan’s Payday Loan Legislation**  
   Saskatchewan has established its own comprehensive regulatory framework to protect consumers from exploitative lending practices:
   - **The Payday Loans Act, S.S. 2007, c. P-4.3**  
     This Act sets out the legal framework for payday lending, including requirements for transparency, borrower protections, and, crucially, **limits on the total cost of borrowing**.
   - **The Payday Loans Regulations, R.R.S. c. P-4.3 Reg. 1**  
     These regulations provide detailed rules on how interest and fees are calculated and capped, ensuring that the total cost of a payday loan does not exceed a legally defined threshold.

2. **Key Provisions in the Payday Loan Act and Regulations**  
   - Sections 5, 18, and 19 of the *Payday Loans Act* establish:
     - Limits on the maximum interest rate and total cost of borrowing.
     - Requirements for clear disclosure of fees and interest.
     - Provisions for borrower rights and protections (e.g., right to cancel, cooling-off periods).
   - Section 14 of the *Payday Loans Regulations* sets specific numerical caps on the total cost of a loan, which effectively prevents lenders from charging exorbitant rates.

3. **Federal Criminal Code Provisions**  
   - **Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code** criminalizes the **charging of interest rates that exceed the maximum allowed under provincial law** — a mechanism designed to prevent lenders from engaging in predatory lending.
   - The federal government allows provinces to designate themselves for the purposes of this section **if they have enacted appropriate legislation** to regulate interest rates and protect consumers.

### **The Designation Order**

- **Issued by**: The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Industry).
- **Legal Authority**: Subsection **347.1(3)a** of the *Criminal Code*.
- **Effect**: Designates **Saskatchewan** as a province eligible for the application of **section 347.1** of the Criminal Code — specifically, the criminal penalties for charging interest rates that exceed the maximum allowed under provincial law.

### **Conditions for Effectiveness**

The Order **does not take effect immediately**. It only comes into force on the **first day** when **all of the following are in full force and effect**:
1. **Section 5** of the *Payday Loans Act*  
2. **Section 18** of the *Payday Loans Act*  
3. **Section 19** of the *Payday Loans Act*  
4. **Section 14** of the *Payday Loans Regulations*

This ensures that the federal criminal interest rate provisions are only applied when Saskatchewan’s **domestic regulatory framework is fully operational and enforceable**. It acts as a safeguard to prevent the application of criminal penalties before the province has implemented effective consumer protection measures.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order officially came into force on **January 1, 2012** — the first day when all required provisions of the Payday Loans Act and Regulations were in force.
- This date marks the beginning of **federal criminal liability** for lenders in Saskatchewan who charge interest rates exceeding the limits set by provincial law.

### **Key Implications**

1. **Consumer Protection**  
   The designation strengthens consumer safeguards by ensuring that predatory lending practices — such as charging interest rates above the legal cap — are not only financially penalized but also subject to **criminal prosecution**.

2. **Criminal Liability for Lenders**  
   Any individual or entity in Saskatchewan that charges a rate of interest exceeding the maximum allowed under provincial law (as defined in the Payday Loans Act and Regulations) may face **criminal charges** under section 347.1 of the Criminal Code.

3. **Alignment with Federal and Provincial Standards**  
   This Order demonstrates a **cooperative approach** between federal and provincial governments in regulating financial services, where federal criminal law supports provincial consumer protection efforts.

4. **Prevention of Predatory Lending**  
   By linking federal criminal penalties to provincial interest rate caps, the regulation discourages lenders from engaging in exploitative lending, especially in vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income individuals or those with poor credit).

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a significant step in **protecting consumers in Saskatchewan from high-cost, predatory lending**. By designating the province under section 347.1 of the Criminal Code, it ensures that lenders who violate the province’s interest rate caps face **both civil and criminal consequences**. The condition that all key provisions of the Payday Loans Act and Regulations must be in force before the Order takes effect underscores a commitment to **procedural integrity and consumer safety**, ensuring that the criminal penalties are only applied when a robust and enforceable regulatory framework exists.

This designation reflects a model of **cooperative federal-provincial governance** in financial regulation, where consumer protection is advanced through both legislative and criminal means.
