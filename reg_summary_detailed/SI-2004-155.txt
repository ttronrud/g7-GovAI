### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under **subsection 83.05(9) of the Criminal Code of Canada**, constitutes a **continuation and formal affirmation of the status of a list of designated terrorist entities**. It was adopted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Solicitor General of Canada**, and serves to **confirm that certain international terrorist organizations remain designated as terrorist entities** under Canadian law.

## **Background and Legal Basis**

### **1. Historical Context**
- On **July 23, 2004**, the Government of Canada established an initial list of entities believed to be involved in terrorist activities under **subsection 83.05(1)** of the *Criminal Code*.
- Two years later, on **July 23, 2006**, the Government conducted a **review of that list** pursuant to **subsection 83.05(9)**, which empowers the Solicitor General to assess whether there are still **reasonable grounds to believe** that each listed entity:
  - Has **knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated a terrorist activity**, or
  - Is **knowingly acting on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with** an entity that has engaged in such activities.

### **2. Legal Authority**
- The regulation is grounded in **section 83.05** of the *Criminal Code*, which allows for the **designation of entities** as terrorist organizations.
- Subsection **83.05(9)** authorizes the Solicitor General to review and recommend the **continuance of the list** if there remains sufficient evidence of ongoing terrorist activity or links to such activity.

## **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:
- **Formally confirm** the continued terrorist status of a list of 38 international and regional organizations.
- Provide **legal clarity and consistency** in Canada’s counter-terrorism framework.
- Enable Canadian authorities (law enforcement, intelligence, financial institutions, etc.) to:
  - Restrict financial transactions,
  - Freeze assets,
  - Prohibit dealings with these entities,
  - Prevent their use in Canadian operations or infrastructure.

This designation is not a one-time action but a **renewal of the existing list**, based on a thorough legal and intelligence-based assessment conducted two years after the original listing.
