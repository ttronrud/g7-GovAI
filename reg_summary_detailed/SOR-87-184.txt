## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Occupational Safety and Health of Employees on Trains While in Operation**  
*(Canada Labour Code – Part IV – Regulations, effective April 2, 1987)*

> **Note:** This regulation has been **repealed** by *SOR/2015-143, s. 2*, and is no longer in force. It was issued under the authority of the Minister of Labour, on the recommendation of the Canadian Transport Commission, pursuant to sections 82*, 83*, and 106(2)* of the Canada Labour Code.

## 🔍 1. **Purpose and Scope**

### Purpose:
To establish **minimum health and safety standards** for employees working on trains while in operation, particularly focusing on:
- Lighting
- Noise exposure
- Use of elevating devices (elevators, escalators)
- Electrical safety
- Sanitary conditions in on-board accommodations and food preparation areas
- Protection from hazardous substances and vermin

### Scope:
- Applies to **employees on trains while in operation**.
- Applies to **all persons granted access** to trains by an employer (e.g., contractors, trainees, visitors).
- Applies to **non-employees** who perform work to acquire knowledge or experience — treated as if they were employees for the purposes of these regulations.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This regulation is **no longer valid** as of the repeal in 2015. It was superseded by modern occupational health and safety legislation and standards.

## 🚨 3. **Core Provisions and Requirements**

---

### 🔹 **3.1 Lighting Standards**

#### Objective:
Ensure adequate visibility to prevent accidents, especially during visual tasks.

#### Requirements:
- **Minimum lighting levels** are prescribed in **Schedules I, II, and III**.
  - Schedule I & II: Minimum lighting in areas (e.g., corridors, workspaces)
  - Schedule III: Maximum lighting at task positions (to prevent glare and eye strain)

#### Measurement:
- Average lighting is determined by taking **four measurements** at representative points (1 meter above floor).
- Average = total of four readings ÷ 4.

#### Alternatives:
- If full lighting system is not feasible, **portable lanterns** must provide required lighting.

#### Glare Control:
- Reflection glare on **VDT screens** must be limited so employees can:
  - Read all text
  - See all visual content clearly

#### Emergency Lighting:
- Must be available in areas where employees pass during procedures involving risk.
- Must:
  - Operate automatically if possible
  - Provide **at least 10 lx** of average lighting

### 🔹 **3.2 Noise Exposure Standards**

#### Objective:
Protect employees from hearing damage due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels.

#### Key Metrics:
- **A-weighted sound pressure level (dBA)**: Measures human-perceivable noise.
- **Noise exposure level (Lex,8)**: Time-integrated exposure over 24 hours.

#### Exposure Limits:
| Condition | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| In any 24-hour period | No exposure to A-weighted sound pressure level exceeding the limit in **Schedule** (Column I) for more than the duration in **Column II** |
| At any time | No exposure to **more than 87 dBA** |

> ⚠️ Exposure to **84 dBA or more** is considered potentially hazardous.

#### Actions Required:
1. **If exposure ≥ 84 dBA**:
   - Employer must **appoint a qualified person** to investigate.
   - Investigator must:
     - Identify noise sources
     - Assess exposure duration
     - Evaluate current controls
     - Determine if exposure exceeds limits (e.g., 84–87 dBA)
     - Recommend engineering controls or hearing protectors
   - Report must be **signed, dated, and kept for 10 years**.
   - Posted in a **conspicuous place** and provided to affected employees.
   - Provide written information about the risks of high noise exposure.

2. **If feasible**, employers must use **engineering controls** (e.g., sound barriers, enclosure) to reduce noise **before** relying on hearing protectors.

3. **If not feasible**:
   - Employer must **write a report** to:
     - Head of Compliance and Enforcement
     - Workplace committee or health and safety representative
   - Must provide **hearing protectors** (meeting CSA CAN/CSA-Z94.2-02 standards) to employees.

4. **Training**:
   - Employers must develop and implement a **training program** on:
     - Proper fit
     - Care and maintenance
     - Use of hearing protectors

5. **Non-employees** granted access to noisy areas must **use approved hearing protectors**.

6. **Warning Signs**:
   - Must be posted in conspicuous places if noise exceeds 87 dBA.

### 🔹 **3.3 Elevating Devices (Escalators, Elevators)**

#### Safety Rules:
- **No load exceeding design capacity** may be carried.
- **No operation** if any safety device is inoperative.
- **No alteration or interference** with safety devices without authorization.

#### Inspection and Testing:
- Must be conducted by a **qualified person** at:
  1. Before first operation
  2. After any modification
  3. **Every 12 months**
- Record must include:
  - Date and location

- If guarding is not feasible:
  - Equipment must be **insulated** from the employee or the employee from ground.

#### Control Devices:
- Must be:
  - Easily accessible
  - Designed for **quick and safe operation**
  - Located so access paths are **free of obstruction**

#### Lockout/Tagout:
- If only authorized personnel operate switches:
  - Switches must have **locking devices** accessible only to authorized persons.

> ⚠️ If work is not covered by the above, **Part VIII of the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** applies.
