## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Reciprocal Agreement on Social Security between Canada and Australia (1989)**

### 🔹 **Overview**
This is a **bilateral social security agreement** between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of Australia**, signed in Canberra on **July 4, 1988**, and officially **entered into force in Canada on September 1, 1989**. The agreement enables citizens of both countries to access social security benefits from each other under certain conditions, promoting mutual recognition of residency, contributions, and entitlements.

The agreement was established to:
- Strengthen bilateral relations between Canada and Australia.
- Facilitate co-operation in the field of social security.
- Provide equitable treatment for individuals who have lived in or contributed to both countries.

It is governed by **Section 41 of the Old Age Security Act (O-9, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985)**, which allows the Governor in Council to declare agreements entered under Section 40 (social security cooperation) into force, and is further regulated by **Section 42**, which requires parliamentary review and public notice.

### 3. **Eligibility and Residency Rules**

#### A. **Who Is Covered?**
The agreement applies to:
- Individuals who were or are **Australian residents**  
- Individuals who **reside or have resided in Canada** (under OAS or CPP)  
- Spouses, dependents, or survivors of such individuals  

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Paragraph 1 does **not apply** to claims for **wives’ pensions or carer’s pensions** if the claimant has **never been an Australian resident**.

#### B. **Deemed Residency (Key Provision)**
Under **Article 1, Paragraph 1**, a person may be **deemed to be an Australian resident** for the purposes of claiming benefits if:
- They were an Australian resident or residing in Canada or a third country with an existing social security agreement;
- And they are **in Australia, Canada, or that third country** on the date they lodge a claim.

> This allows individuals to claim benefits despite not having been formally resident in Australia.

#### C. **Canadian Creditable Periods as Equivalent to Australian Residency**
If a person:
- Has lived in Australia for **less than** the required period to qualify under Australian law;
- But has accumulated a **Canadian creditable period** (under OAS or CPP) that, when **added to** their Australian residence, meets the minimum requirement;

👉 Then their **Canadian creditable period is deemed to be a period of Australian residency** for claiming benefits.

##### Specific Rules:
- For **invalid pensions or widow’s pensions**, only **CPP creditable periods** count.
- For **widow’s pensions**, if a spouse had a Canadian creditable period, the person may be deemed to have accumulated such a period — **but overlapping periods are counted only once**.
- If the person has **two or more separate Canadian creditable periods** totaling more than the minimum required, they are **deemed to have one continuous period**.
- If a **Canadian creditable period and Australian residence coincide**, it is counted **only once** (as either Australian or Canadian, not both).

> 🔍 **Minimum Residency Requirements**:
- For **age, invalid, or wives’ pensions** (excluding invalid): **1 year**, with **at least 6 months continuous**.
- For **invalid pensions**: **2 years**, with **at least 6 months continuous**.

### 4. **Benefit Rates and Income Assessment**

#### A. **Rate of Benefit (Outside Australia)**
When a person receives an Australian benefit **outside Australia**, the rate is calculated as follows:

1. **Disregard income**:
   - Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) under OAS  
   - Spouse’s allowance equivalent to GIS  
   - Other Canadian federal/provincial/territorial payments (mutually agreed upon)

2. **Assess income**:
   - Only a **proportion** of Canadian benefits is counted.
   - Formula:  
     `(Number of whole months in Australia + 1) × (Amount of Canadian benefit) ÷ 300`

> This ensures that Canadian benefits are not overcounted in income assessments.

#### B. **Rate of Benefit (In Australia)**
When a person receives an Australian benefit **in Australia**, the rate is determined by Australian law, **but**:
- Canadian benefits are **disregarded** in income assessment.
- The amount of the Canadian benefit is **deducted** from the Australian benefit rate.

> ✅ **If the resulting rate is lower than it would have been if the person were outside Australia**, the rate is **increased** to match the "outside Australia" rate.

#### C. **Comparison of Rates**
A comparison is made:
- At the **first pension payment date after claim submission**
- On **each anniversary** of that date (while the person receives the benefit)

> The comparison uses the **number of months of residence in Australia** at the time of the comparison.

#### D. **Apportionment of Canadian Benefits**
If both a person and their spouse are entitled to Canadian benefits:
- The total Canadian benefits are **split equally**.
- This amount is **excluded from income** when assessing Australian benefits.

### 5. **Special Provisions**

#### A. **Pensions for People Who Were Residents on May 8, 1985**

#### B. **Publication of Mutual Payments**
- As soon as practicable after mutual agreement, the Australian Minister must publish in the *Commonwealth of Australia Gazette* a notice listing the **Canadian payments** (e.g., GIS, spouse’s allowance) that will be disregarded in income assessments.

#### C. **Deemed Receipt of Pensions**
- A person who receives a **wife’s pension or carer’s pension** because their **spouse receives an Australian benefit under this agreement** is **deemed to receive that pension under the agreement**.

#### D. **Widow’s Claim Rules**
- When a widow files a claim, **only her last-deceased spouse** (husband or man meeting de facto conditions) is considered — not any prior spouses.
