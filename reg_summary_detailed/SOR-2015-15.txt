### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This statutory instrument establishes the specific date that will serve as the "day" referenced in **Section 143** of the *Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11* (the "Act"). Section 143 of the Act likely pertains to a time-bound provision related to economic policy implementation, such as the commencement of certain measures, the deadline for compliance, or the effective date of specific actions taken under the economic plan.

By fixing a specific date, this Order ensures legal clarity and certainty regarding when the provisions of Section 143 are to take effect, which is essential for administrative, fiscal, or regulatory planning.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Fixed Date:**  
   The day designated under Section 143 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11 is officially set as **December 1, 2018**.

2. **Effective Date of the Order:**  
   The Order comes into force on:
   - The **first day** on which **Sections 111, 139, and 140** of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11 are all in force; **OR**
   - If the Order is registered (officially published and recognized) **after** that day, then it comes into force on the **day of registration**.

   This provision ensures that the Order only takes effect when the relevant enabling provisions of the Act are already operational, thereby preventing premature or inconsistent application.

3. **Note on Enforcement and Legal Status:**  
   The Order is noted to have come into force on **February 11, 2015**, as confirmed by subsequent statutory instruments SI/2015-5 and SI/2015-6. This indicates that despite being issued in 2014, the Order was formally activated in early 2015 due to the timing of its registration and the conditions for its effective date.

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- **Clarity and Predictability:** By fixing December 1, 2018, as the reference date, the regulation provides a clear, non-negotiable benchmark for stakeholders (e.g., government agencies, businesses, or regulatory bodies) who must comply with or act upon the provisions of Section 143.
  
- **Conditional Activation:** The effective date of the Order is not arbitrary—it is tied to the concurrent enforcement of three other sections (111, 139, and 140) of the Act. This ensures that the Order only operates within a legally coherent and fully activated framework, reducing legal risk and potential conflicts.

- **Administrative Procedure:** The Governor General in Council acts on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, reflecting a standard administrative process in Canadian law where executive decisions are made with ministerial advice and formalized through statutory instruments.

### **Contextual Background**

The *Economic Action Plan 2014 Act* was likely introduced to implement economic reforms or fiscal measures aimed at stabilizing or improving the national economy. Section 143 may have been designed to set a deadline for the implementation of certain policy actions, such as changes to labor standards, tax incentives, or public spending initiatives.

Fixing December 1, 2018, as the reference day may have been intended to align with a broader economic policy timeline, such as a fiscal review cycle, a budget cycle, or a targeted reform period.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **statutory instrument** that provides a definitive and legally binding date for the operation of Section 143 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11. It ensures that all relevant parties understand when the provisions of that section are to be applied. The Order is effective only when the necessary enabling provisions of the Act are active, and it formally came into force on February 11, 2015, following registration. While the date referenced (December 1, 2018) may be symbolic or operational, its legal significance lies in its role as a critical milestone in the implementation of economic policy under the Act.

This instrument exemplifies how Canadian governments use legislative instruments to provide precise, enforceable timelines for economic and regulatory actions.
