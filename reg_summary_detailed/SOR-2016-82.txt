**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Nooksack Dace (Rhinichthys cataractae ssp.) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is the federal legislation in Canada responsible for protecting wildlife species at risk and promoting their recovery. The full name of the Act is *Species at Risk Act*, S.C. 2002, c. 29.

The Nooksack dace (*Rhinichthys cataractae ssp.*) is a small freshwater fish species native to specific streams in British Columbia and Washington State, Canada. It is classified as **endangered** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA, meaning it is at high risk of extinction in the wild.

**2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **designate and legally define the critical habitat** of the Nooksack dace. Critical habitat refers to the specific areas that are essential for the survival and recovery of a listed species, including places where the species currently lives and where it may need to live in the future.

This designation is a key step in the recovery process under SARA, as it triggers federal protection measures to prevent or mitigate harm to those areas.

**3. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*. These provisions allow the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to:

- Identify and designate critical habitat for a listed species;
- Ensure that the designated critical habitat is not located in areas that are exempt from protection under the Act (specifically, areas referred to in subsection 58(2)).

Importantly, **subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Nooksack dace. This means that once designated, the critical habitat is legally protected and any actions that could result in harm to it must be assessed and, where necessary, mitigated.

---

**4. Basis for Designation**

The critical habitat for the Nooksack dace was previously identified in the **recovery strategy** for the species. This recovery strategy was formally included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is the official database maintained by the Government of Canada to provide public access to information about species at risk and their recovery plans.

This Order formalizes and legally enforces the critical habitat identified in that recovery strategy, ensuring that the specific geographic areas essential for the dace’s survival are now legally recognized and protected.

---

**5. Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Designation of Critical Habitat**: The Order specifies the exact geographic areas (typically streams, river reaches, or riparian zones) that constitute the critical habitat for the Nooksack dace. These areas are defined based on ecological requirements such as water quality, flow, substrate composition, and temperature — all of which are essential for the dace’s life cycle.
  
- **Exclusion from Exempt Areas**: The Order explicitly states that **no portion** of the designated critical habitat lies in a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)** of SARA. This subsection typically refers to areas that are not subject to critical habitat protection due to being on private land, in areas where development is already occurring, or in areas where protection would not be practical or effective. The absence of such exemptions ensures that the full extent of the critical habitat is protected.

- **Legal Effect**: Once registered, the Order becomes legally binding. It triggers obligations under SARA for federal government departments and agencies to avoid or minimize harm to the designated critical habitat in their projects or activities.

---

**6. Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, making it effective immediately upon publication.
- It is subject to review and potential amendment or repeal. In this case, the Order was **repealed by SOR/2020-171, section 1**, which indicates that the designation is no longer in force as of the date of that amendment (likely in 2020 or later).

> ⚠️ **Note on Repeal**: This is a critical point. Although the Order was originally issued in 2016, it has since been **repealed** by the *Statutory Instruments (Repeal) Regulation*, SOR/2020-171, section 1. This means that the legal designation of critical habitat for the Nooksack dace under this specific Order is **no longer valid or enforceable**.

---

**7. Implications and Significance**

- **Prior Significance**: At the time of issuance (April 21, 2016), the Order was a significant step in protecting a rare and vulnerable fish species by formally recognizing its essential habitat.
- **Current Status**: Due to the repeal, the critical habitat designation is no longer legally active. This may reflect changes in species status, updated recovery strategies, or policy shifts in federal wildlife protection priorities.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Nooksack Dace (Rhinichthys cataractae ssp.) Order* was a formal legal instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* designed to protect the essential habitat of an endangered fish species. It was based on scientific data from the recovery strategy and legally recognized the specific areas necessary for the species’ survival. However, the Order has been **repealed** by regulation SOR/2020-171, section 1, meaning it is **no longer in effect**. As such, the critical habitat designation for the Nooksack dace under this Order is **currently inactive**, and any future protection efforts would need to be based on updated recovery strategies or new designations.

---

**Recommendation for Stakeholders**

- Environmental organizations, Indigenous communities, and government agencies should monitor updated recovery strategies and any new designations for the Nooksack dace.
- The repeal highlights the importance of ongoing scientific review and policy adaptation in species conservation efforts.
