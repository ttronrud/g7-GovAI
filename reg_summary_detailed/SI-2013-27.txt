### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, S.C. 2002, c. 29, by **His Excellency the Governor in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, outlines the decision **not to add three species to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** in Schedule 1 to SARA. The decision is based on a comprehensive assessment of scientific evidence, ecological status, threats, socio-economic impacts, and existing management frameworks.

The regulation also **approves the inclusion of a public statement** in the registry established under **Section 120 of SARA**, explaining the rationale for each decision. Below is a detailed breakdown of the decisions and their supporting reasoning for each species.

## **1. Beluga Whale (Delphinapterus leucas) – Eastern High Arctic and Baffin Bay Population**

### **Key Facts:**
- This population winters in the **Jones Sound – North Water polynya** region of the Eastern Arctic.
- It is **not currently subject to exploitation or anthropogenic threats within Canadian waters**.
- There is **no evidence of habitat degradation or direct human-caused harm** in Canadian waters.
- **Possible overexploitation outside Canadian waters** is a concern, but not within Canadian jurisdiction.

### **COSEWIC Assessment (2004):**
- Classified as **"Species of Special Concern"** due to potential threats, though no direct threats were identified in Canadian waters.

### **Reasons for Not Listing:**
1. **No Threats in Canadian Waters:**  
   - The population is **lightly harvested** (approximately 100 belugas per year in Canadian waters).
   - There is **no documented evidence** of bycatch, pollution, or habitat loss affecting this population within Canadian waters.

2. **Limited Benefits of Listing:**  
   - A listing as "Special Concern" would require the development of a **SARA management plan**.
   - This plan would have **minimal impact** because:
     - It cannot address **harvesting or threats outside Canada**.
     - The current level of harvest (100 per year) would remain unchanged.
     - No new restrictions or conservation measures would be imposed in Canadian waters.

3. **No Impact on Stakeholders:**  
   - Listing would **not affect Inuit communities**, general public, industry, or government operations.
   - The **current regulatory framework** (Marine Mammal Regulations under the Fisheries Act) already governs harvesting.

4. **International Context and Health of the Population:**  
   - The **Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on Narwhal and Beluga (2009)** concluded that the Canadian population is **healthy**.
   - Population modeling of the Greenland portion (after quota reductions post-2004) suggests a **reversal of previous declines**, indicating positive trends.

5. **Existing Management Frameworks:**  
   - Harvesting and conservation are managed under:
     - The **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement**.
     - The **Nunavut Wildlife Management Board**, which operates under principles of conservation and sustainable use.
   - These systems already provide effective governance and protection.

6. **Future Monitoring:**  
   - Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) will continue to collaborate with **international partners** to improve stock assessments and sustainable hunt management.
   - The **COSEWIC status review** will be updated periodically as new data becomes available.

### **Conclusion:**
The Beluga Whale population in the Eastern High Arctic and Baffin Bay region is **not at risk within Canadian waters**, and listing it under SARA would provide **no meaningful conservation benefit** and would impose **unnecessary administrative and economic costs** without addressing the real threats (which occur outside Canada).

## **2. Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) – Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence Population**

### **Key Facts:**
- This population **spawns at a single location** in the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.
- Historically important for commercial and recreational fisheries.
- Decline attributed to:
  - Climate change
  - Past overfishing
  - Illegal fishing
  - Bycatch in Gaspereau and Rainbow Smelt fisheries
  - Habitat alteration
  - Contaminants

### **COSEWIC Assessment (2004):**
- Classified as **"Threatened"** due to its small distribution area and high vulnerability — despite resilience shown in recent spawner abundance estimates.

### **Reasons for Not Listing:**
1. **Socio-Economic Impacts of Listing:**  
   - Listing as "Threatened" would trigger **automatic prohibitions** under Sections 32 and 33 of SARA.
   - This would lead to:
     - Closure of **commercial, recreational, and Aboriginal food, social, and ceremonial fisheries**.
     - Estimated annual losses of **$134,000 to $671,000** in industry profits.
     - Negative impacts on **fish processing sectors**, coastal communities, and regional economies.

2. **Recovery Already in Progress:**  
   - All directed fisheries for Striped Bass have been closed since **1996**.
   - All recreational and Aboriginal fisheries closed in **2000**.
   - **Live release of bycatch** is mandatory.
   - Scientific assessments confirm that the population is **recovering under current management**.

3. **Feasibility of Recovery Without Listing:**  
   - Recovery is **feasible** if no additional mortality occurs beyond current levels.
   - Existing tools under the **Fisheries Act** are sufficient to support recovery.

4. **Effective Mitigation Measures Already in Place:**  
   - DFO has implemented several targeted actions to reduce mortality:
     - **Increased enforcement patrols** in rivers (especially during spawning season).
     - **Annual area closure** of angling on the Northwest Miramichi River (May 1 – June 30).
     - **Delay of Rainbow Smelt fishery opening** to November 1.
     - **Changes to gear, time, or location rules** for Aboriginal gillnet activities.
     - **Training programs** for harvesters on proper handling and release of Striped Bass.
     - **Scientific research** to better understand spatial and temporal distribution and bycatch levels.

5. **Proportionate and Targeted Management:**  
   - New management measures will be introduced under the **Fisheries Act** in a way that is **proportional to the actual risks** (mainly illegal fishing and bycatch).
   - These measures will:
     - Reduce interactions with fishing gear.
     - Improve survival rates of caught fish.
     - Enhance conservation efforts.
     - Support long-term recovery without unduly affecting Aboriginal communities or provincial stakeholders.

6. **No Substantial Biological Benefit from Listing:**  
   - A listing would not lead to a **different biological outcome** than what is already being achieved through current, legally enforceable measures.

### **Conclusion:**
The Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence population of Striped Bass is **recovering successfully** under existing, effective management. Listing it as "Threatened" would **cause significant socio-economic harm** without improving its long-term survival. The current measures under the Fisheries Act are sufficient and are already producing positive results.

## **3. Cusk (Brosme brosme)**

### **Key Facts:**
- Cusk is primarily caught as **bycatch** in groundfish (cod, haddock, halibut) longline and trawl fisheries.
- Also caught in lobster and trap fisheries.
- No practical method exists to exclude Cusk from fishing gear.
- No known directed fishery for Cusk in Canada.
- Bycatch levels historically high (up to 900 tonnes/year), now reduced to **~650 tonnes/year**.

### **COSEWIC Assessment (2003 and 2006):**
- Classified as **"Threatened"** due to mortality from fishing (direct and incidental).

### **Reasons for Not Listing:**
1. **Scientific Uncertainty in Abundance Trends:**  
   - Trawl surveys (used to assess abundance) **grossly underestimate** Cusk populations because:
     - Cusk are not easily caught in otter trawls.
     - Surveys do not sample Cusk in preferred habitats or depths.
   - Data from **Halibut Longline Surveys** and **commercial landings** (2007 RPA) suggest Cusk are still **common and widespread**, with **no clear long-term decline** since the mid-1990s.

2. **Economic Costs of Listing:**  
   - If listed with a **bycatch cap of 370 tonnes/year** (instead of current 650 tonnes), annual losses to the fishing industry would be **$10.4 million**.
   - Over a 15-year period, the **present value of these costs** is estimated at:
     - **$123.9 million** (at 3% discount rate)
     - **$88.8 million** (at 8% discount rate)
   - These costs would be borne by producers, including commercial and Aboriginal fishers.

3. **Existing Management Measures (Post-2007):**  
   - DFO has already reduced the bycatch cap to **650 tonnes/year**.
   - Implemented additional measures to improve monitoring and data collection:
     - **Improved bycatch data analysis** to assess conservation risks.
     - **Amended logbooks** to include a column for **discards** (to track unreported bycatch).
     - **Development of
