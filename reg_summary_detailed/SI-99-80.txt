### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation grants a *tax remission* (i.e., a reduction or forgiveness of tax liability) to the **Executive Director of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC)**. The remission is designed to recognize and compensate for the fact that the Executive Director, as a representative of an international environmental body, is entitled to certain diplomatic immunities and exemptions under international law — specifically, the *Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations* — which are not fully mirrored in Canadian tax law.

The remission is intended to align the tax treatment of the Executive Director with the international norms that apply to diplomatic agents, thereby ensuring fairness and consistency with Canada’s obligations under international agreements.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Commission**  
   Refers to the *Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC)*, established under Article 8(1) of the *North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC)*, which was signed on September 14, 1993, and came into force on January 1, 1994. The CEC is a trilateral environmental body involving Canada, the United States, and Mexico, aimed at promoting environmental protection and cooperation among the three nations.

2. **Tax**  
   Refers to the excise tax imposed under *Part IX of the Excise Tax Act*. This tax is typically levied on certain goods and services, and in this context, it applies to the Executive Director of the CEC.

### **Core Provision: Tax Remission**

The regulation provides for a **remission of excise tax** to the Executive Director of the CEC, calculated as follows:

> The remission is equal to the amount by which:
> - The actual tax paid by the Executive Director **during the period from September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997**,  
> **exceeds**  
> - The tax that would have been payable *if* the Executive Director had been granted exemptions comparable to those provided under the *Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Agents*.

---

### **Explanation of the Tax Calculation**

- **Actual Tax Paid:** The Executive Director paid excise tax during the specified period (September 4, 1994 – September 22, 1997).
- **Hypothetical Tax Liability (with exemptions):** If the Executive Director had been treated as a diplomatic agent under the *Vienna Convention*, they would be entitled to certain tax exemptions — such as exemption from excise taxes on personal and official items — similar to those granted to diplomatic personnel in other countries.
- **Remission Amount:** The difference between what was actually paid and what would have been paid *under diplomatic exemption rules* is refunded or remitted to the Executive Director.

This effectively means that the government is refunding the tax that was overpaid due to the absence of diplomatic immunity protections under Canadian tax law.

### **Legal and Policy Rationale**

1. **International Obligations:**  
   The *Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations* (1961) grants diplomatic agents immunity from certain domestic laws, including taxation, in order to protect their ability to perform international duties without interference. While Canada is a signatory to the Convention, the *excise tax* is not automatically exempted for all diplomatic personnel under domestic law.

2. **Fairness and Equity:**  
   By granting this remission, the government acknowledges that the Executive Director of the CEC is performing a role akin to a diplomatic function — representing Canada in international environmental cooperation — and thus should be treated with equivalent tax relief.

3. **Public Interest:**  
   The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, determines that this remission serves the public interest by:
   - Recognizing the international nature of the CEC’s mandate,
   - Supporting effective environmental cooperation among Canada, the U.S., and Mexico,
   - Ensuring that the CEC can operate efficiently without undue financial burdens on its leadership.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Time Period:** The remission applies only to the tax paid between **September 4, 1994, and September 22, 1997**. This specific window may reflect the period during which the CEC was operational or when the Executive Director was actively serving in a capacity that required tax treatment.
- **Applicability:** The remission is limited to the **Executive Director** of the CEC, not to other members or staff.
- **No Broad Exemption:** This is not a general exemption for all CEC employees or for future periods. It is a targeted, one-time remission based on the tax difference during that period.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted and principled intervention in tax policy to ensure that the Executive Director of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation receives tax treatment consistent with international diplomatic standards. It reflects Canada’s commitment to international environmental cooperation and the principle of treating international representatives fairly and equitably under the law.

By remitting the excess tax paid during a defined period, the government acknowledges the unique role of the Executive Director and supports the effective functioning of the CEC — a key institution in North American environmental policy.

---

**In short:**  
The regulation grants a tax refund to the Executive Director of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation for the period 1994–1997, equal to the difference between the tax actually paid and the tax that would have been payable if the Executive Director had been granted diplomatic exemptions under the Vienna Convention. This action supports international cooperation and recognizes the diplomatic nature of the CEC’s work.
