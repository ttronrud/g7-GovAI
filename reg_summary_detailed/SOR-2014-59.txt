It appears that you've provided a request for a detailed summary of a regulation, but no specific regulation has been included in your message. Could you please provide the actual text or reference (e.g., title, number, or source) of the regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the regulation, I will offer a comprehensive, clear, and structured summary covering its purpose, key provisions, applicable entities, enforcement mechanisms, and any relevant implications or interpretations.
