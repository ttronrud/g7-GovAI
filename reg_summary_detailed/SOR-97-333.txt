#### **3. Methods of Conducting a Verification of Origin**

An officer may verify origin through **one or more of the following methods**:

1. **On-site Verification Visit**  
   - Conducted at the premises of:
     - An **exporter or producer** of the goods, or  
     - A **producer or supplier** of a material used in the production of the goods.

2. **Review of Completed Questionnaires**  
   - The exporter or producer may complete and submit a verification questionnaire.

3. **Review of Written Responses**  
   - A response to a verification letter sent to the exporter or producer.

4. **Review of Other Available Information**  
   - Any other information provided by the relevant party (e.g., invoices, cost records, production logs).

> **Note**: A verification visit is not mandatory; it is one of several tools available to assess origin claims.

---

#### **4. Requirements for a Verification Visit**

To conduct a verification visit, the following conditions must be met:

- The officer must send a **written notice** to:
  - The **person whose premises** are being visited,
  - The **customs administration** of the country where the visit occurs (Canada, a NAFTA country, or Chile),
  - **If requested**, the **embassy in Canada** of Chile or the NAFTA country.

- The **person whose premises are subject to the visit must consent** to the visit.

> **Notice Requirements** (must be included in the written notice):
> - Identity of the customs administration sending the notice  
> - Name of the person whose premises are involved  
> - Date and place of the visit  
> - Object and scope of the visit (specific reference to goods or materials)  
> - Name and title of the officer  
> - Legal authority for the visit  

---

#### **5. Postponement of Verification Visits**

- Any customs administration may **postpone** a verification visit if it receives the notice within **15 days**.
- The postponement period:
  - Cannot exceed **60 days** from the date of notice,
  - May be extended for a **longer period** if agreed upon by both:
    - The **customs administration of Canada** and
    - The **customs administration of Chile or the NAFTA country** involved.

---

#### **6. Observers During Verification Visits**

- A person receiving a notice may **designate two observers** to be present during the visit.
- Observers:
  - May **only observe** and **cannot participate** in the verification process.
  - Must be **identified to the officer** conducting the visit.

---

#### **7. Compliance with GAAP for Cost Recording**

- If an officer determines during a verification that a producer has **failed to record production costs in accordance with GAAP** in the country where the goods are produced:
  - The officer must send a **written notice** to the producer.
  - The producer must **record costs in accordance with GAAP within 60 days** of receiving the notice.

> This ensures that cost data used to determine origin is reliable and consistent with accounting standards in the relevant jurisdiction.

---

#### **8. Content and Timeliness of Verification Letters/Questionnaires**

- A verification letter or questionnaire must include:
  - Identity of the customs administration sending it
  - Description of the goods or materials involved
  - A **minimum response period of 30 days** from the date of sending (except under specific circumstances)

> **Exception – Motor Vehicle Production**  
> If a producer of a motor vehicle has elected to **average regional value content over its fiscal year**, the officer may request:
> - A cost submission reflecting actual production costs
> - Due no later than the **later of**:
>   - 180 days after the end of the producer’s fiscal year, **or**
>   - 60 days after the verification letter is sent

---

#### **9. Consequences of Non-Response to Verification Requests**

- If a person **fails to respond** to a verification letter or complete and return a verification questionnaire within the specified period:
  - The officer must send a **subsequent verification letter or questionnaire**.

> This ensures that origin claims are thoroughly investigated and not left unverified due to lack of response.

---

#### **10. Grounds for Denying or Withdrawing Preferential Tariff Treatment**

Preferential tariff treatment under NAFTA or CCFTA **may be denied or withdrawn** if the exporter or producer:

1. **Does not consent** to a verification visit within **30 days** of receiving the notice.
2. **Fails to maintain required records** under applicable laws in the country where the goods are produced.
3. **Fails to provide access** to those records when requested.
4. **Does not respond** to a **subsequent verification letter or questionnaire** within **30 days** of receiving it.

> This creates a clear enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with origin rules.

---

#### **11. Re-determination of Origin and Notification**

- When an officer determines that goods are **not eligible** for preferential tariff treatment:
  - A **written notice** must be sent to the exporter or producer.
- The notice must include:
  - The **date after which** preferential treatment may be denied or withdrawn,
  - The **period during which** the exporter or producer may submit **written comments or additional information**.

> **Important Timing Rule**:  
> A re-determination of origin **cannot occur earlier than 30 days** after the notice is received:
> - If the notice is sent under paragraph 18(a), or  
> - If sent under paragraph 18(b).

> This provides a **due process period** for exporters to respond and defend their origin claim.

---

#### **12. Methods of Sending Notices and Documents**

- Verification letters, questionnaires, and notices may be sent by **any method** that produces a **confirmation of receipt**.
- Subsequent notices or letters may be sent:
  - By **any method producing confirmation of receipt**, if requested by the customs administration of Chile or a NAFTA country,
  - Otherwise, by **any method**.

> This flexibility ensures that communications are effective and legally valid, regardless of delivery method.

---

#### **13. Effective Date**

- **Effective Date**: July 5, 1997 (as noted in SI/97-86)

> The regulations were issued to align with the implementation of the CCFTA and NAFTA, ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance in the verification of goods’ origin.

---

#### **14. Repeal Note**

- The regulations contain a **[Repeal]** clause, indicating that they are not intended to replace or amend other existing regulations but rather to **implement specific verification procedures** under the free trade agreements.
