**Detailed Summary of the Territorial Lands Act Exclusion Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Territorial Lands Act Exclusion Order* and may be cited by that name. It serves as a specific exemption or exclusion provision within the broader framework of the *Territorial Lands Act*, primarily addressing the ownership and investment activities of Canadian government officers and employees in relation to territorial land.

**2. Scope of the Exclusion (Permitted Shareholding)**  
Under subsection (1), an officer or employee of or under the Government of Canada **may** be a shareholder in a corporation that purchases, acquires, or holds **territorial land or any interest therein**, **provided** the following conditions are met:

- The officer or employee holds shares in a **class of capital stock** of the corporation that is **listed on a prescribed stock exchange in Canada**.  
  → This means the shares must be publicly traded on a recognized Canadian stock exchange (e.g., Toronto Stock Exchange, TSX). The specific exchanges are "prescribed" under the Income Tax Act, which implies that only those exchanges designated by the federal government or relevant tax legislation are eligible.

- The **sole interest** of the officer or employee in the corporation is as a **holder of such shares**.  
  → This means the individual must not have any other form of interest in the corporation, such as a directorship, management role, voting control, or active involvement in corporate operations. The position is strictly limited to passive shareholding.

This provision creates a **permissible exception** to potential conflicts of interest, allowing certain public officials to invest in corporations involved in territorial land transactions—**as long as the investment is passive and compliant with the listed stock exchange requirement**.

**3. Prohibitions and Restrictions (Exclusions from Permissibility)**  
Despite the allowance in subsection (1), **nothing in that provision shall be construed as authorizing** an officer or employee to hold a share interest in a corporation if such a holding would result in:

- **Direct or indirect benefit or interest** derived from **government contracts** over which the officer or employee has **influence or decision-making power**.  
  → For example, if an officer is involved in awarding land development contracts or managing public procurement, holding a stake in a corporation that would benefit from such contracts would be prohibited. This prevents situations where personal financial gain could influence public decisions.

- A **conflict with public duties**.  
  → This is a broad and essential safeguard. Even if no direct contract benefit is involved, any situation where the officer’s private interest could compromise their impartiality, integrity, or public trust is excluded. This includes situations where the officer’s position might be perceived as biased or where transparency or accountability would be undermined.

This clause ensures that the exclusion does not create a loophole for self-dealing or conflicts of interest, particularly in sensitive areas involving public land and government procurement.

**4. Applicability of the Order**  
The Order applies to **shares described in subsection 2(1)** (presumably referring to shares that meet the criteria of being listed on a prescribed Canadian stock exchange) **whether acquired before or after August 13, 1975**.  
→ This means the rule is **retrospective** in nature. It applies to any shareholding that meets the conditions, regardless of when the shares were originally acquired. This provides consistency and clarity in enforcement across time periods.

**5. Key Implications and Purpose**  
- **Purpose**: The Order aims to balance the need for public officials to have legitimate financial interests (e.g., through passive investments) with the imperative to maintain **integrity, transparency, and public trust** in government operations involving territorial land.  
- **Integrity Protection**: By restricting holdings that could lead to conflicts of interest or benefit from government decisions, the regulation protects against misuse of public office.  
- **Investor Access**: It allows eligible officers and employees to participate in public market investments in land-related corporations, provided the investment is passive and transparent.  
- **Regulatory Clarity**: The rule is clearly defined, with specific thresholds (listed shares, passive interest, no conflict), making it easier to enforce and interpret.

---

**6. Limitations and Caveats**  
- The regulation does **not** allow for active involvement in corporate management or decision-making.  
- The officer or employee must not derive any benefit from government contracts—this includes both direct financial gains and indirect advantages (e.g., preferential treatment, access to information).  
- The "prescribed stock exchange" is defined under the *Income Tax Act*, meaning the list is legally binding and subject to change only through legislative or regulatory update.  
- The rule does not extend to land held by the government itself, nor does it apply to private land transactions outside of the territorial land framework.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Territorial Lands Act Exclusion Order* establishes a **limited, conditional exception** allowing certain Canadian government officers and employees to hold passive shares in corporations that own or hold territorial land—**only if** the shares are listed on a prescribed Canadian stock exchange and the individual has no other interest in the corporation that could create a conflict of interest. It is designed to promote financial participation without compromising public accountability. However, it strictly prohibits any situation where personal financial gain could arise from government contracts or where public duties are compromised. The rule applies retroactively, ensuring consistency in its application from 1975 onward.  

This regulation reflects a careful balance between individual rights and public service integrity in the context of land governance.
