**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Company Pay Out of Excess Revenue for the Movement of Grain Regulations***

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Railway Company Pay Out of Excess Revenue for the Movement of Grain Regulations* were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **paragraph 152(c)a of the Canada Transportation Act** (CTA). This provision grants the Minister the authority to make regulations related to the management of railway revenue in the grain transport sector.

These regulations establish a framework for **recovering excess grain transportation revenue** from prescribed railway companies when their revenues exceed a set maximum entitlement for a given crop year. The purpose is to ensure equitable distribution of railway revenue, with a portion of any surplus being directed toward grain research and development.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Transportation Act*, which provides the legal foundation for this regulation.
- **Agency**: The *Canadian Transportation Agency* (CTA), which continues to administer and enforce these rules under subsection 7(1) of the CTA.
- **Western Grains Research Foundation (WGRF)**: A designated entity established under Order in Council P.C. 1999-1650 (September 29, 1999), under the *Canadian Wheat Board Act*. It is responsible for receiving the excess revenue and funds research activities related to grain production and transport efficiency.
- **Average bank rate**: This definition has been **repealed** by *SOR/2004-254, s. 15* and is no longer in effect.

### **Core Provision: Penalty on Excess Grain Revenue**

If a **prescribed railway company** (a railway company subject to the CTA’s grain transport revenue rules) earns more in grain transportation revenue during a crop year than its **maximum revenue entitlement**, the company must pay out the excess revenue, plus a penalty, as follows:

| Excess Amount | Penalty |
|--------------|---------|
| **1% or less** of the maximum revenue entitlement | **5% of the excess amount** |
| **More than 1%** of the maximum revenue entitlement | **15% of the excess amount** |

> *Note: The penalty is applied only when the excess exceeds the company’s maximum entitlement, and it is calculated as a percentage of the excess, not of the total revenue.*

### **Process for Determining and Enforcing the Payment**

1. **Determination by the Agency**:
   - The Canadian Transportation Agency (Agency) must determine whether a prescribed railway company’s grain transportation revenue for a crop year exceeds its maximum revenue entitlement as calculated under **subsection 151(1) of the CTA**.

2. **Decision or Order**:
   - If the Agency finds an excess, it must issue a **decision or order** requiring the company to pay the excess revenue and the applicable penalty.

3. **Timing of Decision**:
   - The decision or order must be sent to the railway company **no later than 10 days** after the Agency completes its determination of both the company’s actual grain revenues and its maximum revenue entitlement.

---

### **Payment Requirements**

- The **excess amount plus the penalty** must be paid to the **Western Grains Research Foundation**.
- Payment must be made in one of the following forms:
  - Certified cheque  
  - Money order  
  - Bank draft  
- The company must **notify the Agency in writing** at the time of payment, specifying:
  - The total amount paid
  - The date of payment

---

### **Deadline for Payment**

- The payment must be made **no later than 30 days** after the company receives the decision or order from the Agency.

> *Note: This deadline is critical to ensure timely compliance and prevent delays in funding research initiatives.*

---

### **Repeal and Amendments**

- The definition of **"average bank rate"** has been **repealed** by *SOR/2004-254, s. 15*.
- The provision related to the "average bank rate" was likely intended to support financial calculations but is no longer relevant.
- The regulation itself remains active and in force, despite the repeal of a minor component.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette* (official publication of federal regulations).

---

### **Purpose and Impact**

This regulation serves several key objectives:

1. **Revenue Equity**: Ensures that railway companies do not profit excessively from grain transport, which could distort market dynamics or create inequities among grain producers.

2. **Funding for Research**: Directs surplus revenue to the **Western Grains Research Foundation**, which supports critical agricultural research in areas such as:
   - Grain handling
   - Storage efficiency
   - Transport logistics
   - Environmental sustainability
   - Crop yield improvements

3. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   - Clear procedures for determining excess revenue
   - Timely decisions and payment requirements
   - Written notification to the Agency

4. **Stability in the Grain Transport System**:
   - By limiting excessive profits and channeling surplus into research, the regulation helps maintain long-term stability and innovation in the grain transportation sector.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- Excess grain transport revenue is **not retained** by the railway company.
- A **penalty** is applied based on the size of the excess (5% for small excesses, 15% for larger ones).
- The **Western Grains Research Foundation** is the designated recipient of all payments.
- The process is **transparent, time-bound, and accountable**, with clear roles for both the Agency and the railway company.
- The regulation reflects a policy balance between **railway financial sustainability** and **public benefit through agricultural innovation**.

### **Conclusion**

The *Railway Company Pay Out of Excess Revenue for the Movement of Grain Regulations* is a targeted, well-structured regulation designed to ensure that any surplus revenue generated by railways in grain transport is shared with the agricultural sector through research funding. It promotes fairness, supports innovation, and aligns with broader goals of sustainable and efficient grain movement in Canada.

Despite minor changes (such as the repeal of the "average bank rate" definition), the core framework remains robust and continues to play a vital role in Canada’s grain transportation policy.
