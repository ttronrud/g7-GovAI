**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Context and Legal Basis:**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically pursuant to **subsection 29(1)** of the Act. The *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29) is a Canadian federal law designed to prevent the extinction of wildlife species at risk and to promote their recovery. Under this Act, the Minister of the Environment is empowered to assess whether a species is at risk and, if so, to recommend its addition to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk* in Schedule 1 of the Act.

The decision in question involves two distinct populations of the **Steelhead Trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*)**:

1. The **Chilcotin River population**  
2. The **Thompson River population**

**Key Facts of the Regulation:**

- The **Minister of the Environment** has concluded that both of these Steelhead Trout populations face an **imminent threat to their survival**. This assessment is based on scientific data, ecological monitoring, and environmental risk factors such as habitat degradation, water temperature changes, flow reductions, or other threats affecting their ability to survive and reproduce.

- Despite this finding of imminent threat, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** (acting on behalf of the federal government) has **decided not to add either population to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk**.

- This decision was made after **careful consideration** of:
  - The Minister’s formal recommendation under subsection 29(1) of SARA;
  - A range of **social, economic, policy, and other factors**;
  - The **broader public interest**, including considerations such as:
    - Economic impacts on fisheries, agriculture, or regional development;
    - Potential costs and feasibility of conservation measures;
    - Existing management practices or protections in place;
    - The availability of alternative conservation strategies or mitigation measures;
    - Public opinion and stakeholder input.

**Legal and Policy Implications:**

- The decision reflects a **deliberate policy choice** under SARA to **exclude** these populations from formal protection status, even in the face of an identified imminent threat to survival.

- Under SARA, a species is only added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk if it meets specific criteria — including being at risk of extinction and if the threat is significant and immediate. While the Minister has identified an imminent threat, the Governor General has concluded that, in light of the broader context, the species do not meet the threshold for inclusion in the List.

- The decision does **not** imply that the populations are not at risk or that the threat is not serious. Rather, it indicates that the government, after comprehensive evaluation, has determined that the **current level of risk, combined with other factors, does not justify listing** under the Act at this time.

**Important Note on "Imminent Threat" vs. "Listed Status":**

- The presence of an "imminent threat" is a **critical component** of the listing process. However, listing is not automatic. The government must balance the ecological urgency of the threat with practical, policy, and socioeconomic considerations.

- This decision may reflect the belief that:
  - The threat, while serious, may be manageable through existing conservation efforts or adaptive management;
  - The populations may have sufficient resilience or are under active protection;
  - The cost or impact of listing (e.g., restrictions on land use, development, or water allocation) outweighs the benefits of formal protection.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a **non-listing decision** for two Steelhead Trout populations in British Columbia — the Chilcotin and Thompson River populations — despite the Minister’s assessment of an imminent threat to their survival. The Governor General in Council has concluded, after weighing scientific, social, economic, and policy factors, that these species should not be included in the federal List of Wildlife Species at Risk under SARA.

This decision underscores the **balanced, context-sensitive approach** of SARA, which requires not only scientific justification but also a holistic assessment of broader public interest. It does not eliminate the need for conservation efforts, but rather signals that current management frameworks may be sufficient to address the threats facing these populations.

**Final Outcome:**  
✅ The Steelhead Trout populations in the Chilcotin and Thompson Rivers are **not added** to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk.  
⚠️ The imminent threat remains, but formal legal protection under SARA is withheld pending further data, stakeholder engagement, or changes in conditions.  
🔄 Ongoing monitoring and adaptive management are likely expected to inform future assessments.
