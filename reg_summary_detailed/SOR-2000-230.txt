**Detailed Summary of the International Telecommunication Union Privileges and Immunities Order (S.C. 1991, c. 41)**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, known as the *International Telecommunication Union Privileges and Immunities Order*, was made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance, under specific provisions of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*. It grants legal privileges and immunities to the **International Telecommunication Union (ITU)** and its representatives, officials, and experts operating in Canada.

The Order is grounded in international law and draws upon established frameworks—particularly the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* (the "Convention") and the *Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations* (the "Vienna Convention")—to ensure that the ITU can function effectively and independently in Canada without undue interference from domestic laws.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in Schedule III of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act.
- **Union**: Refers to the **International Telecommunication Union (ITU)**, a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for issues related to international telecommunication standards, policies, and infrastructure.
- **Vienna Convention**: The *Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations*, as set out in Schedule I of the Act, which governs the privileges and immunities of diplomatic envoys.

### **Legal Capacity of the ITU**

The ITU is granted the **legal capacity of a body corporate**, meaning it can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued in its own name. This recognition allows the ITU to operate as a legitimate international entity within Canada’s legal framework.

It also enjoys the **privileges and immunities** specified in **Articles II and III of the Convention**, which include:

- Immunity from legal process (in certain respects),
- Inviolability of premises and property,
- Freedom from interference in its operations,
- Protection of its communications and administrative functions.

These privileges are essential to ensure the ITU can carry out its mandate—such as setting global telecommunications standards—without being subject to domestic legal jurisdiction or interference.
