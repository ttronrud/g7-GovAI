**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
*Order Establishing a List of Foreign State Supporters of Terrorism*  
**Citation:** S.C. 2012, c. 1, s. 5; R.S., c. S-18  
**Date of Coming Into Force:** September 7, 2012  
**Issuing Authority:** The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs)  
**Legal Basis:** Subsection 6.1(2)(a) of the *State Immunity Act*

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a formal list of foreign states that are considered to have **supported or supported the commission of terrorism**. The primary objective is to enable Canada to apply provisions of the *State Immunity Act* to limit the immunity of these foreign states from Canadian legal actions — specifically, to allow Canadian courts to assert jurisdiction over matters involving terrorism when those acts are linked to the listed states.

The list serves as a legal tool under Canadian law to determine when a foreign state may be subject to Canadian judicial processes, particularly in cases involving terrorism-related offenses, by removing the general principle of state immunity in such contexts.

### **Legal Framework and Authority**

- The regulation is issued under **subsection 6.1(2)(a)** of the *State Immunity Act* (R.S., c. S-18), which empowers the Governor in Council to establish a list of foreign states that are believed to have supported or supported terrorism.
- This provision allows Canada to **override the general immunity of foreign states** in cases where there is reasonable ground to believe that the state has provided material support, funding, sanctuary, or other forms of assistance to terrorist activities.
- The decision to list a state is not made unilaterally; it is based on a recommendation from the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, following **consultation with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**. This ensures interdepartmental coordination between foreign policy and domestic security concerns.

---

### **Content of the List**

The list established by this Order includes the following two foreign states:

1. **Islamic Republic of Iran**  
2. **Syrian Arab Republic**

These states are identified as having either:
- Provided **direct or indirect support** to terrorist groups or activities,
- Or having **supported terrorism** through funding, training, weapons, safe havens, or other means.

The determination is based on assessments and intelligence gathered by Canadian government agencies, including the Foreign Affairs and Public Safety departments, and is grounded in credible evidence of state-level involvement in terrorism.

---

### **Scope and Application**

- The list is **specifically established for the purposes of section 6.1 of the State Immunity Act**.
- It enables Canadian courts to **proceed with legal actions** against individuals or entities associated with these states in terrorism-related matters, where the foreign state is found to have supported terrorism.
- It does **not** imply that the listed states are guilty of terrorism themselves, nor does it constitute a formal declaration of war or diplomatic condemnation. Instead, it is a **legal mechanism** to remove state immunity in specific circumstances involving terrorism.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Limiting State Immunity**:  
   Under international law, foreign states generally enjoy immunity from legal proceedings in the courts of other countries. This regulation allows Canada to **exclude that immunity** when a foreign state is identified as having supported terrorism.

2. **Deterrence and Accountability**:  
   The list acts as a tool to hold foreign states accountable for their support of terrorism, potentially deterring future support and encouraging cooperation with Canadian and international counter-terrorism efforts.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**:  
   The process is transparent in that it involves consultation between key ministers and is publicly disclosed through an official Order. The list is published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*, ensuring public awareness and accountability.

4. **Non-Exhaustive and Reviewable**:  
   The list is not permanent. It can be reviewed, amended, or revoked based on new intelligence or changes in policy. The government retains discretion to update the list as new information becomes available.

### **Timeline and Implementation**

- **Date of Publication**: The Order was issued and came into force on **September 7, 2012**.
- This was part of a broader Canadian strategy to strengthen counter-terrorism measures in the wake of international terrorist threats, including those linked to Iran and Syria, which were known to support or harbor terrorist organizations.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a significant example of how Canada uses domestic legislation to respond to international terrorism threats. By formally listing Iran and Syria as states that have supported or supported terrorism, Canada asserts legal jurisdiction in specific cases under the *State Immunity Act*, thereby enabling the prosecution of terrorism-related offenses involving individuals or entities linked to these states.

It reflects a balance between international legal principles and national security imperatives, and underscores Canada’s commitment to combating terrorism through both diplomatic and legal means.
