**Detailed Summary of the Defence Controlled Access Area Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 26, s. 64)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Defence Controlled Access Area Regulations* replace the earlier *Defence Establishment Trespass Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1047*, under the authority of **Section 12** and **Section 231.1** of the *National Defence Act*. These regulations establish comprehensive rules governing access, movement, conduct, and security within **defence establishments**, **work for defence or materiel**, and any **restricted areas** within them. The regulations are designed to protect national security, maintain operational integrity, ensure public safety, and regulate the behaviour of individuals entering or remaining in such sensitive areas.

The regulations may be cited as the **Defence Controlled Access Area Regulations**.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Implications |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Civilian Visitors / Contractors** | Must obtain a pass; comply with all entry/exit rules; submit to searches; cannot bring devices or alcohol. |
| **Security Guards** | Have broad authority to enforce rules, deny entry, conduct searches, and remove individuals. Must act reasonably and proportionally. |
| **Designated Authorities** | Hold ultimate responsibility for issuing passes, imposing prohibitions, and overseeing compliance. |
| **Military Personnel** | Exempt from some provisions (e.g., Code of Service Discipline), but still subject to internal discipline and operational rules. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Defence Controlled Access Area Regulations* represent a modern, enforceable, and security-focused framework for managing access to sensitive defence facilities. By clearly defining who may enter, how access is granted, what behaviours are prohibited, and how enforcement is carried out, the regulations balance the need for **national security** with **due process**, **proportionality**, and **individual rights**—while maintaining strict control over the movement and conduct of all persons within defence-controlled zones.

These rules remain a critical component of Canada’s national defence infrastructure, ensuring that sensitive operations are protected from espionage, sabotage, and disruption.
