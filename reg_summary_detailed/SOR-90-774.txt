### **Detailed Summary of the Hibernia Development Project Offshore Application Regulations**

The **Hibernia Development Project Offshore Application Regulations** (S.C. 1990, c. 41) are a set of administrative rules enacted by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, under **sections 7 and 8 of the Hibernia Development Project Act**. These regulations establish the legal framework for the **application of both federal and Newfoundland laws in the offshore area** of Newfoundland and Labrador, specifically for the purposes of the Hibernia Development Project — a major offshore oil and gas development.

---

## **1. Purpose and Context**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **enable the effective operation of the Hibernia Development Project** by harmonizing the application of federal and provincial laws in the offshore area. This is necessary because:

- The Hibernia Development Project involves complex cross-jurisdictional activities.
- Certain federal laws and Newfoundland laws apply in the offshore area due to **section 8 of the Hibernia Development Project Act**, which allows for the application of provincial laws in such areas.
- The regulations clarify how these laws are interpreted and applied, particularly in relation to property rights, security interests, and administrative procedures.

---

## **2. Key Provisions and Legal Modifications**

### **A. Application of Federal Laws (Schedule I)**

- The **prescribed federal laws** that apply are:
  - Acts of Parliament (or specific provisions within those Acts).
  - Regulations made under those Acts (as defined in the *Interpretation Act*).
  - Rules of law within Parliament’s jurisdiction related to the subject matter.

> This ensures that federal statutes governing areas like maritime boundaries, environmental protection, or oil and gas operations are directly applicable in the offshore zone.

---

### **B. Security Interests in Offshore Personal Property**

A critical innovation in the regulations is the **treatment of personal property affixed to the seabed or subsoil**.

- Under **subsection 8(1)** of the Hibernia Development Project Act, Newfoundland laws apply in the offshore area.
- For the purpose of creating, continuing, or enforcing **security interests** in personal property (e.g., equipment, pipelines) that is in contact with the seabed or subsoil:
  - Those laws shall be **read as if the property were not a fixture** of the seabed or subsoil.

> **Implication**: This prevents the property from being treated as permanently attached to the land or seabed, which would otherwise make it difficult to transfer or secure via a mortgage or lien. It allows for more flexible financing and property rights in offshore operations.

---

### **C. Modification or Addition of Newfoundland Acts (Schedule II)**

- Specific Acts of Newfoundland listed in **Column I of Schedule II** are **read as if modified or added** to in the manner and extent specified in **Column II**.
- Examples include:
  - Amendments to provisions related to **property rights, registration of interests, or enforcement of security interests** in offshore zones.

> This enables the Newfoundland legal system to adapt to the unique needs of offshore oil and gas development without requiring new legislation.

---

### **D. Application of the Interpretation Act (R.S.N. 1970, c. 182)**

- The *Interpretation Act* applies to all Newfoundland laws, including any modified or added Acts under this regulation.
- This ensures **consistency in legal interpretation** across all relevant statutes, particularly in matters involving definitions, terms, and construction.

---

### **E. Substitution of "Corporation" with "Corporation or Partnership of Corporations"**

This change appears in multiple sections and reflects a broader policy to **include partnerships** as valid legal entities in offshore operations:

- In **section 3**, **paragraph 2(h)**, and **paragraph 33(2)(a), (d)**:
  - The word *"corporation"* is replaced with *"corporation or, for greater certainty, partnership of corporations"*.
- In **paragraph 33(2)(c)**:
  - *"person"* is replaced with *"person or partnership"*.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that partnerships (common in oil and gas ventures) are recognized as capable of holding legal rights, entering into contracts, and being subject to registration or enforcement procedures under the law.

---

### **F. Repeal and Substitution of Key Provisions**

Several existing sections are **repealed** and replaced with more flexible, practical provisions to accommodate offshore operations.

#### **1. Section 14 – Rectification of Omissions or Misstatements**
- **Repealed** and replaced with a new provision:
  > A judge of the Supreme Court may, if satisfied that an omission or misstatement in a document filed under the Act was due to **inadvertence, impossibility, or sufficient cause**, order rectification on terms and conditions (e.g., notice, security, advertisement).
  > The order is attached to the assignment and recorded in the register.

> **Impact**: Provides judicial flexibility to correct errors without requiring a full legal re-filing or causing undue hardship to parties involved.

#### **2. Section 7 – Bill of Sale Amendments**
- **Repeals** the requirement that a bill of sale must be filed within 30 days of execution.
- **Adds new subsection**:
  > An **amended bill of sale**, verified by affidavit referencing the original and correcting **clerical errors or omissions**, may be filed.

> **Benefit**: Allows for practical correction of typographical or formatting errors without invalidating the original document.

#### **3. Section 20 – Extension of Registration Time**
- **Repeals** the original subsection.
- **Replaces with**:
  > A judge may extend the time for registration of a renewal statement or correct an omission/misstatement **if accidental or due to sufficient cause**, subject to rights of other persons.

> **Benefit**: Provides relief in cases where delays occur due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., technical issues, administrative errors).

#### **4. Section 4 – Conditional Sale Amendments**
- **Repeals** the 30-day filing requirement.
- **Adds new subsection**:
  > An **amended conditional sale**, verified by affidavit, may be filed if it contains a **clerical error or omission**.

> **Purpose**: Same as for bills of sale — enhances flexibility in documentation.

#### **5. Section 18 – Extension of Filing Time**
- **Repeals** original subsection.
- **Replaces with**:
  > A judge may extend time to file a notice under section 14 or a renewal statement, or correct an omission/misstatement, if due to **inadvertence, impossibility, or sufficient cause**.

> **Benefit**: Ensures that operators are not penalized for administrative delays.

#### **6. Section 6.1 – Notice of Sale**
- **Repeals** subsection 6.1(2).
- **Replaces with**:
  > A notice of sale of mortgaged property must be published **in a newspaper of general circulation in Newfoundland at least once a week for two consecutive weeks** before the sale.

> **Purpose**: Ensures public notice and transparency in auctions or tenders for offshore property.

#### **7. Section 6.2, 6.6, and 6.7**
- These sections are **fully repealed**.
> Likely due to their irrelevance or redundancy in the offshore context.

### **G. Modification of Paragraph 6(1)(e)**

- The original provision on conveyances of personal chattels is **repealed** and replaced with:
  > "Conveyances of personal chattels and the documents referred to in subsection 33(2); and"

> This ensures that all relevant documentation (e.g., bills of sale, conditional sales) is included in the scope of transferable property.

---

### **H. Modification of Paragraph 33(2)**

- All instances of "corporation" in paragraph 33(2) are replaced with *"corporation or, for greater certainty, partnership of corporations"*.
- "Person" in paragraph 33(2)(c) is replaced with *"person or partnership"*.

> Ensures that **partnerships** — common in joint ventures in offshore oil and gas — are recognized as legal entities capable of owning and transferring interests.

---

### **I. Change in Reference to the Crown**

- In **subsection 39(4)**:
  - "The Crown in right of Newfoundland" is replaced with:
    > "The Crown in right of Canada or the Crown in right of Newfoundland"

> **Implication**: Recognizes that **federal authority** (Crown in right of Canada) may be involved in offshore operations, especially where federal laws or rights apply.
