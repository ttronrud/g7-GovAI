The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-91" — indicates that the specific legislative instrument (SI) numbered 91 of 2018 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the issuing authority, or the subject matter of the regulation — e.g., health, environment, labour, transportation, etc.), a detailed summary cannot be provided. The designation "SI/2018-91" refers to a Statutory Instrument issued in 2018, typically under the authority of a government department or ministry in a jurisdiction such as Canada, the United Kingdom, or another country that uses Statutory Instruments.

In general, when a regulation is marked as "repealed," it means that:

1. **The regulation is no longer in force** — it has been formally canceled or replaced by a new law or regulation.
2. **It has been superseded** — a more current or comprehensive rule has taken its place, often due to changes in policy, legal interpretation, or administrative efficiency.
3. **It is no longer applicable** — any legal or operational obligations derived from it are void and no longer binding.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
- The full title of the Statutory Instrument (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2018").
- The issuing body (e.g., Department of Health, Environment Agency, etc.).
- The subject area (e.g., workplace safety, environmental protection, licensing, etc.).
- The original content or key provisions of the regulation (if available).

Since no such details are provided in your query, and only the repeal notice (SI/2018-91) is given, the most accurate and responsible response is:

👉 **Summary**:

A detailed summary of its original content or provisions cannot be provided without further information about its title, subject matter, and issuing authority.
