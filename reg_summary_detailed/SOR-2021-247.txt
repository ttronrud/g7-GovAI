### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Regulatory Background**

The **Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** (the "Regulations") were formally adopted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Natural Resources**, the **Minister of Labour**, and the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to specific provisions in the **Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act (the "Act")**.

This regulation establishes a comprehensive framework for occupational health and safety (OHS) in offshore operations in Newfoundland and Labrador, particularly in the oil, gas, and marine sectors. It was developed following a formal consultation process and is designed to ensure the safety of workers in high-risk offshore environments.

#### **2. Regulatory Process and Consultation**

The regulation was enacted through a transparent and collaborative process:

- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the Regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 24, 2021**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit written representations to the **Minister of Natural Resources**.
  
- **Inter-Governmental Consultation**:
  - The **Minister of Natural Resources** consulted with the **Minister of Occupational Health and Safety of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador**, who approved the making of the Regulations.
  - The **Provincial Minister for Newfoundland and Labrador** reviewed and approved **Part 33** of the proposed Regulations, which specifically addresses diving operations and related safety requirements.

This demonstrates a strong commitment to inter-provincial cooperation and stakeholder input.
