### **Detailed Summary of the Ontario Review of Parole Ineligibility Rules (Rule 50)**  
*Effective Date: December 17, 2013*  
*Enacted under subsection 745.64(1)a of the Criminal Code, R.S.O. 1996, c. C-46*

---

## **Overview**

Rule 50 of the *Ontario Review of Parole Ineligibility Rules* establishes the procedural framework for individuals who seek a **reduction in the number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole** under **section 745.6 of the Criminal Code**. This rule applies to applicants convicted of serious offences—particularly murder—where the sentence includes a period of imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

The process is designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and due process while balancing the interests of public safety, justice, and rehabilitation. It allows individuals serving long sentences to apply for a reduction in their "parole ineligibility period," which may result in eligibility for parole after serving a portion of their sentence.

This rule governs the **entire lifecycle** of such an application—from initial filing through judicial screening, case management, to the final jury trial.
