### **Detailed Summary of the Prince Albert Airport Zoning Regulations (1987)**

The **Prince Albert Airport Zoning Regulations**, enacted on May 26, 1987, under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, are a set of detailed land-use and height-control regulations designed to ensure aviation safety at Prince Albert Airport in Saskatchewan. These regulations define spatial boundaries and elevation restrictions around the airport to prevent interference with aircraft operations—particularly during takeoff and landing—by controlling structures, natural growth, and waste disposal.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Process**

- **Authority**: The regulations are made under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister of Transport to establish zoning rules for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: Prior to enactment, a proposed version of the regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **May 16 and 23, 1987**;
  - Two successive issues of the *Prince Albert Herald* on **June 29 and July 4, 1987**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., landowners, municipalities, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on this consultation, the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister, formally adopted the regulations.

## **2. Regulatory Name and Scope**

- **Title**: *Prince Albert Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands:
  - Within the **outer limits** described in **Part VI of the schedule**; and
  - Directly beneath any portion of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

> This means the rules apply not only to land immediately surrounding the airport but also to areas under the flight paths of aircraft approaching or departing the runway.

## **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Prince Albert Airport, located near the City of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point at **UTM coordinates: Northing 5896141.162, Easting 455092.714**; elevation = **424.9 meters above sea level** |
| **Approach Surface** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runways (08–26 and 16–34), designed to ensure clear visibility and safe approach paths for aircraft |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 424.9 + 45 = 470.9 m), except where it would be less than 9 meters above ground—then it is set at **9 meters above ground level** |
| **Strip** | The actual runway and adjacent paved area used for takeoff and landing; includes designated runways and their associated zones |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the sides of the strip and its approach surfaces, connecting them to the outer surface or adjacent transitional surfaces |

---

## **4. Elevation Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Construct, erect, or build any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing ones) on land subject to these regulations,
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**;
  - The **outer surface**;
  - The **transitional surface**.

> This restriction ensures that no structure (e.g., trees, towers, buildings) will obstruct aircraft during approach or departure.

---

## **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the elevation of any of the three defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to:
  - Remove or trim the excessive growth.

> This is critical for preventing birds or obstructions from interfering with aircraft operations.

---

## **6. Waste Disposal Prohibitions**

- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
    - **Edible by birds**, or
    - **Attractive to birds**

> This rule aims to reduce bird strikes—a major aviation hazard—by eliminating food sources that attract birds to the airport vicinity.

## **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Zones**

### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway Ends)**

Defined for each of the four runways (08, 26, 16, 34):

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Runway 08 (approach 08)** | - Inclined plane: 1:60 ratio (1m up per 60m horizontal) from end to a line 2,538m out, 530.7m from centerline; reaches 42.3m above end elevation<br> - Continues with 1:50 ratio to 15,000m out, 2,400m from centerline; reaches 291.54m above end elevation |
| **Runway 26 (approach 26)** | - 1:60 ratio to 2,628m out, 544.2m from centerline; reaches 43.8m above end elevation<br> - Continues with 1:50 ratio to 15,000m out; reaches 291.24m above end elevation |
| **Runway 16 (approach 16)** | - 1:40 ratio to 2,500m out, 295m from centerline; reaches 62.5m above end elevation |
| **Runway 34 (approach 34)** | - Same as 16: 1:40 ratio, 2,500m out, 62.5m above end elevation |

> These surfaces extend far beyond the runway ends to provide a clear zone for aircraft to descend safely.

---

### **B. Outer Surface**

- A flat, imaginary plane located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (424.9 m → 469.9 m).
- **Exception**: If this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground**, then the outer surface is defined as **9 meters above ground level**.
- This creates a buffer zone that limits the height of any structure or object in the surrounding area.

---

### **C. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **08–26** | 300 meters wide (150m on each side of centerline) | 2,244 meters long |
| **16–34** | 90 meters wide (45m on each side) | 1,122 meters long |

> These are the actual landing areas where aircraft operate. The 08–26 strip is longer and wider, indicating it is a primary runway.

---

### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

- **Runway 08–26**: Inclined plane rising at **1:7 ratio** (1m up per 7m horizontal), extending from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces to meet the outer surface or adjacent transitional surface.
- **Runway 16–34**: Inclined plane rising at **1:5 ratio** (1m up per 5m horizontal), extending similarly.

> These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface, preventing abrupt changes in elevation that could interfere with flight paths.

## **8. Boundary of Outer Limits (Land Boundary)**

The boundary of the regulated zone is precisely defined in a complex, step-by-step description using **survey coordinates and road allowances**. It follows a winding path across several sections of land in the Prince Albert area, incorporating:

- Sections of Township 49, Range 25, West of the 2nd Meridian
- Sections 19, 20, 27, 28, 22, 21, 16, 8, 7, and 12
- Major roads: **North Saskatchewan River**, **Barton Drive**, **Eagle Crescent**, **Gisi Road**, **Bliss Crescent**, **Olive Diefenbaker Drive**, **15th Avenue East**, **7th Street East**, **12th Avenue East**, **22nd Street East**
- Specific parcels and reserves: **Hudson Bay Company Reserve (Block 208, Reg’d Plan 80 PA 04380)**, **Reg’d Plan A.C. 1771**, **A.B. 3308**, **PA 19009**, **PA 07307**

> This boundary effectively encircles the airport and its critical operational zones, ensuring that only land within this defined perimeter is subject to the height and waste rules.

## **9. Key Objectives and Safety Implications**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure Aircraft Safety**:
   - Prevent visual obstructions during approach and departure.
   - Maintain unobstructed flight paths by limiting structure heights.

2. **Reduce Bird Strikes**:
