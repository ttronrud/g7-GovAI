### **Detailed Summary of the St. Andrew’s Airport Zoning Regulations (Manitoba, Canada)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Purpose**

The **St. Andrew’s Airport Zoning Regulations** were officially approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations replace the previous *St. Andrew’s Airport Zoning Regulations, C.R.C., c. 110*, with updated and more specific zoning rules designed to ensure aviation safety by controlling land use around the airport.

These regulations establish **strict height limitations** and **environmental protections** for all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of St. Andrew’s Airport in the Rural Municipality of St. Andrew’s, Manitoba.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *St. Andrew’s Airport*, located in the Rural Municipality of St. Andrew’s, Manitoba.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A precise geographic point used as a datum for elevation and spatial reference. It is defined as the intersection of:
  - A line 500 feet southwesterly at right angles from the centerline of **runway 12R–30L**, and  
  - A line 500 feet northwesterly at right angles from the centerline of **runway 04–22**.

- **Strip**: The rectangular area of the runway and its associated landing area, including the runway itself and its sides. Strips are defined by width and length and are associated with specific runways.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a strip (i.e., the area where aircraft approach the runway). The slope and dimensions vary by runway:
  - For runways **04, 22, 12R, 30L, 18R, 36L**: 1:50 slope (1 foot rise per 50 feet horizontal).
  - For runways **12L, 30R, 18L, 36R**: 1:40 slope (1 foot rise per 40 feet horizontal).
  - Each surface rises to a horizontal line 200 feet above the end of the strip (for 1:50 slopes) or 207.5 feet (for 1:40 slopes), extending 10,000 feet or 8,300 feet horizontally from the end, with outer ends 2,000 or 955 feet from the runway centerline.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surface, rising at different gradients depending on the runway:
  - **Runways 04–22, 12R–30L, 18R–36L**: 1:7 slope (1 foot rise per 7 feet horizontal).
  - **Runways 12L–30R, 18L–36R**: 1:5 slope (1 foot rise per 5 feet horizontal).
  - These surfaces extend until they intersect either the **outer surface** or another transitional surface of a neighboring strip.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane located at a constant elevation of **150 feet above the airport reference point** (757 feet above sea level). However, if this elevation would place the surface below 30 feet above ground level, the surface is instead set at **30 feet above ground** to prevent unsafe low clearances.

#### **3. Applicable Land Area**

The regulations apply to all lands that:
- Are **within** the designated airport boundaries, **or**
- Are **directly under** any portion of an **approach surface** that extends beyond the outer limits of the airport.

The **outer limits** of the regulated area are defined by a detailed, legally precise boundary description (a legal description of a closed polygon). This boundary is drawn in **yellow** on Department of Transport Plan No. **E.1539** and includes:
- Portions of the Red River shoreline
- Roads and road allowances
- Specific land parcels in the Parishes of St. Pauls and St. Andrew’s
- Key features such as the Four Mile Road, River Roads, and CN Railway right-of-way

This boundary ensures that only land directly adjacent to or within the airport’s operational envelope is subject to these restrictions.

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions**

**No person may construct or erect any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures)** on any land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

- The **approach surface**,
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surface**.

This means that all structures—whether permanent or temporary—must remain below the height of these imaginary surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

---

#### **5. Natural Growth Provisions**

If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the height of any of the above surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision ensures that vegetation does not pose a hazard to aircraft by creating obstacles or increasing the risk of bird strikes or turbulence.

---

#### **6. Bird Hazard Prohibition**

No owner or occupier of regulated land may:
- Allow the land to be used for **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** to birds, or
  - **Attractive to birds**

This rule aims to reduce the risk of **bird strikes**, which can cause serious damage to aircraft and pose significant safety risks during flight operations.

---

#### **7. Regulatory Tools and Enforcement**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste restrictions

- The regulations are **geographically and technically precise**, relying on:
  - A clearly defined airport reference point
  - Detailed legal descriptions of boundaries
  - Visual representations (in color-coded format on official plans)

These tools allow for consistent, transparent, and enforceable application of the rules across the airport’s surrounding area.

---

#### **8. Visual Representation**

All key surfaces are clearly marked on **Department of Transport Plan No. E.1539**:
- **Blue lines** = Approach surfaces
- **Yellow lines** = Outer surface
- **Red lines** = Transitional surfaces

This visual aid assists landowners, planners, and aviation authorities in understanding the spatial constraints and ensuring compliance.

---

#### **9. Elevation Reference**

- The **assigned elevation of the airport reference point is 757 feet above sea level**.
- The outer surface is set at **150 feet above this reference point** (i.e., 757 + 150 = 907 feet above sea level), unless it would fall below 30 feet above ground, in which case it is capped at 30 feet above ground.

This elevation system provides a consistent baseline for all height determinations.

### **Summary of Key Safety and Operational Objectives**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aircraft Safety** | Prevents obstructions during takeoff, landing, and approach by limiting building and vegetation height. |
| **Runway Visibility** | Ensures clear visibility of runways and approach paths through height controls. |
| **Bird Hazard Mitigation** | Prevents accumulation of food or waste that attracts birds near the airport. |
| **Clearance Zones** | Defines precise, legally enforceable zones (via approach, transitional, and outer surfaces) to protect flight paths. |
| **Land Use Control** | Restricts development in sensitive areas to maintain safe operational margins. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The **St. Andrew’s Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive, science-based, and legally enforceable framework to **protect aviation safety** at St. Andrew’s Airport. By defining precise elevation limits, spatial boundaries, and environmental protections, the regulations ensure that all land use around the airport supports safe flight operations while balancing community development needs.

These rules are critical for maintaining public safety, minimizing risks of aircraft incidents, and ensuring compliance with national aeronautical standards under the **Aeronautics Act**.
