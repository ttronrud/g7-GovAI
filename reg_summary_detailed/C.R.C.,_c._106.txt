**Detailed Summary of the Resolute Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Resolute Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish specific zoning and height restrictions around **Resolute Bay Airport**, located in Resolute, Northwest Territories, Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation begins by defining several critical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Resolute Bay Airport** at Resolute, NWT.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A precise geographic point used as a central reference for measuring distances and elevations. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be at 200 feet above sea level** for regulatory purposes, even if the actual elevation differs.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip), at right angles to the runway’s centerline.  
  - Slope ratio: **1 foot vertically to 50 feet horizontally** (1:50).  
  - Rises to an imaginary horizontal line:  
    - **1,000 feet vertically** above the elevation at the end of the strip.  
    - **50,000 feet horizontally** from the end of the strip.  
  - The outer ends of this horizontal line are **8,000 feet from the runway centerline**.  
  - Applies to **four runways**: 10-28 (approaches 10 and 28), and 16-34 (approaches 16 and 34).  
  - These surfaces are illustrated on **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1247**, dated September 1, 1976.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An **imaginary surface** that forms a protective zone above and around the airport.  
  - Composed of two parts:  
    1. A **common plane at 150 feet above the ARP elevation**.  
    2. If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, then the surface is **30 feet above ground** (to prevent overbuilding in low-lying areas).  
  - This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or natural feature in the broader airport vicinity.  
  - Also shown on **Plan No. E.1247**.

- **Strip**:  
  The **rectangular landing area** of the airport, including runways and associated taxiways, prepared for takeoff and landing in a given direction.  
  - **Runway 10–28 strip**:  
    - 8,400 feet long, 1,000 feet wide (500 feet on each side of centerline).  
  - **Runway 16–34 strip**:  
    - 11,400 feet long, 1,000 feet wide (500 feet on each side of centerline).  
  - Both strips are referenced in **Plan No. E.1247**.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surfaces.  
  - Slope ratio: **1 foot vertically to 7 feet horizontally** (1:7).  
  - Extends upward until it intersects with:  
    - The **outer surface**, or  
    - An **approach surface** of an adjacent runway strip.  
  - This surface ensures a smooth transition between the runway edges and the broader protective zones.  
  - Also depicted on **Plan No. E.1247**.

### **3. Geographic Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:

- All **land and underwater areas** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.  
- The **outer boundaries** of this zone are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.  
- The regulations **do not apply** to land that is officially part of the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated operational areas).

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:

- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object **on any land covered by these regulations**,  
- If the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following **imaginary surfaces** at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> ⚠️ *This means all structures — including buildings, towers, trees, or even fences — must remain below the maximum height defined by these surfaces.*

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exception**

- If **natural features** (e.g., trees, shrubs, or vegetation) grow **above** any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** (Minister) may issue a **direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision allows for enforcement action when natural growth poses a safety risk to aircraft operations.

---

### **6. Geographic Description of the Airport Zone (Key Coordinates)**

The area covered by the regulations is precisely defined in the schedule:

- **Starting Point**: Intersection of runways **10–28** and **16–34**.  
- **Path**:  
  - Travel **northerly** along the centerline of runway **16–34** for **4,000 feet**.  
  - Then turn **westward and perpendicular** to the runway centerline for **500 feet** to reach the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.  
- **Circular Buffer Zone**:  
  A **circle with a radius of 13,000 feet**, centered at the ARP.  
  This defines the outer boundary of the protected area.

> This geometric description ensures that the zone extends uniformly around the airport, protecting critical flight paths and approach corridors.

---

### **7. Visual and Technical References**

All defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) are **graphically illustrated** on:

- **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1247**, dated **September 1, 1976**.  
- This plan is considered the **official reference document** for interpreting the spatial dimensions and boundaries of the regulated zones.

---

### **8. Legal Status and Revocation Note**

- The regulation includes a note stating:  
  > [Revoked, SOR/81-176, s. 1]  
  This indicates that **Section 1 of the regulation was revoked by Order in Council SOR/81-176**, though the rest of the regulation may still be in effect or applied under new provisions.  
  > ⚠️ *This requires careful interpretation: while the revocation applies to Section 1, the rest of the regulation (especially the definitions and spatial boundaries) remains relevant and in force, as they are foundational to the zoning framework.*

---

### **9. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear airspace and unobstructed flight paths.  
- **Prevent obstructions** to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.  
- **Establish a legally enforceable height limit** that applies uniformly across all land and water adjacent to the airport.  
- **Protect critical approach corridors** by defining approach and transitional surfaces with strict slope and distance criteria.

These measures are based on international aviation standards, particularly those related to **minimum obstacle clearance** for aircraft operations.

---

### **10. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions.
- Landowners and developers must comply with the rules, and failure to do so may result in legal action or intervention by the Minister.
