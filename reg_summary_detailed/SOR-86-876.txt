**Detailed Summary of the Direct Shipment of Goods Regulations (S.C. 1986, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Direct Shipment of Goods Regulations* (S.C. 1986, c. 1), enacted under the authority of the *Customs Act*, establish a legal framework that allows goods exported to Canada from a foreign country—while passing through another country in transit—to be **deemed as having been shipped directly from the original exporting country to Canada**, provided certain conditions are met.

This regulation is designed to simplify customs procedures by preventing unnecessary delays or complications that would arise if goods passing through a third country were treated as having originated in that transit country. It ensures that the **country of origin** is correctly identified for customs purposes, even when goods undergo international transit.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Section 54** of the *Customs Act* grants the Governor in Council (the federal government) the authority to make regulations concerning the customs treatment of goods.
- **Paragraph 164(1)(i)** of the *Customs Act* defines the circumstances under which goods are considered to be shipped directly to Canada.
- The regulation was proposed and published in *Part I of the Canada Gazette* on **March 15, 1986**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit written representations to the Minister of National Revenue.
- After review, the regulations were adopted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Definition of "Direct Shipment"**
Under these regulations, goods that:
- Are exported to Canada from a country other than Canada (i.e., a foreign country),
- Pass through one or more other countries in transit,

**shall be deemed to be shipped directly to Canada from the first mentioned country** (the country of export), **if** two conditions are satisfied:

> ✅ **(a)** The journey from the country of export to Canada is **uninterrupted**.  
> ✅ **(b)** The importer complies with **Section 3** of the *Customs Act* (which typically involves compliance with customs procedures, including declaration and documentation requirements).

This means that even though the goods physically pass through a third country, they are legally treated as having come directly from the original exporting country—provided the movement remains continuous and uninterrupted.

#### **2. What Constitutes an "Uninterrupted Journey"?**

- A **transfer of goods from one carrier to another** (e.g., from a ship to a truck, or from one airline to another) **does not constitute an interruption** of the journey.
- The regulation explicitly **excludes** such transfers from being considered breaks in the journey.
- This provision supports the principle that **intermediary transport arrangements do not change the origin** of the goods, as long as the goods are not diverted, re-exported, or otherwise altered in their path.

> *Example:* If goods are shipped from Germany to Canada via France, and the cargo is transferred from a container ship to a rail train in France, this transfer is not considered an interruption. The goods are still deemed to have been shipped directly from Germany to Canada.

#### **3. Importer Obligations Upon Request**

- **When an officer of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** (or a customs officer) requests documentation, the importer must provide:
  - The **original bill of lading**, or
  - A **certified copy** of the bill of lading.

> This is required to verify the **origin** of the goods and ensure compliance with the "direct shipment" rule.

- **If the original bill of lading or certified copy is unavailable**, the importer must provide **any other available information or documents** that will enable the customs officer to determine the **country of export**.

> This includes, but is not limited to:
> - Airway bills or sea waybills
> - Shipping manifests
> - Commercial invoices
> - Consignee or shipper details
> - Any other documentation that clearly identifies the point of origin

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

1. **Simplify Customs Procedures**: Avoids the need to reclassify goods based on transit points, reducing administrative burden and delays at border crossings.
2. **Ensure Accurate Determination of Country of Origin**: Prevents misclassification that could lead to incorrect tariff applications, duties, or compliance issues.
3. **Support International Trade Efficiency**: Facilitates smoother movement of goods across borders by recognizing legitimate transit without implying a change in origin.
4. **Maintain Compliance with Legal Requirements**: Requires importers to provide accurate and verifiable documentation to uphold customs integrity.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force **on the date when Section 54 and Paragraph 164(1)(i) of the Customs Act** are enacted or come into effect.

In this case, the effective date is **March 15, 1986**, the date the proposed regulations were published in the Canada Gazette.

### **Regulation Citation**

These regulations are officially known as the **Direct Shipment of Goods Regulations** and may be cited as:  
**S.C. 1986, c. 1**

### **Key Takeaways for Importers and Customs Officers**

| Stakeholder | Key Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Importer** | Must ensure the journey is uninterrupted and provide original or certified bill of lading upon request. If unavailable, provide alternative supporting documents. |
| **Customs Officer** | May request documentation to verify the country of export. Must rely on available evidence to determine origin. |
| **Carriers** | Transfers between carriers are allowed without affecting the "direct shipment" status. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Direct Shipment of Goods Regulations* provide a clear, legally binding mechanism to treat goods that transit through a third country as if they were shipped directly from their original exporting country—provided the journey remains uninterrupted and the importer meets their documentation obligations. This promotes efficiency in international trade while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of customs records and compliance with Canadian tariff and regulatory frameworks.

These regulations remain a foundational tool in Canadian customs law for managing goods in transit and ensuring proper classification and treatment at the border.
