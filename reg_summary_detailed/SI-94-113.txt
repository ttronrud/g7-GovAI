### **Regulation Summary**

**Title:**  
Order Regarding the Inclusion of Certain Lands in the Sale of Territorial Lands – Yellowknife, Northwest Territories

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which authorizes the inclusion of certain lands in a land sale when they are adjacent to waters of the territory and fall within specific geographic or administrative boundaries.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Lands to Be Included in Sale:**  
   Any portion of the lands described in the **Schedule attached to this regulation** that lies within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark** of **two unnamed bodies of water** is hereby included in the sale of the said lands.

   - The two unnamed bodies of water are located **within the municipal boundaries of the City of Yellowknife**, Northwest Territories.
   - The "Ordinary High Water Mark" refers to the highest point to which water normally rises during normal tidal or seasonal conditions, which is a standard boundary used in land ownership and waterfront regulations.

2. **Specific Lands Identified:**  
   The **entire area** of the following lots is specifically designated:
   - **Lots 1, 2, and 4**
   - Located in **Block 549**
   - Within the **City of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories**

3. **Legal Documentation and Reference:**  
   - The exact boundaries and location of these lots are defined in a **plan of survey of record number 72425**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.
   - A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District in **Yellowknife**, under **file number 2058**.

### **Purpose and Implication**

- This regulation modifies the scope of a land sale by **including adjacent riparian (waterfront) lands** that are within 100 feet of two unnamed water bodies.
- The inclusion of these lands is based on **procedural authority under paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which allows for the inclusion of lands adjacent to water bodies when such inclusion is necessary for the proper administration of land sales or for public interest reasons (e.g., access, drainage, or land use planning).
- The regulation ensures that **all lands directly adjacent to these waters** are subject to the same sale process, preventing potential disputes or omissions in land title transactions.

---

### **Geographic and Administrative Context**

- The City of Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and is located in a region with significant natural water features, including rivers, lakes, and seasonal waterways.
- The "unnamed bodies of water" suggest that the specific names of the water bodies are not yet officially recorded or publicly identified in the land records, which may require further investigation or mapping by the relevant authorities.

---

### **Legal and Practical Significance**

- This order serves as a **formal legal declaration** that certain lands adjacent to water are included in a land sale, even if they were not explicitly listed in the original land description.
- It provides clarity and legal certainty for future land transactions, property rights, and potential development activities.
- It reflects the government’s role in managing land use, particularly in northern communities where water access and land boundaries can be complex due to natural topography and seasonal changes.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted land inclusion order** under the Territorial Lands Act, ensuring that lands within 100 feet of two unnamed water bodies in Yellowknife are included in a land sale. It specifically references the ownership and location of Lots 1, 2, and 4 in Block 549, as defined in a formal survey plan. The regulation enhances transparency and legal consistency in land administration in the Northwest Territories, particularly in urban and environmentally sensitive areas.

---

**Note:**  
For full legal effect, this regulation must be read in conjunction with the **Territorial Lands Act**, and the referenced survey plan (record 72425, file 2058) must be consulted for precise boundary details. Any disputes regarding the interpretation of the water boundaries or the inclusion of lands should be resolved through the Land Titles Office or appropriate land administration authorities.
