**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Title of the Regulation**  
*Order Designating Manitoba for the Purposes of the Criminal Interest Rate Provisions of the Criminal Code*

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulatory order is a formal designation made by the **Governor in Council** of Manitoba, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice** and the **Minister of Industry**, under specific provisions of the *Criminal Code of Canada*.

The key background elements include:

1. **Manitoba’s Legislative Safeguards for Payday Loan Recipients**  
   Manitoba has enacted legislative measures that:
   - Protect individuals who receive payday loans.
   - Establish **limits on the total cost of borrowing** under a payday loan agreement.  
   These protections are designed to prevent predatory lending practices and ensure financial fairness for vulnerable borrowers.

2. **Request from the Lieutenant Governor in Council**  
   The Lieutenant Governor in Council (a representative of the Crown in Manitoba) formally requested that the Governor in Council designate Manitoba as a jurisdiction where the **criminal interest rate provisions** of the *Criminal Code* apply — specifically, **section 347.1** — to apply to payday loans.

3. **Legal Authority**  
   The order is made under **subsection 347.1(3)a** of the *Criminal Code* (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as amended), which allows the Governor in Council to designate provinces or territories where the criminal interest rate provisions (i.e., those related to usury) will apply. This provision enables the federal government to extend federal criminal usury laws to provinces with strong, enforceable consumer protection frameworks.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **1. Designation of Manitoba**  
The Order officially **designates Manitoba** as a province where **section 347.1 of the Criminal Code** applies to payday loans.

- Section 347.1 of the *Criminal Code* criminalizes **charging or receiving interest rates that exceed the maximum allowed rate** (known as the "usury rate").
- In Manitoba, this means that any person who charges or receives interest on a loan exceeding the legally permissible rate (as set by provincial law) may face criminal penalties — not just civil liability.

#### **2. Conditions for Enforcement**  
The Order does **not take effect immediately**. It comes into force only on the **first day** when **two specific provincial laws and regulations are in force**:

1. **Section 147 of the Consumer Protection Act (C.C.S.M. c. C200)**  
   - Enacted by **Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Amendment Act (Payday Loans), S.M. 2006, c. 31**.  
   - This section establishes **maximum interest rates and total borrowing costs** for payday loans in Manitoba.  
   - It sets a cap on the total cost of borrowing, which includes interest and fees, to prevent exploitative lending.

2. **The Payday Loans Regulation, Man. Reg. 99/2007 (as amended by Man. Reg. 50/2010)**  
   - This regulation provides **operational details** for the enforcement of the interest and cost limits under the Consumer Protection Act.  
   - It outlines specific rules for loan terms, disclosures, and borrower protections.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The criminal provisions under section 347.1 of the *Criminal Code* only apply once **both of these provincial laws and regulations are fully in force**. This ensures that federal criminal usury laws are only activated when the province has a robust, enforceable regulatory framework in place.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Criminalization of Excessive Interest Rates**: By designating Manitoba, the federal government strengthens enforcement of usury laws in a jurisdiction that already has strong consumer protection legislation. This helps prevent lenders from charging exorbitant interest rates that could harm borrowers — especially low-income or vulnerable individuals.

- **Alignment of Federal and Provincial Laws**: The designation ensures that **federal criminal penalties** for usurious interest rates are applicable in Manitoba, even though the province has its own interest rate caps. This creates a more consistent and enforceable legal environment across Canada.

- **Protection of Borrowers**: The order reinforces Manitoba’s commitment to financial consumer protection by linking federal criminal liability to provincial regulatory safeguards.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force at **12:00 a.m. (midnight)** on the **first day** when:
  - Section 147 of the *Consumer Protection Act* is in force (as amended), **and**
  - The *Payday Loans Regulation* (Man. Reg. 99/2007, as amended by Reg. 50/2010) is in force.

- **Date of Entry into Force**: October 18, 2010 (as noted in the [Note]).

> This date marks the official start of the application of the criminal interest rate provisions in Manitoba under the *Criminal Code*.

---

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Federal Oversight**: The designation allows federal criminal law to apply in Manitoba, even though the primary regulatory framework is provincial. This reflects a shared responsibility between federal and provincial governments in protecting consumers from predatory lending.

- **Enforcement Mechanism**: If a lender in Manitoba charges interest or fees that exceed the limits set in the Consumer Protection Act and Regulation, the act of doing so could constitute a **criminal offence** under section 347.1 of the *Criminal Code*, potentially leading to fines or imprisonment.

- **Precedent**: This order serves as a model for other provinces that may develop strong payday loan regulations and seek federal criminal usury provisions to complement them.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a significant step in **protecting consumers from exploitative lending practices** in Manitoba. By designating the province for the purposes of the *Criminal Code*'s usury provisions, it ensures that lenders who violate the maximum interest and cost limits face **both civil and criminal consequences**. The measure is built on a foundation of strong provincial consumer protection laws and is activated only when those laws are fully operational — ensuring a balanced, fair, and effective regulatory environment.
