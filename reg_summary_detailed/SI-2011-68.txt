2. **Legal Basis**

   - This clause enables the federal government to formally assign leadership roles within key administrative entities, ensuring clarity in governance and accountability.

3. **Effective Date**

   - This marks the official start of the President’s duties as deputy head, including participation in decision-making, policy development, and interdepartmental coordination.

4. **Purpose and Context**  
   Shared Services Canada (SSC) is a federal entity established to provide centralized, cost-effective, and efficient services to other federal departments. These services include finance, human resources, information technology, and procurement.
