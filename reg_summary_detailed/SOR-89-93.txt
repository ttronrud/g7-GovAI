## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Ontario Fishery Regulations, 1989**

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **Sections 43* and 79 of the Fisheries Act (Canada)**.  
This action formally **revokes the outdated Ontario Fishery Regulations, 1984 (C.R.C., c. 849)** and replaces them with a new, updated set of rules governing **fishing activities in the Province of Ontario**.

- **Regulation Title**: *Ontario Fishery Regulations, 1989*  
- **Citation**: R.S. 1985, c. 35 (1st Supp.), s. 7  
- **Purpose**: To define and regulate fishing rights, access, and restrictions across Ontario’s diverse aquatic environments through clearly delineated geographic zones known as "Divisions."

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Structure**

- **"Division"** refers to specific, legally defined areas of Ontario’s waters, as enumerated and described in **Schedule IV** of the regulation.  
  These divisions are critical for applying different fishing rules (e.g., species limits, gear restrictions, seasonal closures) depending on location.

> ⚠️ Note: The repeated "[Repealed, SOR/2007-237, s. 46]" entries indicate that certain provisions (likely outdated or redundant) were removed or superseded by a later amendment (SOR/2007-237), which modernized the regulation. However, the core divisional descriptions remain in effect as part of the 1989 framework.
