### **Detailed Summary of the Spence Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Process**

The **Spence Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports in Canada. 

Prior to final adoption, the proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 9 and 16, 1991**, and in two successive issues of the *News/North* on **June 24 and July 1, 1991**. This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., local communities, landowners, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

After reviewing public feedback, the Minister recommended the regulations for approval, and the Governor in Council formally enacted them.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Scope**

- **Title:** *Spence Bay Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicable Site:** The Spence Bay Airport, located in the vicinity of Spence Bay, **Northwest Territories**  
- **Scope:** These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances, as specifically defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical spatial and structural elements:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to the Spence Bay Airport in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. Located on the centerline of runway 151, **580.5 meters from the threshold of runway 151**. Its elevation is **16.5 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. It ensures safe aircraft approach by limiting obstructions that could interfere with visibility. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a fixed elevation above the ARP (45 meters), but **reduced to 9 meters above ground level** if the 45-meter elevation would be below ground surface. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular landing area, including the runway, designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. For runway 151–331, it is **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,220 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces upward to meet the outer surface. It ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

#### **4. Spatial Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **Approach Surfaces (Runway 151 and 331)**

- Each approach surface is an **inclined plane** with a **1:30 gradient** (1 meter rise per 30 meters horizontal distance).
- It rises to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
  - Located **2,500 meters horizontally** from the end of the runway strip.
  - Positioned **295 meters from the centerline** of the strip on either side.
  - At an elevation of **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway** (i.e., 83.3 m above the end of the strip).
- These surfaces are designed to ensure **sufficient visibility** for pilots during approach and landing, preventing visual interference from tall structures or terrain.

##### **Outer Surface**

- A horizontal plane located at **45 meters above the elevation of the airport reference point (ARP)**.
- If the 45-meter elevation would place it **below ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that the outer boundary of the regulated zone is neither unrealistically high nor below ground.

##### **Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 gradient** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontally).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces** upward to intersect with the outer surface.
- These surfaces provide a **gradual transition** between the runway area and the outer surface, helping to maintain safe flight paths and reduce abrupt changes in terrain or obstruction.

##### **Boundary of the Outer Limits**

- The outer boundary of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **airport reference point (ARP)**.
- This circular boundary defines the **maximum extent** to which any structure or building may be located, ensuring that no obstructions interfere with airport operations beyond a safe distance.

#### **5. Prohibitions on Construction**

No person may:

- **Erect or construct** any new building, structure, or object, or
- **Add to an existing building, structure, or object**

on any land subject to these regulations, **if the highest point of that structure exceeds**:

1. The **approach surface**,  
2. The **outer surface**, or  
3. The **transitional surface**.

This restriction ensures that all structures remain within safe elevation limits to prevent interference with aircraft operations—particularly during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

---

#### **6. Reference to Existing Zoning Plan**

The regulations are based on the **Spence Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2739**, dated **July 25, 1989**, which provides the foundational design and spatial layout for the airport. All key elements (runway, approach surfaces, outer surface, strip dimensions, and boundary) are derived from this plan and are consistent with established aviation safety standards.

---

#### **7. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by minimizing visual and physical obstructions to aircraft during critical flight phases (especially approach and landing).
- To **protect the integrity of the airport environment** by limiting construction near the runway and surrounding areas.
- To provide **clear, measurable boundaries** for land use through defined surfaces and elevation limits.
- To allow for **future development** while maintaining compliance with national aviation safety standards.

#### **8. Key Takeaways**

| Feature | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| **Legal Authority** | Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act |
| **Effective Date** | Enacted in 1991, following public consultation |
| **Core Principle** | No structure may exceed the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) |
| **Critical Elevation Reference** | Airport Reference Point at 16.5 m above sea level |
| **Runway Dimensions** | 1,220 m long, 90 m wide (45 m on each side) |
| **Key Safety Zones** | Approach surfaces (1:30 gradient), transitional surfaces (1:7 gradient), outer surface (45 m above ARP or 9 m above ground) |
| **Maximum Land Boundary** | 4,000 m radius circle centered on ARP |

#### **9. Implications for Land Use and Development**

- **Landowners and developers** within the regulated zone must ensure all structures are **elevated below or at the level of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces**.
- Any **new construction or expansion** requires review and approval to confirm compliance with these elevation limits.
- The regulations serve as a **binding legal framework** that prevents unauthorized or unsafe development near the airport.

### **Conclusion**

The *Spence Bay Airport Zoning Regulations* represent a comprehensive and safety-focused approach to managing land use around a critical aviation facility. By defining precise elevation limits through clearly described surfaces and establishing a well-defined spatial boundary, the regulations protect aircraft operations from visual and physical obstructions. The process of public consultation and formal adoption ensures transparency and accountability in the regulation of airspace and land use near the airport.

These regulations remain a foundational document for aviation safety and land-use planning in the Northwest Territories.
