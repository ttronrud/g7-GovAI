### **Detailed Summary of the Muskoka Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **Muskoka Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This establishes the legal foundation for regulating land use around Muskoka Airport to ensure aviation safety and operational efficiency.

These regulations are officially titled the **Muskoka Airport Zoning Regulations** and apply to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Muskoka Airport.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several key terms essential to understanding the zoning requirements:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to the **Muskoka Airport located in Gravenhurst, District of Muskoka, Province of Ontario**.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed reference point used to establish elevation and spatial measurements. It is marked by a physical tablet named **DHO Precise BM 278-67**, located on the property of Muskoka Airways.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (for runways 09, 18, 27, and 36). These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear visual and physical path during landing and take-off, preventing obstructions.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface that extends around the airport at a consistent elevation above the ARP. It acts as a boundary for all structures and natural features beyond the immediate airport zone.

- **Strip**: The designated landing area (runway and taxiways) used for take-offs and landings. Two main strips are defined:
  - **Runway 09–27**: 120 meters wide, 60 meters on each side of the centerline, 655 meters long.
  - **Runway 18–36**: 150 meters wide, 75 meters on each side, 1,643 meters long.

- **Transitional Surface**: An inclined plane that extends from the lateral edges of each strip and its associated approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal) until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface from an adjacent strip.

---

#### **3. Assigned Elevation**
- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **278 meters above sea level**.
- All other surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) are measured relative to this reference point.

---

#### **4. Applicable Lands**
The regulations apply to **all lands**—including public road allowances—within the boundary described in **Part VI of the Schedule**, which is a detailed legal description of the land parcel. The boundary is defined in a precise, step-by-step survey description that spans across multiple concessions and townships in the Muskoka region.

This includes:
- Land adjacent to the airport
- Road allowances
- Areas near runways and approach paths

The zoning plan is referenced as **Muskoka Airport Zoning Plan No. 44-002-82-48**, with specific sheets (1 to 11) providing the full spatial layout.

---

#### **5. Prohibitions on Construction and Obstruction**
**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on any land covered by these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds:

- The **approach surface**,
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surface**.

This rule ensures that no structures—such as trees, towers, or buildings—interfere with aircraft operations during take-off, landing, or approach.

> **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees or bushes) that exceeds the height of any of these surfaces may be subject to removal. The **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to trim or remove such excessive natural growth.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Bird Attraction**
No owner or occupier of land covered by these regulations may allow the land to be used for:
- **Disposal of waste** that is **edible or attractive to birds**.

This is a critical safety measure to prevent bird strikes, which pose a significant risk to aircraft.

#### **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces**
These are inclined planes extending from the ends of each runway strip:

| Runway | Inclination | Horizontal Distance from End | Height Above Strip End | Width of Horizontal Line |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 09 (approach) | 1:40 (1 m up : 40 m out) | 2,500 m | 62.50 m | 310 m from centerline |
| 18 (approach) | 1:50 | 3,000 m | 60 m | 375 m from centerline |
| 27 (approach) | 1:40 | 2,500 m | 62.50 m | 310 m from centerline |
| 36 (approach) | 1:50 | 3,000 m | 60 m | 375 m from centerline |

> These surfaces ensure aircraft have a clear visual and physical corridor during approach, especially in poor visibility or adverse weather.

##### **B. Outer Surface**
- At a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP (278 m)** → **323 meters above sea level**.
- However, **if the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level** to avoid unrealistic height requirements in low-lying areas.

This creates a buffer zone around the airport where no structures may exceed the defined height.

##### **C. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of each strip** and its approach surfaces.
- Continue until they intersect with:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface** of an adjacent runway strip.

These surfaces ensure that the entire area around the runway is protected from obstructions, especially at the sides and ends of the strips.

---

#### **8. Boundary Description of Regulated Area**
The boundary of the regulated land is defined in a detailed, legally precise chain of coordinates and directions across multiple concessions and townships:

- Begins at the **southeastern corner of Lot 1, Concession 4** in the Town of Gravenhurst.
- Proceeds **westward**, then **northward**, crossing road allowances between concessions.
- Moves through **Concessions 4 to 12**, crossing into the former Township of Draper.
- Ends at the **northeastern corner of Lot 1, Concession 12**, in the former Township of Draper, and loops back to the starting point via a closed chain.

This extensive boundary ensures that all land within a defined perimeter—encompassing the airport, surrounding properties, and adjacent roads—is governed by the zoning rules.

---

#### **9. Purpose and Objectives**
The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: Prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during take-off, landing, or approach.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Maintain clear visibility and flight paths for pilots.
3. **Environmental Protection**: Minimize bird attraction to reduce strike risks.
4. **Consistency and Clarity**: Provide a standardized, legally enforceable framework for land use around the airport.

---

#### **10. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The **Minister of Transport** has authority to:
  - Issue directions for removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance through legal action if necessary.
- Landowners and occupiers are **legally obligated** to comply with the height restrictions and bird-attracting prohibitions.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Muskoka Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around Muskoka Airport. By defining key surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), setting strict height limits, and prohibiting bird-attracting waste, the regulations protect aviation safety, ensure operational integrity, and provide clear guidance for landowners and developers in the vicinity.

These rules are not only technical but also deeply rooted in aviation safety standards, reflecting best practices in airport zoning across Canada.
