**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions of the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages to the Minister for International Development  
**Legal Authority:**  
- Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)  
- Relevant statutory provision: Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act  
- Statutory citation: R.S., c. P-34 (the *Public Service Regulations*)

**Summary of the Provision:**

On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council (i.e., the Canadian government acting on ministerial advice) has transferred, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, the powers, duties, and functions of the **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages** with respect to the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA)** to the **Minister for International Development**.

**Key Elements of the Transfer:**

1. **Subject Matter:**  
   The transfer specifically applies to the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA)**. PEDA is a federal agency established to support economic development in the Pacific provinces and territories of Canada (particularly in British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories), with a focus on promoting sustainable economic growth, infrastructure development, and regional cooperation.

2. **Transfer of Authority:**  
   The Minister for International Development now assumes full responsibility for all powers, duties, and functions previously held by the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages in relation to PEDA. This includes:
   - Policy development and strategic direction for PEDA
   - Budgetary oversight and funding decisions
   - Administrative control and management of PEDA operations
   - Oversight of programs and initiatives delivered by PEDA
   - Reporting and accountability to Parliament and the federal government

3. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign ministerial responsibilities between departments or ministers, particularly when such a transfer is intended to improve efficiency, coherence, or alignment with broader government priorities.

4. **Rationale and Context (Implied):**  
   This transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities, likely aimed at:
   - Strengthening the integration of economic development initiatives in the Pacific region with broader international development goals.
   - Aligning regional economic development with Canada’s global development priorities, especially in areas such as climate resilience, sustainable resource management, and cross-border cooperation.
   - Enhancing coordination between domestic economic development and international development objectives, particularly in regions with strong international ties (e.g., the Pacific region’s proximity to Asia and the Pacific Islands).

5. **Impact on PEDA:**  
   While PEDA remains a standalone agency, its operational and policy direction is now under the purview of the Minister for International Development. This may result in:
   - Greater emphasis on development cooperation with Pacific Island nations.
   - Alignment of PEDA programs with Canada’s international development policy, including the Canada International Development Agency (CIDA) and global development frameworks.
   - Potential integration of PEDA into broader international development programming.

6. **No Change to Agency Structure:**  
   The transfer does not alter the legal or structural status of PEDA. The agency continues to operate under its original mandate, but now reports to and is accountable to the Minister for International Development.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant reorganization of ministerial responsibilities within the Canadian federal government. By transferring PEDA’s oversight from the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages to the Minister for International Development, the government signals a strategic shift toward aligning regional economic development with international development priorities. The move enhances coherence in policy delivery, particularly in the Pacific region, and reflects a broader effort to streamline and integrate federal programs under a more unified developmental framework.
