The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SOR/2012-90, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2012-90, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2012-90, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2012-90, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2012-90, s. 5]

This indicates that a specific regulation (or set of regulations) was **repealed** (officially canceled or replaced) by **Schedule 5 of the Statutory Rules of 2012**, specifically **SOR/2012-90**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question has been **repealed**. This means it is no longer in force and does not apply.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2012-90**, which is a statutory instrument (a type of secondary legislation) issued in Canada in 2012.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 5 of SOR/2012-90 specifically includes the repeal of the referenced regulation. This implies that the regulation was previously issued under a prior statute or regulation and was formally removed from the legal framework by the provisions in Section 5 of that 2012 instrument.
- **Legal Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it is no longer enforceable, and any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements it previously established are now void. Any references to it in existing laws, administrative procedures, or judicial decisions must be updated or interpreted in light of the repeal.

### Contextual Notes:
- SOR/2012-90 is a common designation for a statutory rule issued under the authority of a federal statute. The specific subject matter of the repealed regulation would typically be found in the original regulation’s text or in the explanatory notes accompanying SOR/2012-90.
- Without the original regulation’s content, it is not possible to determine the exact nature or scope of the repealed rule (e.g., whether it related to licensing, environmental standards, tax procedures, or another area).
- The repetition of the same line five times suggests a formatting or data-entry error, possibly from a database or document where multiple entries were mistakenly duplicated.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text has been **officially repealed** by **Section 5 of SOR/2012-90**. It is no longer part of the current legal framework and should not be referenced or applied. To understand the substance of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory materials accompanying SOR/2012-90. As of now, based on the provided information, no substantive content of the regulation exists because it has been formally canceled.
