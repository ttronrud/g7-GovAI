**Detailed Summary of the Campbell River Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Campbell River Airport Zoning Regulations*, established under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act* and approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, are a set of detailed zoning rules designed to ensure aviation safety and operational efficiency at **Campbell River Airport** in British Columbia. These regulations define the spatial boundaries and elevation limits for structures, natural features, and land use around the airport to prevent hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

These regulations are formally cited as **"Campbell River Airport Zoning Regulations"** and are part of the broader regulatory framework governing airports in Canada under the *Aeronautics Act* (S.C. 1976–77, c. 28).

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Campbell River Airport located in the District of Campbell River, BC. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point used as a datum for elevation measurements. It is located 86.00 meters southwesterly and at right angles from a point 823.18 meters along the centerline of runway 11–29, to the northwesterly end of the strip. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 11 and 29), rising at specific gradients to meet the outer surface. The gradient is 1:50 (runway 11) and 1:40 (runway 29). After reaching the outer surface, the surface becomes horizontal and extends 3,000 meters from the end of the runway, with outer ends 600 meters from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**. However, if this elevation would be less than 9 meters above ground level, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to ensure safety and practicality. |
| **Strip** | The main runway area associated with runway 11–29. It is **300 meters wide** (150 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,644 meters long**. This is the primary area where aircraft take off and land. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a ratio of **1:7** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally), until it meets the outer surface. This surface ensures that structures and objects do not interfere with aircraft during approach or departure. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: The airport reference point is officially assigned an elevation of **90.65 meters above sea level**. This serves as the baseline for all elevation calculations in the regulation.

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances. The specific boundaries of these lands are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, and are based on the **Campbell River Airport Zoning Plan No. (Z) B.C. 1594**, dated April 12, 1983, covering sheets 1 to 13.

The boundary description is a detailed legal description of land parcels, using standard survey terminology. It spans across multiple sections and townships in the Comox District, referencing specific lots, roads, and property boundaries (e.g., Willow Creek Road, Erickson Road, Harrogate Road, Holm Road, etc.). The full boundary runs in a complex, multi-directional path, ultimately returning to the starting point.

This ensures that the regulated zone is clearly demarcated and includes all land that may impact airport operations.

### **Regulatory Provisions**

#### **1. Elevation Restrictions on Structures and Objects**

No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing ones) on any land within the regulated zone **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

- The **approach surface** (for each end of the runway),
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surface**.

This restriction is critical to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during approach, landing, or departure.

> **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) that naturally exceeds any of these surfaces may be permitted, but the **Minister of Transport may require the owner or occupier to remove** any excessive growth that poses a safety hazard.

#### **2. Prohibition of Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**

No owner or occupier of land within the regulated zone may allow the land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

This provision is essential to prevent bird strikes, which are a major safety risk for aviation operations.

### **Key Safety Features and Design Elements**

#### **Approach Surfaces**
- **Runway 11 (northbound approach)**: Inclined at **1:50** (1 meter rise per 50 meters run) to the outer surface.
- **Runway 29 (southbound approach)**: Inclined at **1:40** (1 meter rise per 40 meters run) to the outer surface.
- Both surfaces extend **3,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the runway, with outer ends **600 meters from the runway centerline**.
- After reaching the outer surface, the surface becomes horizontal, ensuring a clear zone beyond the approach path.

#### **Outer Surface**
- Maintains a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP (90.65 m A.S.L.)**, i.e., **140.65 meters above sea level**.
- If this elevation would be **less than 9 meters above ground**, the surface is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic or unsafe requirements in low-lying areas.

#### **Transitional Surface**
- Extends from the **lateral edges of the strip** and its approach surfaces.
- Rises at a **1:7 gradient** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally).
- Connects smoothly to the outer surface, forming a buffer zone that prevents obstructions near the runway edges.

#### **Strip Dimensions**
- **Length**: 1,644 meters
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline)
- Centerline of runway 11–29 is used as the reference axis for all directional measurements.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

These regulations are designed to:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by minimizing visual and physical obstructions during critical flight phases (approach, landing, takeoff).
2. **Protect aircraft from hazards** such as terrain, trees, buildings, or debris that could interfere with flight paths.
3. **Prevent bird-related incidents** by restricting waste disposal that attracts birds.
4. **Provide clear, measurable boundaries** for land use and development control, enabling consistent enforcement and planning.

The use of **imaginary surfaces** (approach, transitional, outer) allows for precise, standardized safety zones that are not dependent on physical terrain but are instead based on calculated geometric and elevation parameters.

### **Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** is responsible for:
  - Enforcing the regulations.
  - Issuing directives to remove excessive natural growth.
- The regulations are enforceable through land use planning and development approvals.
- Any violation may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the Minister.

### **Conclusion**

The **Campbell River Airport Zoning Regulations** constitute a comprehensive, technically precise, and safety-focused set of rules governing land use and development near the airport. By defining clear elevation limits, geometric surfaces, and prohibited land uses, the regulations ensure that the airport remains safe and operational for all aircraft.

They reflect a balance between **aviation safety**, **environmental protection**, and **practical land use**, and serve as a model for airport zoning in other regions of British Columbia and Canada.
