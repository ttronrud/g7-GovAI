The regulation you provided is a formal transfer of administrative responsibility within the Canadian public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. Below is a detailed summary of its key elements and implications:

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the federal government to reassign control and supervision of certain public service functions or offices between different ministers or government entities.

This indicates that the transfer is not a unilateral decision but one formally authorized by legislation and approved through the standard constitutional and administrative processes of the Canadian government.

---

**2. Subject of the Transfer:**

- The office being transferred is the **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution**.
- This office is a key component of the public service responsible for overseeing the federal government’s response to the legacy of Indian residential schools in Canada.
- The office is tasked with implementing policies, managing reconciliation initiatives, and coordinating with Indigenous communities, federal departments, and external stakeholders related to the historical trauma and systemic harm caused by the residential school system.

---

**3. Transfer of Control and Supervision:**

- The **control and supervision** of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution are being transferred from the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** to the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**.

This is a significant administrative shift because:
- The **President of the Queen’s Privy Council** is a senior, non-ministerial figure who serves as the head of the federal executive branch and is responsible for the overall coordination of government operations, including the oversight of key policy offices and interdepartmental initiatives.
- The transfer suggests that the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution is being elevated to a **strategic, cross-departmental, and high-level policy priority**, requiring oversight that transcends the usual ministerial structure.

---

**4. Effective Date:**

- The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**.
- This date marks the beginning of the Office’s new administrative framework under the President of the Privy Council, signaling a formal institutional shift in governance and accountability.

---

**5. Significance and Context:**

- The transfer occurred in the early years of Canada’s national reconciliation efforts following the release of the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Reports** (which began in 2008, but the groundwork was laid earlier).
- Although the TRC was formally established later, the creation of a dedicated office to manage the residential school issue was a critical step in institutionalizing accountability and reconciliation.
- By placing the office under the President of the Privy Council, the government signaled that this issue was not merely a departmental concern but a **national priority requiring high-level coordination and political oversight**.

---

**6. Implications:**

- **Enhanced Oversight**: The President of the Privy Council can ensure that the office operates with a broader view of federal policy and interdepartmental alignment.
- **Policy Continuity and Accountability**: The transfer ensures that the office maintains a consistent and accountable role in the implementation of federal commitments related to Indigenous reconciliation.
- **Symbolic Importance**: The move reflects a shift in government priorities, recognizing the residential school issue as central to Canada’s national identity and moral responsibility.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a formal and legally binding transfer of administrative authority over the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution from a ministerial department to a senior, non-ministerial office within the federal executive. It underscores the government’s commitment to addressing the legacy of residential schools through a centralized, high-level, and accountable mechanism. The effective date of December 12, 2003, marks the beginning of a significant phase in Canada’s reconciliation journey, laying the foundation for future policy development and implementation in this area.

> Note: While the regulation is dated 2003, it is important to note that the full scope of reconciliation efforts, including the TRC’s 94 Calls to Action, would later evolve significantly. This transfer, however, represents one of the earliest formal institutional steps to establish dedicated federal oversight of the residential school issue.
