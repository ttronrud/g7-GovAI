**Detailed Summary of the Specialized Financing (Retail Associations) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Cooperative Credit Associations Act (Act)**:

- **Section 389a**
- **Section 396a**
- **Section 463b**

The regulations are part of a broader framework designed to regulate **specialized financing activities** conducted by **retail associations** — cooperatives that primarily serve members through retail sales and financial services.

The regulations were enacted under **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 314 and s. 339**, and are referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 48** (the original Act). They came into force on **October 24, 2001**, following the enactment of sections 389, 396, and 463 of the Act by the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*, 2001.

### **2. Key Definitions**

Several key terms are defined to clarify the scope and application of the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value reported on an entity’s balance sheet on an **unconsolidated basis**. This is the primary metric used to assess financial exposure. *(Note: "Book value" was repealed in SOR/2008-168, s. 11)* |
| **Specialized financing entity of the retail association** | An entity that is either: <br> - Controlled by the retail association, or <br> - In which the retail association holds a **substantial investment**. |
| **Subsidiary** | A subsidiary of a retail association **does not include** a specialized financing entity. This distinction is critical for scope and capital calculations. |

> **Note on "Specialized financing entity" in subsection 386(1)**:  
> It is defined more broadly as an entity that acquires or holds shares in entities that a retail association may acquire control of or increase its investment in under **subsection 388(4)** of the Act. This creates a **chain of risk exposure** that extends beyond direct ownership.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to two main areas:

1. **Specialized financing activities** under **subsection 388(4)** of the Act.
2. **Ownership by a retail association** of shares or ownership interests in a **specialized financing entity** under **paragraph 390(2)(b)** of the Act.

Thus, the rules govern both the **activities** of retail associations in financing and the **ownership structures** they can establish through specialized financing entities.

---

### **4. Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

A retail association **shall not** engage in the following by way of specialized financing activities:

#### **(a) Prohibited Entities to Acquire Control Of or Invest In**
The retail association cannot acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in, any entity that:
- Falls under **any of paragraphs 390(1)(a) to (h)** of the Act (e.g., entities involved in certain financial or insurance services);
- Is **primarily engaged in leasing motor vehicles** in Canada for credit extension or financing a customer’s acquisition of a vehicle;
- Is **primarily engaged in temporary possession** of personal property (including motor vehicles) for purposes **other than financing acquisition**;
- Acts as an **insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

> This excludes entities that provide financing through vehicle leasing or temporary possession, which are considered to fall outside the scope of retail financing and may pose systemic or consumer protection risks.

---

### **5. Holding Period Restrictions**

- A retail association **shall not hold control of, or make a substantial investment in**, any entity via specialized financing activities for **more than 13 consecutive years**.

> This prevents long-term, static exposure to certain financial risks and ensures periodic review and diversification of investment portfolios.

---

### **6. Capital Exposure Limits**

To prevent excessive risk concentration, the regulations impose **capital-based thresholds** on the retail association’s exposure.

#### **(i) Aggregate Balance Sheet Value Limit**
- The **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by:
  - The retail association,
  - Any subsidiary of the retail association,
  - Any specialized financing entity of the retail association,
  in a single entity **shall not exceed $250 million**.

> This cap limits the total financial exposure to any one entity.

#### **(ii) 10% Regulatory Capital Threshold**
If the sum of the following exceeds **10% of the retail association’s regulatory capital**, the activity is prohibited:
1. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares the retail association and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity;
2. The aggregate value of **outstanding loans** made by the retail association and its subsidiaries to specialized financing entities of the retail association;
3. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares held by the retail association and its subsidiaries in:
   - Specialized financing entities,
   - Entities controlled by the retail association via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the retail association holds a substantial investment via specialized financing.

> This ensures that financing activities do not create excessive leverage or exposure relative to the association’s capital base.

#### **(iii) 25% Regulatory Capital Threshold (for entities controlled by or invested in by specialized financing entities)**
If the sum of the following exceeds **25% of the retail association’s regulatory capital**, the activity is prohibited:
1. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares held by the retail association and its subsidiaries in:
   - The specialized financing entity,
   - Entities controlled by that entity,
   - Entities in which that entity holds a substantial investment;
2. The aggregate value of **outstanding loans** made by the retail association and its subsidiaries to:
   - The specialized financing entity,
   - Entities controlled by it,
   - Entities in which it holds a substantial investment.

> This is a stricter threshold applied when the retail association's exposure is **indirect**, through a specialized financing entity.

#### **(iv) 25% Regulatory Capital Threshold (for direct investments in non-specialized entities)**
If the sum of the following exceeds **25% of the retail association’s regulatory capital**, the retail association shall not acquire control of or make a substantial investment in an entity **unless** the investment is made through a specialized financing entity:
1. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares the retail association and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity;
2. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares held by the retail association and its subsidiaries in:
   - Entities controlled by the retail association via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the retail association holds a substantial investment via specialized financing,
   - *Excluding* entities acquired through a specialized financing entity;
3. The aggregate value of outstanding loans made to:
   - Entities controlled by the retail association via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the retail association holds a substantial investment via specialized financing,
   - *Excluding* those made to entities acquired via a specialized financing entity.

> This rule ensures that **only investments through specialized financing entities** are permitted when the exposure exceeds 25% of capital, thereby limiting direct risk exposure.

### **7. Restrictions on Specialized Financing Entities (Subsidiaries of Specialized Entities)**

A retail association shall not acquire or hold control of a **specialized financing entity** if:

#### **(a) Debt-to-Asset Ratio Exceeds Threshold**
- The **value of outstanding debt obligations** (excluding those payable to the retail association or entities controlled by it) of:
  - The specialized financing entity, and
  - Any specialized financing entity it controls,
  exceeds **twice** the value of:
  - The **excess of assets over liabilities** of the specialized financing entity (on an unconsolidated basis), and
  - The **non-controlling interests** in the specialized financing entity (on a consolidated basis).

> This ensures that specialized financing entities maintain a **sound financial structure** and are not over-leveraged.

#### **(b) Control or Investment in Prohibited Entities**
- The specialized financing entity must **not control or hold ownership interests** in any of the entities listed in paragraphs **(a) to (d)** of the prohibited list (e.g., leasing, temporary possession, insurance brokerage).

#### **(c) $250 Million Balance Sheet Value Cap**
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares and ownership interests (excluding those held by the specialized financing entity in its own specialized financing entities) held by the retail association, the specialized financing entity, subsidiaries, and other specialized financing entities in an entity **controlled or invested in by the specialized financing entity** must not exceed **$250 million**.

#### **(d) 10% Regulatory Capital Threshold**
- The sum of the values under paragraphs **(a) to (c)** above must not exceed **10% of the retail association’s regulatory capital**.

#### **(e) 25% Regulatory Capital Threshold**
- The sum of the values under paragraphs **(7)(a) and (b)** must not exceed **25% of the retail association’s regulatory capital**.

> These thresholds are applied to ensure that **risk is contained** even at the level of specialized financing entities.
