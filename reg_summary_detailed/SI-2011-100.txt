**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Domestic Help Charities Remission Order**

**Legal Basis and Authority**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision empowers the Governor General to make orders in the public interest, particularly in matters related to financial administration and taxation.

The regulation is formally published as **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)** and is referenced in **R.S., c. F-11** (the *Financial Administration Act*), indicating its status as a statutory instrument under federal financial governance.

**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to provide **tax relief** to certain registered charities that were previously involved in the **Financial Assistance Program for Domestic Help Services** in Quebec. Specifically, it grants a **remission (forgiveness) of the revocation tax** owed by qualifying charities that voluntarily chose to revoke their charitable status under specific conditions.

**Key Definitions**  
1. **Registered Charity**:  
   - Has the same meaning as defined in **subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act**.  
   - Refers to an organization that has been formally recognized and approved by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as a registered charitable organization under Canadian tax law. These organizations are generally exempt from income tax and may receive tax-deductible donations.

2. **Revocation Tax**:  
   - Defined under **subsection 188(1.1) of the Income Tax Act**.  
   - This tax is imposed when a registered charity voluntarily revokes its registration. The tax is typically a percentage of the charity’s net assets at the time of revocation and is intended to ensure that the government recovers value from the loss of charitable status.

---

**Eligibility Criteria**  
A person (typically a registered charity) is eligible for remission of the revocation tax if **all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Prior Registration Status**:  
   - The organization was a **registered charity before the coming into force of this Order**.  
   - This ensures that the organization had legal charitable status and was subject to the Income Tax Act’s charitable provisions prior to the implementation of the Order.

2. **Participation in the Financial Assistance Program for Domestic Help Services**:  
   - The organization was a **participant in the Financial Assistance Program for Domestic Help Services**, established by the **Quebec Department of Health and Social Services**, prior to the Order coming into force.  
   - This program provided financial support to individuals providing domestic help (e.g., housekeeping, caregiving, etc.) in Quebec. Charities that participated in this program were directly involved in supporting domestic workers, often through funding or administrative roles.

3. **Timely Written Application for Revocation of Registration**:  
   - The charity must submit a **written application to revoke its registration** with the **Minister of National Revenue** (CRA) **within nine months** of the Order coming into force.  
   - This requirement ensures that the revocation is not arbitrary and occurs within a defined, reasonable timeframe.

4. **Timely Written Application for Remission**:  
   - The charity must also submit a **written application for remission of the revocation tax** to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **nine months** of the Order coming into force.  
   - This dual application process ensures that the request for tax relief is both intentional and formally documented.

**Key Provisions and Implications**  

- **Remission of Revocation Tax**:  
  - The Order grants a **full remission (forgiveness)** of the revocation tax that would otherwise be payable by eligible charities.  
  - This effectively eliminates the financial penalty associated with revoking charitable status, which was previously a significant cost for organizations that chose to discontinue their charitable operations.

- **Public Interest Justification**:  
  - The Governor General acts "in the public interest," indicating that the policy aims to address broader social or administrative concerns—such as the need to support domestic workers, streamline charitable operations, or respond to changes in service delivery within Quebec’s social welfare system.

- **Time Limit (Nine Months)**:  
  - The strict nine-month deadline for both revocation and remission applications ensures that the Order is implemented in a timely and administratively feasible manner. It also prevents indefinite or speculative claims.

- **Exclusivity of Eligibility**:  
  - Only charities that both **participated in the domestic help program** and **had prior charitable registration** are eligible. This ensures that the remission is targeted and not broadly applied.

**Context and Background**  
This Order reflects a historical policy response to the evolving landscape of social services in Quebec. In the 1990s, there was a shift in how domestic help services were funded and administered. Charities that had previously provided financial or administrative support to domestic workers through the Financial Assistance Program may have decided to exit the charitable sector due to changes in funding, operational challenges, or policy realignments.

By offering tax relief upon revocation, the government acknowledges the legitimate reasons for such decisions and reduces the financial burden on organizations that transitioned out of charitable status.

**Conclusion**  
The *Quebec Domestic Help Charities Remission Order* is a targeted, time-bound, and conditionally based tax relief measure designed to support charities that participated in a specific social assistance program. It provides a clear pathway for such organizations to legally revoke their charitable status without facing the financial penalty of the revocation tax—provided they meet strict eligibility and application requirements. The Order balances fiscal responsibility with public interest, recognizing the unique role of these charities in supporting domestic workers in Quebec.

This regulation remains a notable example of how federal tax policy can be adapted to address regional social needs and support the transition of charitable organizations in response to changing public service models.
