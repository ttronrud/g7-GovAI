The regulation you have provided is a formal government designation under Canadian statutory law, specifically related to the administration of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA). Below is a detailed summary of its content, purpose, legal basis, and implications:

**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

1. **Issuing Authority**  
   The regulation is issued by *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister** of Canada. This means that the Governor General, as the representative of the Crown, formally approves and signs the regulation following advice from the federal government’s executive leadership—specifically the Prime Minister.

2. **Legal Basis**  
   The designation is made pursuant to **Section 4 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**.  
   - Section 4 of the IRPA empowers the Governor General in Council to designate a Minister of the Crown as responsible for administering the Act.  
   - This provision ensures that there is a clearly designated individual accountable for the implementation, interpretation, and enforcement of immigration and refugee policies under the Act.

3. **Designated Minister**  
   The **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** is officially designated as the **Minister responsible for the administration of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act**.  
   - This role grants the Minister authority over all aspects of immigration policy, including processing applications, setting immigration priorities, managing refugee claims, and overseeing the operations of immigration services.

4. **Membership in the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**  
   The regulation explicitly states that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**.  
   - This is a formal recognition of the Minister’s status as a senior official with access to confidential government information and the authority to act on behalf of the Crown in administrative and policy matters.  
   - Membership in the Privy Council is a constitutional and ceremonial designation that underscores the Minister’s role in the executive branch and enhances their legitimacy in policy-making and governance.

5. **Effective Date**  
   The designation becomes effective on **December 6, 2001**.  
   - This date marks the point at which the Minister begins to formally exercise the responsibilities and authorities conferred by the IRPA.  
   - The delay between the assent date (November 1, 2001) and the effective date (December 6, 2001) is typical in government processes, allowing for internal administrative preparations, staff training, and policy alignment.

6. **Statutory Reference**  
   The regulation is cited as **Chapter 27 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001**, and was assented to on November 1, 2001.  
   - This means it is an official law enacted and published in the annual compilation of Canadian statutes for that year.  
   - It is publicly accessible and legally binding, forming part of the federal legal framework governing immigration and refugee matters.

**Purpose and Significance:**

- This regulation establishes a clear line of accountability in the federal government’s immigration system.  
- It ensures that the administration of the IRPA is centralized under a single, designated minister, which improves coordination, policy consistency, and public transparency.  
- It reflects the evolving structure of Canada’s immigration governance, particularly in the post-1998 reorganization of immigration services, where the responsibilities of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration were consolidated and formalized.

---

**Context and Background:**

- The *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* came into force in 2001 as a comprehensive replacement for the older *Immigration Act*, modernizing Canada’s immigration and refugee framework.  
- The 2001 designation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration as the responsible minister was part of the broader legislative and administrative transition to implement the new Act.  
- At the time, Canada was restructuring its immigration system to improve efficiency, fairness, and integration of newcomers.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally assigns the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** as the key official responsible for administering the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*, effective December 6, 2001. It is grounded in statutory authority (Section 4 of the IRPA), approved by the Governor General in Council on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serves to ensure effective, accountable, and centralized governance of Canada’s immigration and refugee policies. The designation also affirms the Minister’s status within the federal executive and the Privy Council, reinforcing their authority and role in shaping national immigration policy.

Note: While the regulation is dated 2001, it remains legally relevant as the foundational designation for the administration of the IRPA. Subsequent ministerial changes or reorganizations may have led to updates in ministerial responsibilities, but the core structure established by this regulation remains a key part of Canada’s immigration governance framework.
