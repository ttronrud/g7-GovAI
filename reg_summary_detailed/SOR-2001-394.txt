## 📊 Valuation Principles

### 1. **Book Value of Real Property Interests**
For sections 7–10 of the regulations:
- The **book value** of an asset (real property or security/loan) is calculated based on the balance sheet of the society prepared in accordance with the **Superintendent’s accounting principles** (as defined in subsection 331(4) of the ICA).
- **Real property**: Gross book value minus accumulated depreciation.
- **Securities or loans**: Book value as reported on the balance sheet.

> This ensures consistency in financial reporting and valuation across entities.

## 🔐 Investment Limits (Section 563, 565, 566)

### ✅ **Section 563 – Maximum Investment in Financial Institutions**
- A society may not invest more than **15% of its total assets** in:
  - Financial institutions, or
  - Subsidiaries of financial institutions (except where the subsidiary is a financial institution only because it is a subsidiary of the society).

> **Purpose**: Prevents over-concentration of risk in financial institutions, which could threaten the solvency of the society.

### ✅ **Section 565 – Maximum Investment in Participating Shares and Ownership Interests**
- A society may not hold more than **25% of the total assets** in participating shares or ownership interests in:
  - Financial institutions, or
  - Subsidiaries of financial institutions (same exclusion rule applies).

> **Note**: These limits apply to **prescribed subsidiaries** — i.e., those that are not financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions solely due to their status as society subsidiaries.

> **Valuation**: The value of such shares and interests is taken as their **book value** on the **consolidated balance sheet** of the society.

## 🏡 Interests in Real Property (Part XII of the ICA – Sections 7 to 11)

This section defines what constitutes an "interest of a society in real property" and how those interests are valued. It expands beyond direct ownership to include debts, guarantees, and loans tied to real estate.

---

### ✅ Types of Interests in Real Property

#### 1. **Direct Ownership or Debt for Acquisition/Improvement**
- Real property **beneficially owned** by the society or a designated entity.
- A **debt obligation** issued by the society or a designated entity to finance real property acquisition or improvement.

> **Valuation**:
> - For real property: Book value (gross value minus depreciation).
> - For debt: The amount by which the **book value of the debt exceeds** the book value of the real property.

---

#### 2. **Interests in Related Real Property Entities (Joint Ventures or Subsidiaries)**
- Real property owned by:
  - A **related real property entity** that is a **joint venture**, or
  - An entity where a designated entity has a substantial investment.
- Shares or ownership interests in such entities held by the society or a designated entity.

> **Valuation**:
> - Real property: Book value.
> - Shares/ownership interests: Book value of the shares or interests.

---

#### 3. **Debt Obligations, Loans, and Guarantees**
These include various types of financial instruments linked to real property:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Debt issued by a related real property entity** | Owned by society or designated entity. |
| **Loan made by society or designated entity** to a related real property entity or to a real property entity where a financial institution controlled by the society has a substantial investment. |
| **Guaranteed debt obligation** | Issued by a related real property entity, beneficially owned by a third party, but **guaranteed** by the society or a designated entity. |
| **Guaranteed loan** | Made by a third party to a related real property entity, **guaranteed** by the society or a designated entity. |

> **Valuation**:
> - For debt/loan: Book value.
> - For **guaranteed obligations**:
>   - If the entity owns real property that is an interest of the society:  
>     → Amount by which **face value of guarantee exceeds** value of real property (per paragraph 8(2)(a)).
>   - Otherwise: Face value of guarantee.

---

#### 4. **Secured Loans or Debts**

  - The society;
  - A designated entity;
  - A related real property entity;
  - A financial institution controlled by the society;
  - An entity controlled by a financial institution (subparagraph iv);
  - A real property entity described in 9(1)(c)(i) or (ii);

>   - Lesser of:
>     1. Net realizable value of third party’s interest in the real property at time of security creation;  
>     2. A formula that includes:
>        - Book value of the loan (if made by society or owned by society);  
>        - Face value of guarantee (if guaranteed by society);  
>        - Minus total net realizable value of other security interests given for the same loan.
> - For **shares/ownership interests as security**:
>   - Lesser of:
>     1. Net realizable value of third party’s interest in shares at time of security;  
>     2. A formula involving:
>        - Book value or guarantee face value;  
>        - Net realizable value of entity’s interest in real property;  
>        - Value of shares given as security;  
>        - Total outstanding shares.
> - For **related real property entity shares**:
>   - Same formula, with adjustments for entity-level ownership.
