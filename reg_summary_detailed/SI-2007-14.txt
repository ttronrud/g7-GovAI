**Detailed Summary of the Softwood Lumber Products Charge on Duty Deposit Refunds Remission Order, No. 2**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act**.  
- The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Minister for International Trade**) has the power to make orders related to the administration of charges under the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006*.
- The Order is specifically designed to address the **remission (forgiveness or cancellation)** of certain portions of the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge (commonly referred to as the "softwood charge") in specific circumstances involving duty deposit refunds.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to **grant remission of the charge** on a portion of the softwood lumber export charge that relates to **interest accrued after October 11, 2006**, and any interest that may have been paid or payable in respect of that portion — **but only if the specified person does not sell their rights to the duty deposit refund**.

This provision aims to:
- Provide relief to certain Canadian businesses (specifically those with duty deposit refunds) who have incurred interest on the charge after a key date (October 11, 2006).
- Prevent double recovery or unjust enrichment by ensuring that interest on post-October 11, 2006, charges is not compounded unnecessarily.
- Encourage compliance with the rules around the sale or transfer of duty deposit refund rights.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006*. This is the foundational legislation that establishes the charge on softwood lumber exports and governs the rules around duty deposits, refunds, and charges. |
| **Duty Deposit Refund** | Has the same meaning as defined in **subsection 18(1)** of the Act. This refers to a refund of a duty deposit paid by a business (typically a Canadian exporter) when the export of softwood lumber is completed and the conditions for refund are met. The refund is generally returned to the business after the export is verified. |
| **Specified Person** | Has the same meaning as in subsection 18(1) of the Act. This refers to a business or entity that is eligible to receive a duty deposit refund under the Act and is subject to the charge. The term typically includes exporters or processors of softwood lumber products. |

> *Note: The definitions ensure consistency with the original Act and prevent ambiguity in how the Order applies.*

### **4. Scope of Remission**

The Order grants **remission of the charge** under the following conditions:

- The remission applies to **a portion of the charge** that was paid or is payable by a specified person.
- This portion relates specifically to:
  - **Interest that accrued after October 11, 2006**, and
  - Any **interest paid or payable** in respect of that interest.
- The remission is **only granted if** the specified person **does not sell or transfer their rights** to the duty deposit refund to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

> In other words:  
> If a business keeps its right to the duty deposit refund (i.e., does not sell or assign it to the Government), then the Government will **forgive or cancel** the charge (and the interest on that charge) that relates to interest accrued after October 11, 2006.

---

### **5. Key Conditions and Exclusions**

- **No remission if the rights to the duty deposit refund are sold or assigned** to the Government.  
  This means that if a business sells or transfers its entitlement to the refund to the federal government (e.g., in a commercial transaction), the remission does **not** apply. The government retains the right to collect the full charge and any associated interest.

- The remission applies **only to interest** that accrued **after October 11, 2006**.  
  Interest prior to that date is not covered by this Order.

- The remission is **not a refund of the original charge**, but rather a **remission of the charge on interest** — meaning the business is not required to pay the interest portion of the charge after that date.

### **6. Implications for Stakeholders**

#### For Exporters/Specified Persons:
- If you are a Canadian exporter or processor of softwood lumber and you have a duty deposit refund:
  - You may be eligible for remission of the charge related to interest that accrued after **October 11, 2006**.
  - This can reduce your overall financial burden, especially if interest was compounded.
  - **You must not sell or assign** your right to the duty deposit refund to the Government to qualify.

#### For the Government:
- The government is effectively reducing its collection of interest on softwood export charges for a defined period and group of businesses.
- It maintains control over the charge system by ensuring that only those who retain their refund rights benefit from this remission.

### **7. Historical Context**
- The **Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006** was introduced to address trade imbalances and protect Canadian forests by placing a charge on softwood lumber exports.
- The charge was initially controversial due to its impact on exporters and its effect on international trade.
- This Order is part of a broader effort to **refine the administration** of the charge, particularly in relation to **interest and refund mechanisms**, and to provide **fairness and relief** to businesses that have not transferred their rights to the government.

### **8. Legal Citation**
- **Statutory Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
  (Note: This citation may reflect the original enabling legislation or a reference to the Financial Administration Act, though the actual Order is dated 2006 or later — the citation may require verification in official sources.)

### **Conclusion**

This Order provides a targeted relief mechanism for Canadian softwood lumber exporters who are eligible for duty deposit refunds and who have not sold their rights to those refunds. It specifically forgives the portion of the export charge that relates to **interest accrued after October 11, 2006**, thereby reducing the financial burden on qualifying businesses. However, this relief is conditional: it does **not apply** if the business assigns or sells its right to the duty deposit refund to the Government.

This reflects a balance between **government revenue collection** and **fair treatment of exporters**, especially in the context of interest accumulation over time. It is a practical administrative tool to ensure compliance and fairness in the softwood lumber export charge regime.
