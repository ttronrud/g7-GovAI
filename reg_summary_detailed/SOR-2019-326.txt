**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Pugnose Shiner (Notropis anogenus) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Framework**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **Section 58**, which governs the identification, protection, and management of **critical habitat** for wildlife species listed as at risk.

- **Species Involved**: The **Pugnose Shiner** (*Notropis anogenus*), a freshwater fish species classified as **threatened** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29).
- **Legal Basis**: The Order is made pursuant to **Sections 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA, which empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate critical habitat and to exclude certain areas from such designation when necessary due to specific legal or policy considerations.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **A. Critical Habitat Designation**
- The Order formally designates the **critical habitat** for the Pugnose Shiner, as identified in its **recovery strategy**.
- This recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the scientific basis for the critical habitat designation.

#### **B. Exclusion of Specific Areas from Critical Habitat Designation**
- Under **Section 58(2)(b)** of SARA, certain areas may be excluded from critical habitat designation if they are:
  - **Protected or reserved** for public use or conservation purposes (e.g., national parks, wildlife areas).
- The Order **excludes specific portions** of the Pugnose Shiner’s critical habitat located within:
  1. **Thousand Islands National Park of Canada**  
     – As defined in **Part 5 of Schedule 1 to the Canada National Parks Act**.
  2. **Big Creek Unit** of:
     - **Big Creek National Wildlife Area**
     - **Long Point National Wildlife Area**
     - **St. Clair Unit** of **St. Clair National Wildlife Area**
     - **Wellers Bay National Wildlife Area**
     – All of these are described in **Part IV of Schedule I to the Wildlife Area Regulations**.

> These exclusions are legally required under **Section 58(5)** of SARA, which mandates that any critical habitat designation must not interfere with lands set aside for protected or public purposes.

### **3. Consultation Requirements Met**

The Order reflects a comprehensive consultation process required under SARA:

- **Consultation with Parks Canada (Minister of the Environment)**  
  – Required under **Section 58(5)** because the proposed critical habitat includes areas within national parks and wildlife areas managed by Parks Canada.

- **Consultation with Indigenous Partners**  
  – Under **Section 58(7)**, the MFO consulted with:
    - The **Minister of Indigenous Services**
    - The **specific Indigenous band** whose traditional lands or rights may be affected by the Order.
  – This ensures that Indigenous interests, rights, and traditional uses are respected and considered in the decision-making process.

> This reflects SARA’s commitment to **Indigenous engagement** and **co-governance** in species recovery and habitat protection.

### **4. Scope and Application of the Order**

- **Applicability**:  
  Section 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Pugnose Shiner **except** for the excluded areas listed above.
  
- **Effect**:  
  The Order establishes that:
  - The designated critical habitat (excluding the specified protected areas) is legally recognized and protected under SARA.
  - Any activities that may adversely affect this critical habitat (e.g., development, pollution, habitat degradation) are subject to review and approval under SARA’s regulatory framework.

- **Excluded Areas** are **not** considered part of the critical habitat for the Pugnose Shiner. This means:
  - These areas are **not subject to the same regulatory protections** under SARA as the rest of the habitat.
  - However, they remain protected under their **existing management frameworks** (e.g., national parks, wildlife areas), which provide their own environmental safeguards.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal laws).

---

### **6. Purpose and Significance**

This Order serves several key purposes:

1. **Species Recovery**: By clearly identifying and protecting the essential habitat required for the survival and recovery of the Pugnose Shiner, the Order supports its long-term conservation.

2. **Balancing Conservation with Land Use**: It demonstrates how SARA can protect at-risk species while respecting the existing legal status of protected lands (national parks, wildlife areas), avoiding conflicts with federal land management.

3. **Compliance with Legal and Policy Obligations**: It fulfills SARA’s requirement for consultation with both environmental agencies and Indigenous communities, reinforcing legal accountability and inclusive decision-making.

4. **Transparency and Public Access**: By referencing the recovery strategy in the Public Registry, the Order ensures that the scientific rationale and geographic details are publicly available and accessible.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Critical Habitat of the Pugnose Shiner (Notropis anogenus) Order**, issued on **September 6, 2019**, is a legally binding instrument that:

- Designates critical habitat for a threatened fish species;
- Excludes specific protected areas (national parks and wildlife units) from this designation due to their status as reserves or protected lands;
- Ensures compliance with SARA’s consultation and exclusion provisions;
- Supports the recovery of the Pugnose Shiner while respecting environmental, administrative, and Indigenous rights.

This Order is a key step in the broader recovery strategy for the species and exemplifies how federal environmental legislation can balance biodiversity protection with land-use and Indigenous governance frameworks.
