**Detailed Summary of the "Import of Eggs Permit" Regulation**

---

**1. Official Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Import of Eggs Permit* and may be cited as **General Import Permit No. 8**. This designation establishes the legal basis and reference number for the permit.

---

**2. Scope of Authorization**  
This General Import Permit authorizes any individual (including individuals, businesses, or organizations) to import eggs into Canada, provided the following conditions are met:

- **Quantity Limitation**:  
  The maximum quantity of eggs that may be imported in a single non-commercial transaction is **two dozen (24 eggs)**.  
  - *Note*: The term "non-commercial importation" is key. This means the import is not for resale, commercial distribution, or business purposes. It typically applies to personal, household, or private use.  
  - Commercial imports (e.g., for sale or distribution) are explicitly excluded under this permit and would require a different regulatory pathway.

- **Specialty Food Exception**:  
  Eggs that are **encased in mud or other natural materials** (such as clay, soil, or organic substances) and are used for **specialty food purposes** may be imported under this permit.  
  - This exception recognizes the cultural or culinary significance of such eggs (e.g., traditional or artisanal eggs like "mud eggs" used in certain regional cuisines).  
  - The key requirement here is that the encasement must **preserve the quality** of the eggs, ensuring they remain safe and suitable for consumption.  
  - This provision allows for the import of unique, non-standard eggs that are not typically available in conventional markets.

---

**3. Revocation Status**  
- This permit was **revoked** by **Statutory Instrument No. 89-139, Section 1**.  
  - This means the regulation is **no longer in force** as of the date of revocation.  
  - Any current or future importation of eggs under the authority of this permit is **invalid and not legally permissible**.

---

**4. Customs Entry Requirements**  
Where a customs entry form is required for eggs imported under this permit, the form must be **endorsed** with one of the following statements:  
- "Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 8"  
- "Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d'importation no 8"  
  - This endorsement serves as a formal declaration and documentation of compliance with the permit’s conditions.  
  - It ensures that customs authorities are aware of the specific permit under which the import was made.

**Important Implications and Interpretation**  

- **Current Legal Status**:  
  Since the permit was revoked under SI/89-139, **this regulation is no longer valid**. Any attempt to use it to import eggs into Canada would be **illegal or non-compliant** with current Canadian import laws.

- **Replacement Regulations**:  
  Current egg importation into Canada is governed by more comprehensive and up-to-date regulations, including those under the *Customs Act*, *Food and Drugs Act*, and *Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) guidelines*. These may include requirements for food safety, labeling, origin, and health standards.

- **Commercial vs. Personal Imports**:  
  The original permit only allowed non-commercial imports of up to two dozen eggs. Commercial imports require formal licensing and compliance with food safety and trade regulations.

- **Specialty Foods**:  
  The exception for mud-encased eggs is likely a historical or niche provision that has been superseded. Modern importation of specialty or traditional foods would now require approval under current food safety and customs frameworks, not this revoked permit.

**Conclusion**  
The *Import of Eggs Permit* (General Import Permit No. 8) was a temporary or limited authorization allowing individuals to import up to two dozen eggs for personal use or specialty food items encased in mud or similar materials. However, **this permit has been formally revoked** and is **no longer in effect**. Therefore, it cannot be used as a legal basis for importing eggs into Canada today. Any current egg imports must comply with current Canadian food safety and customs regulations, which are more rigorous and comprehensive.

For compliance, importers should consult the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** or the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** for up-to-date requirements on egg imports.
