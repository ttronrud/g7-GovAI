### **Detailed Summary of the Mortgage Insurance Disclosure (Banks, Authorized Foreign Banks, Trust and Loan Companies, Retail Associations, Canadian Insurance Companies and Canadian Societies) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Legislative Authority**
These regulations were established by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, to enhance **transparency in mortgage insurance arrangements** for residential mortgages in Canada. The regulations are designed to ensure that borrowers are fully informed about the **costs, benefits, and financial arrangements** related to mortgage insurance when obtaining a residential mortgage.

The authority for these regulations stems from several key pieces of federal legislation:

- **Bank Act**:
  - Subsections **418.1(3)a** and **552(3)b** – Apply to banks, authorized foreign banks, trust and loan companies, retail associations, and Canadian insurance companies and societies.
- **Cooperative Credit Associations Act**:
  - Subsection **382.2(3)d** – Applies to retail associations.
- **Insurance Companies Act**:
  - Subsections **469.1(3)f** and **542.061(3)g** – Apply to insurance companies.
- **Trust and Loan Companies Act**:
  - Subsection **418.1(3)i** – Applies to trust and loan companies.

These provisions empower the government to regulate disclosure practices related to mortgage insurance to protect consumer interests.

Every institution that **charges borrowers for mortgage insurance** must meet the following obligations:

##### **(A) Availability of Information**
- Maintain and make available at:

##### **(C) Separate Document for Each Borrower**
- Before a borrower signs a mortgage agreement, the institution must provide a **separate, clear document** containing:
  1. The information from Sections 5 to 10 **tailored to that borrower**;
  2. The **total amount** of the following, as applicable to the borrower:
     - Paragraphs **7(a), 8(c), 9(c)** and subparagraphs **10(a)(iii), (b)(iii)**;
  3. The **total percentage** of the following, as applicable to the borrower:
     - Paragraphs **7(b), 8(b), 9(b)** and subparagraphs **10(a)(ii), (b)(ii)**.

> This ensures **personalized transparency**, allowing borrowers to understand exactly how much they will pay and what the insurance costs represent.

---

#### **4. Core Disclosure Content**

Every institution must disclose the following **key information** about mortgage insurance:

1. **Coverage Provided**:
   - Who is protected (e.g., the borrower or the lender)?
   - Who pays for the insurance?

2. **Calculation of Insurance Charges**:
   - How is the amount the institution charges the borrower for mortgage insurance calculated?

3. **Other Relevant Information**:
   - Any other information that could reasonably affect the borrower’s decision (e.g., exclusions, policy limits, claims process).

> This promotes **informed decision-making** and prevents hidden or misleading costs.

---

#### **5. Business Arrangements with Insurers (Section 6)**

If an institution has a business arrangement with an insurer to receive **payments or benefits** (e.g., fees, commissions, rebates), and the insurer also provides mortgage insurance, the institution must disclose **in a single document**:

- The **nature** of the business arrangement;
- Any **payments or benefits** received (directly or indirectly) from the insurer or its affiliates under:
  - **Section 7** (e.g., fees for services);
  - **Section 8** (e.g., commissions);
  - **Section 9** (e.g., rebates);
  - **Section 10** (e.g., marketing support).

> This disclosure applies **only if** the arrangement involves payments or benefits from the insurer.

> ✅ **Exemption**: The rules do **not apply** to arrangements where the institution provides products/services to customers in the normal course of business (e.g., offering financial advice or credit products).

---

#### **6. Disclosure Based on Payment/Benefit Basis**

The level of detail required depends on **how payments or benefits are structured**.

##### **Case 1: Per Mortgage Basis (e.g., per loan)**  
If payments or benefits are received **per residential mortgage**, the institution must disclose:

- For each type of activity:
  - The **amount in dollars**;
  - For a particular borrower:
    - The **amount as a percentage** of the borrower’s mortgage insurance fee.

> Example: If a lender receives $100 per mortgage for underwriting services, and charges the borrower $1,000 for insurance, the borrower must see that $100 is 10% of the total fee.

##### **Case 2: Multi-Quarter Forecast (Fiscal Quarter Rule)**  
If, on the **first day of a fiscal quarter**, the institution has received payments or benefits from an insurer in **any of the first four fiscal quarters of the previous five quarters** (and those quarters began on or after **July 1, 2010**), then:

- Disclose:
  - Total dollar amount of payments/benefits received in those four quarters;
  - Each amount as a **percentage of total payments made to the insurer** during those quarters;
  - For each borrower: Multiply the borrower’s insurance fee by each percentage to show the **actual dollar impact**.

> This enables borrowers to understand **long-term financial impacts** of the arrangement.

##### **Case 3: Future Expectations (No Past Payments)**  
If, on the first day of a fiscal quarter, the institution has **not yet received** such payments but **expects to receive them** in that quarter or the next three:

- Must disclose:
  - Expected total dollar amount of payments/benefits over the next four quarters;
  - Each amount as a percentage of expected payments to the insurer;
  - For each borrower: Multiply their insurance fee by each percentage to show the expected dollar impact.

> This ensures transparency even in **prospective or transitional arrangements**.

##### **Case 4: Special Rule for Post-July 2010 Periods (Starting Jan 1, 2011)**  
If the fiscal quarter begins **on or after January 1, 2011**, or **includes January 1, 2011** but does not begin on that day, and the institution had **some prior quarters before July 1, 2010**, the institution must:

- If the quarter begins on or after Jan 1, 2011:
  - Disclose expected payments/benefits in that quarter and the next three;
  - Express each as a percentage of expected payments to the insurer;
  - Show the dollar impact on each borrower.

- If the quarter includes Jan 1, 2011 but does not begin on that day:
  - Disclose actual or expected payments received or expected;
  - Express as percentage of actual or expected payments to insurer;
  - Show dollar impact on each borrower.

> This rule bridges the gap between pre- and post-July 2010 data and ensures consistency in disclosure timing.

---

#### **7. Exclusions and Clarifications**

- **Excluded Payments**:  
  Payments received by the institution **as a result of a claim** made under the mortgage insurance (e.g., due to a borrower default) are **not included** in the required disclosures.

> This prevents confusion between **revenue from insurance** and **claims payouts**.

---

#### **8. General Principles for Disclosure**

- All information must be:
  - **Clear**
  - **Simple**
  - **Not misleading**

> The goal is to ensure that borrowers can easily understand the financial implications of mortgage insurance without being overwhelmed by complex jargon.
