**Detailed Summary of the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2018)**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Origin**  
This Order is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, under **subsection 117.14(1)a of the Criminal Code** (R.S.C., c. C-46). This provision allows for the declaration of an amnesty period for specific offences related to the possession or handling of prohibited firearms, provided certain conditions are met.

The Order is rooted in **Section 139 of S.C. 1995, c. 39**, which grants the Governor General the authority to make such amnesties when recommended by the Minister of Justice. This legislative framework enables the government to provide legal relief to individuals who may have violated firearm-related laws, under specific, narrowly defined circumstances.

**2. Definition of "Firearm" Covered by the Amnesty**  
The Order specifically identifies five prohibited firearms manufactured by **SAN Swiss Arms**. These firearms are classified as "prohibited" under Canadian firearms legislation due to their design, intended use, or potential for misuse. The listed models are:

- SAN Swiss Arms Model Classic Green Sniper rifle  
- SAN Swiss Arms Model Ver rifle  
- SAN Swiss Arms Model Aestas rifle  
- SAN Swiss Arms Model Autumnus rifle  
- SAN Swiss Arms Model Hiemis rifle  

These models are excluded from general civilian ownership and are subject to strict controls under the *Firearms Act*. Possession of any of these firearms without proper authorization is typically an offence.

---

**3. Eligibility for the Amnesty Period**  
An individual is eligible for the amnesty period if both of the following conditions are met:

- On the **day before the date of registration** of this Order, the person **possessed** one of the five specified prohibited firearms.  
- The individual **held a valid licence** issued under the *Firearms Act* at that time.

This means that the amnesty applies only to individuals who were legally licensed to possess the firearm *prior to the Order's registration*, and who were in possession of one of the listed SAN Swiss Arms models.

---

**4. Conditions During the Amnesty Period**  
During the declared amnesty period, the eligible individual may:

- **Possess** the firearm without fear of criminal prosecution for possession (as long as they remain licensed and comply with other requirements).  
- **Deliver** the firearm to a peace officer, a firearms officer, or a chief firearms officer for safekeeping or disposal.  
- **Sell or give** the firearm to a **business entity authorized** to acquire and possess prohibited firearms. Such entities include, but are not limited to, museums, private collectors, or other institutions approved by the Government of Canada under the *Firearms Act*.  
- **Transport** the firearm in connection with either delivering it to a peace officer, a firearms officer, or transferring it to an authorized business.

This provision ensures that individuals can legally move or transfer the firearm without violating the law during the amnesty window, promoting compliance and reducing the risk of illegal firearm trafficking.

---

**5. Duration of the Amnesty Period**  
The amnesty period begins on the **day the Order is officially registered** with the appropriate authorities (typically the day it is published in the Canada Gazette).  
It ends on **February 28, 2021**.

This creates a fixed, time-bound window during which eligible individuals may act to transfer, dispose of, or surrender their prohibited firearms without facing criminal charges related to possession or transfer.

---

**6. Legal Effect and Enforcement**  
- The Order comes into force on the day it is registered.  
- It operates as a **criminal amnesty**, meaning that any offence related to the possession, transfer, or use of the specified firearms during the period will **not be prosecuted** if the individual meets the eligibility criteria and acts within the terms of the Order.  
- The amnesty does **not** constitute a pardon or forgiveness of past offences in a general sense, but rather a specific legal relief under the *Criminal Code* for a defined class of offences tied to the possession of these particular firearms.

---

**7. Purpose and Policy Rationale**  
The primary objectives of this amnesty are:

- To **facilitate the safe and lawful transfer** of prohibited firearms from private individuals to authorized entities (such as museums or licensed collectors).  
- To **reduce the risk of illegal firearm trafficking or misuse** by removing legal barriers to disposal.  
- To **support compliance** with the *Firearms Act* by allowing individuals who may have inadvertently or legally possessed these firearms to comply with updated safety and licensing standards.  
- To provide a **practical, time-limited solution** for individuals who were operating under outdated or ambiguous licensing arrangements.

---

**8. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The amnesty applies **only** to the five specified SAN Swiss Arms models.  
- It applies **only** to individuals who held a valid licence under the *Firearms Act* at the time of the Order’s registration.  
- It does **not** cover individuals who acquired the firearm after the day before registration, or who did not have a valid licence.  
- The amnesty does **not** extend to offences such as illegal manufacturing, trafficking, or use of the firearm in a criminal context outside of the defined activities.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2018)* is a targeted, legally grounded measure designed to resolve a specific compliance issue related to the possession of five high-risk, prohibited firearms. By offering a defined window during which individuals can legally possess, transfer, or surrender these firearms without facing prosecution, the Order promotes public safety, legal clarity, and responsible firearm management. It reflects a balance between regulatory enforcement and practical solutions for individuals who were lawfully licensed but faced challenges in adapting to evolving firearm regulations.

This Order is a key example of how Canadian criminal law can be applied flexibly to address real-world issues through targeted amnesties, under the authority of the *Criminal Code*.
