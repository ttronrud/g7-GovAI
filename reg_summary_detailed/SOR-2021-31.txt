**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers Populations Order*

---

### **Legal Basis:**
The regulation is issued under **Section 58 of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)***, enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), and further clarified by amendments introduced in 2015 (S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60).

---

### **Key Background and Context:**

1. **Species at Risk:**  
   The **Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus)** — specifically the **Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population** — is designated as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**. This classification means the species is at risk of extinction in the wild and requires protection and recovery efforts.

2. **Recovery Strategy:**  
   The **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** jointly developed a **recovery strategy** for this Bull Trout population. This strategy:
   - Identifies the **critical habitat** necessary for the species’ survival and recovery.
   - Has been formally published and **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring public access and transparency.

3. **Critical Habitat and Legal Exclusion:**  
   - A portion of the identified critical habitat lies within **national parks** in Canada — specifically:
     - **Banff National Park**
     - **Waterton Lakes National Park**
     - **Jasper National Park**
   - These parks are governed under the **Canada National Parks Act**, and **Section 58(2)b** of SARA defines certain protected areas (i.e., national parks) as being **exempt from the application of critical habitat provisions**.
   - Under **Section 58(5)** of SARA, any critical habitat located in such designated national parks **must be excluded** from the formal designation in a regulatory order.

---

### **Purpose of the Order:**

This regulation serves to **formally designate the critical habitat** of the Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population — **excluding the portion located within the three national parks** mentioned above — in accordance with the requirements of SARA.

It is **not** a blanket designation of all critical habitat. Instead, it:
- Confirms the geographic extent of critical habitat based on the recovery strategy.
- **Excludes** the portion within Banff, Waterton Lakes, and Jasper National Parks due to their protected status under the Canada National Parks Act and the specific provisions of SARA.

---

### **Legal Authority:**

The Order is made pursuant to:
- **Section 58(4)**: Authority to issue an order designating critical habitat.
- **Section 58(5)**: Requirement to exclude critical habitat located in national parks (as defined in Section 58(2)b).

---

### **Scope and Application:**

- **Applies to**: The critical habitat of the **Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population**.
- **Excludes**: The portion of that critical habitat located within:
  - Banff National Park
  - Waterton Lakes National Park
  - Jasper National Park
  (as defined in **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Canada National Parks Act**)

- **Section 58(1)** of SARA applies to the remaining critical habitat — i.e., the areas **outside** the national parks — which are now formally recognized as legally protected under the Act.

---

### **Effective Date:**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (e.g., the Registrar of the Government of Canada).

---

### **Significance and Implications:**

1. **Conservation Protection:**  
   The designation ensures that the remaining critical habitat (outside national parks) is legally protected from activities that could degrade or destroy it, such as development, mining, or harmful water management practices.

2. **Balancing Conservation and Land Use:**  
   The exclusion of habitat within national parks reflects a recognition that these areas are already protected under federal park legislation and are not subject to the same level of development or disturbance. This allows for a harmonized approach between SARA and the Canada National Parks Act.

3. **Transparency and Public Access:**  
   The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the **Species at Risk Public Registry** ensures that the public, scientists, Indigenous communities, and stakeholders can access and review the scientific basis for the critical habitat designation.

4. **Recovery Efforts:**  
   This Order supports the broader recovery of the Bull Trout population by ensuring that the essential environmental conditions required for its survival are preserved and managed.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation is a key step in the conservation of the Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population. It legally recognizes and protects the critical habitat necessary for the species’ recovery, while respecting the existing protections of national parks. By excluding habitat within Banff, Waterton Lakes, and Jasper National Parks, the Order ensures compliance with SARA and avoids duplication or conflict with existing park management frameworks.

It exemplifies the collaborative and science-based approach of Canadian environmental policy in protecting endangered species while balancing land use and conservation objectives.
