---

### 9. **Pension Calculation Rules**

#### A. **For Canadians Receiving Pensions Outside Canada**
- If eligible **only through totalization**, the amount is calculated:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on **CPP pensionable earnings**.
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Calculated by multiplying the CPP flat-rate by the **fraction of contributions relative to the minimum qualifying period** (but **not exceeding 100%**).

> ✅ Ensures **proportional and fair calculation** of pension amounts.

#### B. **For Estonian Pension Recipients**
- If a person is eligible **only through totalization**, the pension is calculated **exclusively** under Estonian law, based on periods completed under Estonian legislation.
