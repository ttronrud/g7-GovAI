**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Bill of Rights Examination Regulations**

---

### **Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the *Canadian Bill of Rights Examination Regulations*. It is a procedural framework established to ensure that proposed legislation and statutory instruments in Canada are reviewed for compliance with the *Canadian Bill of Rights*—a foundational document that enshrines certain fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression, equality, and protection from arbitrary detention.

---

### **Key Definitions**
- **Minister**: Refers specifically to the **Minister of Justice**. This individual holds the responsibility for overseeing the examination process under these regulations.

---

### **Core Provisions and Procedures**

#### **1. Examination of Bills Introduced in the House of Commons**
- Whenever a **Bill** is introduced or presented to the House of Commons by a Minister of the Crown (i.e., a Cabinet minister), the **Minister of Justice** must:
  - Receive **two copies** of the Bill from the **Clerk of the House of Commons**.
  - **Immediately examine** the Bill to determine whether any of its provisions are inconsistent with the **purposes and provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights**.
  - Issue a **certificate**, in a form approved by the Minister and **signed by the Deputy Minister of Justice**, stating that the Bill has been examined as required.
  - Transmit **one certified copy** to the **Clerk of the House of Commons** and **one certified copy** to the **Clerk of the Privy Council**.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures that proposed federal laws are assessed for compliance with fundamental rights before they proceed in the legislative process.

---

#### **2. Examination of Statutory Instruments (Regulations)**
- If a **regulation** is submitted to the Clerk of the Privy Council for registration under the *Statutory Instruments Act* but **has not been examined** as a proposed regulation under **Section 3 of that Act**, the Clerk is required to:
  - Forward a copy of the regulation to the **Minister of Justice**.

- Upon receiving such a regulation, the Minister must:
  - **Examine** it to determine whether any provisions are inconsistent with the *Canadian Bill of Rights*.
  - Affix a **certificate**, in an approved form and signed by the Deputy Minister of Justice, confirming the examination has been completed.
  - Return the **certified copy** to the Clerk of the Privy Council.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Extends the rights review mechanism to secondary legislation (regulations), which often implement or detail laws passed by Parliament.

---

#### **3. Reporting Inconsistencies**
- If the Minister identifies **any provision** in a Bill (under Section 3) or a regulation (under Section 5) that is **inconsistent** with the *Canadian Bill of Rights*, the Minister must:
  - Prepare a **written report** explaining the inconsistency.
  - Deposit the report with the **Clerk of the House of Commons** at the **earliest convenient opportunity**, in accordance with the **Standing Orders of the House of Commons**.

> ⚠️ *Note*: This reporting mechanism serves as a formal check on potential violations of fundamental rights, allowing Parliament to respond or amend the legislation.

---

- Whenever a report is made by the Minister regarding a **regulation**, a **copy of that report must be immediately transmitted** to the **Clerk of the Privy Council**.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures transparency and accountability in the regulatory process, enabling oversight by the executive and legislative branches.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rights Protection** | Ensures that both primary (Bills) and secondary (Regulations) legislation respects fundamental rights as defined in the Canadian Bill of Rights. |
| **Procedural Accountability** | Establishes clear, mandatory steps for review by the Minister of Justice, with documentation (certificates and reports) maintained. |
| **Transparency and Oversight** | Reports are made public through the Clerk of the House of Commons, enabling parliamentary scrutiny. |
| **Inter-Agency Coordination** | Involves key officials (Minister, Deputy Minister, Clerks of Parliament and Privy Council), ensuring a structured review process. |

---

### **Limitations and Contextual Notes**
- **Scope**: These regulations apply only to the *Canadian Bill of Rights*, not to the more comprehensive *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* (1982), which provides broader and more detailed protections. The Canadian Bill of Rights is a **pre-Charter** document and is generally considered less enforceable and narrower in scope.
- **Enforcement**: The Minister’s report is **advisory** in nature. While it raises concerns about rights violations, it does not automatically lead to the rejection of a Bill or Regulation. Final decisions on legislation rest with Parliament.
- **No Judicial Review**: These regulations do not create a judicial remedy or allow courts to strike down legislation based on inconsistency with the Bill of Rights. Judicial review under the *Charter* (post-1982) is the primary mechanism for rights protection.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Bill of Rights Examination Regulations* serve as a **procedural safeguard** to ensure that proposed federal legislation and regulations are assessed for compliance with fundamental rights. By requiring the Minister of Justice to examine Bills and regulations and to report any inconsistencies, the regulations promote accountability, transparency, and respect for constitutional values—particularly in the early stages of the legislative process.

While the Canadian Bill of Rights itself is not as robust as the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, these regulations represent an important step in institutionalizing rights-based scrutiny within Canada’s legislative framework.

---

**In short**:  
These regulations mandate that every Bill and regulation introduced or registered in Canada must be reviewed by the Minister of Justice for compliance with the *Canadian Bill of Rights*, with a formal certificate issued and any identified inconsistencies reported to Parliament. This ensures that fundamental rights are not overlooked during the creation of laws or regulations.
