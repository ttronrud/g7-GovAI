*Minister Designation Order (Canada Business Corporations Act)*

**Purpose and Scope:**

   The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is officially designated as the member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada with the authority to act as the *Minister for the purposes of the Canada Business Corporations Act*.  

   This designation is not a legislative change to the Act itself but rather a procedural appointment that enables the Minister to perform administrative and regulatory functions under the Act, such as issuing regulations, making policy decisions, and providing directions to regulatory bodies or officials.

   As the designated Minister, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs holds the statutory authority to:
   - Exercise powers granted under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*;
   - Issue regulations under the Act (subject to parliamentary procedures and legal scrutiny);
   - Provide direction to agencies or officials implementing the Act;
   - Represent the federal government in matters related to corporate governance, corporate registration, and compliance.

3. **Legal Basis and Citation:**  
   The Order is issued under the authority of the *Canada Business Corporations Act*, which empowers the federal government to establish regulatory frameworks for the formation, operation, and oversight of business corporations in Canada. This designation ensures continuity and clarity in the chain of accountability and responsibility for corporate regulation.

4. **Citation and Reference:**  
   The Order may be cited as the *Minister Designation Order (Canada Business Corporations Act)*. This formal citation allows for consistent reference in legal documents, regulatory filings, court proceedings, and official government communications.

**Significance and Implications:**

**Limitations and Context:**

- This designation does not alter the substantive provisions of the *Canada Business Corporations Act*.
- The Minister's powers are limited to those explicitly conferred by the Act and are subject to oversight by Parliament and the courts.
- The designation is temporary in nature and may be reviewed or revised as necessary, depending on changes in government or policy priorities.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Minister Designation Order (Canada Business Corporations Act)* is a foundational administrative instrument that assigns the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs the official role of the Minister for the purposes of corporate regulation under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*.
