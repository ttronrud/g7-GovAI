**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order Specifying the Minimum Amount of Grain to Be Moved, No. 2**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 116.2(2)a of the Canada Transportation Act**. It was promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of two federal ministers:

- The **Minister of Transport**
- The **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**

This legislative action demonstrates a collaborative effort between transportation and agricultural policy to ensure the reliable movement of grain across Canada, particularly during critical periods of grain harvest and market demand.

---

**Purpose of the Order:**

The primary objective of this Order is to establish **minimum weekly grain transportation obligations** for two of Canada’s largest railway operators:

- **Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail)**
- **Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP Rail)**

These minimum volumes are designed to ensure that sufficient grain is transported during key periods in the agricultural year—particularly around harvest time and winter storage cycles—thereby supporting food security, market stability, and the efficient functioning of Canada’s grain supply chain.

---

**Key Provisions:**

The Order specifies the **minimum amount of grain (in tonnes)** that each railway company must move per week during a defined period from **November 30, 2014, to March 28, 2015**. The weekly volume requirements are as follows:

| Period | Minimum Grain Volume |
|--------|------------------------|
| November 30, 2014 – December 20, 2014 | **345,000 tonnes per week** |
| December 21, 2014 – January 3, 2015 | **200,000 tonnes per week** |
| January 4, 2015 – February 21, 2015 | **325,000 tonnes per week** |
| February 22, 2015 – March 21, 2015 | **345,000 tonnes per week** |
| March 22, 2015 – March 28, 2015 | **465,000 tonnes (one week only)** |

> Note: The final week (March 22–28, 2015) is a single 7-day period and requires a higher volume (465,000 tonnes), likely due to seasonal demand spikes or post-harvest processing needs.

---

**Definition of a Week:**

For the purposes of calculating and enforcing these minimums, a **"week" is defined as beginning on Sunday and ending on the following Saturday**. This standardization ensures consistency in measuring and tracking grain movement across the rail network.

---

**Effective Date:**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette. This means that once officially published and registered, the requirements become legally binding and enforceable immediately.

---

**Enforcement and Compliance:**

While the regulation does not explicitly detail enforcement mechanisms, its existence under the Canada Transportation Act implies that:

- The **Minister of Transport** has oversight responsibility for compliance.
- The railway companies are legally obligated to meet the minimum volumes.
- Failure to meet these requirements may lead to administrative or regulatory action, including potential penalties or reporting requirements.

The regulation is likely part of a broader framework to ensure that rail infrastructure supports the agricultural economy, especially during peak harvest and export seasons.

---

**Context and Significance:**

This Order reflects the importance of **intermodal transportation in Canada’s agricultural sector**. Grain is a critical export commodity, and timely movement via rail is essential for:

- Preventing spoilage
- Meeting domestic and international market demands
- Supporting rural economies
- Ensuring national food security

By setting minimum volumes, the government ensures that rail carriers maintain sufficient capacity during periods of high demand—particularly in late fall and early winter when grain is being moved from farms to storage facilities and ports.

The variation in weekly volumes across the period reflects seasonal patterns:

- Higher volumes in November–December (harvest season)
- A drop in December–January (possible winter slowdown)
- A rise again in January–February (post-harvest movement)
- A peak in late March (possibly due to export preparations or market demand)

**Legal References:**

- **S.C. 2014, c. 8, s. 6(1)** – This section authorizes the Governor in Council to issue orders specifying minimum grain transport volumes.
- **S.C. 1996, c. 10** – This refers to prior legislation or amendments that support the legal foundation of the Canada Transportation Act, particularly regarding transportation of agricultural goods.

---

**Conclusion:**

Order Specifying the Minimum Amount of Grain to Be Moved, No. 2, is a targeted regulatory measure designed to ensure the continuity and reliability of grain transportation in Canada during a critical agricultural period. By mandating specific weekly volumes for CN and CP Rail, the government strengthens supply chain resilience, supports farmers and agri-businesses, and ensures that Canada’s grain exports remain efficient and timely. The regulation underscores the intersection of transportation policy and agricultural policy in national economic planning.
