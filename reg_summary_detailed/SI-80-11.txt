**Detailed Summary of the Exported Dairy Products Assistance Payments Order (SI/79-56, 1979)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, known as the *Exported Dairy Products Assistance Payments Order* (SI/79-56, 1979), was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board, under the authority of **Canadian Dairy Commission Vote 50a of Appropriation Act No. 3, 1978–79**. It formally **revokes the previous Exported Dairy Products Assistance Payments Order (P.C. 1979-741)** and replaces it with a new, more detailed and structured framework governing the payment of export assistance to Canadian dairy exporters.

The primary objective of this Order is to provide **financial support to Canadian exporters** of dairy products by compensating them for the difference between the **market price received in foreign markets** and the **domestic support price** established by the Canadian Dairy Commission (Commission). This mechanism aims to ensure that Canadian dairy products remain competitive internationally while protecting domestic producers from price volatility and market disadvantages.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Commission**: Refers to the *Canadian Dairy Commission*, the federal body responsible for administering dairy support programs.
- **Export Assistance**: A payment made from the *Canadian Dairy Commission Account* to an exporter to help offset price disadvantages in international markets.
- **Exporter**: Any individual or entity that exports a dairy product from Canada abroad.

---

### **Eligibility and Application Process**

An exporter may apply for export assistance by submitting a written application to the Commission that includes the following information:

1. The **common name** of the dairy product to be exported.
2. The **common names** of any dairy components contained within the product.
3. The **destination** of the product.
4. The **quantity** of the product to be exported.
5. The **composition** of the product.
6. The **latest date** by which the product will be exported.

Upon receiving the application, the Commission must provide the applicant in writing with the **authorized amount of export assistance**, if any.

> **Note**: The Commission does not automatically approve assistance. Approval is conditional and based on market comparisons and policy criteria.

---

### **Conditions for Authorization of Export Assistance**

Export assistance is authorized under specific conditions depending on the type of dairy product being exported:

#### 1. **Butter or Skim Milk Powder**
- Assistance amount is capped at the **difference between**:
  - The **Canadian support price** (set by the Commission) for butter or skim milk powder at the time of authorization, and  
  - The **world market price** for the same product at that time.

> This ensures that exporters receive support only when the world price is below the domestic support price, preventing overpayment.

#### 2. **Cheese (excluding certain types) or Other Dairy Products (not butter or skim milk powder)**
- Assistance amount is capped at the **difference between**:
  - The **price calculated based on the market price of milk**, derived from the Canadian support prices for butter and skim milk powder, and  
  - The **world market price** for the cheese or other product.

> This method links cheese prices to the underlying milk market, maintaining consistency with the Commission’s milk pricing system.

#### 3. **Aged Cheddar Cheese Exported to European Economic Community (EEC) Member States**
- Assistance is authorized to bring the price of aged cheddar cheese **below the Free-at-Frontier (FAF) values** established under the EEC Common Customs Tariff heading **04.04E**.
- The maximum payment is limited to the amount needed to reduce the price to a level **below the FAF value**.
> This supports Canadian exporters in competing in the EU market where trade barriers and tariff values are strictly defined.

#### 4. **Cheese Exported to the United States**
- Assistance is capped at the **difference between**:
  - The **aggregate of**:
    - F.O.B. (Free on Board) price of Canadian cheese,  
    - Freight costs to the U.S. destination, and  
    - U.S. customs duty charges on the cheese,  
  - And the **U.S. wholesale price** of similar cheese produced in the United States.

> This ensures that Canadian cheese is not disadvantaged by higher U.S. domestic costs, especially when U.S. producers benefit from lower wholesale pricing.

### **Reporting and Verification Requirements**

After the exportation of a product for which assistance was authorized, the exporter must submit to the Commission the following documentation, supported by **satisfactory evidence**:

1. Common name of the exported dairy product.
2. Quantity exported.
3. Destination of the product.
4. Port of export.
5. Date(s) of shipment.
6. Any additional information required by the Commission to verify compliance with the conditions of the assistance.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and that exports were carried out in accordance with the terms of the authorization.

---

### **Payment of Export Assistance**

Once the Commission receives the required documentation from the exporter, it will **disburse the export assistance** in the amount previously authorized.

> Payment is contingent upon the successful submission of complete and verifiable export records.

---

### **Policy Objectives and Rationale**

This Order serves several key purposes:

1. **Market Competitiveness**: Helps Canadian dairy exporters compete internationally by bridging the gap between domestic support prices and foreign market prices.
2. **Price Stability**: Maintains a stable price floor for dairy producers by linking export assistance to established domestic support prices.
3. **Trade Fairness**: Ensures that Canadian producers are not at a disadvantage due to higher domestic or international costs (e.g., U.S. wholesale prices or EU tariff structures).
4. **Transparency and Accountability**: Requires detailed reporting to prevent misuse and ensure compliance with policy conditions.
5. **Targeted Support**: Provides assistance only when it is economically justified—i.e., when world prices are below domestic support prices or when specific trade barriers exist.

---

### **Key Limitations and Conditions**

- Export assistance is **not automatic**; it requires a formal application and Commission approval.
- The amount of assistance is **capped** based on market price differentials.
- Assistance is only available for **specific dairy products** (butter, skim milk powder, cheese, and certain aged cheddar).
- The system is **market-responsive**—assistance is only paid when foreign prices are lower than domestic support prices or when trade barriers exist.
- Exporters must **prove compliance** with all conditions through documentation.

---

### **Legal Authority and Governance**

- The Order is enacted under **Canadian Dairy Commission Vote 50a** of the *Appropriation Act No. 3, 1978–79*, which grants the Commission the authority to administer export support programs.
- It operates within the broader framework of Canadian agricultural policy and price support mechanisms.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Exported Dairy Products Assistance Payments Order* (SI/79-56) establishes a **transparent, market-based, and conditionally governed system** for providing financial support to Canadian dairy exporters. It balances the need to support domestic producers with the imperative of maintaining fair and competitive international trade. By linking export assistance to established domestic prices and international market conditions, the Order promotes both economic efficiency and equitable trade outcomes.

This regulation reflects a pragmatic approach to agricultural trade policy—one that supports Canadian dairy producers without distorting global markets or creating long-term dependency on government subsidies.
