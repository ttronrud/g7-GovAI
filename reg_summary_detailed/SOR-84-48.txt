### **7. Diversion of Lump Sum and Periodic Payments**

The rules for calculating diverted amounts depend on the structure of the pension benefit and the financial support order.

#### **Case 1: Lump Sum Payment Paid Before Periodic Payments**
> Treat as if only a **lump sum** is payable.  
> Apply the relevant provisions of the Act (section 36) as if only a lump sum exists.

#### **Case 2: Lump Sum and Periodic Payments Paid Simultaneously**

##### **A. Order provides only for lump sum payment**:
- First, satisfy the lump sum from the **lump sum portion** of the net pension benefit (per section 36).
- If any remains unsatisfied, treat the remainder as a **new lump sum** to be satisfied under section 37 (as if only periodic payments exist).

##### **B. Order provides only for periodic payments**:
- Satisfy the payments from the **periodic portion** of the net pension benefit (section 36).

##### **C. Order provides for both lump sum and periodic payments**:
- **Lump sum portion**: Satisfied from the lump sum portion of net pension benefit (section 36).
- **Periodic portion**: Satisfied from the periodic portion (section 36).

> 📌 This ensures that the financial support order is fulfilled in a structured, equitable manner based on the actual payment structure.

---

### **8. Multiple Applicants (Proportional Diversion)**

When **two or more applicants** submit valid applications for diversion of the same recipient’s pension:

#### **8.1 Equal Portion of Diversion**
- If each applicant is entitled to the **same portion** of the net pension benefit:
  - Each applicant receives:  
    `(Portion of net pension) × (Applicant’s proportionate share)`  
    → Maximum amount = amount the applicant would receive if they were the **sole applicant**.
