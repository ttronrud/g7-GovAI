### **Detailed Summary of the "Income Earned in Quebec Income Tax Remission Order, 1988"**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The **Income Earned in Quebec Income Tax Remission Order, 1988** is a regulatory instrument enacted under **section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, and approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board**.  

This Order is designed to **remit (i.e., forgive or reduce)** income tax, interest, and penalties that certain non-resident individuals may have paid or incurred in respect of income earned in the **Province of Quebec**, particularly when such income is not subject to Quebec taxation due to the individual's lack of residence in Canada.

The primary objective is to **promote fairness and equity** in the taxation of individuals who earn income in Quebec but do not reside in Canada, ensuring that they are not unduly burdened by tax obligations that would otherwise apply if they were residents of Quebec.

#### **4. Scope of Remission (Section 1 – Remission for Non-Residents)**

Remission is granted to any individual who **did not reside in Canada at any time during a taxation year** if the amount of tax, interest, and penalties **actually paid or payable** under the Act exceeds the amount that would have been payable **if the individual had been considered to have earned income in Quebec under a modified interpretation of the Regulations**.

##### **Modified Section 2602 of the Income Tax Regulations (Key Change)**  
The core of the remission is the **alteration of section 2602** of the Income Tax Regulations to define how income earned in Quebec is calculated for non-residents.

> **New interpretation of section 2602**:
> For a non-resident individual, income earned in Quebec includes:
>
> 1. **Income from employment or office**:
>    - The portion of income from employment (included in taxable income under subparagraph 115(1)(a)(i)) that is **reasonably attributable to duties performed in Quebec**.
>
> 2. **Income earned in Quebec** (as defined in **Section 4** of the Order).
>
> 3. **Business income earned in Quebec**:
>    - Income from carrying on a business in Quebec, determined under specific rules in this Part.
>
> 4. **Taxable capital gains** from dispositions of:
>    - Real property situated in Quebec or an option in respect thereof.
>    - Any other capital property used in carrying on a business in Quebec.
>
> 5. **Life insurance proceeds**:
>    - Income from the disposition of a life insurance policy where the insured person was a resident of Quebec at the time the policy was issued or effected.
>
> 6. **Proportional allocation**:
>    - If total income across all provinces exceeds income under subsection 115(1), the income attributable to Quebec is proportionally allocated based on the share of income earned in Quebec relative to total income.
>
> 7. **Capital gains allocation**:
>    - For dispositions of real property or capital property used in a business:
>      - A portion of the taxable capital gain is attributed to a specific province based on the proportion of business income earned in that province versus total business income in Canada.

#### **5. Special Cases of Income Attributable to Quebec (Section 4)**

For certain individuals who are **non-residents but have strong ties to Quebec**, the Order explicitly includes specific types of income in the calculation of Quebec-sourced income:

These include individuals who fall into any of the following categories:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Students** | Full-time students at a Quebec university, college, or post-secondary institution. Also includes students or teachers at foreign institutions who moved to Quebec for study or teaching, and previously ceased residency in Quebec. |
| **Researchers** | Individuals who moved to Quebec to carry out research under a government grant. |
| **Public Service Workers** | Individuals receiving remuneration from: <br> - The Province of Quebec, <br> - Corporations, commissions, or associations at least 90% owned by the Province of Quebec (or their wholly-owned subsidiaries), <br> - Educational institutions in Quebec receiving financial support from the Province. <br> (Excludes institutions of the Government of Canada.) |

> **Income included**:
> - Remuneration paid directly or indirectly by these entities.
> - Excludes remuneration attributable to duties performed outside Canada.
> - **Excluded if** the income is subject to foreign income tax or paid in connection with foreign business dealings (e.g., selling property, negotiating contracts with foreign affiliates).
> - Includes amounts that would have been included under **paragraphs 56(1)(n), (o), and (q)** of the Income Tax Act **if the individual were a resident of Canada**, with adjustments:
>   - The reference to “received by the taxpayer” is limited to income from Quebec or qualifying institutions.
>   - The $500 threshold in paragraph 56(1)(n) is adjusted to reflect the proportion of the amount attributable to Quebec.
> - Includes amounts required under **subsection 56(8)** (e.g., foreign source income).
> - **Minus** any deductions under **section 62** (e.g., business expenses) that would normally apply to residents — but only if those deductions are applied in a non-resident context.

#### **7. Remission for Individuals Who Resided in Quebec (Section 2)**

Remission is also granted to individuals who **resided in Quebec on the last day of a taxation year**, provided that the tax they paid exceeds what would have been payable **if a specific interpretation of the Regulations applied**.

##### **Modified Regulations (Subsections 2601(1) & (2))**
- If a person resided in Quebec on the last day of the year and had **no business income from another province**, their income earned in Quebec is simply their total income for the year.
- If they had **business income from another province**, their Quebec income is calculated as:
  > **Total income** – **Sum of income from businesses in other provinces**

##### **Modified Definitions in Section 126(7)**

- **Business-income tax**:  
  Refers to 55% of income tax paid to a foreign government (the "business country") that can reasonably be attributed to income from a business in that country.  
  - **Excludes** taxes related to income received by others or deductible under paragraph 110(1)(f)(i).

- **Tax for the year otherwise payable**:  
  The tax that would be payable under this Part after applying the **remission rules in subsection 6(1)(b)(i)**, but **before** deductions under sections 121, 122.3, 126.1, 127, and 127.2–127.4.

> This ensures that the tax calculation reflects the actual income earned in Quebec, adjusted for business income in other provinces.

#### **8. Application of Time and Residency Rules**

- For individuals who **resided in Quebec at any time during the year and ceased residence before the end of the year**, the "last day of the taxation year" is interpreted as **the last day they resided in Canada**.
