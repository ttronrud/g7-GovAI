### **Detailed Summary of the Grand Manan Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are established under the **Aeronautics Act of Canada**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed zoning regulations be publicly published in official gazettes and newspapers to allow for public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (on recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt and implement final zoning regulations after a public consultation period.

The proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of:
- *Canada Gazette, Part I* (November 14 and 21, 1992),
- *Telegraph Journal* and *L’Acadie Nouvelle* (January 14 and 15, 1993).

This provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the regulations were officially adopted by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister.

#### **2. Official Title and Scope**

- **Title**: *Grand Manan Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all land **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Grand Manan Airport**, including public road allowances.

> The land is precisely defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**, which outlines the geographic boundaries based on the airport’s zoning plan.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Grand Manan Airport, located in the County of Charlotte, Parish of Grand Manan, Province of New Brunswick. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point used as a datum for measuring distances and elevations. Defined in Part I of the Schedule. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 06–24), designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches. Described in Part II. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane 45 meters above the ARP elevation (or 9 meters above ground if lower), ensuring clear airspace above the airport. Described in Part III. |
| **Strip** | The central landing area of the airport, including the runway, 90 meters wide and 1,340 meters long. Described in Part IV. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the sides of the strip and approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until they meet the outer surface or reach 113 meters above sea level. Described in Part V. |

---

#### **4. Elevation Datum**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **68 meters above sea level**.
- All surface elevations (approach, outer, transitional) are referenced from this point.

---

#### **5. Key Prohibitions and Restrictions**

##### **(a) Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**

No person may:
- Erect or construct any building, structure, or object, or add to an existing one,
- **Whose highest point exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surfaces**
2. **Outer Surface**
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This ensures that no obstruction (e.g., trees, towers, buildings) interferes with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

##### **(b) Prohibition of Interference with Aircraft Communications**

No owner or lessee may:
- Use or develop any part of the regulated land in a way that:
  - Interferes with **radio or visual signals** to and from aircraft,
  - Interferes with **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, navigation systems, ground control).

> This protects the integrity of air traffic control and communication systems.

##### **(c) Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister may require** the owner or lessee to:
- Remove or trim the excessive growth.

> This prevents tree limbs or branches from interfering with flight paths or aircraft operations.

##### **(d) Prohibition of Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

No person may:
- Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical measure to reduce bird strikes, which pose a serious safety risk to aircraft.

#### **6. Geographic and Spatial Descriptions**

##### **(a) Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

- Located by measuring:
  - 610 meters **south** along the **centerline of runway 06–24** from the **northern end of runway 24**,
  - Then 45 meters **east** at right angles to the centerline.
- **Coordinates (New Brunswick Double Stereographic Projection Grid)**:
  - **N 601,385.13 m**
  - **E 276,341.62 m**

##### **(b) Approach Surfaces**

- Two approach surfaces, one for each runway end:
  - **Runway 06 (north end)**:
    - Inclined plane rising at **1:30** (1 meter vertical per 30 meters horizontal),
    - Extends 1,200 meters horizontally from the end,
    - Outer ends are 165 meters from the runway centerline,
    - Top line is **40 meters above the elevation at the runway end**.
  - **Runway 24 (south end)**:
    - Same slope (1:30),
    - Extends 1,350 meters horizontally,
    - Outer ends are 180 meters from centerline,
    - Top line is **45 meters above the elevation at the runway end**.

> These surfaces protect aircraft during approach by creating a clear zone free of obstructions.

##### **(c) Outer Surface**

- A horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 68 + 45 = **113 meters above sea level**).
- **Exception**: If the outer surface would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe requirements.

> This defines the upper boundary of the entire protected airspace zone.

##### **(d) Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal),
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces**,
- Continue upward until they intersect with the **outer surface** or reach **113 meters above sea level** (the elevation of the outer surface).

> These surfaces provide a gradual transition between the runway area and the broader outer airspace, ensuring smooth and safe flight paths.

##### **(e) Boundary of Regulated Land**

- The outer boundary of all land subject to these regulations is a **semi-circle**:
  - Radius: **4,000 meters**
  - Centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

> The semi-circle is positioned on the **easterly side** of the extended westerly limits of both:
  - Runway 06 approach surface,
  - Runway 24 approach surface.

> This ensures that the protected zone extends symmetrically and safely beyond the runway ends, minimizing risk to aircraft during all phases of flight.

#### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Protect critical flight paths and communication zones** by limiting structures, vegetation, and waste disposal.
3. **Provide clear, measurable boundaries** using standardized geometric and elevation definitions.
4. **Balance development needs** with aviation safety, particularly in a rural, remote area like Grand Manan Island.

#### **8. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth,
  - Enforce compliance with height and use restrictions.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in this regulation.

---

#### **9. Supporting Documentation**

All spatial and dimensional definitions are based on the **Grand Manan Airport Zoning Plans**, specifically:

- **Nos. S-2503-1 to S-2503-6**, dated **February 28, 1990**.

These plans provide the official mapping and technical specifications that form the basis of the zoning boundaries and surfaces.

### **Conclusion**

The **Grand Manan Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based framework to ensure the safety of air operations at Grand Manan Airport. By defining precise elevation limits (approach, outer, transitional surfaces), clearly demarcating protected zones, and restricting development and natural growth, the regulations protect aircraft from ground-level hazards while allowing for responsible land use in a sensitive coastal environment.

These rules are a critical component of Canada’s aviation safety infrastructure, reflecting a balance between community development and the operational demands of regional air transport.
