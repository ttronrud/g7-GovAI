**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Turkey Marketing Board (Interprovincial and Export) Order**

### **Overview**
The *British Columbia Turkey Marketing Board (Interprovincial and Export) Order* is a regulatory framework established under the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act* (the "British Columbia Act") to manage the production, processing, distribution, and marketing of turkeys grown in British Columbia (BC).
