## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Commonwealth of Dominica**

### 🔹 **1. Proclamation Context and Legal Authority**

This document is a **Proclamation issued by Her Excellency the Governor General of Canada, Jeanne Sauvé**, on **March 23, 1989**, under the authority of **Section 41 of the Old Age Security Act (O-9, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985)**.

#### Key Legal Basis:
- **Section 41** allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to declare an international social security agreement "in force" in Canada.
- The declaration must be **published in the Canada Gazette, Part II** — however, this particular proclamation is **not published in Part II**, which raises questions about transparency or administrative procedure.
- The order must be **laid before Parliament within 15 days** of issuance (or within 15 days of the next session if Parliament is not sitting).
- A motion to **revoke** the order must be filed by at least:
  - 50 Members of the House of Commons, or
  - 20 Members of the Senate,
  **before the 20th sitting day** after the order is laid.
- If no such motion is filed, the order comes into force on the **30th sitting day** after being laid before Parliament.

#### Timeline of Events:

- **Social Security Act, 1975**, as it relates to:

- Any person who has **ever been subject** to the legislation of either country.
- Their **dependants and survivors** (e.g., spouses, children).
- A **citizen of one country who has never been subject** to the legislation of that country — they are still eligible for benefits under the other country's rules.

> This ensures that **even non-residents** or **new immigrants** can access benefits if they meet the eligibility criteria.

---

### 🔹 **6. Rules on Benefit Eligibility and Payment**

#### A. **No Reduction or Denial Due to Residency**
- Benefits acquired under one country’s legislation **shall not be reduced, suspended, or canceled** just because the person resides in the other country.

### 🔹 **7. Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

These rules allow for **totalization of periods** of residence or contributions to determine eligibility for benefits.

#### For OAS (Old Age Security Act):
- A period of residence in **Dominica** during which the person was covered by the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan counts as **residence in Canada** — for the person and their spouse/dependants.
- A period of residence in **Canada** while covered by Dominica’s legislation **does NOT count** as residence in Canada — **unless** the person is covered by CPP or provincial pension plans.
- If a person **lives in Canada** and is employed under the CPP, the time in Canada counts as **residence in Canada**.

> ✅ Applies only **after January 1, 1971** and **after the Agreement came into force**.

#### For CPP (Canada Pension Plan):
- A **calendar year** in which at least **13 weeks** of contributions are creditable under Dominica’s legislation is treated as a **year of CPP contributions**.

#### For Dominica’s Legislation:
- A year of CPP contributions (after January 1, 1971) counts as **52 weeks** of contributions under Dominica’s system.
- A week of OAS coverage (after 1971) that is **not part of a CPP creditable period** counts as **one week** of contributions under Dominica’s system.

> This ensures **fair comparison** between the two systems.

---

### 🔹 **8. Determining Eligibility for Benefits**

If a person is **not eligible** under one country’s rules based on periods alone:
- Totalize **all creditable periods** from both countries (as per this Agreement).
- Add any periods from **third countries** bound by international social security agreements that allow totalization.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: If the total duration of creditable periods under one country is **less than one year**, and no benefit exists under that country’s rules,
