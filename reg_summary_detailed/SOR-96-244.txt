#### **7. Measurement Standards for Gas**

All gas must be measured according to the **Electricity and Gas Inspection Act**:

- **Volume Measurement**:
  - Measured at **standard conditions**:  
    - Temperature: **15°C**  
    - Pressure: **101.325 kPa (absolute)**  
  - Volume expressed in **cubic metres** (m³) of gas at these conditions.

- **Thermal Measurement**:
  - Computed in **joules (dry basis)**  
  - Dry gas must have moisture content **less than 110 mg/m³**

> 🔍 **Conversion Rule**:  
> If gas is measured under non-standard conditions, it must be **converted to standard conditions** using the **Ideal Gas Law**.  
> If deviations exceed **1%**, corrections must be applied using **AGA Report No. 3** (Orifice Metering of Natural Gas), as amended.

> ✅ **Exception**:  
> **Propane, butanes, and ethane** may be measured in **liquid form** (in cubic metres), not gas volume.

> ⚠️ For **all liquids** (except cryogenic liquids), measurements are based on a temperature of **15°C**.

> 📌 This Division applies **only to gas other than propane, butanes, and ethane**.
