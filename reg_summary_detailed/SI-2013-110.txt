**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2008-12 and Designation of the Minister of Health as the Appropriate Minister for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (R.S., c. F-11), specifically under paragraph (c.1)a of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in section 2 of that Act. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to designate a specific minister responsible for overseeing certain federal agencies in financial and administrative matters.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Prior Order in Council:**  
   The regulation formally repeals *Order in Council P.C. 2008-12*, issued on January 16, 2008 (also referenced as SI/2008-4). This prior order had previously designated a different minister as the "appropriate Minister" for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) under the Financial Administration Act. By repealing this order, the government removes the previous designation and effectively ends the prior administrative arrangement.

2. **New Designation:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Health** as the **appropriate Minister** with respect to the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** for the purposes of the *Financial Administration Act*. This means that, for all financial administration, budgetary, procurement, and fiscal matters related to the CFIA, the Minister of Health is now the responsible minister under the Act.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The changes take effect on **October 7, 2013**. This date marks when the new designation becomes legally binding and operational within the federal government’s financial administration framework.

**Rationale and Implications:**

- The designation of the Minister of Health as the appropriate Minister reflects a shift in administrative oversight of the CFIA. While the CFIA is traditionally a department under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (or a related portfolio), this designation indicates a strategic realignment—likely due to broader health and food safety policy integration, or interdepartmental coordination needs.

- The *Financial Administration Act* governs how federal departments and agencies are financially managed and accountable. By designating a specific minister, the government ensures that financial decisions, budget approvals, and administrative oversight of the CFIA are channeled through the Minister of Health.

- This change may reflect a broader government effort to improve coordination between public health, food safety, and agricultural policy. The CFIA plays a key role in ensuring food safety, animal health, and plant health, which are often intersecting with public health concerns.

**Legal Citation:**  
- Statutes: *Financial Administration Act*, R.S., c. F-11, section 2, paragraph (c.1)a  
- Source: S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 69(2) (a reference to the original enabling provision of the Act)  
- Order in Council Repealed: P.C. 2008-12 (January 16, 2008)  
- Regulatory Instrument: SI/2008-4 (Statutory Instrument of 2008, No. 4)

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation streamlines financial accountability for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency by removing a previous designation and assigning oversight to the Minister of Health. It is a formal administrative decision that aligns the CFIA’s financial governance with the broader health and public safety portfolio, effective October 7, 2013. This reflects a strategic shift in interdepartmental responsibility, emphasizing integration between food safety and public health policy.

Note: While the CFIA is traditionally under the purview of agriculture, this designation may have been made to strengthen coordination in areas such as foodborne illness prevention, public health emergencies, or cross-sectoral food safety initiatives. However, the actual operational responsibilities of the CFIA remain separate from the Minister of Health’s day-to-day duties, and this designation primarily affects financial and administrative reporting under the Financial Administration Act.
