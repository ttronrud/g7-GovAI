### 2. **Scope of Application**

#### B. **Extended Coverage**

---

### 3. **Who Is Covered?**

  - Derives rights from such individuals (e.g., dependants, spouses).

> **Equal Rights**: Covered persons have **the same rights and obligations** as citizens of the respective country.

---

### 4. **Benefit Payment Rules (Non-Reduction Principle)**

> **Core Principle**: Benefits are **not reduced, suspended, or canceled** solely because the person is in the territory of the other country.

- Benefits are paid **even when the person is in a third country**.
- Benefits are paid **regardless of location** — no territorial restrictions.

> This prevents "loss of benefits" due to movement.

---

### 5. **Residency & Employment Rules (Article 6–8)**

#### A. **Employed Persons**
- An employed person working in a Contracting Party’s territory is **subject only to that country’s legislation**.

#### B. **Self-Employed Persons**
- If self-employed and would otherwise be subject to both countries’ rules:
  - Subject **only to Canada** if they **ordinarily reside in Canada**.
  - Subject **only to Slovakia** if they **permanently reside in Slovakia**.
- If someone **both ordinarily resides in Canada and permanently resides in Slovakia**, the competent authorities must **agree** on which legislation applies.

#### C. **Temporary Assignments**
- Employees sent from one country to work in another are subject **only to the legislation of the host country**.
- **Exception**: Detachments exceeding **60 months** require **prior consent** from both competent authorities.

#### D. **Government Employment**
- A government employee posted to work in the other country is subject **only to the legislation of the posting country**.
- If the employee **previously contributed** to the employing country’s pension system, they may **elect** (within 6 months of start or entry into force) to be subject only to the **employing country’s legislation**.

> Residency definitions:
> - "Ordinarily resides" = as defined in Canadian law.
> - "Permanently resides" = as defined in Slovak law.

> Authorities may make **exceptions** to Articles 6–8 through mutual agreement.

### 6. **Creditable Periods & Totalization (Eligibility Rules)**

#### A. **Old Age Security Act (Canada) – Residence & Credit**
- If a person is contributing to **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial plan during a stay in Slovakia:
  - That period counts as **residence in Canada** for the individual and their spouse/dependants (who are not covered by Slovak employment/self-employment).
- Conversely, if a person is subject to **Slovak legislation** during a stay in Canada:
  - That period **does not** count as residence in Canada for spouse/dependants (unless they are covered by CPP or provincial plans).

> This supports **credit accumulation** for individuals living abroad.

#### B. **Eligibility Based on Creditable Periods**
- Totalize all creditable periods (from both countries) **without overlap**.
- For **old age benefits**:
  - A calendar year with **at least 90 days** of creditable periods under Slovak law = **one creditable year under CPP**.
- For **Slovak old age benefits**:
  - A CPP creditable year counts as a **Slovak creditable period**.
  - A period under OASA (not part of a CPP period) also counts as a Slovak creditable period.

#### C. **Invalidity / Survivor Benefits**
- A calendar year of CPP contributions counts as a **Slovak creditable period**.

#### D. **Totalization Threshold**
- If total creditable periods are **less than one year**, and no benefit exists under national rules:
  - The country **does not have to pay** under this Agreement.

> This prevents minimal contributions from triggering benefits.

---

### 7. **Pension Calculations (Amounts)**

#### A. **Old Age Security (OAS) – Outside Canada**
- A person outside Canada **only qualifies** for OAS if their **totalized residence periods** meet or exceed the **minimum required in Canada**.
- Allowances and Guaranteed Income Supplements (GIS) are paid **only to the extent allowed** by OASA.

#### B. **CPP Benefits – Amount Calculation**
- **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on **CPP pensionable earnings**.
- **Flat-rate portion**: Calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Flat-rate} = (\text{CPP flat-rate}) \times \left(\frac{\text{CPP contributions}}{\text{Minimum qualifying period}}\right)
  $$
  - The fraction **cannot exceed 1** (i.e., maximum flat-rate = full amount).

> Ensures fairness in benefit calculation based on actual contributions.

#### C. **Slovak Benefit Determination**
- If eligible **without totalizing Canadian periods**:
  - Slovak institution calculates benefit **without considering Canadian contributions**.
- If eligible **only via totalization**:
  - First, calculate **theoretical benefit** as if all periods were Slovak.
  - Then, apply a **proportional reduction** based on:
    $$
    \frac{\text{Actual Slovak periods}}{\text{Total periods (Canada + Slovakia)}}
    $$

> Example: If 12 months Slovak, 6 months Canadian → 50% of theoretical benefit.

#### D. **Minimum Period Requirement**
- If Slovak creditable periods are **less than 12 months**, **no benefit is paid**.
- **Exception**: If the benefit is payable **based solely on Slovak periods**, the rule does not apply.
- **Canadian periods under 12 months** are **counted** in Slovak benefit calculations.

> Prevents benefits from being granted based on incomplete records.

#### E. **Overlap of Benefits**
- If a person receives **both** a pension from Canada and a benefit from Slovakia:
  - **No reduction** applies due to overlap.

> Avoids double-dipping or benefit erosion.

### 8. **Administrative & Information Exchange**

#### A. **Joint Administrative Arrangement**
- The competent authorities must establish an **administrative framework** for implementation.
- Designate **liaison agencies** to coordinate between Canada and Slovakia.

#### B. **Information Sharing**
- Authorities must:
  - Share **necessary information** for eligibility and benefit calculation.
  - Offer **free assistance** in determining eligibility or benefit amounts.
  - Provide **prompt updates** on changes in legislation or administrative measures.

> Assistance is free **except** where reimbursement is required under a specific administrative arrangement.

#### C. **Medical Examinations**
- If a claimant/beneficiary in one country needs a medical exam:
  - The competent institution in the **other country** may require the exam to be
