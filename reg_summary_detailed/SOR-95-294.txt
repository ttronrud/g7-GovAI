The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules Order 2017, No. 84 (SOR/2017-84)**, under section 1 of that order.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  This means the regulation no longer exists in force and is no longer applicable or enforceable under current law.

- **Repeal Source**:  
  The regulation was formally repealed by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.  
  SOR/2017-84 is a Statutory Rules Order issued by the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on context — though in this case, it is likely federal, given the use of "SOR" which stands for Statutory Orders of the federal government in Canada).  
  Section 1 of that order specifically identifies the repeal of the referenced regulation.

- **Purpose of the Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when they are:
  - Outdated or no longer relevant,
  - Superseded by newer legislation,
  - Found to be inconsistent with current laws,
  - Or when they were intended to be temporary or transitional.

- **Implication of Repeal**:  
  Any legal obligations, administrative procedures, or operational requirements previously derived from the regulation are no longer in effect. Legal entities, government agencies, or individuals must now refer to current, active regulations for guidance.

- **No Further Detail Available**:  
  Since the original regulation is not provided in your query, and only the repeal notice is given, **no substantive content, scope, or provisions of the original regulation can be summarized**. The repeated listing of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" indicates that the regulation was formally removed from the legal framework, but the original text or purpose of the regulation itself is not included in the information provided.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced is **no longer in force** and was **officially repealed by SOR/2017-84, section 1**. Without access to the original text of the regulation, a detailed summary of its content, application, or intent cannot be provided. To understand what the regulation previously governed, one would need to consult archived legal documents or legislative databases that contain the original version prior to repeal.

If you can provide the original regulation's title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of certain food establishments"), I can assist in summarizing its content before repeal.
