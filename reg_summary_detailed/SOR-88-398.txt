**Detailed Summary of the 160900 Canada Inc. Acquisition Exemption Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**

- The Order is issued under **subsection 253(6)** of the *National Transportation Act, 1987* (S.C. 1987, c. 34).
- It is approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the National Transportation Agency (NTA)**.
- This Order is formally titled:  
  **"The 160900 Canada Inc. Acquisition Exemption Order"**  
  and may be cited as such.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**

- The primary purpose is to **exempt specific acquisitions** made by **160900 Canada Inc.** from the regulatory requirements imposed under **Part VII** of the *National Transportation Act, 1987*.
- Part VII of the Act typically governs **prohibitions, conditions, and approvals** related to mergers, acquisitions, and control changes in transportation sectors—particularly in areas such as **maritime, rail, and air transport**—to ensure competition and prevent monopolistic practices.

---

**3. Scope of the Exemption**

The following acquisitions are specifically exempted from the application of Part VII:

#### a) Acquisition of Shares in Les Entreprises Voyageur Limitée and 146831 Canada Inc.
- 160900 Canada Inc. is acquiring **all shares** in:
  - *Les Entreprises Voyageur Limitée* (a Canadian transportation company, likely involved in maritime or freight services)
  - *146831 Canada Inc.* (the nature of this entity is not specified in the excerpt but likely related to transportation or logistics)

#### b) Acquisition of a Minority Interest in Three Entities
1. **ACE — Atlantic Container Express Inc.**  
   - A company engaged in container shipping and maritime logistics, primarily operating in Atlantic Canada.
2. **Atlantic Searoute Limited (Partnership)**  
   - A partnership involved in maritime transportation, likely focused on sea routes in the Atlantic region.
3. **North Water Navigation Ltd.**  
   - A company involved in navigation and potentially ice-class shipping, likely operating in the Arctic or northern waters of Canada.

> The exemption applies to a **minority interest** held by **Groupe CSL Inc.** in these three entities. This means that 160900 Canada Inc. is acquiring a non-controlling stake (i.e., less than 100%) in these companies, not full ownership.

**4. Key Regulatory Implications**

- Normally, under Part VII of the *National Transportation Act*, such acquisitions would require:
  - A **pre-approval** from the National Transportation Agency
  - A **review** for potential anti-competitive effects
  - A **public notification** or **public consultation**
- This Order **waives** the need for such review and approval in this specific case, effectively allowing the transaction to proceed without going through the full regulatory scrutiny process.

---

**5. Justification (Implied by Recommendation)**

While not explicitly stated in the text, the National Transportation Agency's recommendation suggests that:
- The acquisition is **not likely to result in a significant threat to competition**
- The entities involved are **not dominant** in any key transportation market
- The transaction does **not create a substantial concentration of market power**
- The activity falls within a **non-critical or niche segment** of the transportation sector

Thus, the exemption is considered **proportionate and justified** under the Act’s regulatory framework.

---

**6. Legal and Practical Significance**

- This Order demonstrates the **flexibility** in the regulatory regime when transactions are deemed to pose **minimal competitive risk**.
- It facilitates **private investment and consolidation** in the transportation sector without triggering full regulatory intervention.
- It supports **business development and operational efficiency** by enabling strategic acquisitions in maritime and logistics sectors.

---

**7. Effective Date and Citation**

- The Order is effective upon publication and is binding on all relevant parties.
- It is formally cited as:  
  **"The 160900 Canada Inc. Acquisition Exemption Order"**

**Conclusion**

This Order grants a targeted exemption under the *National Transportation Act, 1987*, allowing 160900 Canada Inc. to proceed with the acquisition of shares in Les Entreprises Voyageur Limitée and 146831 Canada Inc., and a minority interest in ACE — Atlantic Container Express Inc., Atlantic Searoute Limited, and North Water Navigation Ltd., without being subject to the regulatory requirements of Part VII. The exemption is based on the determination by the National Transportation Agency that the transaction does not pose a significant risk to competition in the transportation sector.

This action reflects a balance between **regulatory oversight** and **market flexibility**, enabling responsible business growth in a specialized transportation domain.
