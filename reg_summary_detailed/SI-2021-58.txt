**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on the Rusty Cord-moss (Entosthodon rubiginosus)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA)**, enacted as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**.

This legal framework empowers the federal government to refer species for further scientific review when new information arises that may affect their conservation status or classification.

---

### **2. Key Action: Referral Back to COSEWIC**
The primary action of this regulation is to **refer the status assessment of the Rusty Cord-moss (*Entosthodon rubiginosus*) back to the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further evaluation.

- **Reason for Referral**:  
  Despite the species being previously classified as *Endangered* and listed in **Schedule 1 of SARA** in 2006, new scientific evidence has emerged since the 2017 COSEWIC reassessment that raises significant concerns about its current population trends and extinction risk.  
  The Minister of the Environment has concluded that a more comprehensive and updated analysis is necessary to determine whether the species should remain classified as *Endangered* or be reclassified as *Special Concern*.

### **3. Historical Status and Reassessment Timeline**

| Year | Status / Action |
|------|-----------------|
| **2004** | Initial COSEWIC assessment classified *Entosthodon rubiginosus* as **Endangered**. |
| **2006** | Listed in **Schedule 1 of SARA** as *Endangered*. |
| **April 2017** | COSEWIC reassessed the species and downgraded it to **Special Concern**, citing: <br> - Increased known distribution and abundance <br> - Reduced extinction risk due to expanded range and population growth <br> - Presence confirmed in both **British Columbia (BC)** and **Saskatchewan**. |

This 2017 reassessment formed the basis for the proposed reclassification under SARA, which was included in a **proposed Order Amending Schedule 1** published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **February 20, 2021**, with a 30-day public comment period.

### **4. Public Comment and New Evidence**
During the comment period, the Department of the Environment received input from a **species expert** who submitted detailed research reports, including field surveys conducted between **2018 and 2020**.

#### Key Findings from the Expert’s Reports:
- **Significant population declines** were observed at two of the largest known populations in Canada:
  - **Riske Creek, British Columbia**: Decline of **93–96%** since 2017.
  - **White Lake, British Columbia**: Complete **extirpation (100% decline)** of the species.
- **Primary Drivers of Decline**:
  1. **Landscape-scale wildfire in 2017**:  
     - The fire passed through **three of the known sites** at Riske Creek, directly impacting the moss habitat.
  2. **Invasive exotic grasses**:  
     - These grasses have spread in habitats at White Lake, outcompeting the Rusty Cord-moss and altering the ecosystem.
- **Absence of the species in previously documented sites**:  
  - Despite being previously recorded across multiple sites in BC in 2017, the moss was **not observed during 2018–2020 surveys**.  
  - This raises concerns that the species may now be **locally extirpated** at several locations.

### **5. Minister’s Assessment and Justification for Referral**
The Minister of the Environment has determined that:
- The 2017 COSEWIC reassessment, while based on available data at the time, **does not fully account for recent, substantial population declines**.
- The new evidence suggests that the species' extinction risk may have **increased significantly**, contrary to the earlier conclusion of reduced risk.
- Therefore, a **more thorough, up-to-date scientific review** is required to accurately assess the species’ current status.

As a result, the Minister has formally **referred the matter back to COSEWIC** to:
- Evaluate the new data (including post-2017 field surveys and ecological changes).
- Reassess the species’ distribution, abundance, and threats.
- Consider whether the species should be reclassified from *Special Concern* to *Endangered*, or if further data is needed to justify maintaining *Special Concern*.

---

### **6. Public Registry Notification**
The regulation also **approves the inclusion of a formal statement** in the **public registry established under Section 120 of SARA**. This statement:
- Outlines the reasons for the referral back to COSEWIC.
- Documents the historical status, the 2017 reassessment, and the new evidence of population decline.
- Ensures transparency and public access to the government’s decision-making process.

This public record supports accountability and enables stakeholders, scientists, Indigenous communities, and the public to monitor and contribute to the ongoing assessment.

---

### **7. Department’s Commitment**
The Department of the Environment has committed to:
- **Collaborating closely with COSEWIC** throughout the review process.
- Ensuring that the scientific assessment incorporates all relevant data, including field observations, ecological studies, and threat analyses.
- Providing timely updates to the public and stakeholders as the process progresses.

---

### **8. Significance of the Regulation**
This action reflects a key principle of SARA: **dynamic and science-based species management**. It demonstrates that:
- Conservation status is not static.
- Regulatory decisions are responsive to new scientific findings.
- The government recognizes that ecological conditions can change rapidly due to natural events (e.g., wildfires) and human-induced factors (e.g., invasive species).

It also underscores the importance of **ongoing monitoring** and **adaptive management** in protecting biodiversity.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation marks a critical step in reassessing the conservation status of the Rusty Cord-moss. While the species was previously considered to have improved due to increased distribution, recent evidence of severe population declines—driven by fire and invasive species—has prompted a return to COSEWIC for a comprehensive re-evaluation. The government’s decision to refer the matter back highlights a commitment to scientific rigor, transparency, and the protection of Canada’s at-risk species in the face of emerging threats.

**Final Status (as of this regulation)**:  
**Under review** – The Rusty Cord-moss is **not currently listed as endangered or special concern** in the public registry due to the referral. Its final status will be determined by COSEWIC following a revised assessment based on updated scientific evidence.
