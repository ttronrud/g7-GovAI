**Detailed Summary of the Products Containing Mercury Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Products Containing Mercury Regulations* are a set of federal regulations under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, enacted on **February 26, 2011**, and officially published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*. These regulations aim to **reduce the environmental and human health risks associated with mercury-containing products** by setting strict limits on mercury content, restricting certain uses, requiring labeling, and mandating reporting and disposal practices.

The regulations were developed following a public consultation process, including opportunities for stakeholders to submit comments or file objections, and were approved by the Governor in Council after review by the Minister of the Environment, the Minister of Health, and the National Advisory Committee. The regulations do not conflict with other existing environmental or health legislation and are designed to ensure adequate protection of the environment and human health.

### **2. Prohibitions on Manufacturing and Importing Mercury-Containing Products**

A person **must not manufacture or import** a mercury-containing product unless:

1. The product belongs to a specific category in **Schedule 1** (e.g., certain lamps, switches, meters), contains **no more than the maximum allowed mercury quantity**, and is manufactured or imported **on or before the specified end date**;
2. The product is a **replacement part**;
3. The product is a **replacement lamp**;
4. The person holds a **permit issued under subsection 5(1)**.

> *This creates a phased reduction in mercury use, with strict timelines and product categories.*

---

### **3. Restrictions on Selling Replacement Lamps**

- A **replacement lamp** (as defined in Schedule 2) must **not be sold or offered for sale** after the **second anniversary** of the end date set in Schedule 2 (column 4).
- This ensures a transition to mercury-free alternatives over time.

---

### **4. Definition of Replacement Parts and Lamps**

#### **Replacement Part:**
- Replaces a component present in a product **before November 8, 2015**
- Required for the product to function
- Cannot be replaced by a mercury-free alternative
- Does not fall under a restricted category in Schedules 1 or 2
- For **cold cathode fluorescent lamps or external electrode fluorescent lamps**, only used in **electronic display panels**

#### **Replacement Lamp:**
- Belongs to a category in Schedule 2
- Mercury content ≤ maximum allowed
- Manufactured or imported **on or after the start date** and **no later than the end date** in Schedule 2
- Will be used in a lighting fixture **installed before the start date**, or in an **automobile headlamp** in a vehicle manufactured **before that date**

---

### **5. Disposal and Recycling Requirements**

Any product containing mercury manufactured in violation of section 3 must be:
- Sent for **final disposal or recycling** at a facility **authorized** to handle hazardous materials in the jurisdiction where it is located.
- Alternatively, the product may be **returned to the original manufacturer or importer**.

> *This ensures responsible end-of-life management and prevents environmental contamination.*
