## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Retirement Compensation Arrangements Regulations, No. 2**

### **1. Purpose and Context**
These regulations establish a **special early retirement compensation arrangement** for certain public servants who were made surplus due to workforce reductions or position abolitions between **April 1, 1995, and March 31, 1998**. The goal is to provide financial support to eligible employees who are no longer employed in the Public Service, particularly those who would otherwise have lost pension benefits due to early departure.

The regulations were introduced in response to significant workforce restructuring initiatives, including the **Work Force Adjustment Directive (1991)** and the **Executive Employment Transition Policy (1992)**, and aim to ensure that affected employees receive fair compensation based on their pensionable service and contributions.

## 💰 Structure of the Annual Benefit

The annual benefit is calculated as follows:

> **Annual Benefit = [Annuity payable under PSA para. 11(1)(a) on full pensionable service] – [Annual allowance under clause 13(1)(c)(ii)(B) or (D)] – [Any benefit under Regulation No. 1, section 35]**

- The annuity amount is based on what would have been paid if the employee had retired under normal pension rules.
- The benefit is **not a pension**, but a **compensation for early retirement**.
- It is **equal in nature and subject to the same conditions** as an annual allowance under the PSA.

## 🔄 Special Provisions

| Provision | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **Spousal Reduction** | If a participant makes an election under section 13.1 of the PSA (spouse joining after termination), the annual benefit is **reduced by the same proportion and for the same period** as the annual allowance is reduced under section 68 of the PSA regulations. |
| **Surviving Spouse Benefit** | If the surviving spouse is entitled to an immediate annual allowance under section 13.1(3) of the PSA, they receive **a benefit equal to the annual benefit amount multiplied by the percentage of the participant’s original allowance** (before any reduction under section 68). |
| **Re-employment** | The annual benefit **ends immediately** when the participant is re-employed in the Public Service and becomes a contributor under section 64 of the PSA. |
| **No Reinstatement** | Once the benefit ends due to re-employment, it **does not resume** if the person later becomes unemployed again. |
| **Immediate Annuity** | If a participant receives an immediate annuity under subparagraph 13(1)(d)(ii) of the PSA, they **cease to receive the annual benefit**. |
| **Deferred Annuity & Re-eligibility** |
