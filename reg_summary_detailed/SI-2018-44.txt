**Detailed Summary of the Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Establishment Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Establishment Order** was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, under **subsection 4.1(1)a of the Canada Wildlife Act** (CWA). This provision empowers the federal government to designate protected marine areas within Canadian waters to conserve wildlife, ecosystems, and natural resources.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - *Canada Wildlife Act*, S.C. 1996, c. 31, s. 107  
  - *Regulations*, R.S., c. W-9; S.C. 1994, c. 23, s. 2  

This Order is a regulatory instrument used to formally establish a protected marine area with specific boundaries and legal protections.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of the Order is to **establish a protected marine area** known as the **Scott Islands Protected Marine Area (Scott Islands PMA)**. This designation aims to:
- Conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystems.
- Protect critical habitats for fish, marine mammals, birds, and other wildlife.
- Ensure sustainable use of marine resources by restricting harmful activities such as commercial fishing, mining, or pollution.
- Support the conservation of species at risk and the ecological integrity of the region.

---

### **3. Geographic Scope and Jurisdiction**
The Scott Islands Protected Marine Area lies entirely within **Canadian waters**, including:
- **Internal waters**
- **Territorial sea**
- **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)**

This means the protected area extends from the coast inward to the 200-nautical-mile limit of Canada’s EEZ, ensuring comprehensive protection across all legally defined maritime zones.

---

### **4. Area Description (Boundaries)**
The protected area is defined by a detailed, precise boundary using **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing) and the **ordinary high water mark** (the line along the coast where seawater reaches at mean high tide). The boundary is described in a sequence of points, as follows:

1. **Commencement Point**:  
   Intersection of the ordinary high water mark with a rhumb line connecting:
   - Latitude 50°41′32.5″N, Longitude 128°22′38.9″W  
   - Latitude 50°20′45.2″N, Longitude 128°45′32.4″W

2. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 50°20′45.2″N, Longitude 128°45′32.4″W

3. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 50°09′49.0″N, Longitude 129°21′08.0″W

4. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 50°24′19.3″N, Longitude 130°00′37.4″W

5. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 51°06′04.3″N, Longitude 130°08′26.1″W

6. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 51°14′33.9″N, Longitude 128°55′45.5″W

7. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 51°14′57.6″N, Longitude 128°47′01.2″W

8. **Rhumb Line to**:  
   Latitude 51°15′05.0″N, Longitude 128°36′45.5″W

9. **Rhumb Line (or production) to**:  
   Ordinary high water mark at Latitude 50°50′37.2″N, Longitude 128°10′39.1″W

10. **General Southwesterly and Southeasterly Movement Along the High Water Mark** to:
    - The **mouth of Hansen Lagoon** at approximately:
      - Latitude 50°44′23.3″N, Longitude 128°24′09.5″W

11. **Line Across the Mouth of Hansen Lagoon** to:
    - A point on the ordinary high water mark at:
      - Approximate latitude 50°43′39.5″N, Longitude 128°23′22.7″W

12. **Return Along the Ordinary High Water Mark** to the **point of commencement**.

> **Exclusion Clause**:  
> The area **excludes all islands and all foreshore lying above the low water line**. This means only submerged or low-lying coastal areas within the boundary are protected, and land-based islands or elevated coastal areas above the low tide level are not included in the protected zone.

---

### **5. Area Size**
- The total area of the Scott Islands Protected Marine Area is approximately **11,546 square kilometers** (about 4,460 square miles).
- This makes it one of the larger protected marine areas in Canada’s Arctic region.

---

### **6. Geodetic Reference System**
All coordinates in the description are expressed in the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD83)** geodetic system. This ensures accuracy and consistency in mapping and spatial data used for navigation, environmental monitoring, and legal enforcement.

---

### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day the Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Regulations come into force**.
- **Note**: The Order is in force as of **June 27, 2018**.

This means that the protections established by the Order began on that date, and all activities within the designated area are subject to the legal restrictions of the Canada Wildlife Act and associated regulations.

---

### **8. Key Implications and Environmental Significance**
- The Scott Islands PMA is located in the **northern Canadian Arctic**, an ecologically sensitive region with high biodiversity and important migratory pathways.
- The area likely supports:
  - Seabird colonies
  - Marine mammals (e.g., seals, whales)
  - Fish spawning grounds
  - Important breeding and feeding habitats
- Protection under the CWA helps prevent:
  - Overfishing
  - Habitat degradation
  - Oil or gas exploration
  - Pollution or invasive species
- The designation supports Canada’s commitments under international environmental agreements, such as the **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)** and the **UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Establishment Order** is a significant environmental regulation that formally protects a vast and ecologically valuable marine region in northern Canada. By establishing clear boundaries, defining the jurisdiction, and excluding land-based features above the low water line, the Order ensures effective conservation of marine life and habitats. It reflects Canada’s commitment to preserving its natural heritage and maintaining the ecological balance of its Arctic waters.

This protected area serves as a model for future marine conservation efforts in Canada and underscores the importance of science-based, legally grounded environmental protection.
