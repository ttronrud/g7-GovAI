**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Delegation of Powers (Customs) Regulations*

**Date of Issuance:**  
March 25, 1986  

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 163(2) of the Customs Act**. This provision empowers the Minister of National Revenue to delegate certain powers granted under section 163 of the Customs Act to designated officers. The delegation allows for administrative efficiency by enabling authorized officers to carry out specific functions that would otherwise require direct ministerial intervention.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
To formally revoke and replace the previously enacted *Delegation of Powers (Customs) Regulations* made on **October 12, 1984** (SOR/84-807, Canada Gazette Part II, p. 3965), and to issue a new, updated set of regulations that clearly define and delegate the powers conferred by section 163 of the Customs Act to specific officers.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Revocation of Prior Regulations:**  
   The 1984 Delegation of Powers (Customs) Regulations are hereby **fully revoked**. This ensures that the current regulatory framework is the most up-to-date and legally valid version, reflecting any changes in policy, administrative needs, or legislative amendments.

2. **Introduction of New Regulations:**  
   In place of the revoked regulations, the current version (issued in 1986) serves as the **official and operative Delegation of Powers (Customs) Regulations**. These regulations are formally cited as such and are legally binding.

3. **Scope of Delegated Powers:**  
   The powers delegated are those specifically conferred by **section 163 of the Customs Act**. Section 163 typically grants the Minister of National Revenue broad authority to delegate functions related to customs administration, including but not limited to:
   - The power to issue directives or orders regarding the enforcement of customs laws;
   - Authority to conduct inspections, investigations, or audits;
   - Powers to determine the application of customs duties, penalties, or exemptions;
   - The ability to issue permits or authorizations related to the movement of goods.

4. **Applicable Officers:**  
   The powers under this regulation are exercisable by the **officers listed in the Schedule** attached to the regulations. These officers are typically senior customs officials or designated agents within the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) or equivalent entities. The inclusion of specific officers ensures accountability, transparency, and proper oversight of delegated functions.

5. **Legal Effect and Citation:**  
   The regulation is formally cited as the *Delegation of Powers (Customs) Regulations*, and its provisions are enforceable under the authority of the Customs Act. It may be referenced in administrative decisions, enforcement actions, and legal proceedings involving customs matters.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Administrative Efficiency:** By delegating powers, the government enables faster and more responsive enforcement of customs laws at the field level, without requiring constant ministerial approval.
- **Accountability and Oversight:** The delegation is limited to designated officers, ensuring that powers are exercised within defined boundaries and under proper supervision.
- **Legal Clarity:** The 1986 revision replaces outdated or potentially ambiguous provisions with a more current and precise framework, reducing legal uncertainty.
- **Consistency with Legislation:** The regulation ensures alignment with the current interpretation and application of section 163 of the Customs Act, which is central to customs authority and enforcement.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal update to the administrative framework governing the delegation of customs powers. It replaces an older set of rules with a current, legally sound instrument that enables designated officers to act on behalf of the Minister of National Revenue in accordance with the authority granted by section 163 of the Customs Act. The regulation enhances operational effectiveness while maintaining legal accountability and adherence to statutory requirements.

**Note:**  
For full legal effect, this regulation must be read in conjunction with the *Customs Act* and the specific provisions of section 163. The Schedule listing the officers is a critical component and must be consulted to determine which individuals are authorized to exercise the delegated powers.
