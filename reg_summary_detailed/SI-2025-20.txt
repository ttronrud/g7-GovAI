**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument:**
**Exclusion from Application of Section 35.11b of the Public Service Employment Act**

- **Issuing Authority:**  
  Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada.

- **Legal Basis:**  
  Section 20 of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA), which empowers the Public Service Commission (PSC) to exclude certain individuals from the application of specific provisions of the Act, provided that such exclusion is in the public interest and after appropriate consultation.

- **Effective Period:**  
  The exclusion applies to individuals who meet the specified criteria during the period **from November 13, 2020, to January 18, 2024**, inclusive.

### **Who Is Excluded?**

The following individuals are **excluded from the application of Section 35.11b of the Public Service Employment Act**:

1. **Service in the Canadian Forces:**  
   - Must have **completed their third year of service** in the Canadian Forces during the period from **November 13, 2020, to January 18, 2024**.

2. **Honourable Release:**  
   - Must have been **honourably released** from the Canadian Forces, as defined under regulations made under the *National Defence Act* (NDA).  
   - "Honourable release" is a formal term indicating that a service member left the military in a manner consistent with good standing, without disciplinary action or misconduct.

3. **Account Creation in the Public Service Resourcing System (PSRS):**  
   - Must have **created an account in the Public Service Resourcing System (PSRS)** on or **before January 18, 2024**.

> Note: The PSRS is a digital platform used by the federal public service to manage workforce planning, staffing, and employee records. Creating an account signifies the individual's transition into the federal public service workforce.

### **Rationale for Exclusion (Why This Was Done)**

The Public Service Commission (PSC) determined that:

- It is **neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service** to apply **Section 35.11b** of the PSEA to these individuals.

#### **Section 35.11b of the PSEA (Context):**
This section typically governs **the requirement for certain employees to serve a minimum period of service before being eligible for retirement, reassignment, or other benefits**, or may relate to **eligibility for certain employment rights or protections** (depending on the specific version and interpretation). In this case, the exclusion likely relates to **eligibility for certain employment conditions or retirement provisions** that would otherwise apply to individuals transitioning from the military to civilian federal service.

#### Key Considerations:
- **Transition Challenges:**  
  Military personnel often have unique career paths, training, and service commitments. Applying standard civilian employment rules (like those in Section 35.11b) could create administrative burdens or unfairly disadvantage individuals transitioning from the armed forces.

- **Public Service Interests:**  
  The PSC concluded that excluding these individuals ensures a **smooth and fair transition** into civilian public service roles, supports **military-to-civilian integration**, and respects the **duties and service of those who have served honourably**.

- **Practicability:**  
  Applying Section 35.11b to this group would require additional administrative processes, record-keeping, and potentially inconsistent application due to the nature of military service and release.

---

### **Consultation Requirement (Subsection 20(2) of the PSEA)**

- The PSC **consulted with the employer** (i.e., the relevant federal department or agency) prior to making this decision.  
- This ensures that the interests of the employing organization and the broader public service are taken into account before excluding individuals from employment rules.

### **Legal Effect of the Regulation**

By virtue of this regulation, the following **provision is effectively suspended or excluded** for the specified group:

> **Section 35.11b of the Public Service Employment Act**  
> Does **not apply** to individuals who:
> - Completed their third year of service in the Canadian Forces between November 13, 2020, and January 18, 2024;  
> - Were honourably released under the regulations of the *National Defence Act*;  
> - Created a PSRS account on or before January 18, 2024.

This means that these individuals are **not subject to the specific requirements or restrictions** that Section 35.11b would otherwise impose (e.g., mandatory service periods, eligibility timelines, or other employment conditions).

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Supports Military Transition:**  
   This regulation is a **positive step toward recognizing and supporting the transition** of military personnel into civilian public service roles, acknowledging their experience, discipline, and commitment.

2. **Fairness and Equity:**  
   It ensures that individuals who have served their full term in the Canadian Forces and transitioned honourably are not penalized by rigid employment rules designed for civilian career paths.

3. **Administrative Efficiency:**  
   Excluding this group reduces bureaucratic complexity and streamlines onboarding and employment processes for military veterans entering the federal workforce.

4. **Policy Alignment:**  
   This aligns with broader federal government initiatives promoting **military-to-civilian integration**, including targeted hiring programs and veteran employment supports.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, legally sound, and well-justified exclusion that removes the application of Section 35.11b of the *Public Service Employment Act* for a defined cohort of Canadian Forces personnel who completed three years of service and transitioned to civilian public service between November 13, 2020, and January 18, 2024. It reflects a balance between public service policy integrity and the need to support the fair and effective integration of military veterans into the federal workforce.

It is a practical and compassionate measure that recognizes the unique contributions of military service members and ensures equitable treatment during their transition to civilian life in public service.
