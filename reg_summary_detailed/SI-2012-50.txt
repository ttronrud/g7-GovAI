### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision to the Public Health Agency of Canada**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis:**
- The transfer is authorized by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), which empowers the federal government to reassign functions and responsibilities within the public service, particularly those related to public health and emergency management.

**2. Effective Date:**
- The transfer becomes effective on **June 30, 2012**.

**3. Entities Involved:**
- **Source Department:** The **Department of Health** (a federal department responsible for health policy and services).
- **Specific Units Transferred:**
  - The **International Affairs Directorate** within the Department of Health.
  - The **Emergency Preparedness and Response Unit** within the Department of Health.

**4. Recipient Entity:**
- The **Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)**, a federal agency established to lead and coordinate public health activities across Canada, including disease prevention, emergency response, and international health cooperation.

**5. Nature of the Transfer:**
- The transfer involves the **control and supervision** of the two specified units. This means that:
  - PHAC assumes responsibility for the **day-to-day management**, operational oversight, and strategic direction of these units.
  - PHAC gains authority to appoint staff, allocate resources, and implement policies related to these functions.
  - The units are no longer under the direct administrative control of the Department of Health.

**6. Purpose and Rationale:**
- The realignment was designed to:
  - Strengthen the **public health response capacity** of Canada by consolidating key functions under a single, focused agency.
  - Improve coordination between domestic health preparedness and international health engagement.
  - Enhance the **efficiency and responsiveness** of emergency preparedness and response efforts, particularly in the face of public health emergencies (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters, or infectious disease outbreaks).
  - Align the functions of international health cooperation and emergency response with PHAC’s mandate, which includes both national and global health security.

**7. Legal and Institutional Context:**
- The transfer is consistent with broader government efforts to **streamline public service structures** and improve inter-agency coordination.
- The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* allows for such reorganizations to ensure that public services are delivered more effectively and in alignment with national priorities.
- The transfer does not alter the legal status or statutory mandate of the units themselves, but rather assigns administrative and supervisory authority to PHAC.

**8. Impact:**
- This move marked a significant step in the evolution of Canada’s public health governance structure.
- It enabled PHAC to take a more central role in managing health emergencies and international health affairs, supporting Canada’s ability to respond to global health threats and coordinate with international partners.

### **Conclusion:**
