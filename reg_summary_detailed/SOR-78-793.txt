**Detailed Summary of the FAO Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The *FAO Privileges and Immunities Order* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**. It is enacted pursuant to **Section 3 of the Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act**, which empowers the Canadian government to grant legal privileges and immunities to international organizations operating within Canada.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **establish and define the legal privileges and immunities** that the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** — a specialized agency of the United Nations — will enjoy in Canada, enabling it to carry out its mandate effectively and without undue interference from Canadian authorities.

This Order may be cited as the **FAO Privileges and Immunities Order**.

### **2. Key Definitions in the Order**

- **"Convention"**: Refers to the **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**, a multilateral treaty adopted in 1946 and widely recognized as the foundational legal framework governing the rights and immunities of UN entities and their personnel. This Convention provides a standardized set of protections for UN bodies and personnel across member states.

- **"Organization"**: Refers specifically to the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts in food security, agriculture, and rural development.

### **3. Legal Status and Capacity of the FAO in Canada**

The Order grants the FAO **the legal capacity of a body corporate** in Canada. This means:

- The FAO can **own property**, **enter into contracts**, **sue and be sued**, and **act in its own name** in Canadian legal proceedings.
- It is recognized as a **separate legal entity** within Canadian law, which allows it to operate independently and with the necessary legal standing to fulfill its international and domestic functions.

This corporate status is essential for the FAO to function effectively in Canada, particularly in areas such as establishing offices, managing resources, and engaging in public-private partnerships.
