### **Core Legal Principles and Privileges**

The Order grants specific privileges and immunities to various categories of ICAO personnel and missions, based on the **Agreement** and the **Vienna Convention**, with adjustments tailored to ICAO’s unique structure and functions.

---

#### **1. Legal Capacity of ICAO**

- ICAO is recognized in Canada as a **body corporate** with full legal capacity.
- It enjoys certain privileges and immunities **to the extent specified in Articles 2, 3, 4(1)–(3), 5, 6, 8, and 9 of the Agreement**, and those set out in **Articles II and III of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**.

> This means ICAO can enter into contracts, own property, and conduct legal business in Canada, just like a foreign diplomatic mission, under the terms of the Agreement and the UN Convention.

---

#### **2. Permanent Representatives of Member States**

- Permanent representatives of foreign states that are members of ICAO, along with their **families forming part of their households**, are granted privileges and immunities **comparable to those of diplomatic representatives** under the **Vienna Convention**.
- These privileges are granted **to the extent specified in Articles 12, 15, and 23 of the Agreement**.

> This ensures that ICAO’s top-level diplomatic envoys enjoy the same protections and immunities as Canadian diplomatic representatives, including immunity from legal proceedings and protection of personal and family assets.

---

#### **3. Other Representatives of Member States**

- Other representatives (e.g., non-permanent or junior-level officials) of member states are granted privileges and immunities **comparable to those of diplomatic representatives under the Vienna Convention**.
- These rights are granted **to the extent specified in Articles 13(a) to (f), 16, and 23 of the Agreement**.

> This extends certain immunities to mid-level officials, though not to the full extent of diplomatic envoys.

---

#### **4. Administrative and Technical Staff & Families**

- Members of the **administrative and technical staff** of an ICAO mission, and their **families forming part of their households**, are granted privileges and immunities **comparable to those under the Vienna Convention**.
- These rights are granted **to the extent specified in Articles 14 and 17 of the Agreement**.

> This includes immunity from arrest, protection of personal property, and exemption from certain taxes and customs duties—similar to the treatment of technical staff in diplomatic missions.

> **Exclusion**: Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada are **not** entitled to these privileges.

---

#### **5. Senior ICAO Officers (P-4 Level and Above)**

- The **President of the Council**, the **Secretary General**, **Deputy Secretary General**, **Assistant Secretaries General**, and **officials of equivalent rank** at or above the **P-4 level**, along with their **families**, are granted privileges and immunities **equivalent to those of diplomatic agents** under the **Vienna Convention**.
- These rights are granted **to the extent specified in Articles 19, 21, 24, and 25 of the Agreement**.

> This is a significant recognition of the high-level status of ICAO’s leadership, treating them as **diplomatic agents** in Canada, which includes full diplomatic immunity and protection.

---

#### **6. Other ICAO Officials**

- All other ICAO officials (not covered in subsection 5) are granted privileges and immunities **as set out in Section 18 of Article V of the Vienna Convention**.
- These are generally **limited immunities**, such as immunity from civil and criminal liability in certain circumstances, and protection from search and seizure.

> This ensures that even lower-level staff have some protection, though not the full range of diplomatic immunities.

---

#### **7. Accredited ICAO Missions (Diplomatic Mission Status)**

- Accredited ICAO missions are granted **the full extent of privileges and immunities** accorded to **diplomatic missions of foreign states** in Canada under the **Vienna Convention**.

> This includes:
> - Immunity from arrest and detention
> - Exemption from service of legal process
> - Protection of communications
> - Exemption from customs duties and taxes
> - Immunity from jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters

> This grants ICAO missions the same status as a foreign embassy or consulate in Canada.

---

#### **8. Tax Relief (1991–2000 Period)**

- For the period from **January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2000**, accredited ICAO missions are entitled to **tax relief under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, specifically the same tax exemptions and reliefs granted to diplomatic missions under the **Vienna Convention**.

> This includes:
> - Exemption from excise taxes on certain goods (e.g., fuel, alcohol, tobacco)
> - Exemption from import duties on mission-related supplies
> - Protection from taxation on income generated by mission operations

> This provision is **time-limited** and only applies until the end of the 2000 calendar year.

### **Purpose and Significance**

This Order serves several key purposes:

1. **Formal Recognition of ICAO’s Status**  
   ICAO is recognized as a legitimate international organization with legal standing in Canada, comparable to the United Nations or other international bodies.

2. **Alignment with International Law**  
   The Order ensures that ICAO’s privileges and immunities are consistent with international norms, particularly the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations**, while allowing for specific adaptations under the **Headquarters Agreement**.

3. **Support for Canada’s Role in Global Aviation Governance**  
   By granting ICAO full diplomatic status, Canada supports international cooperation in aviation safety, regulation, and standards, which are essential for global air travel and security.

4. **Clear Distinction Between Diplomatic and Technical Staff**  
   The Order carefully differentiates between diplomatic envoys (with full immunity), senior technical staff (with partial immunity), and general administrative staff (with limited protection), ensuring that privileges are proportionate to roles and responsibilities.

5. **Temporary Tax Relief Provision**  
   The 10-year tax relief period (1991–2000) reflects a transitional approach, allowing time for Canada to assess the long-term implications of ICAO’s operations and to potentially revise tax provisions in future legislation.
