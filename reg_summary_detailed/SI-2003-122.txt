Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation titled the **Saskatchewan Indian Federated College Remission Order, 2003**, as provided:

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College Remission Order, 2003**

### 📌 **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
- The Order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- It is based on **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the government to make remission orders in the public interest.
- **Purpose**: To provide tax remission (a reduction or refund of taxes) to **Indians and bands** whose income or taxable supplies are situated on a specific Indian Settlement — the **Saskatchewan Indian Federated College (SIFC) Indian Settlement** — due to the fact that this settlement was not legally recognized as a reserve during certain periods.

> This is a **public interest measure** designed to correct a fiscal inequity: Indian Settlements are not treated as reserves for tax purposes under Canadian tax law, even when they are inhabited and used by Indigenous communities. This Order compensates for that treatment by granting tax remissions.

### 📌 **2. Definitions Used in the Order**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Band** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* – a group of registered Indians living together in a specific area. |
| **Indian** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* – a person who is a member of a band and meets the criteria under the Act. |
| **Indian Settlement** | The specific settlement and land area described in the Schedule to the Order. This is not a reserve under the *Indian Act* but is a designated community. |
| **Reserve** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* – land set apart for the use of a band under the Act. |

> These definitions ensure consistency with existing legal frameworks, particularly the *Indian Act*.

---

### 📌 **3. Scope and Timing of the Order**

- The Order applies **to the Indian Settlement** until such time as the land is officially set apart as a **reserve** by an order of the Governor in Council.
- Once a reserve designation is made, the Order **ceases to apply** for that land.

> This means the remission benefit is **temporary** and ends when the government formally designates the settlement as a reserve.

### 📌 **4. Two Types of Tax Remission**

#### ✅ **Type 1: Income Tax Remission (Section 6)**
- Applies to **Indians or bands** with income **situated on the Indian Settlement**.
- Covers **taxation years or fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2000**.
- **Remission amount** = the difference between:
  - Taxes, interest, and penalties **actually paid or payable**, and  
  - Taxes, interest, and penalties that **would have been payable** if the Indian Settlement had been a **reserve** throughout the entire year.

> In simpler terms: If a band or individual had to pay more tax because the settlement wasn’t treated as a reserve, the government refunds the **excess tax** paid due to this non-reserve status.

#### ✅ **Type 2: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Remission (Section 7)**
- Applies to **Indians or bands** who receive **taxable supplies** (e.g., goods or services) delivered to the Indian Settlement.
- The remission applies **on or after**:
  - For **Indians**: the day the Order comes into force.
  - For **bands**: **January 1, 2000**.
- **Remission amount** = the difference between:
  - GST actually paid or payable by the recipient, and  
  - GST that would have been payable if the Indian Settlement had been a **reserve at the time of supply**.

> This addresses the fact that GST is typically not charged on supplies to reserves — so when supplies are made to an Indian Settlement (not a reserve), the recipient pays GST, which is unfair. This Order refunds the excess GST paid.

### 📌 **5. Conditions for Remission**

#### 🔹 For **Individual Indians (Section 6)**:
- The tax **must not have already been**:
  - Rebated, credited, refunded, or remitted under:
    - Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* (GST/HTS), or  
    - The *Financial Administration Act*.
- A **written claim** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the tax was paid.

> This ensures that remission is only granted once and only for unpaid or underpaid taxes.

#### 🔹 For **Bands (Section 6)**:
- Same condition as for individuals: **no prior remittance or refund** under the Excise Tax Act or Financial Administration Act.
- **Two separate claim timelines**:
  - For taxes paid **on or after January 1, 2000, but before the Order came into force**:  
    → Claim must be made within **two years of the Order coming into force**.
  - For taxes paid **on or after the Order came into force**:  
    → Claim must be made within **two years of the tax payment date**.

> This recognizes that the Order is retroactive in nature, and different claim windows are needed for different periods.

### 📌 **6. Key Legal and Policy Implications**

| Implication | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Recognition of Indigenous Status and Land Use** | Treats Indian Settlements as if they were reserves for tax purposes, acknowledging their functional and cultural role as Indigenous communities. |
| **Equity and Fairness** | Prevents Indigenous individuals and bands from bearing the full tax burden of non-reserve status, which is not consistent with the principle that reserves are tax-exempt or taxed differently. |
| **Fiscal Adjustment** | Corrects a gap in tax policy where settlements not designated as reserves are subject to full taxation — a policy that may be seen as unjust or discriminatory. |
| **Temporary Nature** | The Order is not permanent; it ends when the land is officially designated as a reserve. This allows for future government decisions about land status. |
| **Administrative Burden** | Requires claims to be filed within two years, ensuring timely processing and accountability. |

### 📌 **7. Reference to Relevant Acts**

- **Income Tax Act** (Parts I, I.1, I.2): Governs income tax treatment.
- **Excise Tax Act** (Part IX): Governs GST/HST.
- **Financial Administration Act**: Provides the authority to issue remission orders.
- **Indian Act**: Defines key terms like "band," "Indian," and "reserve."

---

### 📌 **8. Practical Impact**

- **For Individuals**: May receive a refund of income tax or GST paid on income or supplies related to the Indian Settlement.
- **For Bands**: May receive a refund of GST on supplies made to the settlement after 2000, especially if those supplies were made before the Order was enacted.
- **For the Government**: A one-time correction of a tax policy gap, with no long-term fiscal impact beyond the remission of excess taxes.

---

### 📌 **9. Conclusion**

The **Saskatchewan Indian Federated College Remission Order, 2003** is a targeted, equitable, and legally grounded policy measure that:

- **Corrects a tax inequity** by recognizing that Indian Settlements should be treated as reserves for tax purposes.
- **Provides financial relief** to individuals and bands who paid more taxes due to the non-reserve status of the settlement.
- **Ensures compliance** with both tax laws and the principles of fairness under the *Indian Act*.
- **Remains temporary**, ending only when the land is formally designated as a reserve.

This Order reflects a broader commitment to **Indigenous self-determination, land rights, and fiscal justice** within Canada’s tax system.

---

> ✅ **Bottom Line**: This regulation is a **fiscal correction** to ensure that Indigenous communities are not unfairly taxed simply because their land is not officially designated as a reserve — providing a meaningful, legally sound, and temporary remedy.
