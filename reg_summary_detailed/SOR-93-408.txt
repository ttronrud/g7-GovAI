### **Detailed Summary of the Swift Current Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Swift Current Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically pursuant to **Sections 5.4 and 5.5**. These regulations define spatial restrictions and environmental controls around **Swift Current Airport** in Saskatchewan to ensure aviation safety, particularly by minimizing hazards such as obstructions and bird attraction near the airport.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

- The proposed regulations were first published in two successive issues of the **Canada Gazette Part I** on **March 20 and 27, 1993**, and in two issues of the **Southwest Booster** on **March 22 and April 5, 1993**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, businesses, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on the public consultation and recommendations, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the advice of the Minister of Transport, officially adopted the regulations on **March 27, 1993**.

> ✅ **Legal Authority**: Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act authorizes the Governor General to make zoning regulations for airports; Section 5.5 requires prior publication to allow public input.

---

## **2. Regulatory Title and Scope**

- **Title**: *Swift Current Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicable Area**: All land, including public road allowances, that is **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Swift Current Airport**.
- The specific boundaries of this area are defined in **Part VI of the Schedule** and are based on the **Swift Current Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2851**, dated **July 5, 1990**.

## **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Swift Current Airport, located near Swift Current, Saskatchewan |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point on the centerline of runway 12–30, 647.7 meters from the threshold of runway 30 |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 12 and 30) to prevent aircraft from encountering obstacles during approach |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane 45 meters above the ARP elevation (but capped at 9 meters above ground if closer than that) |
| **Strip** | The active runway area (1,415.4 meters long, 150 meters wide) associated with runway 12–30 |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces, extending upward to intersect with the outer surface |

> ⚠️ **Elevation of ARP**: 807.8 meters above sea level

---

## **4. Key Provisions and Restrictions**

### **A. Prohibition of Obstructions**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land,
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> 🔍 This ensures that no structure (e.g., trees, towers, buildings) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

### **B. Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces:
  - The **Minister of Transport** may require the **owner or lessee** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> 🌳 Purpose: Prevents uncontrolled tree growth from becoming a hazard during flight operations.

---

### **C. Prohibition of Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**
- No owner or lessee may allow any part of the regulated land to be used for:
  - Disposal of **edible or bird-attractive waste** (e.g., food scraps, organic matter).

> 🐦 Purpose: Reduces bird presence near the airport, which helps prevent bird strikes — a major aviation safety risk.

---

## **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway 12 and 30)**

Each approach surface is an **inclined plane** rising at a **1:40 ratio** (1 meter vertical rise per 40 meters horizontal distance):

- **Starts at the end of the runway strip** (runway 12 or 30).
- Rises to a **horizontal line**:
  - 3,000 meters horizontally from the runway end,
  - 525 meters from the centerline of the runway,
  - 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end.
- Applies to both runway ends (12 and 30).

> ✅ Ensures a safe zone for aircraft approaching the runway, reducing the risk of collision with obstacles.

---

### **B. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (807.8 m → 852.8 m).
- **Exception**: Where the outer surface would be less than 9 meters above ground, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground level**.

> 🌍 This creates a buffer zone above the airport that prevents structures from rising too high and creating visual or physical hazards.

---

### **C. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal distance).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of the runway strip and its approach surfaces.
- Rise to intersect with the **outer surface**.

> 🔗 Acts as a "transition" between the runway edges and the outer boundary, ensuring a smooth, safe gradient.

---

## **6. Boundary of Regulated Land**

The regulated land is defined by a detailed **survey-based boundary description** in the Schedule, referencing specific **sections, townships, ranges, and registered plans**.

### **Key Geographic Features in the Boundary Description**:
- Begins at the **northeast corner of Section 31, Township 15, Range 12, W of 3rd Meridian**.
- Travels through:
  - Sections 31, 30, 19, 18, 13, 15, 16, 21, 28, 33
  - Road allowances (public rights-of-way)
  - Specific registered land parcels:
    - **Parcel A (Plan 60-SC-02980)**
    - **Plan 68-SC-12033**
    - **Plan 74-SC-07986**
    - **Parcel G (Plan 77-SC-01117)**
    - **Plan C.W.4550**

> 🗺️ This boundary forms a large, irregular polygon surrounding the airport, ensuring that all land within a defined zone is subject to the zoning rules.

## **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aviation Safety** | Prevents obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach. |
| **Flight Visibility** | Maintains clear visual lines of sight for pilots. |
| **Bird Hazard Mitigation** | Reduces bird activity by banning waste disposal that attracts birds. |
| **Public and Environmental Protection** | Balances development with safety, protecting both people and aircraft. |

---

## **8. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste restrictions.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in this regulation.

---

## **9. Historical and Planning Context**

- These regulations are **based on the Swift Current Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2851**, dated **July 5, 1990**, which provides the foundational design and layout.
- The plan was developed to align with **aviation safety standards** and is consistent with national and international best practices for airport zoning.
