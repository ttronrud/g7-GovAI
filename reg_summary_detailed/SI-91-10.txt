Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Passover Products Remission Order**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under **section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**.
- It is authorized by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board**.
- This means the decision to revoke an older order and issue a new one is grounded in federal financial administration powers, specifically those allowing the government to adjust tax policies in the public interest.

#### **2. Revocation of Prior Order**
- The regulation **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1966-19/2220**, dated December 1, 1966.
- This older order was previously governing the remission (exemption) of customs duties and excise taxes on certain Passover-related products.

#### **3. Purpose of the New Order**
- The new order establishes a **modernized and specific remission framework** for customs duties and excise taxes on **Passover foods and products**.
- These products are:
  - Of a **class not available in Canada**.
  - Intended for use during the **Passover holiday**.
  - Imported within a **defined time period**.

#### **4. Scope of Remission**
- **Customs taxes** imposed under:
  - **Division III of Part IX of the Customs Tariff** (relating to certain goods and duties).
  - **Any other part of the Excise Tax Act** (applicable to excise taxes on specific products).
- **Applies to**:
  - Passover foods and products that are **not available in Canada**.
  - Products **intended for use during the Passover holiday**.
- **Import window**:
  - Begins **two months before the eve of the first day of Passover**.
  - Ends on the **last day of the Passover holiday**.

> ⚠️ *Note: This import window is significant because it allows sufficient time for Jewish communities in Canada to import necessary religious items, especially since many such products are not produced domestically.*

#### **5. Name of the Order**
- The new regulation is officially titled:  
  **"The Passover Products Remission Order"**  
  (May be cited as such).

#### **6. Conditions for Remission**
- Remission is **only granted under section 2 of the Excise Tax Act** (implied from context).
- A **claim for remission must be made** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- The claim must be submitted **within two years after the final accounting** for the goods.
  - "Final accounting" refers to the completion of the customs and excise tax reporting process under **section 32 of the Customs Act**.

> This two-year deadline ensures timely claims and prevents long-term tax liabilities, while still allowing reasonable time for businesses or importers to assess and report their transactions.

#### **7. Repeal Status**
- The regulation notes that **this order was previously repealed by Statutory Instrument SI/98-17, section 3**.
- However, the current version **reinstates and replaces** the earlier order, indicating that the repeal was **temporary or procedural**, and the current order is now in force as a permanent or renewed policy.

> This suggests that the 1998 repeal was likely due to administrative or policy changes, but the current order restores the remission mechanism with updated parameters.

### **Key Objectives and Public Interest Justification**
- **Religious freedom and cultural accommodation**: Ensures that religious communities (particularly Jewish Canadians) can observe religious practices by accessing essential food items not available domestically.
- **Economic and practical necessity**: Addresses the unique need for specific Passover foods (e.g., matzah, kosher ingredients) that are not produced in Canada.
- **Public interest**: The Governor General’s decision is based on the principle that such exemptions serve a broader public interest by supporting religious observance and community well-being.

---

### **Practical Implications**
- Importers or businesses importing Passover products into Canada during the specified window may **claim a remission of customs and excise taxes**.
- They must:
  1. Ensure the products are **not available in Canada**.
  2. Confirm the products are **intended for Passover use**.
  3. Import within the **two-month pre-holiday to holiday-end window**.
  4. Submit a **formal claim to the Minister of National Revenue** within **two years of final accounting**.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a clear, time-bound, and conditionally applicable remission of customs and excise taxes on specific Passover-related goods not available in Canada. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and religious accommodation, ensuring that Canadian citizens can observe religious holidays without undue financial burden. The policy is both historically rooted and updated to meet modern needs, with clear procedural requirements for claimants.

**Final Note**: While the regulation is specific, it remains a significant example of how Canadian tax policy can support religious and cultural practices through targeted exemptions.
