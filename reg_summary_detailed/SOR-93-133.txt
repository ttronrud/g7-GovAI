Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations*, S.C. 1993, c. 2, s. 4, as amended and interpreted in the context of Canadian patent and drug regulation.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations**

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations implement **section 55.2(4)** of the *Patent Act* and are made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** (now the Minister of Health).  
They establish a framework for how **patents on patented medicines** are evaluated and managed in relation to **new drug submissions** and **supplements** under the *Food and Drug Regulations (FDR)*.

The primary objective is to **ensure that only valid, relevant, and properly authorized patents are included in a public register**, thereby protecting innovators while allowing generic manufacturers to enter the market after appropriate compliance with patent rights.

### **3. The Register: Management and Maintenance**

The **Minister of Health** maintains a **public register** of:
- Patents and certificates of supplementary protection (CSPs)
- That meet eligibility criteria
- That are linked to new drug submissions or supplements

#### **Actions the Minister May Take Regarding the Register:**

| Action | Conditions |
|-------|-----------|
| ✅ **Add** a patent/CSP | If it meets eligibility requirements and a notice of compliance has been issued for the related submission. |
| ❌ **Refuse to add** | If the patent does not meet eligibility criteria. |
| 🔁 **Delete** a patent/CSP | If: <br> - It was added due to an administrative error; <br> - It has been declared invalid/void under s.60(1) or s.125(1) of the Patent Act; <br> - It has been declared ineligible under s.6.07(1); <br> - The first person requests deletion; <br> - The patent has expired (unless a CSP covers it); <br> - The CSP has expired. |

> 🔍 **Important Restriction**:  
> The Minister **cannot delete** a patent based on a Federal Court decision **before the later of**:  
> - The deadline for appealing to the Federal Court of Appeal;  
> - The date when the appeal is discontinued or dismissed.  
> This protects patent rights during judicial review.

> ✅ If a deletion is later **reversed on appeal**, the patent/CSP is **re-added** to the register.

> 🔄 The Minister may **review** the register to remove any patent/CSP that fails to meet eligibility standards.

> ⏳ If a drug's **identification number (DIN)** is cancelled under **C.01.014.6(1)(a)** (e.g., due to a change in manufacturer), the related patent is deleted from the register **90 days after cancellation**.

> ✅ **Exception**: If the DIN is cancelled due to a manufacturer change, subsection (3) does **not apply**.

> ✅ If a new DIN is assigned to the same drug after cancellation, the previously deleted patent is **re-added** when the required documentation under **C.01.014.3** is received.

#### **Public Access**
- The register is **open to public inspection during business hours**.

### **4. Eligibility Criteria for Adding a Patent to the Register**

A patent may be added to the register **only if**:

#### For a **new drug submission**:
The patent must contain **one of the following claims** and the corresponding claim must have been approved via a **notice of compliance**:

| Claim Type | Eligibility Condition |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Medicinal ingredient** | The ingredient must be approved (via notice of compliance). Even if other ingredients are present in the submission. |
| **Formulation** | The formulation must be approved. The claim may include non-medicinal ingredients; even if other non-medicinal ingredients are present. |
| **Dosage form** | The dosage form must be approved. |
| **Use of ingredient** | The use (diagnosis, treatment, etc.) must be approved. The use may be broader than the submission (e.g., combination with another drug), or include additional ingredients. |

> ✅ **Flexibility**:  
> - A patent may include **additional ingredients** beyond those claimed — still eligible.  
> - A patent may include **additional uses** — still eligible.  
> - A patent may include **combination therapy** — still eligible.

#### For a **supplement to a new drug submission**:
The supplement must involve a **change in**:
- Formulation
- Dosage form
- Use of the ingredient

And the patent must contain a claim for the **changed version** that has been approved via a **notice of compliance** for the supplement.

> Example: A supplement requesting a new tablet formulation — the patent must claim that formulation and must have been approved in the supplement.

#### For a **Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP)**:
- The underlying patent must be **on the register** for that submission or supplement.
- The CSP must grant rights, privileges, or liberties under **section 115 of the Patent Act** (i.e., it must extend protection for the drug).

> CSPs are only eligible if they are tied to a valid, registered patent and relate to a drug with a valid submission.
