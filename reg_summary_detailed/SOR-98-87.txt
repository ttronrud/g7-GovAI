### **Detailed Summary of the "Shirting Fabrics Remission Order, 1998"**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff Act (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.))**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. It constitutes a formal government policy decision to provide **customs duty remission** for specific types of imported shirting fabrics used in the production of tailored collar shirts in Canada.

#### **2. Definitions (Key Terms Used in the Order)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Finished fabric** | A fabric that has undergone all processes required to convert a greige fabric into a marketable product suitable for sale to a shirt manufacturer. This includes finishing such as washing, shrinking, and finishing treatments. |
| **Greige fabric** | Fabric that has come directly from the loom without any post-weaving processing. Includes fabrics woven from dyed or coloured yarns but not finished. |
| **Shirting fabric** | A broadwoven textile fabric, not used for interlining or interfacing, specifically intended for manufacturing tailored collar shirts. |
| **Tailored collar shirt** | A man’s or boy’s shirt under **Heading No. 62.05 of the Customs Tariff**, featuring a collar made from one or more pieces of material cut and sewn or fused, with pointed or rounded ends. |
| **Yarn-dyed fabric** | A fabric woven from at least one yarn dyed in a colour different from the base (background) colour, with the dyed pattern distributed in a **repetitive and predetermined pattern in the warp direction**. Dyed yarns may or may not appear in the weft direction. |

> These definitions are critical for determining eligibility for duty remission.

The Order provides **customs duty remission** for imports of **shirting fabrics** used in the production of **tailored collar shirts**, with different levels of remission applied over time. The remission applies to two types of producers:

- **Producers of finished shirting fabrics** listed in **Schedule B**

##### **A. Remission Periods and Levels**

| Period | Type of Fabric | Remission Rate | Recipients |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **January 1, 1998 – December 31, 2004** | Yarn-dyed shirting fabrics | **Full remission (100%)** | Tailored collar shirt manufacturers (Schedule A) |
| **January 1, 2005 – December 31, 2006** | Yarn-dyed (to manufacturers) and Greige (to finished fabric producers) | **Full remission (100%)** | Manufacturers (Schedule A); Finished fabric producers (Schedule B) |
| **January 1, 2007 – December 31, 2007** | Yarn-dyed (to manufacturers) and Greige (to producers) | **75% remission** | Both groups |
| **January 1, 2008 – December 31, 2008** | Yarn-dyed (to manufacturers) and Greige (to producers) | **50% + 25% = 75% total** | Both groups (note: 50% + 25% = 75%) |
| **January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2009** | Yarn-dyed and greige fabrics | **75% remission** | Both groups |
| **January 1, 2010 – December 31, 2010** | Yarn-dyed and greige fabrics | **50% remission** | Both groups |

- **For producers of finished shirting fabrics (Schedule B):**
  - A **full remission (100%)** is granted for **greige and finished shirting fabrics** imported between **January 1, 1998 – December 31, 2004**.
