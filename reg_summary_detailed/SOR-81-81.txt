     - The claimant must have been a **Canadian citizen from the time the claim arose or when they obtained title to it until November 7, 1980**.
     - If title to the claim was obtained **after** it arose, **each predecessor in title** must have been a Canadian citizen during the time they held the claim.

4. **Succession and Death of Claimants**  
   - If an eligible claimant **dies after November 7, 1980**, an award may be made to **any person lawfully entitled** to the claim, regardless of nationality.

5. **Corporate Claimants**  
   - For a Canadian-owned corporation:
     - The award amount is limited to the **same percentage** of the total claim as the **Canadian beneficial ownership** of the shares.
     - This percentage is calculated based on either the date the claim arose or November 7, 1980, whichever is **lesser**.

6. **Offset of External Compensation**  
   - If a claimant has already received or is likely to receive compensation from **any source other than the Fund**, the Commission must **deduct that amount** from the recommended award.
   - If a claimant **neglected or defaulted** in applying for such external compensation, the rule applies as if they had already received it.

7. **Negligence and Default**  
   - If a claimant **knew or should have known** that failing to act by a fixed deadline would result in losing eligibility for external compensation, and they fail to act, this failure is treated as **neglect** for the purposes of eligibility.

### **Payment Process**

  - Moneys received from the **Cuban Government under Article I of the Agreement**.
  - Any **interest** credited to the Fund on those moneys.

- **Payment Priority and Shortfall Handling**:
  - If the Fund balance is **insufficient** to pay all awards in full:

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time-bound Eligibility** | Claims must be submitted by November 7, 1980. This reflects the historical and political closure of the period under review. |
| **Equity and Fairness** | The rules ensure that only those with Canadian citizenship at the relevant time are eligible, and that corporate claims are proportionally limited. |
| **Prevention of Double Compensation** | The system prevents claimants from receiving compensation from both the Fund and other sources. |
| **Fund Limitations** | The Fund has a finite source (Cuban government payments under the Accord), so payments are capped and distributed fairly in case of shortfall. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Reports are sent to claimants upon approval, and all documents (bonds, shares, etc.) are delivered to the Minister of Finance. |
