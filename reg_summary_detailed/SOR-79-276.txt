The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** — it no longer exists or has legal effect.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **Supplemental Order in Council (SOR) 2017-84**, which was published in the Canada Gazette on May 15, 2017.
- **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84**: This section specifically identifies the provisions being repealed. While the exact content of the original regulation is not provided in your input, the fact that it is listed multiple times suggests that it was a standalone or frequently referenced rule, possibly related to a specific area of regulation (e.g., environmental, safety, or administrative matters).
- **Legal Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in this regulation are now **no longer enforceable**. Legal or administrative bodies must refer to current, active legislation or regulations instead.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when they are:
  - Outdated or obsolete,
  - Overlapping with newer, more comprehensive legislation,
  - Inconsistent with current policy,
  - Replaced by a more effective or modern version.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or current regulation** to summarize, as the regulation referenced has been **formally repealed** by SOR/2017-84, section 1. The repeated entries in your input are simply a technical notation indicating that the regulation is no longer in force.

👉 **Recommendation**: To understand the original scope of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation (prior to May 15, 2017), which may be archived in the *Canada Gazette*, the *Statutes of Canada*, or through the Government of Canada's legislation database (e.g., [canada.ca/laws](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)).

If you can provide the **title or subject matter** of the original regulation (e.g., "Regulation respecting the use of certain chemicals"), I can assist in identifying what it originally covered before repeal.
