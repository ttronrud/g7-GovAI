**Detailed Summary of the Ste. Anne’s Hospital Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Ste. Anne’s Hospital Divestiture Regulations* were issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under the following statutory provisions:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a and subsection 42.1(2)b of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
  These provisions authorize the Treasury Board to make regulations governing specific circumstances affecting public service employees’ superannuation rights, particularly in cases involving transitions from public service employment to employment with certain public health institutions.

- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**  
  This grants the Treasury Board authority to make regulations related to the administration of public service benefits and financial arrangements, including superannuation.

These regulations are formally enacted under:
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, subpar. 225(z.19)(xxxiv)**  
- **S.C. 2012, c. 31, s. 499(3)**

- **R.S. c. F-11** (Financial Administration Act)

### **2. Scope and Applicability**

#### **Who Are the Regulations Applicable To?**
The Regulations apply to a person who:
- **Ceases to be employed in the public service** and
- **Becomes employed by the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de l’Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal (CIUSSS Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal)** — commonly known as the **Centre** —  
as a result of an agreement between:
- The **Government of Canada**,
- The **Government of Quebec**, and
- The **Centre (CIUSSS)**,  
dated **April 16, 2015**.

This transition is specifically tied to the **divestiture of Ste. Anne’s Hospital** from public ownership, which led to a restructuring of employment arrangements.

#### **Exclusions**
The Regulations **do not apply** to:
- A person who is **re-employed by the Centre** after leaving public service.

Additionally:
- **Sections 2, 3, and 7** of the Regulations (which may relate to pension eligibility, service credit, or benefit calculations) **do not apply** to:
  - The **survivor** or **children** of a person who:
    - Has received a **return of contributions**, or
    - Has exercised an **option under subsection 6(2)** of the PSSA (which typically relates to the right to receive a return of contributions or to opt out of pension benefits).

### **3. Key Provisions and Their Implications**

#### **(a) One-Year Period for Return of Contributions and Pension Options**

For the purposes of **subsection 10(5)** of the Public Service Superannuation Act:
- The **one-year period** that begins on the day a person ceases to be employed by the Centre applies to:
  - Requests for a **return of contributions**, and
  - Exercise of an **option under section 13.01** of the Act (which allows individuals to choose to receive a return of contributions instead of joining the pension plan).

> **Important**: This one-year window starts on the day the individual **ceases employment with the Centre**, not with the public service.

#### **(b) Survivor and Children Benefits**

If a person dies while employed by the Centre, their **survivor and children** are entitled to one of the following benefits — **as if the person had been employed in the public service**:
- The **death benefit** under:
  - Subsection **12(8)** or **12.1(8)** of the PSSA (depending on the employee’s status),
  - OR
  - The **allowances** under:
    - Subsection **13(3)** or **13.001(3)** of the PSSA (such as survivor’s pension or dependent allowances).

> This ensures that dependents receive the same level of support as they would have if the employee had remained in the public service.

#### **(c) Age and Pensionable Service at the Time of Exit**

- A person’s **age** for purposes of calculating benefits (such as survivor benefits or pension eligibility) is determined as their **age on the day they cease to be employed by the Centre**.
- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period that begins on the day the person **ceases to be employed in the public service** and
  - Ends on the day they **cease to be employed by the Centre**.

> This means that the time between leaving public service and joining the Centre is counted as pensionable service, which can impact pension calculations and eligibility.

#### **(d) Application of Sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSSA**

- These sections (covering death benefits, survivor benefits, and pension rights) **only apply to a person beginning on the day they cease to be employed by the Centre**.
- This implies that the transition period from public service to Centre employment is treated as a **new start date** for benefit entitlements, rather than a continuation of the original public service employment.

#### **(e) Right to Request Return of Contributions or Exercise Option**

If, **on or after April 1, 2016**, the individual would have been entitled to a **return of contributions** under:
- Subsection **12(3)** or **12.1(4)** of the PSSA (which allows for a refund of contributions in certain circumstances),  
then they may:
- **Request a return of contributions** in writing, **no later than one year after ceasing employment** with the Centre.

Similarly, if they would have been entitled to **exercise an option under section 13.01** of the PSSA (to opt out of the pension plan and receive a return of contributions), they may:
- **Exercise that option within the same one-year period**.

> This provides a clear, time-bound opportunity for individuals to make decisions about their superannuation benefits after transitioning to employment with the Centre.

#### **(f) Deemed Cessation of Public Service Employment**

Under **subsection 26(2)** of the PSSA:
- A person is **deemed to have ceased being employed in the public service** on the day they **cease to be employed by the Centre**.

> This legal interpretation ensures that the transition to the Centre is treated as a formal exit from public service for superannuation purposes.

### **4. Effective Date**

The Regulations come into force on **April 1, 2016**.

This date marks the beginning of the transitional framework for individuals affected by the Ste. Anne’s Hospital divestiture, ensuring consistency in how superannuation rights are administered during this shift.

---

### **5. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of these Regulations is to:
- **Clarify the superannuation rights** of individuals who transition from public service employment to employment with the CIUSSS Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal following the divestiture of Ste. Anne’s Hospital.
- Ensure **fair and equitable treatment** of these individuals by aligning their benefit entitlements with those of public service employees.
- Provide **clear timelines and conditions** for:
  - Returning contributions,
  - Exercising pension options,
  - Receiving survivor benefits,
  - Calculating pensionable service and age.

These provisions protect both the interests of the individual and the integrity of the public service superannuation system during a structural change in public health employment.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ste. Anne’s Hospital Divestiture Regulations* establish a comprehensive and legally grounded framework for managing the superannuation rights of public service employees who transition to employment with the CIUSSS Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal. By defining key dates, eligibility criteria, and benefit entitlements, the Regulations ensure consistency, fairness, and clarity in a complex transition scenario. They are particularly significant for:
- Individuals exiting public service,
- Their dependents (especially survivors),
- Those considering a return of contributions or pension options.

The Regulations reflect a balanced approach that respects both public service obligations and the evolving nature of public health employment in Canada.
