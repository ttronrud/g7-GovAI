**Detailed Summary of the Peace River Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Peace River Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6* of the Aeronautics Act** (S.C. 1976–77, c. 28, s. 2 and 49). This means the regulations are legally binding and enforceable within the Province of Alberta, specifically governing land use and development around Peace River Airport.

These regulations are formally titled:  
> **"Peace River Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Peace River Airport, located in the vicinity of Peace River, Alberta. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. It is located 91.44 meters (300 feet) northwesterly from a point on the centerline of runway 03–21, which is 640.14 meters (northeasterly) from the 03 end of the runway. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of the strip associated with runway 03–21. It has a gradient of **1:50** (1 meter rise per 50 meters horizontal), rising to a horizontal line 300 meters above the strip ends and 15,000 meters horizontally from the ends. The outer ends of these lines are 2,400 meters from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point** (567.2 meters above sea level). However, if this elevation would place it below 9 meters above ground level, the surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impracticality. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area associated with runway 03–21. It is **300 meters wide**, extending 150 meters on each side of the runway centerline, and **1,644 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontal), extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces to meet the outer surface. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: The airport reference point is officially deemed to be at **567.2 meters above sea level** for all calculations.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands** — including public road allowances — that fall within the following categories:

1. **Lands within** the boundaries defined in **Part II of the Schedule** (the outer limits of the airport zone);  
2. **Lands directly under** any portion of the **approach surface** that extends beyond the outer limits described in Part II.

This means that any land touching or lying beneath the approach surfaces beyond the outer boundary is subject to the zoning restrictions.

---

### **4. Development Restrictions**

No person may:

- **Erect, construct, or expand** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing ones)  
- **Whose highest point exceeds** the elevation of any of the following three surfaces at the location of that point:

  a. **Approach Surface**  
  b. **Outer Surface**  
  c. **Transitional Surface**

> This restriction applies to all structures, including residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, and even minor structures like fences or signs.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on any land subject to these regulations exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a directive requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision helps prevent bird attraction or obstruction to aircraft operations, particularly during takeoff and landing.

---

### **6. Waste Disposal Prohibitions**

No owner or occupier may use any land subject to these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:

- **Edible** or  
- **Attractive to birds**

This is intended to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can be dangerous during flight operations.

---

### **7. Boundary Description of Outer Limits**

The **outer limits** of the regulated area are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, based on a detailed survey boundary described in a formal survey plan:

- **Reference Plan**: *Peace River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1801*, dated **January 16, 1984**.
- The boundary is described as a complex, stepwise traverse involving multiple sections of land, road allowances, and quarter sections within:
  - Township 83, Range 22, West of the 5th Meridian
  - Township 84, Range 22 and 23, West of the 5th Meridian

Key features of the boundary:
- Begins at the intersection of the **South boundary of the South West Quarter of Section 18** and the **Easterly limit of Lot 4** (as per Land Titles Office Plan No. 802-2831).
- Traverses through various sections and road allowances (e.g., Sections 16, 17, 18, 22, 27, 34, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 35, 26, 23, 13).
- Includes directional movements: easterly, northerly, westerly, southerly, and diagonally.
- Ends at the **most northerly corner of Lot 2** in Section 18, returning to the starting point.

This boundary establishes the **legal perimeter** within which all zoning rules apply.

---

### **8. Approach Surface Details**

- Located at each end of the **strip** (runway 03–21).
- Gradient: **1:50** (1 meter rise per 50 meters horizontally).
- Extends **300 meters vertically** above the strip ends and **15,000 meters horizontally** from the ends.
- The outer ends of the horizontal lines are **2,400 meters from the runway centerline**.
- Purpose: Ensures safe visual clearance for aircraft during approach and landing.

---

### **9. Outer Surface Details**

- A flat, imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (567.2 m)** → **612.2 meters above sea level**.
- **Exception**: If 45 meters above ARP would place the surface **below 9 meters above ground**, the surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground**.
- Purpose: Provides a consistent, safe ceiling for all structures and natural features beyond the strip and approach zones.

---

### **10. Strip Dimensions**

- **Length**: 1,644 meters  
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the runway centerline)  
- Associated with **runway 03–21**

This strip is the core operational area where aircraft take off and land.

---

### **11. Transitional Surface Details**

- A **1:7 gradient** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontally).
- Extends from the **edges of the strip** and **approach surfaces** to their intersection with the **outer surface**.
- Ensures a smooth, gradual transition between the runway area and the outer surface, minimizing abrupt changes in elevation.

---

### **12. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue directives regarding removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with the zoning restrictions.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in the regulation itself.

---

### **13. Purpose and Intent**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear visual and physical space around the airport.
2. **Prevent hazards** such as bird strikes, obstructions, and uncontrolled vegetation.
3. **Preserve operational integrity** of runway and approach zones.
4. **Provide a consistent, legally defined zone** for land use planning and development control.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Peace River Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, technically precise framework for land use and development around Peace River Airport. By defining specific elevation surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), clearly marking boundaries, and imposing strict limits on construction and waste disposal, the regulations serve to protect aviation safety and operational efficiency.

These rules are grounded in both **technical aviation standards** and **legal authority**, reflecting a balance between development needs and the critical importance of maintaining safe airspace around a major regional airport.

**Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**:
- **Developers and landowners** must ensure all structures and natural features remain below the defined elevation surfaces.
- **Environmental stewards** must manage vegetation to avoid attracting birds.
- **Local governments and planners** must reference the zoning plan (E.1801) when approving land use or development projects near the airport.

This regulation remains a foundational document
