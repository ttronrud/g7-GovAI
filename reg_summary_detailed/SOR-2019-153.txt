### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**. It is grounded in specific provisions of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMIOA), specifically:

- **Paragraphs 5(1)(c)a, (f), (g), and (h)** of the Act.

These provisions authorize the government to grant privileges and immunities to participants in international events — such as conferences — when such measures are necessary for the proper functioning of the event and in accordance with international norms and conventions.

The Order is referenced in:
- **S.C. 2002, c. 12, s. 3(2)** – which provides the legal framework for granting privileges and immunities to foreign missions and international organizations.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 41** – the original *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant specific privileges and immunities** to participants in the **Ukraine Reform Conference 2019**, a high-level ministerial event held in Toronto, Ontario, on **July 1 and 2, 2019**. These privileges and immunities are designed to ensure that delegates and officials can carry out their duties without undue interference or disruption, in a manner consistent with international diplomatic standards.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes the following key definitions:

- **Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*. This is the international legal instrument that governs the rights and protections afforded to UN representatives and related personnel.

- **Meeting**: Specifically refers to the **Ministerial portion** of the Ukraine Reform Conference, held in Toronto on **July 1 and 2, 2019**. This distinguishes it from other sessions or forums that may be part of the broader conference.

- **Relevant Period**: Defined as the period from **June 29, 2019, to July 4, 2019**. This timeframe includes the days before, during, and immediately after the Meeting, allowing for logistical and operational continuity.

### **4. Privileges and Immunities Granted**

The Order grants different types of privileges and immunities to various categories of participants during the relevant period. These are structured according to the roles of the individuals involved.

#### **A. Representatives of Foreign States (Official Delegates to the Meeting)**

- These are **diplomatic-level delegates** from foreign governments attending the ministerial portion of the conference.
- They are granted privileges and immunities **to the extent required** for the performance of their official functions.
- The specific rights granted are those outlined in:
  - **Paragraphs 11(a) to (f)** of **Article IV** of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations.
- These include, but are not limited to:
  - Immunity from legal process (in certain circumstances),
  - Protection of communications and correspondence,
  - Freedom from arrest or detention without due process,
  - Exemption from taxes and duties,
  - Immunity from civil and criminal liability for acts done in the course of their official duties.

> *Note: These rights are limited to what is necessary for the exercise of their functions in relation to the Meeting.*

#### **B. Senior Officials of an International Organization**

- These are high-ranking officials (e.g., directors, heads of departments) from international organizations (e.g., UN agencies, regional bodies).
- They are granted privileges and immunities **comparable to those of diplomatic agents** under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR)**.
- However, **duty and tax relief privileges are excluded**.
- This means they enjoy:
  - Immunity from legal proceedings,
  - Protection of official communications,
  - Freedom from arrest or detention,
  - Exemption from certain administrative and financial obligations.

> *Important: The exclusion of duty and tax relief ensures that these officials are not granted full diplomatic status in terms of financial or administrative benefits, which may be intended to maintain fiscal accountability or avoid duplication with other international frameworks.*

#### **C. Other Officials of an International Organization**

- These are mid-level officials (e.g., staff, coordinators, administrative personnel) who are not senior but are involved in the operations of the organization.
- They are granted privileges and immunities as set out in:
  - **Paragraphs 18(a), (d), and (e)** of **Article V** of the Convention.
- These include:
  - Immunity from civil and criminal liability for acts performed in the course of their official duties,
  - Protection of personal and official communications,
  - Protection of official documents and equipment.

> *Note: These rights are limited to the scope necessary for their role in the Meeting.*

#### **D. Experts Performing Missions for an International Organization**

- These are technical or specialized experts (e.g., economists, legal advisors, engineers) who provide services to international organizations during the conference.
- They are granted the privileges and immunities as set out in **Article VI of the Convention**.
- These include:
  - Immunity from civil and criminal liability for acts done in the course of their expert functions,
  - Protection of personal and official communications,
  - Protection of documents and equipment used in their work.

> *Note: Expert privileges are generally more limited than those of diplomats or senior officials and are tailored to the nature of their professional engagement.*

---

### **6. Effective Date**

### **7. Significance and Implications**

- This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to **international cooperation** and **multilateralism** by facilitating the participation of foreign governments and international organizations in high-level policy discussions.
- It ensures that delegates and officials can engage in sensitive or confidential discussions without fear of legal repercussions, thereby promoting open and effective dialogue.
- It also demonstrates Canada’s adherence to international legal standards — particularly the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities — which are widely accepted norms in diplomatic practice.
- The exclusion of certain privileges (e.g., tax relief for senior officials) may reflect a balance between diplomatic protection and fiscal responsibility, especially in a non-diplomatic or non-permanent event like a reform conference.
