**Detailed Summary of the LASMO Drilling Rig Remission Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)). This provision allows the government to make special orders for the remission (i.e., reduction or waiver) of customs duties under specific circumstances, particularly when public interest, economic development, or national strategic objectives are at stake.

The Order is formally titled the **LASMO Drilling Rig Remission Order** and may be cited as such.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit a portion of the customs duties** that were paid or are payable on the **drilling rig named "Rowan Gorilla III"**, imported by **LASMO Nova Scotia Limited**. The rig is being used in the **Cohasset/Panuke Oil Development Project**, a significant oil exploration initiative located in Nova Scotia, Canada.

This remission is intended to support the development of Canada’s domestic energy sector by reducing the financial burden on companies involved in offshore oil exploration, thereby encouraging investment and resource development in Canadian waters.

---

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies specifically to **a portion of the customs duties** on the Rowan Gorilla III. It does **not** cover the full duty amount, nor does it eliminate all duties — only a calculated difference between two duty values.

The amount of remission is determined as follows:

> **Remission Amount =**  
> (Customs duties on **1/120th of the value for duty** of the rig, calculated under **Section 4 of the Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations**)  
> **minus**  
> (Customs duties on **1/120th of the value for duty** of the rig that would apply if the rig had been imported on **January 1 of each year** that it remains in Canadian customs waters)

**4. Key Regulatory Reference**  
- **Section 4 of the Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations (SOR/90-304, 1990, Canada Gazette Part II, p. 2246)**  
  This regulation provides the methodology for calculating duties on vessels based on a fractional share of their value. The use of **1/120th** of the value for duty reflects a standardized, proportional calculation typically applied to vessels for duty purposes, especially in cases involving long-term or recurring use in Canadian waters.

This fractional basis (1/120) is applied to the **total value for duty** of the rig to determine the duty payable or remitted, ensuring a consistent and transparent method of calculation.

---

**5. Time-Based Condition for Duty Application**  
The remission is tied to the **duration of the rig’s presence in Canadian customs waters**. Specifically:

- The calculation of the "duty that would apply" assumes the rig was imported on **January 1 of each year** during which it remains in Canadian waters.
- This implies that the duty calculation is **annualized**, and the remission is based on the difference between the duty that would have applied under normal rules and the duty that would apply under a hypothetical import date (January 1).

This approach effectively accounts for the rig’s long-term operational use in Canadian waters and adjusts the duty burden accordingly.

---

**6. Claim Deadline**  
A critical condition of the remission is that:

> A claim for the remission **must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue no later than two years following the end of each year** during which the rig remains in Canadian customs waters.

This means:
- If the rig remains in Canadian waters through 2024, a claim must be filed by **December 31, 2026**.
- If the rig is removed in 2025, the claim must be filed by **December 31, 2027**.
- The claim is **time-bound and annual**, with a two-year window per year of operation.

Failure to file a claim within this period results in the **loss of the right to remission**.

---

**7. Interpretation and Implications**  
- The remission is **not a full exemption** from customs duties; it is a **partial reduction** based on a specific formula.
- The use of **1/120th of value** suggests a method designed to reflect the rig’s value over time, possibly to prevent excessive or disproportionate duty charges for long-term, non-commercial vessels used in exploration.
- The requirement for **annual claims** ensures accountability and transparency in the use of government remission powers.
- The regulation supports **strategic energy development** in Canada by making capital-intensive offshore projects more financially viable.

---

**8. Oversight and Enforcement**  
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for receiving and processing claims for remission.
- The government retains oversight of compliance with the claim deadlines and the conditions of the remission.
- The Order is subject to the general provisions of **Sections 3 and 4**, which likely govern the conditions under which such remissions are valid and enforceable (e.g., eligibility, documentation, and administrative procedures).

---

**Conclusion**  
The **LASMO Drilling Rig Remission Order** is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally granted relief measure designed to reduce the financial burden of customs duties on a major offshore drilling rig used in Canada’s oil development efforts. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and strategic economic development, ensuring that critical infrastructure projects in Canada’s energy sector are not unduly hindered by customs costs.

This Order exemplifies how federal regulations can be used to support national economic objectives while maintaining compliance with established customs and fiscal principles.
