**Detailed Summary of the Golden Nematode Order (1980)**

---

### **Overview**

The **Golden Nematode Order**, issued on **April 3, 1980**, by the **Minister of Agriculture** of Canada under **Section 8 of the Plant Quarantine Act**, establishes a comprehensive set of restrictions and prohibitions aimed at **preventing the spread of the Golden Nematode (*Thrips* spp. – more accurately *Thrips* or *Globodera rostochiensis*, though commonly known as the Golden Nematode in this context)** — a destructive plant-parasitic nematode that affects root crops such as potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes, and other vegetables.

This Order applies specifically to a defined geographic area in **Central Saanich, British Columbia**, and is designed to protect agricultural and horticultural systems from infestation by restricting the movement of potentially contaminated plant materials, soil, and equipment.

### **Key Definitions and Geographic Scope**

#### 1. **Quarantine Area**
- Defined in a **Schedule** attached to the Order.
- Specifically refers to **a portion of the Municipality of Central Saanich in British Columbia, east of the West Saanich Road**.
- This area is designated as the zone where the Golden Nematode has been detected or is suspected to exist.

#### 2. **Category Land Classification**
These classifications determine the level of restriction and movement rules applicable to different types of land within the quarantine area:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Category A Land** | Land where **cysts of the Golden Nematode containing viable eggs or larvae** have been found. Highest risk zone. |
| **Category B Land** | Land **exposed to infestation or suspected of being infested** due to proximity or association with Category A land. Medium risk. |
| **Category C Land** | All land in the quarantine area **not classified as A or B**. Lowest risk. |

> These categories are critical for determining which movement rules apply to soil, plants, and machinery.

#### 3. **Restricted Movement Area**
- Includes the following **land districts**:
  - Esquimalt, Goldstream, Highland, Lake, Malahat, Metchosin, North Saanich, Otter, Sooke, and Victoria.
- Also includes **the portion of South Saanich Land District not within Central Saanich**.
- Additionally includes **all parts of Central Saanich west of the West Saanich Road**.

> This area is considered a **buffer zone** where movement of restricted materials from the quarantine area is permitted under strict conditions.

---

### **Prohibited and Restricted Movements (Section 1)**

The Order **prohibits or restricts** the transportation **into, out of, or within** the quarantine area of the following materials **if they are contaminated with the Golden Nematode or contain infested soil**:

#### **Prohibited Items Include:**
- **Golden Nematode itself**, including cysts with viable eggs or larvae.
- **Soil and sand**, including media (e.g., potting mix) containing soil or sand.
- **Plants and plant parts** with soil or roots, including:
  - Nursery stock
  - Greenhouse plants
  - Bedding plants
  - Vegetable transplants
  - Sod
- **Eggplant, potato, and tomato plants and parts**.
- **Raw or unprocessed root crops and vegetables** (e.g., fresh carrots, beets, potatoes).
- **Containers and packing materials** that contain soil or sand or have soil adhering to them.
- **Hay, straw, plant litter, and manure**.

> The intent is to **prevent the mechanical or biological spread** of nematodes through soil movement and plant material transport.

### **Exemptions (Section 1 – Exceptions)**

Certain items are **exempt from the restrictions** if they are **free from soil**:

| Exempt Items | Conditions |
|------------|-----------|
| Plants propagated in **synthetic growing media** (e.g., perlite, expanded mica, Baystrat, expanded clay) | Must be free of soil |
| **Unrooted plants** (e.g., Christmas trees, holly wreaths, budsticks, seeds, fruits) | No soil attached |
| **Aquatic plants, moss, or lycopodium** | Not susceptible to nematode infestation |
| **Peat moss in sealed bags or unbroken bales** | No soil exposure |
| **Processed root crops and vegetables** (e.g., canned, cooked, processed) | Not raw or unprocessed |
| **New machinery, implements, or vehicles** | Never contacted soil |
| **All vegetables and unprocessed root crops except potatoes** | Exempt from restrictions |

> These exemptions allow for **essential agricultural and horticultural activities** without undue disruption.

---

### **Permitted Movement Under Inspector Oversight (Section 2)**

Any item listed in the prohibited list (paragraphs 1(a) to (g)) **may be moved within the quarantine area or transported from it** if:

1. It originated in **non-infested premises** within the quarantine area.
2. It has **not been exposed to infestation** during its movement.
3. It has been **treated to destroy nematodes** as required by an inspector.
4. It was **grown, produced, stored, or handled** in a way that ensures **no infestation can be transmitted**.

> This provision allows for **controlled, safe movement** of materials that meet strict criteria.

---

### **Special Rules for Potatoes (Section 3)**

Potatoes are a high-value crop and are subject to specific, more lenient rules:

#### **For Potatoes Intended for Marketing or Processing:**
To be moved within or out of the quarantine area, they must meet **all three conditions**:
1. **Washed and soil-free** on the producer’s premises or at a **grading station approved by an inspector**.
2. Transported from the producer to a grading station in a way that **prevents spread** (e.g., sealed containers, clean vehicles).
3. **Packed in new containers** (not reused or previously used in infested areas).

> This ensures that marketable potatoes are safe and do not carry nematodes.

#### **For Cull Potatoes (Livestock Feed Only):**
- Must meet the **same washing and transport standards** as marketable potatoes.
- Must be **authorized by an inspector**.
- Transport must be to **premises approved by the inspector**.

> This allows for **safe disposal or use of damaged potatoes** as feed without spreading the disease.

---

### **Soil Samples for Scientific or Research Purposes (Section 4)**

Soil samples may be moved **from the quarantine area** under a **movement certificate** issued under **Section 10 of the Plant Quarantine Regulations**, provided:

- They have been **treated to prevent spread** of the nematode, or
- If untreated, they are transported in a way that **prevents transmission** (e.g., sealed, clean packaging, controlled handling at destination).

> This balances the need for **scientific research** with the imperative to **prevent disease spread**.

### **Movement of Machinery, Implements, and Vehicles (Section 5)**

Rules vary based on **where the equipment was used**:

#### **1. Equipment Used on Category A Land:**
- May be moved:
  - **Within Category A land** without cleaning.
  - To **Category B or C land** or outside the quarantine area **only if**:
    - All plant debris and soil are removed at the site.
    - Equipment is cleaned under inspector supervision (if required).
    - Prior notice is given to the inspector.

#### **2. Equipment Used on Category B Land:**
- May be moved:
  - To **Category A or B land** without cleaning.
  - To **Category C land** or outside the quarantine area **only if**:
    - All plant debris and soil are removed at the site or at an approved site.
    - Equipment is cleaned under inspector supervision (if required).
    - Prior notice is given to the inspector.

#### **3. Equipment Used on Category C Land:**
- May be moved:
  - **Within the quarantine area** or to the **restricted movement area** without cleaning.
  - To **any other area** (outside the quarantine area) **only if**:
    - All plant debris and soil are removed at the working site.
    - Equipment is cleaned under inspector supervision (if required).

> These rules reflect a **risk-based approach**, with higher restrictions for equipment used in high-risk zones.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **inspector** has the authority to:
  - Determine whether a material is infested or free from nematodes.
  - Approve movement of items (including potatoes, soil samples, and equipment).
  - Require cleaning or treatment.
  - Issue movement certificates.
- Any violation of these rules may result in **fines or legal action** under the **Plant Quarantine Act**.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The Golden Nematode Order was enacted to:
- **Contain the spread** of a highly destructive nematode that can devastate root crops.
- **Protect the agricultural economy** of British Columbia by preventing the introduction of a pest into non-infested regions.
- **Balance agricultural needs** with biosecurity through targeted exemptions and oversight.
- Serve as a **model for future plant quarantine responses** to invasive pests.
