### **Detailed Summary of the Dauphin Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Context**

The **Dauphin Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 4.5**: Requires that proposed zoning regulations be publicly published to allow for public comment.
- **Section 4.4**: Grants the Minister of Transport the power to adopt and implement proposed zoning regulations after a reasonable opportunity for public input.

These regulations were:
- Published in **two successive issues of *Canada Gazette, Part I*** on **June 6 and 13, 1987**,
- Published in **two successive issues of *The Daily Bulletin*** on **June 29 and July 3, 1987**.

This ensured a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties (e.g., landowners, aviation stakeholders, environmental groups)** to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally enacted the regulations.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *Dauphin Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Dauphin Airport**, Manitoba.

The regulated area includes:
1. All lands **within the outer limits** described in **Part VI of the schedule**.
2. All lands **directly under the portions of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond these outer limits.

> This ensures that both the immediate surrounding area and any areas directly beneath critical aviation safety zones are governed by these rules.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Dauphin Airport in the vicinity of Dauphin, Manitoba. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a baseline for elevation and spatial measurements. Located at the midpoint of runway 14–32. Coordinates: Northing 5,661,443.495 m, Easting 426,278.779 m (UTM, 6° zone). |
| **Approach Surface** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runways (strip ends), designed to ensure unobstructed aircraft approach paths. Described in **Part II** of the schedule. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation (300 m AGL)**, but **reduced to 9 meters above ground level** if the ground elevation is less than 9 meters. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area (runway and associated taxiways), including take-off and landing zones. Defined in **Part IV**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. Described in **Part V**. |

> **Elevation Reference**: The airport reference point is set at **300 meters above sea level (m ASL)**. All surfaces are measured relative to this point.

#### **4. Prohibitions on Construction and Development**

No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing ones) on land covered by these regulations  
- **Where the highest point of the structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces:
  - The **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - The **transitional surface**

> This restriction ensures that no physical obstruction (such as trees, towers, or buildings) interferes with aircraft during approach, take-off, or flight paths.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces:
  - The **Minister of Transport may require** the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This provision allows for proactive management of natural features that could pose a hazard to aviation safety.

> Purpose: Prevents overgrown trees or tall grasses from creating visual or physical obstructions during critical flight phases.

---

#### **6. Waste Disposal Prohibitions**

- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
    - **Edible by birds** (e.g., food scraps)
    - **Attractive to birds** (e.g., seeds, fats, or other organic materials)

> This is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation safety hazard.

> **Rationale**: Bird strikes can cause significant damage to aircraft engines and wings, leading to flight delays, damage, or even crashes.

#### **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces (Based on Zoning Plan E2186)**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces** (for runways 08–26 and 14–32)

| Runway | Inclination Ratio | Horizontal Distance to Surface | Height of Horizontal Line | Distance from Centre Line |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 08 (approach) | 1:25 (vertical:horizontal) | 3,000 m from end | 120 m above end elevation | 330 m from centre line |
| 26 (approach) | 1:25 | 3,000 m | 120 m above end elevation | 330 m from centre line |
| 14 (approach) | 1:40 | 3,000 m | 75 m above end elevation | 525 m from centre line |
| 32 (approach) | 1:40 | 3,000 m | 75 m above end elevation | 525 m from centre line |

> These surfaces are designed to ensure that aircraft approaching the runway have a clear path without obstructions.

---

##### **B. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (300 m ASL)** → **345 m ASL**
- **Exception**: If the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level** to prevent impractical or unsafe enforcement.

> Purpose: Defines the upper boundary of permissible development beyond the strips and approach zones.

---

##### **C. Strips** (Runway Areas)

| Runway | Width | Length | Side Width |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| 08–26 | 60 m | 958 m | 30 m on each side |
| 14–32 | 150 m | 1,644 m | 75 m on each side |

> The longer and wider runway (14–32) reflects its primary use and higher traffic volume.

---

##### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

| Runway | Inclination Ratio | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 08–26 | 1:5 (vertical:horizontal) | Inclined plane rising from lateral edges of strip and approach surfaces, extending to meet outer surface or adjacent transitional surface |
| 14–32 | 1:7 | Inclined plane rising at a steeper gradient (1:7), extending to outer surface or adjacent surface |

> These surfaces serve as **transition zones** between the runway edge and the outer surface, ensuring smooth, unobstructed flight paths and preventing abrupt changes in terrain.

---

#### **8. Boundary of the Outer Limits of Lands**

The boundary of the regulated area is precisely defined in **Part VI of the schedule**, based on a detailed **survey-based traverse** through land parcels and road allowances. Key points include:

- Starts at the **northeast corner of Section 36, Township 24, Range 19, W of PM**
- Traverses through:
  - Section boundaries
  - Road allowances (e.g., highways, access roads)
  - Land title plans (e.g., Plan 1426, Plan 1104, Plan 2085, Plan 1898, Plan 247)
- Ends at the **northwest corner of the northeast quarter of Section 36, Township 24, Range 19, W of PM**

> This boundary ensures that the zone is clearly defined and legally enforceable, protecting only the areas directly relevant to airport operations and safety.

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Aviation Safety** | Prevents obstructions (buildings, trees, waste) that could interfere with aircraft during take-off, landing, or approach. |
| **Environmental Protection** | Prohibits bird-attractive waste to reduce bird strike risks. |
| **Clear Regulatory Boundaries** | Defines precise spatial limits and elevation controls using technical survey data. |
| **Public Participation** | Public notice and comment process ensured transparency and accountability. |
| **Enforceability** | Clear definitions, measurable surfaces, and defined responsibilities (Minister, owners) make enforcement feasible. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Dauphin Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive, technically precise, and safety-focused framework designed to protect the operational integrity of Dauphin Airport. By establishing clear spatial boundaries, elevation limits, and environmental controls,
