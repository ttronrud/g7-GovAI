The primary purpose of these commissions is to:

  - **Equal population distribution** across ridings (as required by the principle of "one person, one vote").
  - **Geographic fairness and accessibility**.
  - **Representation of diverse communities**.
- The commissions are required to submit their final reports and recommendations to the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** by a deadline set under the EBRA (typically within 12 to 18 months after the census data is finalized).
