**3. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **remit (waive) customs duties** on **billiard cloth** that is imported into Canada for the purpose of **manufacturing or repairing billiard tables**. This measure aims to support domestic industries involved in the production and maintenance of billiard tables by reducing the cost of essential raw materials.

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies to:  
- **Billiard cloth** classified under **tariff item numbers**:  
  - **5111.19.00**  
  - **5112.19.10**  
  These classifications are found in **Schedule I to the Customs Tariff**, which lists dutiable goods subject to specific tariff rates.  

The remission specifically covers **billiard cloth used in the manufacture or repair of billiard tables**, not for other purposes such as general textile use or non-billiard applications.

**5. Conditions for Eligibility**  
Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

**Condition 1: Import Period**  
The billiard cloth must have been **imported into Canada during a specific timeframe**:  
- From **July 1, 1995**, to **December 31, 1997**, inclusive.  
This means goods imported outside this window are **not eligible** for remission under this Order.

**Condition 2: Timely Claim Submission**  
A claim for remission must be **submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within three years** of the date of importation.  
- The claim must be filed **no later than three years after the date the goods entered Canada**.  
- Failure to file within this period results in **loss of eligibility** for the remission.

**6. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The remission is granted under **Section 2** of the Customs Tariff, which allows for duty remission in specific cases, often tied to industrial or economic objectives.  
- The Minister of National Revenue is the responsible authority to process claims and determine eligibility.  
- The Order is **non-renewable** and limited to the specified time frame (1995–1997), indicating a temporary, targeted policy intervention.

**7. Policy Rationale**  
This Order reflects a **supportive policy toward the domestic billiard industry**, which may have been experiencing challenges due to high input costs. By reducing the cost of imported billiard cloth, the government aims to:  
- Support small and medium-sized manufacturers of billiard tables;  
- Encourage domestic production and repair services;  
- Maintain the competitiveness of Canadian-based billiard table manufacturing and maintenance businesses.

**8. Key Limitations**  
- **Time-bound**: Only applies to imports between July 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997.  
- **Specific use only**: Only applies to cloth used in **manufacture or repair** of billiard tables.  
- **Strict claim deadline**: Claims must be filed within three years of importation.  
- **No extension or retroactive application**: The Order does not extend beyond the defined period or apply to goods imported before or after the specified dates.

**Conclusion**  
The *Billiard Cloth Remission Order, 1996* is a targeted, temporary regulatory measure designed to alleviate the financial burden on Canadian manufacturers and repairers of billiard tables by waiving customs duties on specific types of imported billiard cloth.
