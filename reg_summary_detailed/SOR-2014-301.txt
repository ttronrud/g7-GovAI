**Detailed Summary of the CKFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The **CKFTA Tariff Preference Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish specific tariff preference rules under international trade agreements, including the Canada–Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA).

- **Statutory Source**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)* – Provides the legal basis for the regulation’s enactment.  
  - *S.C. 1997, c. 36* – Likely refers to the original Customs Tariff Act or related enabling legislation.

### **2. Key Definition: "Originating Goods"**
In these regulations, the term **"originating"** means that goods qualify as originating in the territory of a **Party (Canada or Korea)** under the **rules of origin** established in **Chapter Three** of the CKFTA.

- This is critical because only **originating goods** are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the agreement.
- The rules of origin determine whether goods have undergone sufficient processing or transformation in Canada or Korea to be considered "originating" for tariff purposes.
- These rules are not defined in the regulations themselves but are referenced in the CKFTA’s Chapter Three, which includes criteria such as value-added thresholds, production processes, and material content requirements.

### **3. Eligibility for Korea Tariff Preference (Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff)**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the Customs Tariff, **goods exported from Korea** are entitled to the **Korea Tariff preference** (i.e., reduced or zero tariffs) if they meet one of the following two conditions:

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipments to Canada (No Intermediate Country)**
Goods shipped directly from Korea to Canada are eligible for preferential treatment **if**:
- They are transported **without passing through another country**, either:
  - On a **through bill of lading**, or  
  - Without a through bill of lading, **provided** the importer, upon request by a customs officer, provides **documentary evidence** that:
    - Shows the **full shipping route** and  
    - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada.

> This ensures transparency and compliance with the rule of origin, even in cases where documentation is not formally through a bill of lading.

#### **Condition 2: Shipments Through Another Country**
If goods are shipped to Canada **through a third country**, the importer must provide:
- **Documentary evidence** showing:
  - The **complete shipping route** and  
  - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada.
- **A copy of the customs control documents** that confirm the goods remained **under customs control** during their stay in the third country.

> This requirement ensures that the goods did not undergo "de-origination" or lose their origin status due to transit through a non-Party country. The customs control documentation serves as proof that the goods were not freely released or re-exported, which could invalidate their origin.

### **4. Effective Date and Registration Requirements**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day that **Section 47 of the Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014) comes into force.
- However, **if the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provides a clear timeline for implementation and ensures that the rules are not retroactive. It also allows for administrative flexibility in case of delays in the registration process.

---

### **5. Note on Enforcement and Timeline**
- The regulations are **effective as of January 1, 2015** (as noted in the [Note]).
- This date likely reflects the practical implementation date when the CKFTA entered into force or when the preferential tariff regime became operational in Canadian customs practice.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations:
- Enable **Canada to apply preferential tariff treatment** to goods originating in Korea under the CKFTA.
- Provide **clear procedural requirements** for importers to demonstrate compliance with the rules of origin, especially in complex international shipping scenarios.
- Strengthen **trade transparency and compliance** by requiring detailed documentation in both direct and transshipment cases.
- Support **economic integration** between Canada and Korea by reducing trade barriers for qualifying goods.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

The CKFTA Tariff Preference Regulations allow Canadian importers to benefit from lower or zero tariffs when importing goods from Korea — **provided the goods are properly classified as "originating"** under the CKFTA’s rules of origin. To qualify:

- Goods must either be shipped **directly** from Korea to Canada (with a through bill of lading or supporting documentation), or  
- Be shipped **through another country**, in which case the importer must provide **full shipping details** and **proof that the goods remained under customs control** during transit.

These rules are designed to ensure that only genuinely Korean-origin goods receive preferential treatment and to prevent fraud or misrepresentation in the supply chain.

The regulations officially take effect on **January 1, 2015**, or on the date of registration if later — aligning with the broader implementation of the Canada–Korea Free Trade Agreement.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- Originating goods = goods meeting CKFTA rules of origin.
- Preferential tariff applies to Korean goods shipped directly or via third country.
- Documentation is mandatory for both routes.
- Effective date: January 1, 2015 (or date of registration, whichever is later).

These regulations are essential for ensuring fair, transparent, and compliant trade between Canada and Korea under the CKFTA.
