**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation is a formal government directive issued by the Governor General in Council of Canada, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, under the authority granted by the *National Defence Act*. It authorizes the deployment of Canadian military personnel to serve with the **United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)**, established in response to the escalating conflict in the former Yugoslavia.

### **Background and Context**

- **United Nations Security Council Resolution 743 (February 21, 1992):**  
  This resolution established the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) with the primary objective of creating the conditions necessary for peace and security in the Balkans. The Force was intended to assist in stabilizing the region, protect civilians, and support the negotiation of a comprehensive political settlement to the Yugoslav crisis.

- **Canada’s Participation:**  
  The regulation reflects Canada’s commitment to international peacekeeping efforts. It is explicitly stated that it is "advisable" for Canada to participate in UNPROFOR, demonstrating a strategic and diplomatic decision to contribute to global stability through multilateral action.

### **Legal Authority**

The deployment is authorized under **paragraph 31(1)(b)** of the *National Defence Act* (R.S., c. 31 (1st Supp.), s. 60 (Sch. I, item 14)). This provision allows the Governor General in Council to place certain members of the Canadian Forces on active service *beyond Canada*—that is, in international operations—on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence.

This legal basis is critical because it enables Canada to deploy its military personnel abroad without requiring a separate legislative act, provided the operation is part of a United Nations mission and meets the criteria set out in the Act.

### **Scope of Deployment**

The regulation authorizes the placement on active service of the following personnel:

1. **Regular Force Personnel:**  
   Officers and non-commissioned members (NCOs) from the **regular force** of the Canadian Forces.

2. **Reserve Force Personnel:**  
   Officers and non-commissioned members from the **reserve force** of the Canadian Forces, who are either:
   - Currently part of the UNPROFOR mission, or  
   - Serving in **immediate support** of the mission.

> The term "immediate support" implies roles that are directly related to the operational needs of UNPROFOR—such as logistics, medical services, engineering, intelligence, communications, or security support—rather than being in direct combat roles.

---

### **Purpose of the Deployment**

The primary purpose of this deployment is to:
- Contribute to peace and security in the Balkans.
- Assist in protecting civilians and maintaining stability in conflict-affected areas.
- Support the broader international effort to facilitate a political settlement to the Yugoslav crisis.

This aligns with Canada’s long-standing policy of promoting international peace and cooperation through multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations.

### **Key Legal and Operational Implications**

- **Temporary Service:** The deployment is temporary and based on the specific needs of the UNPROFOR mission.
- **Command and Control:** Personnel will operate under the authority of the United Nations and under the command structure of UNPROFOR, not directly under Canadian military command, although they will remain part of the Canadian Forces.
- **Duty of Service:** The personnel are placed on active service beyond Canada, meaning they are no longer on domestic duties and are required to serve in the field in accordance with operational directives.
- **Reserve Force Involvement:** This regulation demonstrates Canada’s willingness to involve reserve forces in international operations, expanding the reach of national defence commitments beyond the regular force.

---

### **Significance**

This regulation marks a significant moment in Canada’s participation in international peacekeeping:
- It reflects Canada’s active role in the United Nations peacekeeping framework.
- It underscores the flexibility of Canada’s defence legislation to respond to global crises.
- It sets a precedent for future deployments of Canadian forces in UN-led missions.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally authorizes the deployment of Canadian military personnel—both from the regular and reserve forces—to serve with the United Nations Protection Force in the Balkans. It is grounded in the *National Defence Act* and serves as a legal and operational mechanism for Canada to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 743. The deployment supports Canada’s foreign policy objectives of promoting peace, stability, and diplomacy in conflict zones.
