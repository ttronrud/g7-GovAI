**Detailed Summary of the *Possession and Export of Elvers Regulations* (S.C. 2019, c. 14, s. 31(1) to (11); R.S., c. F-14)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Possession and Export of Elvers Regulations* are a set of federal regulations made under **subsection 43(1)a of the Fisheries Act** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**. These regulations establish strict controls on the **possession, transfer, and export of elvers**—defined as American eels less than 10 cm in length—within Canada and in Canadian fisheries waters.

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **protect and conserve fish populations**, particularly American eels, which are vulnerable due to overharvesting and habitat degradation.
- To **ensure proper management and traceability** of elvers from capture to export.
- To **prevent illegal or unregulated trade** in elvers, including those caught illegally or obtained from unauthorized sources.
- To **support sustainable aquaculture practices** through regulated access to elvers for cultivation.

These regulations come into force on **March 1, 2025**.

## **1. General Prohibition on Possession of Elvers**

> **Section 3(1)**  
> It is generally **prohibited** for any person to be in possession of elvers **unless authorized** by a licence issued under these Regulations.

This means that **no individual or entity may legally hold elvers** without first obtaining a formal licence from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

---

## **2. Exceptions to the Possession Prohibition**

There are specific circumstances under which a person may possess elvers **without a licence**, including:

### **(a)** Persons who caught elvers under a **Fishery (General) Regulations licence (Section 52)**  
- Individuals who legally caught elvers under a valid licence issued under Section 52 of the *Fishery (General) Regulations*.

### **(b)** Transfer to aquaculture facilities or release into natural habitats  
- Possession for the purpose of transferring elvers to an **aquaculture facility** or **releasing them into fish habitat**, as authorized under the **Fisheries Act** or **provincial legislation**.

### **(c)** Persons who caught elvers under a **Fisheries Act licence**  
- Applies **only while transporting elvers** from the point of capture to a designated holding facility, **as specified in the licence**.  
- This exception is **conditional** and limited in scope—only applies during transport, not for long-term possession.

### **(d)** Commercial transporters  
- A commercial transporter may possess elvers **in the course of their business**, provided they have **no direct or indirect ownership or interest** in the elvers.

### **(e)** Airport personnel  
- Staff working at airports engaged in handling goods for air transport may possess elvers **in the course of their duties**.

### **(f)** Aquaculture facility operators  
- Operators holding an **aquaculture licence** may possess elvers **for cultivation** until they grow to **10 cm or more in length**.

### **(g)** Government personnel  
- Personnel of the **CBSA, CFIA, DFO, or provincial agencies** acting in the course of their duties may possess elvers.

### **(h)** Law enforcement officers  
- Individuals acting under federal or provincial legislation may obtain possession of elvers during law enforcement activities.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The exception in (c) is **time-limited** and applies **only during transport** to a specified holding facility under a valid licence.

## **3. Prohibitions on Transfer of Elvers**

> **Section 3(3)**  
> It is **prohibited** to transfer possession of elvers to anyone **unless**:
> - The recipient is authorized to possess elvers under a licence issued under these Regulations, **or**
> - The transfer falls under one of the exceptions listed in **paragraphs 3(2)(b), (d), (e), (f), or (h)**.

This ensures that **only authorized individuals** can move elvers, maintaining traceability and compliance.

> ✅ **Exception**: A person who caught elvers under a valid licence (as in 3(2)(a) or (c)) may **transfer possession to any other person authorized to fish under the same licence**.  
> This promotes cooperation among licence holders and supports shared access to elvers for research, aquaculture, or other permitted uses.
