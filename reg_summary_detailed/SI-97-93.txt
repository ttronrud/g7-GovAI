*Order Respecting the Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Lands in the Yukon Territory (Dawson First Nation, Y.T.)*  
**Reference Number:** SI/95-60, 1995 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1477  
**Date of Coming Into Force:** July 25, 1997  
**Issuing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 23(a) of the *Territorial Lands Act*

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulatory order is to **withdraw specific parcels of territorial land in the Yukon Territory from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of commercial development) in order to **facilitate the resolution of the Aboriginal land claim of the Dawson First Nation**.

This withdrawal is a critical step in the process of recognizing and settling Indigenous land rights, ensuring that the lands in question are protected and used in accordance with the rights and interests of the Dawson First Nation under federal and treaty-based frameworks.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

- The withdrawal applies to **specific tracts of territorial land** described in the **Schedule** attached to the Order.
- These lands include:
  - All surface and subsurface rights, including:
    - **Mines and minerals**, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous (including oil, gas, and other mineral resources).
    - The **right to work** those mineral resources (e.g., exploration, extraction, development).
- The withdrawal is **effective for a defined period**:
  - **From July 25, 1997**, until **December 31, 2001**.

> This 4-year period was likely chosen to provide sufficient time for negotiations, land claim settlement processes, and potential agreement on land use or compensation.

1. **Substances or materials disposed of under the Territorial Quarrying Regulations**  
   → Quarrying activities (e.g., stone, sand, gravel) that are regulated under specific provincial/federal quarrying rules are exempt.

2. **Forest resources disposed of under the Yukon Timber Regulations**

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Aboriginal Land Rights Context**  
   This Order is part of a broader federal policy to resolve land claims by First Nations through negotiated settlements. The Dawson First Nation’s claim is rooted in historical occupancy, traditional use, and Indigenous title, and this withdrawal supports the process of recognizing those rights.

2. **Protection of Indigenous Interests**  
   By removing the lands from disposal, the government ensures that:
   - No private or commercial entity can acquire title or rights to these lands during the specified period.
   - The lands remain available for Indigenous use, governance, or development in accordance with the claim settlement process.

3. **Temporal Limitation**  
   The withdrawal is **not permanent**—it expires on **December 31, 2001**. After that date, the lands may again be subject to disposal unless a new agreement or settlement is reached.

4. **Legal Clarity and Certainty**  
   The explicit exclusions provide legal certainty for existing rights holders (e.g., miners, oil and gas companies) whose rights were established prior to the Order. This prevents disputes over the validity of pre-existing claims.

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a significant administrative and legal instrument in the process of **settling the Aboriginal land claim of the Dawson First Nation** in the Yukon Territory. It:

- Withdraws specific lands (including mineral rights) from disposal for a defined period (1997–2001),  
- Excludes pre-existing rights under specific legislation,  
- Is grounded in the *Territorial Lands Act*, and  
- Is supported by detailed geographic references to ensure clarity and enforceability.

While the withdrawal is temporary, it represents a foundational step in recognizing Indigenous land rights and advancing reconciliation through formal land claim resolution.

**Note:** This Order is part of a larger framework of federal land claim settlements and reflects Canada’s evolving approach to Indigenous rights and land governance. It underscores the importance of balancing economic development interests with the rights and self-determination of First Nations.
