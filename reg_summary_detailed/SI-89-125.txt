**Detailed Summary of the Exclusion Approval Order for Certain Employees and Certain Positions (Air Traffic Control Group), 1989**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the *Exclusion Approval Order for Certain Employees and Certain Positions (Air Traffic Control Group), 1989*, is a formal government order issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State) to approve the Public Service Commission’s decision to **exclude specific individuals and positions from certain provisions of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. The purpose is to provide operational flexibility in the appointment and training of air traffic controllers within the Department of Transport (DOT), particularly those involved in specialized training programs.

The order applies only during a defined time period and is limited to **air traffic control training and operational appointments** under two key programs:
1. **Selection by Seniority Program for Air Traffic Control Training**
2. **Air Traffic Controllers Transfer Down Program**

---

### **Key Provisions and Their Legal Basis**

The order is grounded in **section 10** and **subsection 21(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*, which normally govern:
- **Section 10**: The requirement that appointments to positions requiring qualifications (other than language skills) must be made through competitive selection processes.
- **Subsection 21(1)**: The right of appeal against appointments made under certain conditions, including appointments to positions that may otherwise be subject to competitive selection.

By this order, the Public Service Commission is **exempted from applying these rules** to specific appointments related to air traffic control, with the goal of ensuring effective and timely staffing of critical transportation roles.

### **Detailed Exclusions Approved**

#### 1. **Exclusion of Section 10 (Competitive Selection Requirement)**
> Applies to **training and operational positions** in the Department of Transport involving air traffic control trainees or employees participating in specific programs.

- **Training Positions**:
  - Employees of the Department of Transport who participate in the **Selection by Seniority Program** or the **Transfer Down Program** are **not required to undergo competitive selection** for training positions.
  - This exclusion applies **only to qualifications other than language skills** (i.e., technical or professional qualifications such as aviation knowledge, safety procedures, etc.).
  - The rationale is that seniority-based appointments are deemed more practical and in the public interest for these specialized roles.

- **Operational Positions**:
  - Trainees who have **successfully completed their training** under either program are **not subject to competitive selection requirements** when being appointed to operational air traffic control roles.
  - This allows for faster integration of trained personnel into operational duties, supporting the efficiency and continuity of air traffic management.

> ✅ **Effective Period**: May 1, 1989 – April 30, 1991  
> ❌ **Applies only to non-language qualifications**

---

#### 2. **Exclusion of Subsection 21(1) (Right of Appeal)**
> This provision removes the right of appeal for certain individuals who would otherwise have had the right to challenge appointments under subsection 21(1).

The following groups are **exempt from having the right to appeal**:

- **Appointments to Training Positions**:
  - Employees of the DOT participating in the Selection by Seniority or Transfer Down Programs who are appointed to training roles.

- **Appointments to Operational Positions**:
  - Trainees who have **successfully completed training** and are appointed to operational roles.

- **Appointments to Positions for Trainees Who Did Not Complete Training**:
  - Trainees who **failed to complete training** or **terminated training early** are also excluded from having the right to appeal their appointment to any position in the DOT.

> ✅ **Effective Period**: May 1, 1989 – April 30, 1991  
> ⚠️ This removes a key employee protection mechanism — the right to appeal — for these specific appointments.

---

### **Rationale and Justification (As Stated in the "Whereas" Clause)**

The Public Service Commission concluded that:
- It would be **not practicable** (not feasible) to apply the full competitive selection process (section 10) to these air traffic control appointments.
- Doing so would **undermine the efficiency and effectiveness** of the training and deployment of air traffic controllers.
- The **best interests of the Public Service** — particularly in maintaining safe and reliable air traffic operations — require a streamlined, seniority-based pathway for these specialized roles.
- The exclusion of appeal rights (subsection 21(1)) is justified as a temporary measure to avoid delays and administrative burdens in a time-sensitive operational context.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Allows faster appointment of trained air traffic controllers, reducing delays in staffing critical aviation infrastructure.

2. **Seniority-Based Access**:
   - Ensures that experienced employees (via seniority or transfer) can access training and operational roles without going through full competitive exams.

3. **Reduced Administrative Burden**:
   - Avoids the need for appeals and re-evaluations in time-sensitive hiring decisions.

4. **Reduced Employee Rights**:
   - Removal of appeal rights may be seen as a trade-off between efficiency and employee protection. It reflects a temporary exception justified by operational necessity.

5. **Public Service Interests**:
   - The Commission emphasized that the public interest in maintaining safe and efficient air traffic services outweighs the need for competitive selection in these specific cases.

### **Citation and Legal Status**

- **Official Name**: *Exclusion Approval Order for Certain Employees and Certain Positions (Air Traffic Control Group), 1989*
- **Citation**: Can be referenced as such in legal or administrative documents.
- **Legal Basis**: Made under subsection 41(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, based on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **targeted, time-limited exemption** from standard public service employment rules designed to support the effective and timely staffing of air traffic control roles in the Department of Transport. It balances administrative efficiency with public service needs by:
- Exempting training and operational appointments from competitive selection (section 10),
- Removing the right to appeal (subsection 21(1)) for affected appointments,
- Limiting the scope to specific programs and qualifications (excluding language skills),
- Applying only during a defined two-year period (1989–1991).

While it enhances operational flexibility, it also reduces employee protections, which underscores the importance of such exemptions being temporary, narrowly defined, and justified by clear public service objectives.

**Final Note**: This order is a historical document reflecting policy decisions from the 1980s related to aviation workforce management. It is no longer in force after April 30, 1991, and would be superseded by updated regulations or policy frameworks in later years.
