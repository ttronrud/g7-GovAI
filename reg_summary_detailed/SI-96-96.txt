Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulatory Summary**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the government to designate specific portions of land for inclusion in a land sale, particularly when such land lies within a defined boundary from a water body.

**2. Scope of the Order**  
The regulation specifies that **any portion of the lands described in the schedule attached to this order** must be **included in the sale** of those lands. The inclusion is conditional upon the land being situated within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)** of **Niven Lake** in the **Northwest Territories**.

- **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)**: This is a legally recognized benchmark used in land tenure and property rights to define the boundary between land and water. It represents the highest level to which water normally rises during ordinary conditions (not during floods or exceptional weather events).  
- The 30.48 metres (100 feet) buffer zone is a standard distance used in land management to define riparian or shoreline areas, often for purposes of land use, access, or environmental protection.

Thus, any parcel of land described in the schedule that falls within this 100-foot strip along the shoreline of Niven Lake is **automatically included in the land sale**, regardless of whether it was originally designated for other purposes.

**3. Specific Land Designation**  
In addition to the general provision regarding lands near Niven Lake, the regulation explicitly identifies two specific lots:

- **Lots 1078 and 1083**  
- Located in **Quad 85 J/8**, **Yellowknife**, Northwest Territories.

These lots are formally referenced in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** under **Survey Plan Number 77053**, which is a recorded survey plan in the official land survey archives maintained in Ottawa.

- A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Offices** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in Yellowknife under **File Number 2546**.

This ensures that the legal description and boundary of these lots are publicly accessible and verifiable for title registration and land transactions.

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
- The regulation ensures that **shoreline land** adjacent to Niven Lake — particularly land within 100 feet of the OHWM — is **included in the sale process**, which may be part of a larger land disposition, such as a government land sale or transfer to a private developer or Indigenous community.  
- This inclusion may have implications for:
  - **Environmental protection** (e.g., limiting development near sensitive water bodies)
  - **Indigenous rights or land claims** (if the land is within or adjacent to traditional territories)
  - **Property rights and title clarity** (ensuring that no land adjacent to the lake is excluded from the sale without legal justification)

**5. Legal Significance**  
- The regulation is binding and enforceable under the Territorial Lands Act.  
- It serves as a formal legal directive that modifies the scope of the land sale by **automatically including** certain riparian parcels.  
- The inclusion is not discretionary — it is mandatory for any sale involving the described lands.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation establishes a clear, legally enforceable requirement that all land parcels within 100 feet (30.48 metres) of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Niven Lake, as described in the schedule, must be included in the land sale. It also specifically identifies and confirms the legal description of two lots (1078 and 1083) in Yellowknife, which are referenced in an official survey plan and filed in the Northwest Territories land records. This ensures transparency, legal consistency, and clarity in land disposition processes, particularly in relation to water-boundary zones.
