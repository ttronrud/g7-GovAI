**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Specifying the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for the Purposes of the Employment Equity Act

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued under **paragraph 4(1)(d)** of the *Employment Equity Act* (S.C. 1995, c. 44), which authorizes the Treasury Board to specify certain public sector entities as being subject to the Act if they employ 100 or more employees.

**Key Provisions and Purpose:**

1. **Applicability of the Employment Equity Act:**  
   The *Employment Equity Act* is a federal law designed to promote equal opportunity in employment by addressing systemic barriers faced by designated groups (such as women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of racialized communities). The Act applies to organizations that are part of the public sector and employ 100 or more employees.

2. **Specification of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP):**  
   This Order formally specifies the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police** as a public sector entity that falls under the scope of the Employment Equity Act. This means the RCMP is now subject to the Act’s requirements, including:
   - The establishment of employment equity goals and plans.
   - The implementation of policies and practices to eliminate employment barriers.
   - The monitoring and reporting of employment data by designated groups.
   - The obligation to conduct equity assessments and ensure fair hiring, promotion, and retention practices.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The Order is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Labour and the Treasury Board**. This reflects a collaborative process involving key federal departments responsible for labour standards and public sector oversight.

4. **Grounds for Specification:**  
   The RCMP is included under paragraph 4(1)(d) because it is a federal public service organization that employs **100 or more employees**. The Act applies to such organizations to ensure that employment practices are equitable and inclusive.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette. This ensures immediate legal effect upon official publication, allowing the RCMP to begin complying with the requirements of the Employment Equity Act without delay.

**Significance and Implications:**

- This regulation ensures that the RCMP, as a major federal institution with a broad workforce, is subject to federal employment equity standards.
- It reinforces the government’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in public institutions, particularly in law enforcement, where representation and trust are critical.
- The inclusion of the RCMP under the Act may lead to the development of internal equity strategies, such as targeted recruitment, retention programs, and workplace assessments to address underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples, women, and persons with disabilities.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order is a formal and legally binding step in extending the reach of the *Employment Equity Act* to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It mandates that the RCMP implement equitable employment practices consistent with federal policy, ensuring that all employees—regardless of gender, race, disability, or other protected characteristics—have fair access to opportunities within the organization. The regulation underscores the federal government’s dedication to creating inclusive workplaces across all levels of public service.
