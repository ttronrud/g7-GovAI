### **Detailed Summary of the Vancouver International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The regulation is issued under **section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**. It formally **revokes the previous Vancouver International Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 120)** and replaces them with **new, updated zoning regulations** specifically designed to ensure aviation safety and operational efficiency at Vancouver International Airport (Vancouver International Airport, located in the Township of Richmond, British Columbia).

These regulations were amended by **S.C. 1976–77, c. 28, sections 2 and 49**, indicating that the revisions were part of a broader legislative update to modernize airport planning and zoning standards.

---

#### **2. Regulatory Title**
The new regulations are officially titled:  
**"Vancouver International Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and apply to specific lands and water areas adjacent to or near the airport.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several critical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to Vancouver International Airport in the Township of Richmond, BC.
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed reference point used for elevation measurements. Its assigned elevation is **2 metres above sea level**.
- **Strip**: The main runway and landing area designated for aircraft take-off and landing in a specific direction. Described in detail in Part V of the Schedule.
- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the end of a strip, designed to provide a safe zone for aircraft during approach. It slopes at a 1:50 ratio (1 metre rise per 50 metres run) and extends up to 15,000 metres from the runway end.
- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, designed to provide a buffer zone between the runway and surrounding land. It also slopes at a 1:50 ratio.
- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface located above and around the airport, forming a large protective zone that extends beyond the approach and transitional surfaces. It is designed to protect aircraft from obstacles during all phases of flight.

These surfaces are described in detail in **Parts III to VI of the Schedule** and are critical to ensuring that no structure or natural object exceeds their elevation limits.

---

#### **4. Scope of Application**
- Applies to **all lands and submerged areas** (including public road allowances) within the **outer limits** defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Lands that are **formally part of the airport** (e.g., active runways, taxiways, terminal zones) are **not covered** by these regulations.
  - Specific **exceptions** are carved out of the outer limits:
    1. A land parcel bounded:
       - West by Number 4 Road,
       - South by the approach surface of Runway 26L,
       - North by the approach surface of Runway 26R.
    2. A **water area** within the Strait of Georgia, bounded:
       - East by the westerly boundary of the Township of Richmond,
       - South by the approach and transitional surfaces of Runway 08R,
       - North by the approach and transitional surfaces of Runway 08L.

> These exceptions are clearly marked in **yellow, red, and blue** on **sheets 1 to 32** of the Department of Transport Plan Number **BC 1280**, dated **November 2, 1978**.

---

#### **5. Prohibitions on Structures and Objects**
No person may:
- Construct or erect any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing ones) on regulated land,
- Where the **highest point** of such structure or object **exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
  - Approach surfaces,
  - Outer surface,
  - Transitional surfaces.

> This means that all structures (including trees, towers, or buildings) must remain **below** the defined elevation contours to prevent interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

#### **6. Management of Natural Growth**
- If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of the defined surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.
- This ensures that natural features do not become hazards to aviation safety.

---

#### **7. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**
- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use the land for **disposal or accumulation** of **waste materials**,
  - Especially those that are **edible or attractive to birds**.
- This is to prevent bird strikes — a major aviation hazard — by eliminating food sources that attract flocks near the airport.

---

#### **8. Description of Approach Surfaces (Detailed)**
Each approach surface is defined with precise geometric parameters:

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **08R** | Inclined plane at 1:50 ratio rising to an imaginary horizontal line 15,000 m from the runway end. Outer ends 2,400 m from runway centreline. The horizontal line is **300.5 m** above ARP (2 m sea level). |
| **26L** | Begins with a 1:50 slope, rises to intersect the outer surface, then becomes horizontal until it meets a line passing through the **northwest corner of Lot 1, Section 3, Block 4 North, Range 6 West, Plan 24067**. Then slopes at 1:50 to a horizontal line **291.60 m** above ARP. |
| **08L** | 1:50 slope to a horizontal line **300.6 m** above ARP at 15,000 m from runway end. |
| **26R** | Begins with a 1:50 slope, rises to meet the outer surface, then becomes horizontal until it intersects a line through the **northeast corner of Lot D, Section 15, Block 5 North, Range 6 West, Plan 5736**. Then slopes to a horizontal line **278.6 m** above ARP. |
| **12** | Begins with a 1:50 slope, rises to meet the outer surface, then continues at 1:50 to a horizontal line **299.68 m** above ARP. |
| **30** | Begins with a 1:50 slope, rises to meet the outer surface, then continues to a horizontal line **276.05 m** above ARP. |

> All approach surfaces have a **divergence of 15% on each side** of the runway’s centreline — meaning they extend outward at a consistent slope to create a safe buffer zone.

---

#### **9. Description of Outer Surface**
The **outer surface** is a large, imaginary surface extending beyond the approach and transitional surfaces. It is designed to:
- Protect aircraft from obstacles during all flight phases.
- Provide a consistent elevation boundary that ensures no structure or natural feature exceeds safe limits.

It is defined in **Part IV of the Schedule** and is referenced in the detailed boundary description of the outer limits of land.

---

#### **10. Description of Transitional Surfaces**
The **transitional surfaces** extend from the lateral edges of the strips and their approach surfaces. They are:
- Sloped at a **1:50 ratio**,
- Designed to provide a smooth transition between the runway area and surrounding land,
- Preventing obstructions from forming dangerous "steps" or sharp drops in elevation.

They are described in **Part VI of the Schedule** and are integrated into the full boundary description.

---

#### **11. Boundary Description (Geometric Detail)**
The outer limits of the regulated area are defined through a **detailed, step-by-step compass and distance description** (a legal description using azimuths and distances). This includes:

- Starting from the **intersection of the westerly production of Blundell Road and the westerly boundary of the Township of Richmond**.
- Following a series of **azimuths and distances** to intersect various approach and transitional surfaces.
- Reaching key points (e.g., corners of approach surfaces, intersections with roads like Granville Avenue, Garden City Road, New Westminster Highway).
- Ending at the **northernmost corner of the Township of Richmond**, and returning to the start.

This boundary ensures that the regulated zone is **precisely defined**, protecting aircraft from hazards while allowing for urban development outside the critical safety zones.

---

#### **12. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth,
  - Enforce compliance with elevation limits,
  - Ensure no waste materials are deposited that attract birds.

Compliance is essential for maintaining **aviation safety**, minimizing **flight hazards**, and ensuring **smooth airport operations**.

### **Summary in Plain Language**

This regulation establishes **strict zoning rules** around Vancouver International Airport to **prevent any structure or natural feature from interfering with aircraft operations**. It defines **safety zones** — approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and an outer surface — that extend hundreds of metres from runways. All land within these zones must remain **below the elevation limits** of these surfaces. Trees, buildings,
