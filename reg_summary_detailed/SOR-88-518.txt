**Detailed Summary of the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Exemption Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation, known as the *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Exemption Order*, was issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**. It is grounded in **subsection 4(8)** of the *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act* (S.C. 1988, c. 41), which allows for the exemption of certain property, rights, obligations, and liabilities of Her Majesty from specific provisions of the Act.

This Order serves as a **special legislative exemption** to ensure that certain Crown-held assets and liabilities are not subject to the reorganization and divestiture provisions of the Act, which were designed to facilitate the restructuring and sale of Eldorado Nuclear Limited’s assets.

**2. Official Citation**

The Order is formally cited as:  
**The Eldorado Nuclear Limited Exemption Order**  
(S.C. 1988, c. 41)

---

**3. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act* (S.C. 1988, c. 41).  
- The Order applies specifically to **property, rights, interests, obligations, and liabilities** of **Her Majesty** (the Crown) that were either:
  - Held by Eldorado (the original corporation) on **September 30, 1988**, or  
  - Incurred by Eldorado and **still existing** on that date.

**4. Exemption Provisions**

The central provision of the Order is that **all of the Crown’s property, rights, and interests** held by Eldorado on September 30, 1988, and **all obligations and liabilities** of the Crown incurred by Eldorado and existing on that date, are **exempt from the application of subsection 4(4)** of the Reorganization and Divestiture Act.

> **Subsection 4(4)** of the Act typically governs the transfer or disposition of assets and liabilities during the reorganization process. By exempting certain Crown holdings and obligations, the Order ensures that these specific items are **not subject to being transferred, sold, or otherwise disposed of** as part of the reorganization or divestiture process.

---

**5. Exceptions to the Exemption**

The exemption **does not apply** to the following:

- The **shares** of the corporation that becomes the **successor corporation** through amalgamation with:
  - Eldorado Resources Limited  
  - Eldor Resources Limited  
  - 119371 Canada Limited  

These shares are **not exempt** and are therefore **subject to the provisions of subsection 4(4)** of the Act. This means that the Crown’s ownership or interest in these successor entities may be subject to reorganization, divestiture, or transfer under the Act.

---

**6. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Protect Crown assets and liabilities that were not directly involved in the core reorganization of Eldorado Nuclear Limited.  
- Ensure that the Crown’s interests—particularly those that were not tied to the amalgamated successor corporations—are preserved from being disrupted or divested during the corporate restructuring.  
- Provide clarity and legal certainty by explicitly defining which Crown interests are exempt from the reorganization process.

This exemption helps prevent unintended or unintended loss of Crown holdings during a corporate restructuring, especially where the Crown may have had a nominal or indirect interest in certain assets or obligations.

---

**7. Effective Date and Legal Effect**

- The Order is effective as of **September 30, 1988**, the date referenced in the statute.  
- It applies retroactively to all Crown property, rights, and liabilities that existed on that date.  
- The exemption is **permanent** within the scope defined, unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation.

---

**8. Significance**

This Order is a critical component of the broader reorganization of Eldorado Nuclear Limited, which was a major nuclear energy company in Canada. It reflects a balance between:

- The need to restructure and divest certain corporate assets to ensure financial stability and regulatory compliance,  
- And the need to protect Crown interests that were not part of the core business or restructuring plan.

It underscores the role of the Crown in corporate reorganizations and demonstrates how the Canadian government can selectively shield certain assets from divestiture through statutory exemption.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Eldorado Nuclear Limited Exemption Order* is a targeted, legally binding instrument that:

- Exempts specific Crown property, rights, obligations, and liabilities from the reorganization provisions of the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act,  
- Excludes only the shares of the successor amalgamated corporations from this protection,  
- Ensures legal clarity and stability in the reorganization process,  
- Protects Crown interests that were not central to the divestiture or restructuring.

This Order is a key example of how Canadian regulatory and constitutional frameworks allow for the protection of Crown interests during corporate transformations.
