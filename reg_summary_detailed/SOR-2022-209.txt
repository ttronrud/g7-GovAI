**Detailed Summary of the Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Withdrawal Order (2022-2)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, pursuant to specific provisions of the *Customs Tariff* (S.C. 2011, c. 24, s. 117(1)) and the *Customs Tariff Act* (S.C. 1997, c. 36).  

The Order is formally known as the **Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Withdrawal Order (2022-2)** and is enacted under **paragraphs 31(1)(a)a and (b)a** of the *Customs Tariff*, which govern the conditions under which countries may be granted Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment.

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Goods that originate in Belarus**:  
  Refers to goods that are eligible to be marked as "goods of Belarus" according to the *Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (Non-CUSMA Countries) Regulations*.  
  This determination is based on specific rules of origin (such as production, processing, or transformation) that establish whether a product qualifies as originating in Belarus.

- **Goods that originate in Russia**:  
  Similarly, these are goods that meet the criteria for being marked as "goods of Russia" under the same *Determination of Country of Origin (Non-CUSMA Countries) Regulations*.  
  The rules for origin apply to both goods produced in Russia and those that have undergone sufficient processing or transformation there.

> These definitions are critical because they determine which goods are subject to the tariff changes in this Order.

### **3. Core Provisions**

#### **A. Extension of MFN Tariff Benefit**
- **Previously**, goods originating in Belarus or Russia were eligible to benefit from **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment** — meaning they were subject to lower import duties compared to goods from other countries under the MFN schedule.

- **This Order reverses that policy**:  
  ➤ **Entitlement to MFN tariff benefits is withdrawn** for all goods that originate in **Belarus** or **Russia**.

> This means that, effective from the date of registration, imported goods originating in either Belarus or Russia will **no longer receive preferential MFN tariff treatment** and will instead be subject to **higher tariffs**, typically aligned with the standard (non-preferential) tariff rates applicable to other countries.

#### **B. Exception – Tariff Item 2844.43.00**
- **Section 3 of the Order (which governs the withdrawal of MFN treatment) does not apply** to goods classified under **tariff item No. 2844.43.00**.

> This is a narrow exception. Goods falling under this specific tariff heading (which may relate to certain types of machinery, equipment, or components) **retain their MFN tariff benefit**, even though all other goods from Belarus and Russia lose it.

> This exception may be intended to preserve access for specific, potentially critical, or strategically important products.

### **4. Repeal of Previous Order**

- The **Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Withdrawal Order (2022-1)** is **fully repealed** by this Order.  
- This indicates a policy shift or correction, likely in response to changing geopolitical, trade, or economic circumstances (e.g., international sanctions, trade disputes, or changes in diplomatic relations).

---

### **5. Effective Dates**

- **General Entry into Force**:  
  The Order comes into force at **11:59:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)** on the day it is officially registered (published in the Canada Gazette).

- **Specific Provisions (Sections 3, 4, and 6)**:  
  These sections — which implement the withdrawal of MFN benefits and related provisions — come into force at **00:00:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)** on the **day after** the registration date.

> This staggered timeline ensures a clear transition period, allowing importers, customs officials, and businesses time to adjust to the new tariff regime.

---

### **6. Implications and Context**

- **Geopolitical Rationale**:  
  The withdrawal of MFN tariff benefits for goods from Belarus and Russia likely reflects Canada’s response to:
  - Sanctions or international concerns regarding the political or economic situation in those countries.
  - A broader shift in Canada’s trade policy, possibly in alignment with international sanctions or trade agreements (e.g., EU or U.S. actions).
  - A desire to reduce economic ties with certain countries amid global tensions.

- **Impact on Importers and Businesses**:  
  - Importers of goods from Belarus or Russia will face **higher duty costs** on eligible products.
  - Businesses may need to re-evaluate supply chains, sourcing strategies, or compliance with origin rules.
  - The exception for tariff item 2844.43.00 suggests that certain high-value or essential goods may still be treated favorably.

- **Compliance and Enforcement**:  
  Customs officials will need to verify the **origin of goods** using the *Determination of Country of Origin (Non-CUSMA Countries) Regulations* to ensure proper classification and tariff application.
