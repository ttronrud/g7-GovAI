**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers Quota Regulations (1987)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Hatching Egg Producers Quota Regulations*, made effective **April 1, 1987**, establish a **quota system** governing the **interprovincial and export marketing** of **broiler hatching eggs** in Canada. These regulations were developed under the authority of the *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act* and implemented by the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency (CBHEMA)**, which was established by proclamation (SOR/87-40) under subsection 17(1) of the Act.

The regulations are a key component of a broader marketing plan designed to ensure fair and stable market access for producers across provinces, prevent oversupply, and maintain price stability in the broiler hatching egg market.

> **Note:** These regulations have since been **repealed** by *SOR/2013-252, s. 1*, and further updated or replaced by subsequent policy and regulatory frameworks. However, this summary provides a detailed historical and legal analysis of their original content and purpose.

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

1. **Primary Legal Framework**:
   - The regulations derive authority from:
     - The *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act* (S.C. 1970–71–72, c. 65)
     - The *Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation* (SOR/87-40)
     - Section 2 of the *Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order* (C.R.C., c. 648), which allows certain regulations to be made without prior ministerial approval if they fall within a specified class (e.g., those related to marketing plans).

2. **Approval Process**:
   - The proposed regulations were submitted to the **National Farm Products Marketing Council (NFPMC)** under paragraph 23(1)(f) of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act.
   - The NFPMC **approved** the regulations on **February 24, 1987**, after determining that their implementation was necessary for carrying out the marketing plan authorized by the CBHEMA.

3. **Implementation Authority**:
   - The CBHEMA made the regulations pursuant to:
     - Paragraph 23(1)(f) of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act
     - Subsection 5(1) of the schedule to the CBHEMA Proclamation

### **Key Definitions in the Regulations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Broiler hatching egg** | An egg used to hatch broiler chickens (meat birds), specifically for commercial poultry production. |
| **Producer** | A person or entity engaged in the production of broiler hatching eggs. |
| **Signatory provinces** | Provinces that have agreed to participate in the quota system (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, etc.). |
| **Interprovincial quota** | The maximum number of broiler hatching eggs a producer may market *between provinces* during a specified period. |
| **Export quota** | The maximum number of broiler hatching eggs a producer may market *outside Canada* (e.g., to the U.S. or other countries). |
| **Provincial quota** | The number of eggs a producer may market *within their own province* under provincial rules. |
| **Marketing** | The sale or distribution of broiler hatching eggs in any market (interprovincial, export, or intraprovincial). |

> ⚠️ **Note**: All definitions listed in the original document were later **repealed** by *SOR/2013-252, s. 1*, as the regulations themselves were eventually replaced.

### **Core Provisions and Rules**

#### 1. **Quota Application Requirements**

- A producer in a signatory province who wishes to market eggs **interprovincially** must:
  - Have been allotted a **provincial quota** by the provincial Commodity Board.
  - Apply to the **Commodity Board** for an **interprovincial quota**.

- A producer who wishes to market eggs **in export trade** must:
  - Have a provincial quota.
  - Apply to the provincial Commodity Board for an **export quota**.

> This ensures that only producers with legitimate production and market access rights can participate in interprovincial or export markets.

---

#### 2. **Prohibitions on Unauthorized Marketing**

No producer may market broiler hatching eggs in interprovincial or export trade unless:

- They have been **allotted an interprovincial quota** or **export quota**, respectively;
- They do **not exceed** the allocated quota;
- They comply with any **rules established by the provincial Commodity Board** that the Agency has authorized under subsection 22(3) of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act.

> This prevents over-supply, price manipulation, and unfair competition.

---

#### 3. **Calculation of Entitlements**

- **Interprovincial marketing entitlement**:
  > = (Total authorized under interprovincial quota + provincial quota)  
  > − (Number of eggs marketed intraprovincially during the period)

  This means producers can only sell a certain number of eggs outside their province, and any eggs sold domestically are deducted from their available interprovincial allowance.

- **Export marketing entitlement**:
  > = Number of eggs authorized under the producer’s **export quota**

  Export sales are strictly limited to the amount of the allocated export quota.

> These formulas ensure that total production and sales remain within provincial and national limits.

---

#### 4. **Quota Allocation Principles**

- **Interprovincial Quotas**:
  - The provincial Commodity Board must allocate interprovincial quotas so that:
    > Total eggs marketed under:
    > - Interprovincial quotas  
    > - Provincial quotas  
    > - Quota exemptions (e.g., for specific needs or emergencies)  
    **does not exceed** the total number of broiler hatching eggs set out in **Column I** of the Schedule (for that province).

- **Export Quotas**:
  - The Commodity Board must allocate export quotas so that:
    > Total eggs marketed under export quotas  
    **does not exceed** the number set out in **Column II** of the Schedule (for that province).

> These caps ensure that no province exceeds its agreed-upon production and distribution limits, protecting market balance.

---

#### 5. **Schedule Replacement**

- The original schedule to the regulations was **replaced** by **Schedule 2** to these regulations.
- Schedule 2 contains:
  - The **specific quota limits** (in numbers of eggs) for each signatory province.
  - **Column I**: Maximum total eggs allowed for interprovincial and provincial marketing (including exemptions).
  - **Column II**: Maximum total eggs allowed for export marketing.

> This schedule is central to the regulation’s operation and defines the boundaries of market access for each province.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

1. **Market Stability**:
   - Prevents oversupply and price volatility in the broiler hatching egg market.

2. **Fair Access**:
   - Ensures all producers have equitable access to interprovincial and export markets.

3. **Provincial Cooperation**:
   - Promotes coordination between provinces through the Commodity Boards, which act as intermediaries between producers and the federal agency.

4. **Price Support**:
   - By limiting supply, the system helps maintain stable prices for producers and ensures adequate returns.

5. **Efficient Resource Use**:
   - Encourages efficient use of egg production capacity and prevents waste due to overproduction.

### **Historical Context and Repeal**

- These regulations were introduced in **1987** as part of a federal-provincial agreement on broiler hatching egg marketing.
- They were based on the **Federal-Provincial Agreement for Broiler Hatching Eggs**, which established the allocation system in Schedule B.
- The regulations were **repealed** on **April 1, 2013**, under *SOR/2013-252, s. 1*, as part of broader reforms to the Farm Products Marketing Agencies framework.
- Further amendments or replacements may have been introduced in later years, reflecting changes in agricultural policy, trade dynamics, or market conditions.

> The repeal indicates that the quota system was no longer considered necessary or effective in the evolving Canadian agricultural and trade environment.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Hatching Egg Producers Quota Regulations* (1987) represent a **structured, province-based approach** to managing the marketing of broiler hatching eggs in Canada. By establishing **interprovincial and export quotas**, the regulations aimed to:

- Prevent market saturation,
- Ensure fair competition,
- Support producer income,
- Promote interprovincial cooperation, and
- Maintain price stability.

While historically significant and well-structured, the regulations are now **outdated and legally obsolete** due to their repeal in 2013. They serve as a valuable example of how federal-provincial cooperation can be used to regulate agricultural commodities in a coordinated and market-stable manner.
