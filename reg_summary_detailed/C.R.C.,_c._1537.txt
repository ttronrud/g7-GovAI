**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Lockhart River N.W.T.) from Disposal Order**

---

### **Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Lockhart River N.W.T.) from Disposal Order"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a formal legal instrument under the *Territorial Lands Act* of the Northwest Territories (N.W.T.).

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific lands in the Lockhart River area of the Northwest Territories from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of private or commercial development)**. These lands are being set aside **exclusively for future hydroelectric power development** by the **Northern Canada Power Commission (NCPC)**.

This action is not intended to transfer ownership or create a new government entity, but rather to **protect and designate** the land for a specific public utility purpose — the development of hydroelectric power.

---

### **Key Legal Provisions**

1. **Withdrawal from Disposal**  
   The lands described in the Schedule are **withdrawn from disposal under the Territorial Lands Act**. This means:
   - The lands cannot be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of by the Government of the Northwest Territories.
   - No private party can acquire rights to these lands through traditional land disposition processes.

2. **Retention of Minerals**  
   The **minerals underlying the withdrawn lands are also excluded from disposal**. This includes any oil, gas, uranium, or other mineral resources beneath the surface.  
   However, this withdrawal **does not affect the rights of holders of recorded mineral claims in good standing**.  
   → Existing mineral claim holders who have valid, legally recorded claims (i.e., claims that are properly documented and in active status) **retain their rights** to extract minerals from their respective claims.

3. **Set-Aside and Appropriation**  
   The lands are **formally set apart and appropriated** for the exclusive purpose of **future hydroelectric power development** by the Northern Canada Power Commission.  
   This appropriation is a formal legal designation that ensures:
   - The government will not allow competing land uses (e.g., mining, agriculture, residential development) on these lands.
   - The NCPC has the authority to plan, develop, and manage infrastructure (dams, power stations, transmission lines, etc.) on these lands.

4. **No Prejudice to Existing Rights**  
   The Order explicitly states that it **does not prejudice** the rights of individuals or entities holding valid mineral claims. This is a critical legal safeguard to protect existing private interests in mineral resources.

### **Description of the Land**

The withdrawn parcel is located along the **Lockhart River** in the **Northwest Territories**, and is precisely described using a detailed boundary description based on topographic features and geographic coordinates.

#### **Boundary Description (Based on Parry Falls Map Sheet 75 K/15, 1:50,000 scale, 1961):**

- **Commencement Point**:  
  A peak with an elevation of approximately **750 feet**, located **northerly of the Lockhart River**, at:  
  Latitude: 62°49′15″ N  
  Longitude: 108°52′00″ W

- **Thence Northeasterly**:  
  In a straight line to a peak at:  
  Elevation: ~1,250 feet  
  Latitude: 62°51′30″ N  
  Longitude: 108°47′20″ W

- **Thence Southeasterly**:  
  To the **most northerly point on the bank of an unnamed lake**, at:  
  Latitude: 62°50′40″ N  
  Longitude: 108°46′20″ W

- **Thence General Southwesterly Along the Lake Bank**:  
  To the **most westerly point** of that lake’s bank.

- **Thence Southwesterly (Straight Line)**:  
  To the **most northerly point on the bank of a second unnamed lake**, at:  
  Latitude: 62°49′40″ N  
  Longitude: 108°47′15″ W

- **Thence Southwesterly (Straight Line)**:  
  To the **most northerly point on the bank of a third unnamed lake**, at:  
  Latitude: 62°48′45″ N  
  Longitude: 108°50′30″ W

- **Thence Northwesterly (Straight Line)**:  
  Back to the **point of commencement**.

> All coordinates are referenced to the **1927 North American Datum (NAD 27)**, which was the standard geodetic system in use at the time of the map’s production.

#### **Area of the Parcel**
- The total area of the land is approximately **3.9 square miles** (about 10,100 hectares), though the figure is stated as "more or less" to allow for minor variations due to topographic or measurement adjustments.

---

### **Geographic and Environmental Context**
- The area lies in the **remote northern part of the Northwest Territories**, near the **Lockhart River**, which is a significant waterway in the region.
- The terrain includes **mountainous peaks, lakes, and riverine features**, making it suitable for hydroelectric projects due to elevation differences and water flow potential.
- The use of a 1961 map indicates that this is a historical designation, possibly reflecting early planning stages for energy infrastructure.

### **Implications and Significance**

1. **Energy Development Planning**  
   This Order represents a foundational step in the planning and development of **hydroelectric power** in northern Canada. It ensures that the NCPC has secure access to land and water resources necessary for building dams, reservoirs, and transmission systems.

2. **Public Interest vs. Private Rights**  
   While the government withdraws the land from disposal, it **respects and protects existing mineral claim holders**, balancing public development goals with private property rights.

3. **Legal Precedent**  
   This regulation sets a precedent for how public lands can be designated for specific infrastructure projects under the *Territorial Lands Act*, particularly in the context of renewable energy.

4. **Environmental and Community Considerations**  
   Though not explicitly stated in the Order, such withdrawals often trigger environmental assessments and consultations with Indigenous communities or local stakeholders, especially in sensitive northern ecosystems. These steps may follow this Order, even if not included in the text.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **legally binding instrument** that formally designates a specific parcel of land and its underlying minerals in the Lockhart River area of the Northwest Territories for **exclusive use in hydroelectric power development** by the Northern Canada Power Commission. It withdraws the land from public disposal, protects existing mineral claim rights, and establishes a clear legal framework for future infrastructure planning. The land is described with precision using historical topographic data, ensuring clarity and enforceability in administrative and legal processes.

This Order is a key component of Canada’s long-term strategy to develop renewable energy sources in remote and underdeveloped regions of northern Canada.
