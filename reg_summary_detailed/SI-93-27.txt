### **Regulatory Summary**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Order Regarding Inclusion of Lands Adjacent to Kam Lake in the Sale of Territorial Lands

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
*On the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development*

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act** (a Canadian federal statute governing land administration in the Northwest Territories), the Governor General has issued this order.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Scope of Lands Included in Sale:**  
   Any portion of the lands described in the **Schedule attached to this order** that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)** of **Kam Lake** in the Northwest Territories will be **included in the sale** of those lands.

   - The "Ordinary High Water Mark" is a legally recognized boundary that defines the natural edge of the lake's water level under normal conditions. This boundary is critical for determining which land parcels are subject to specific regulatory or land-use rules.
   - The 30.48 metre (100 foot) buffer zone is a standard distance used in land administration to define riparian or shoreline land rights, often for purposes of access, environmental protection, or land use planning.

2. **Purpose of the Inclusion:**  
   The inclusion of these lands in the sale is likely intended to:
   - Facilitate land development or infrastructure projects near Kam Lake.
   - Ensure that land adjacent to the lake—particularly in environmentally sensitive or ecologically significant areas—is properly accounted for in land transactions.
   - Reflect the regulatory framework that allows for the sale of certain land parcels adjacent to natural water bodies, especially where they are designated for public or municipal use.

3. **Reference to Kam Lake Road Right-of-Way:**  
   The regulation specifically references **Kam Lake Road** in the **City of Yellowknife**, Northwest Territories.

   - The road right-of-way is defined by a **plan of survey of record number 73214**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** at Ottawa.
   - A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District in Yellowknife under **file number 2144**.
   - This ensures that the legal boundaries of the road are officially documented and accessible for land title and survey purposes.

4. **Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
   - The order is binding and enforceable under the Territorial Lands Act.
   - It establishes a clear legal boundary for land subject to sale, based on proximity to Kam Lake.
   - It aligns with established land administration practices in northern Canada, where water bodies and their adjacent lands are often subject to specific rules due to environmental, cultural, or transportation considerations.

### **Implications and Practical Effects**

- **Landowners or stakeholders** who hold land within 100 feet of Kam Lake must be aware that such land is now part of the sale process and may be subject to:
  - Public or private acquisition.
  - Development restrictions.
  - Environmental or zoning considerations.

- The inclusion of the land in the sale may affect:
  - Property values.
  - Access rights.
  - Future development or conservation plans.

- The reference to the survey plan (No. 73214) and the filing in the Land Titles Office ensures transparency and legal accountability, allowing for public access to the boundary information.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates a **buffer zone (100 feet)** of land adjacent to Kam Lake as part of a land sale under the Territorial Lands Act. It is grounded in established legal principles and supports the administrative process of land management in the Northwest Territories. The inclusion of the Kam Lake Road right-of-way in the documentation ensures that infrastructure and land use boundaries are clearly defined and legally recognized.

This order serves both as a practical land transaction directive and a tool for ensuring consistent land administration and public access to land records in the region.
