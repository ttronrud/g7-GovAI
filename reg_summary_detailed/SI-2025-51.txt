Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, key provisions, legal basis, and implications.

### **Regulation Summary: SI/2025-17 and Related Provisions**

#### **1. Regulatory Instrument Overview**
- **Title:** Statutory Instrument No. 2025-17 (SI/2025-17)
- **Issued by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister
- **Date of Publication:** April 2025 (implied by reference to P.C. 2025-87 and context)
- **Purpose:** To amend and clarify the designation of a "Minister" for purposes of two federal public sector labour relations statutes.

---

#### **2. Repeal of Prior Order**
- **Repeals:** Order in Council P.C. 2025-87, issued on February 12, 2025.
- **Reason for Repeal:**  
  P.C. 2025-87 likely established an outdated or interim designation of a Minister for purposes of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act. This regulation removes that order, signaling a change in policy or administrative structure, and replaces it with a more current and legally sound designation.

---

#### **3. Key Designation Under the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act (FPLRBEA)**
- **Act Reference:** *Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act* (P.C. 2025-87 was repealed)
- **Section Involved:** Section 3 of the Act
- **Designation Made:**  
  The **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** who is **not a member of the Treasury Board** is designated as the **"Minister"** under section 3 of the Act.

- **Legal Significance:**  
  This designation establishes the role of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (typically the Prime Minister or a senior cabinet minister) as the official "Minister" for the purposes of the FPLRBEA. However, the condition that the individual must **not be a member of the Treasury Board** is critical and suggests a distinction from traditional cabinet-level roles.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is usually the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister is a member of the Treasury Board, this designation would not apply. Therefore, this provision effectively excludes the Prime Minister (if they are in the Treasury Board) from being the designated Minister under this Act — a significant policy or structural detail.

---

#### **4. Designation Under the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act (FPLRA)**
- **Act Reference:** *Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act* (FPLRA)
- **Section Involved:** Subsection 2(1), definition of "Minister"
- **Designation Made:**  
  The **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** who:
  - Is a **member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada (KPC)**, and  
  - Is **not a member of the Treasury Board**  
  is designated as the **"Minister"** for the purposes of the FPLRA.

- **Legal Significance:**  
  This designation is narrower and more restrictive than the one in the FPLRBEA. It requires:
  - Membership in the King’s Privy Council (a formal honour and status indicating seniority and government appointment),
  - Exclusion from the Treasury Board (which includes senior cabinet ministers and key policy leaders).

> ✅ This ensures that only certain senior non-cabinet-level figures (or non-Treasury Board members) with formal recognition as part of the government can be designated as "Minister" under the FPLRA.

- **Statutory Basis:**  
  - S.C. 2013, c. 40, s. 365 (original provision)  
  - S.C. 2017, c. 9, s. 36 (amendment to clarify scope)  
  These provisions establish the foundational legal framework for the designation, reinforcing the principle that ministerial status under labour relations statutes is not automatic but must meet specific criteria.

---

#### **5. Additional Provision (FPLRA Section 2(1))**
- **Reference:** S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2; S.C. 2017, c. 9, s. 2  
- **Purpose:**  
  These provisions provide the original and amended legal authority for the definition of "Minister" in the FPLRA, ensuring consistency and legal clarity over time.

---

#### **6. Policy and Structural Implications**
- **Clarification of Ministerial Roles:**  
  The regulation resolves ambiguity about who qualifies as a "Minister" in federal public sector labour relations. It distinguishes between:
  - Cabinet ministers (who are typically in the Treasury Board),
  - Senior government leaders who are not in the Treasury Board,
  - And those with formal recognition in the Privy Council.

- **Exclusion of the Prime Minister (if applicable):**  
  Since the Prime Minister is usually a member of the Treasury Board, this designation effectively **excludes** the Prime Minister from being the designated Minister under both Acts — a notable departure from common practice.

- **Potential Rationale:**  
  The exclusion may reflect a desire to:
  - Prevent the Prime Minister from having direct, unilateral authority over public sector labour relations,
  - Ensure that labour relations are managed by a more neutral or independent figure,
  - Avoid potential conflicts of interest or political overreach in sensitive labour disputes.

- **Administrative Neutrality:**  
  By designating a non-Treasury Board member (and a Privy Council member), the government may be promoting a more neutral, administrative, and procedural approach to labour board oversight.

---

#### **7. Legal and Procedural Context**
- **Governor in Council Authority:**  
  The Governor General in Council acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, indicating that this is a politically driven administrative decision, not a standalone legal innovation.

- **Interpretation of "Minister":**  
  The term "Minister" in both Acts is not defined in a broad sense (e.g., as any government official). Instead, it is narrowly defined by specific criteria — membership in the Privy Council and non-membership in the Treasury Board — ensuring that only individuals with formal ministerial status and a certain level of government standing qualify.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **refinement of ministerial designation** in federal public sector labour relations. By explicitly excluding members of the Treasury Board and requiring Privy Council membership, it introduces a more **structured, neutral, and procedural framework** for how the federal government engages with public sector labour boards.

It reflects a growing emphasis on **administrative neutrality**, **procedural fairness**, and **clear delineation of roles** in public sector governance — particularly in labour relations, where political influence could undermine impartiality.

While the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is typically the Prime Minister, this regulation effectively **excludes the Prime Minister** from being the designated Minister under these Acts if they are in the Treasury Board — a significant policy implication that may affect the governance of public sector disputes.

> 🔍 **Note for Stakeholders:**  
> This regulation may impact how public sector unions, labour boards, and government departments interact with each other. It may require adjustments in internal procedures, communication protocols, and dispute resolution processes to reflect the new designation.
