### **Licensing Decisions by the Superintendent**

#### **Factors Considered in Issuing a Licence:**
1. **Impact on natural and cultural resources** of the park.
2. **Safety, health, and enjoyment** of park visitors and residents.

> This ensures that food service, lodging, or other operations meet public health standards.

### **Suspension and Revocation of Licences**

#### **Suspension:**
- A licence may be **suspended** if the licensee:
  - Fails to comply with:
    - These Regulations,
    - The terms and conditions of the licence,
    - Or the terms of a lease or licence of occupation under the *National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)*.

#### **Revocation:**
- A licence may be **revoked** if:
  1. The licensee is **convicted of a violation** of these regulations; or  
  2. The licence has been **suspended three times during the year of its issuance**.

### **Licence Expiry**

A licence expires on the **earliest of**:
1. The date stated in the licence,
2. The date of revocation (if any), or
3. The **sale of the business**.

> This means that even if the licence is not revoked, it ends when the business is sold, protecting the park from unregulated operations after ownership changes.
