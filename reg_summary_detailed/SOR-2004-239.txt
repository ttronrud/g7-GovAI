### **Key Provisions and Implications**

1. **Legal Authority and Accountability**  
   The regulations clearly assign legal authority to law enforcement agencies and designated personnel to collect and register information, ensuring consistency and accountability.

2. **Jurisdictional Clarity**  
   By specifying which police services and locations are responsible for registration, the regulations prevent duplication or gaps in reporting, especially in complex or multi-jurisdictional areas like Calgary.

3. **Inclusion of Aboriginal Services**  
   Recognition of First Nations police services as legitimate and authorized entities in the registration system reflects a commitment to Indigenous self-governance and equitable law enforcement practices.

4. **Centralized Management**  
   The RCMP "K" Division acts as the central administrative body for registration, enabling data aggregation, monitoring, and public access (as permitted under the Act), while maintaining operational oversight.

5. **Repeal of Outdated Provisions**  
   The removal of the "special constable" designation in 2012 reflects modernization and alignment with current policing structures and legal frameworks.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure timely and accurate registration** of individuals convicted of sex offences.
- To **maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date database** of sex offenders in Alberta.
- To **support public safety** by enabling law enforcement to monitor and respond appropriately to potential risks.
- To **facilitate coordination** among police services, including federal (RCMP), provincial, municipal, and Indigenous services.

### **Conclusion**

The *Alberta Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations* (2004) provide a clear, structured, and jurisdictionally sound framework for the registration of sex offenders in Alberta. By defining roles, locations, and responsibilities, the regulations ensure that all relevant law enforcement agencies can contribute effectively to a public safety initiative. The inclusion of Aboriginal police services and the careful delineation of geographic jurisdictions underscore the regulatory framework’s responsiveness to both legal and community-specific needs.

These regulations remain foundational to Alberta’s sex offender registration system and continue to inform related policies and practices, including public access to offender information (subject to privacy and legal safeguards under the *Personal Information Protection Act* and other applicable laws).
