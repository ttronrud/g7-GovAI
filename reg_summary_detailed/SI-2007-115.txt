**Detailed Summary of the Regulation (S.C. 2002, c. 29 – Order under the Species at Risk Act)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulatory order, issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, makes several key decisions regarding the status of three wildlife species in Canada:

1. **Decides not to add** the **Bering cisco (*Coregonus laurettae*)** and the **black redhorse (*Moxostoma duquesnei*)** to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk* (Schedule 1 to SARA).
2. **Refers the assessment** of the **ghost antler lichen (*Pseudevernia cladonia*)** back to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further evaluation.
3. **Approves the inclusion** of two public statements in the *public registry* established under Section 120a of SARA — one explaining the decision not to list the Bering cisco and black redhorse, and another explaining the referral of the ghost antler assessment.

This order reflects a balanced, science-based, and stakeholder-informed approach to species conservation, emphasizing data gaps, socio-economic implications, and the importance of ongoing monitoring and community knowledge.

## **1. Decision Not to Add the Bering Cisco (*Coregonus laurettae*) to the List**

### **Species Background**
- The Bering cisco is a trout-like, likely anadromous fish that migrates into the upper reaches of large rivers flowing into the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi Seas.
- It is primarily found in coastal Alaska, with rare, sporadic observations in Canadian waters of the Yukon River — as far as Dawson City.
- Despite some presence in Canada, **no confirmed spawning migrations**, **no life history data**, and **no biological sampling** have been conducted in Canadian waters.

### **COSEWIC Status History**
- Initially assessed as **Data Deficient (1990)**.
- Reassessed and designated **Special Concern (2004)** due to potential threats:
  - Incidental fishing (by-catch)
  - Changing marine conditions
  - Habitat degradation
- Hydroelectric development was identified as a future threat, but **no new projects** have been identified in the Yukon Energy Corporation’s 20-year plan, suggesting no immediate impediments to upstream migration.

### **Reasons for Not Listing**
- **Severe lack of baseline data** in Canada — critical for identifying threats, population trends, or limiting factors.
- **No confirmed incidental catches** in Canadian fisheries (e.g., fall chum fisheries), despite potential for by-catch.
- **No evidence of human threats** currently affecting populations in Canada.
- **Stakeholder opposition**:
  - The **Yukon Government**, **First Nations**, and the **Yukon Salmon Committee** all recommended **against listing** the species as Special Concern.
  - Their rationale includes:
    - Lack of information on Canadian populations.
    - Abundant populations in Alaska.
    - Absence of direct human impact in Canada.

### **Future Management Plans**
- Development of **baseline data** through:
  - Collection and “keying” of whitefish caught in fish wheels at the Canada/US border during the annual salmon tagging program.
- Public outreach via the **Yukon Salmon Committee website** to encourage citizen science and reporting of possible spawning areas.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: The species is not considered at risk in Canada due to insufficient data and absence of current threats. Listing would be premature without more research.

## **2. Decision Not to Add the Black Redhorse (*Moxostoma duquesnei*) to the List**

### **Species Background**
- A small freshwater sucker fish that inhabits cool, fast-moving streams and rivers.
- Prefers gravel, sand, or bedrock substrates and well-oxygenated shallow waters.
- Found in only **five southwestern Ontario watersheds** (Lake Erie, St. Clair, Huron, western Lake Ontario).
- Populations occur in **heavily urbanized and agriculturally impacted areas**.

### **COSEWIC Status History**
- Designated **Threatened (1988)**, confirmed in **2005**.
- Decline attributed to:
  - Habitat alteration from **urban development, dams, and impoundments**.
  - Agricultural activities.
  - Recreational fishing — particularly in the Grand River, which is expected to increase with urban growth.

### **Threats and Regulatory Implications**
- If listed as **Threatened**, the Act would impose **automatic prohibitions** on:
  - Fishing (sport and bait use)
  - Agricultural activities
  - Urban development
  - Other habitat-disturbing activities
- These prohibitions would apply **without prior scientific justification** or risk assessment.

### **Reason for Not Listing at This Time**
- **Scientific analysis is underway** to determine whether current activities (fishing, agriculture, development) can continue without jeopardizing the species’ survival or recovery.
- A **socio-economic impact analysis** is being conducted to assess:
  - Effects on **Aboriginal communities** (especially subsistence fishing).
  - Impacts on **industry groups** (e.g., agriculture, tourism).
  - Broader implications for **Canadian communities**.
- The Minister of the Environment concludes that **without this socio-economic analysis**, a listing decision would be **incomplete and potentially unjustified**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The Minister may **reconsider** the listing of the black redhorse **after** the socio-economic analysis is finalized.

### **Key Point**
- The decision is **not a rejection of concern**, but a **pause** to ensure that any listing is both scientifically sound and socially equitable.

---

## **3. Referral of the Ghost Antler Lichen (*Pseudevernia cladonia*) Assessment to COSEWIC**

### **Species Background**
- A lichen species, typically found in forested, moist environments.
- Previously assessed by COSEWIC with limited data.

### **Reason for Referral**
- **Significant new information** emerged after the original assessment:
  - The **Government of New Brunswick** reported the discovery of **over one million individuals** of ghost antler lichen at a **previously unsurveyed location**.
- This finding:
  - Contradicts earlier assumptions about population size and distribution.
  - Indicates a **potential population expansion or previously unknown habitat**.
  - Raises questions about the accuracy of the original status designation.

### **Why Refer Back to COSEWIC?**
- New information was not available during the prior assessment.
- The original assessment may have **failed to consider**:
  - Aboriginal or traditional knowledge.
  - Community-based observations.
- The status designation (e.g., Endangered, Threatened, Special Concern) must be based on **accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive data**.
- COSEWIC is the independent scientific body responsible for assessing species status and must now **re-evaluate** the species with this new data.

> ✅ **Outcome**: The assessment is being **reopened** to ensure scientific integrity and inclusion of all relevant knowledge sources.

## **Public Registry Requirements**

The Minister of the Environment is authorized to include two formal statements in the **public registry** under Section 120a of SARA:

1. **Annex 1**: Explains the **reasons for not listing** the Bering cisco and black redhorse.
2. **Annex 2**: Explains the **referral of the ghost antler assessment** to COSEWIC.

These statements are accessible to the public and serve as **transparent records** of the decision-making process, supporting accountability and public engagement.

## **Key Principles Underlying the Regulation**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Science-Based Decision-Making** | Decisions are grounded in COSEWIC assessments, biological data, and stakeholder input. |
| **Data Deficiency as a Barrier** | Lack of information prevents listing — especially for species with minimal Canadian data (e.g., Bering cisco). |
| **Stakeholder Consultation** | Government consultations (Yukon Government, First Nations, Salmon Committee) are critical in shaping policy. |
| **Socio-Economic Considerations** | Listing decisions must consider impacts on Indigenous communities and industries. |
| **Dynamic and Adaptive Management** | Referrals to COSEWIC reflect the need for ongoing monitoring and updated information. |

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation demonstrates a **prudent, evidence-based, and inclusive approach** to species conservation under the *Species at Risk Act*. It:

- **Avoids premature listing** of species lacking sufficient data (Bering cisco).
- **Pauses listing** of a threatened species (black redhorse) until socio-economic impacts are fully assessed.
- **Reopens an assessment** (ghost antler) due to **new, significant data**, ensuring that future decisions are based on the most current information.

The order reflects a commitment to **scientific rigor**, **intergovernmental collaboration**, **Indigenous knowledge**, and **public transparency**, all essential elements of effective biodiversity conservation in Canada.

---

**Final Note**: This decision does not imply that these species are not at risk — rather, it reflects the current state of knowledge and the need for further research, monitoring, and stakeholder engagement before any formal listing action is taken.
