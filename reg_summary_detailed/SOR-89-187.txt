Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the provided regulation:

---

**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1988-734 and Authorization of the Minister of Finance to Exercise Powers of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
Section 7 of the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act*.

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Revocation of Prior Order in Council:**  
   The regulation formally revokes Order in Council P.C. 1988-734, issued on April 21, 1988. This prior order had likely established certain regulatory, administrative, or operational provisions related to fisheries management or oversight in the Atlantic region, possibly involving National Sea Products Limited. Its revocation signifies a change in policy or administrative direction, effectively nullifying the previous regulatory framework.

2. **Authorization of the Minister of Finance:**  
   Under Section 7 of the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act*, the regulation authorizes the **Minister of Finance** to exercise the powers normally held by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** in respect of **National Sea Products Limited**.  

   This is a significant delegation of authority, as it transfers specific fisheries-related responsibilities—such as regulatory oversight, licensing, compliance monitoring, or enforcement—typically under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans—to the Minister of Finance. This may reflect a strategic shift in governance, possibly due to:
   - A reorganization of federal departments,
   - A desire to align fisheries policy with broader economic or financial oversight,
   - Or a temporary administrative measure to streamline decision-making in a specific case.

3. **Scope of Authority:**  
   The powers granted are limited to those explicitly referenced in the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act* and specifically pertain to the operations and compliance of **National Sea Products Limited**, a company engaged in the fishing or seafood processing sector in Atlantic Canada.

**Implications and Context:**

- This action indicates a shift in regulatory responsibility, potentially signaling a move toward greater financial or economic oversight of fisheries enterprises.
- The delegation of fisheries powers to the Minister of Finance may reflect a broader policy initiative to integrate fisheries management with economic policy, such as ensuring financial accountability, supporting sustainable investment, or aligning with national economic strategies.
- The revocation of the 1988 order suggests that the previous regulatory approach was no longer considered appropriate or effective, and a new framework is being implemented.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation marks a formal administrative and legal change in the governance of National Sea Products Limited. It removes the prior regulatory framework established in 1988 and transfers key fisheries-related powers to the Minister of Finance, enabling a new approach to oversight under the authority of the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act*. The move underscores a strategic realignment of responsibilities between federal departments, with implications for how fisheries operations are monitored, regulated, and supported in the Atlantic region.
