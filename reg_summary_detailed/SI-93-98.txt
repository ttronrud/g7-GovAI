**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, constitutes a formal transfer of certain powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers in Canada. Specifically, it outlines the reassignment of responsibilities related to regional economic development in the Province of Quebec.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Authority of the Issuing Body**:
   - The regulation is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
   - This reflects the constitutional framework where the Governor General, in Council (i.e., with the advice and consent of the federal Cabinet), has the power to reorganize government departments and transfer responsibilities under the authority of specific enabling legislation.

2. **Enabling Legislation**:
   - The transfer is authorized under **Section 2 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This section grants the federal government the legal power to reassign functions and responsibilities among different ministries within the Public Service, provided such transfers are for the purpose of administrative efficiency, policy coherence, or strategic realignment.

3. **Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**:
   - The **Minister of National Health and Welfare** is transferring to the **Minister of Labour**:
     - All powers, duties, and functions related to **regional economic development in the Province of Quebec**.
   - This includes any policy development, planning, implementation, and oversight activities related to fostering economic growth, infrastructure investment, and regional competitiveness within Quebec.

4. **Transfer of Public Service Entity**:
   - The **Federal Office of Regional Development — Quebec** (FORD-Quebec) is being transferred from the jurisdiction of the Minister of National Health and Welfare to the Minister of Labour.
   - This office is a key component of the federal government’s regional development apparatus, historically tasked with supporting economic development initiatives in specific regions, including Quebec.
   - The transfer includes full **control and supervision** of the office, meaning the Minister of Labour will now be responsible for its management, staffing, budgeting, strategic direction, and performance accountability.

### Implications and Context:

- **Shift in Policy Focus**: The move reflects a strategic realignment where economic development responsibilities are being placed under the purview of the Minister of Labour. This may signal a broader policy orientation that links labour market outcomes, employment, skills development, and regional economic vitality more closely with labour policy and employment programs.

- **Administrative Efficiency**: The transfer likely aims to streamline governance by placing regional development functions within a ministry that has direct responsibility for workforce development, training, and employment initiatives—thereby improving coordination between economic development and labour market outcomes.

- **Geographic Specificity**: The transfer is limited to **Quebec**, indicating that this realignment is regionally targeted and may reflect Quebec’s unique economic, demographic, or political dynamics.

- **Continuity of Service**: Despite the change in ministerial oversight, the functions and operations of the Federal Office of Regional Development — Quebec are expected to continue without disruption, with the new minister responsible for ensuring continuity, accountability, and effective implementation.

### Conclusion:

This regulation represents a significant reorganization within the federal public service. By transferring regional economic development responsibilities in Quebec from the Minister of National Health and Welfare to the Minister of Labour, the government is reinforcing a policy integration between economic development and labour market outcomes. It enhances inter-ministerial coordination and aligns regional development efforts with broader employment and workforce strategies, particularly in a province like Quebec where economic and demographic factors are closely tied to labour dynamics. The transfer is legally sound, constitutionally grounded, and executed through a clearly defined legislative framework.
