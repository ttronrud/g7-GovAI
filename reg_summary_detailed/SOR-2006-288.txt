### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Variation of Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28 – Retail Local Access-Independent VoIP Services**

This regulation, formally issued as **Order in Council P.C. 2006-305**, amends and refines the regulatory framework for **Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)** services in Canada, specifically by introducing a **differential regulatory approach** based on the type of VoIP service and the provider. It is grounded in the **Telecommunications Act (the "Act")** and issued under **subsection 12(7)** of that Act, following a recommendation by the Minister of Industry.

---

## **Background and Context**

### 1. **Original Regulatory Framework – Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28**
On **May 12, 2005**, the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** issued **Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28**, titled *Regulatory framework for voice communication services using Internet Protocol*. In this decision:
- The CRTC concluded that **local VoIP services** (voice services delivered over IP networks) are part of the **same market as traditional local exchange services**.
- It determined that **regulation should not be foregone** for VoIP services, and instead, the existing regulatory regime for local competition — established in **Telecom Decision CRTC 97-8** and subsequent rulings — **applies to VoIP**, with certain exceptions.

### 2. **Amendment and Reconsideration**
- On **June 30, 2005**, the CRTC amended Decision 2005-28 via **CRTC 2005-28-1**.
- On **May 4, 2006**, the **Governor in Council (GIC)**, acting under subsections **12(1) and (5)** of the Telecommunications Act, referred the decision back to the CRTC for **reconsideration** within **120 days**.
- On **September 1, 2006**, the CRTC issued **Telecom Decision CRTC 2006-53**, confirming the original framework and reaffirming that **local VoIP services should not be excluded from regulation** without a full market analysis.

## **Key Distinction Introduced: Two Classes of VoIP Services**

The central innovation of this regulation is the **recognition of two distinct classes of retail VoIP services**, leading to a **differentiated regulatory treatment**:

| Feature | **Retail Local Access-Dependent VoIP** | **Retail Local Access-Independent VoIP** |
|--------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Access & Service Provider** | Same provider; access and service are bundled | Separate providers; service provider does not own or operate the underlying network |
| **Network Dependency** | Can be delivered by switching from circuit-switched to packet-switched networks (i.e., same local access infrastructure) | Requires high-speed internet access, special handsets, adapters, or computer-based setup |
| **User Experience** | Functionally similar to traditional local telephone services | More complex, prone to service disruption, less reliable under poor internet conditions |
| **Market Entry Barriers** | Higher due to need for network access and infrastructure | Very low — no need to build or obtain permission to use existing networks |

> The Governor in Council concluded that **access-independent VoIP services are fundamentally different** from traditional local services and should be treated as a **distinct class** for regulatory purposes.

## **Regulatory Policy Objectives and Rationale**

The decision is rooted in the **Canadian telecommunications policy objectives** under **Section 7 of the Act**, which include:
- Enhancing **efficiency and competitiveness** nationally and internationally
- Promoting **market-driven innovation**
- Ensuring **efficient and effective regulation**
- Encouraging **research, development, and innovation**

### Key Rationale for the Change:
- VoIP is a **new, rapidly evolving technology** that enables cost savings, innovation, and increased competition.
- Access-independent VoIP services **lower barriers to market entry**, allowing smaller providers and new entrants to offer voice services without significant capital investment.
- **Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs)** can offer these services without building new infrastructure — simply leveraging existing broadband networks.
- Forbearing economic regulation (e.g., price controls, service quality standards) in this segment would:
  - **Stimulate competition**
  - **Encourage innovation**
  - **Promote consumer choice**
  - **Support dynamic market development**

## **Core Regulatory Change: Forbearance from Economic Regulation**

### What the Order Does:
> The Governor in Council **varies** Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28 (as amended and confirmed in 2005–2006), by **refraining from exercising certain regulatory powers** in relation to **retail local access-independent VoIP services** provided by **ILECs within their incumbent territories**.

### Specific Powers Forborne:
The CRTC is **not required to apply** the following powers and duties under the Telecommunications Act to these services:
- **Section 25** (economic regulation of rates)
- **Subsections 27(1), (5), and (6)** (regulation of access, service quality, and pricing)
- **Sections 29 and 31** (regulation of service quality, access, and competition)

> This means that **ILECs offering retail access-independent VoIP services are not subject to rate regulation or economic oversight** — unlike traditional local telephone services or those offered by CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers), which are regulated under CRTC 97-8.

## **Important Exceptions and Safeguards**

Despite the forbearance, the regulation includes **critical safeguards** to protect competition and consumer interests:

1. **Regulatory Framework Still Applies (Section IV of CRTC 2005-28):**
   - All other provisions of the original VoIP decision — including **service quality, access, interoperability, and consumer protection** — **remain in full force**.
   - This ensures that VoIP services are not unregulated in terms of **basic service standards, privacy, or network neutrality**.

2. **Conditional Reinstatement of Regulation:**
   - If, at any time, the CRTC determines — **as a question of fact** — that **circumstances have changed** such that forbearing regulation would **impair the establishment or continuation of a competitive market**, it may **resume regulation** under the Act.
   - This is governed by **subsection 34(3)** of the Telecommunications Act, which allows the CRTC to reevaluate regulation based on market developments.

3. **Interpretation Precedence:**
   - Any provision of the original decision that conflicts with this Order **shall be interpreted in a way that gives priority to this variation**.

## **Implications and Outcomes**

### ✅ Positive Impacts:
- **Encourages innovation and competition** in the local voice market.
- **Lowers barriers to entry** for new providers (especially small firms and startups).
- **Promotes technological advancement** by enabling the use of IP-based voice services.
- **Supports consumer choice** through diverse, affordable, and innovative voice options.

### ⚠️ Potential Risks (Managed by Safeguards):
- **Service reliability** may be lower for access-independent VoIP due to dependency on internet quality.
- **Consumer protection** risks (e.g., poor service during outages) are mitigated by the continued application of non-economic regulatory standards (e.g., service availability, transparency).
- The **CRTC retains the ability to intervene** if market conditions deteriorate or competition fails to develop.

## **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **significant evolution in Canadian telecommunications policy** — moving from a **one-size-fits-all regulatory approach** to a **market-sensitive, technology-specific framework**.

By **forbearing economic regulation** of **retail local access-independent VoIP services offered by ILECs**, the government recognizes the **competitive and innovative potential** of this technology while preserving **consumer protection and market integrity** through targeted, non-economic rules.

It reflects a **balanced approach** that aligns with national policy goals: **fostering innovation, reducing entry barriers, and maintaining a competitive and efficient telecommunications market** — all without compromising public interest or regulatory accountability.
