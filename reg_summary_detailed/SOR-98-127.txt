**Detailed Summary of the Repayment of Receipts Regulations, 1997**

The *Repayment of Receipts Regulations, 1997*, made under **section 20 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, establish specific rules governing the repayment of deposits and payments made to public officers and into the **Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF)**. These regulations ensure accountability, transparency, and the proper return of funds when certain conditions are met.

### **1. General Principle: Repayment of Deposits When Conditions Are Met**
- **When a public officer receives a deposit** (e.g., to secure the performance of an act or obligation) and that deposit is **paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund**, the money must be **repaid to the original payer** if:
  - The **act or thing** for which the deposit was made has been **successfully completed**, or
  - The deposit is **no longer required** for any reason (e.g., the obligation is fulfilled or becomes unnecessary).

> This ensures that public funds are not retained beyond their intended purpose and that individuals are not unjustly deprived of their deposits once the purpose is achieved.

---

### **2. Repayment of Excess Deposits**
- If the amount deposited **exceeds** the amount prescribed for the purpose (e.g., a deposit limit set by policy or regulation), the **excess amount must be repaid** to the person who paid it.
- If **no prescribed amount** exists, the excess is calculated based on the amount **actually required** to secure the act or thing.
- This provision prevents overcharging or over-depositing and protects individuals from losing money due to unnecessary or excessive deposits.

> Example: If a contractor is required to deposit $10,000 as a guarantee for a construction project, but the deposit is $12,000, the $2,000 excess must be returned.

### **3. Repayment of Unfulfilled Payments**
- If a payment is made to a public officer for a purpose that **has not been fulfilled** (e.g., a fee or bond not used), and that payment is **credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund**, the following applies:
  - The **full amount of the payment** must be repaid, **except** for the amount specified in **subsection 20(2) of the Financial Administration Act**.
  - This "reduced repayment" allows for a small portion of the payment to be retained (as per the Act) for administrative or statutory purposes.
  - However, **if the original payer cannot be identified or located**, the money is **not required to be repaid**.

> This rule balances accountability with practicality—ensuring funds are returned when possible, while recognizing that in some cases, identifying the payer may be impossible.

### **4. Repayment of Non-Public Money to the Receiver General**
- If **money paid to the credit of the Receiver General** (the official responsible for receiving public funds) is **not public money** (i.e., it is private or personal funds, not government revenue), then:
  - The money **must be repaid** to the person who paid it.
  - Again, **if the person cannot be identified or located**, repayment is not required.

> This protects individuals from losing personal funds that were mistakenly or improperly directed to public accounts.

---

### **5. Repeal Clause**
- These regulations are **not intended to remain in force indefinitely**.
- They are **repealed (cancelled)** and replaced by subsequent legislation or amendments.
- The regulations **come into force on February 23, 1998**.

> This indicates that the 1997 regulations were temporary or transitional, superseded by updated rules in later years.

---

### **Key Objectives and Principles**
- **Accountability**: Ensures that public officers do not retain funds beyond their legitimate use.
- **Transparency**: Clarifies when and how deposits and payments are returned.
- **Fairness**: Protects individuals from losing money due to over-deposits or unfulfilled obligations.
- **Practicality**: Recognizes administrative challenges in identifying payers when necessary.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- The regulations are enacted under **section 20 of the Financial Administration Act**, which grants the **Treasury Board** the authority to make rules regarding the administration of public funds, including the repayment of receipts.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Repayment of Receipts Regulations, 1997* provide a clear, structured framework for the return of deposits and payments made to public officers when the original purpose is fulfilled or no longer valid. They emphasize the principle that public funds should not be retained without justification and ensure that individuals are fairly compensated when deposits are not needed or when obligations are not met. While the regulations are now repealed, they represent a foundational set of rules for managing public financial accountability in Canada's federal system.
