**Detailed Summary of the Nova Scotia Chicken Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Nova Scotia Chicken Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a statutory instrument under the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi), establishing specific rules and powers related to the marketing of chickens within and beyond the province.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Nova Scotia* (Loi), the foundational legislation that provides the legal framework for regulating the marketing of agricultural products, including chickens.
  
- **Board**: Refers to the *Nova Scotia Marketing Board* (Régie), a provincial body responsible for overseeing the marketing of certain agricultural products within the province.

- **Chicken**: Defined as a chicken that is six months of age or younger and raised or produced for purposes other than egg production. This excludes laying hens and limits the scope to meat production.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Nova Scotia Chicken Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), a specialized body established under the Act to manage the marketing of chickens, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

- **Plan**: Denotes any marketing plan developed and periodically amended under the authority of the *Natural Products Marketing Act*. The Plan outlines strategies, pricing, distribution, and other marketing mechanisms for chickens.

**3. Regulatory Authority and Powers**  
A central provision grants both the **Commodity Board** and the **Marketing Board** broad regulatory powers over the marketing of chickens in **interprovincial and export trade**. These powers are modeled on their existing authority to regulate chicken marketing *within* Nova Scotia. Specifically:

- They may, by issuing **orders or regulations**, exercise all or any powers that they currently have under the Act and the Plan, **with respect to persons and property located within Nova Scotia**.

This means that the same mechanisms used to regulate local chicken marketing—such as pricing, quotas, or distribution rules—can be applied to chickens being sold outside the province or exported.

**4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board (Relevant Section)**  
The Order grants the *Nova Scotia Chicken Marketing Board* specific authority related to **levies and charges** in the context of interprovincial and export marketing. This section was previously active but has since been **repealed** (removed or canceled), as noted in the text:  
> *[Repealed, SOR/80-90]*

This indicates that the original provision allowing the Commodity Board to impose levies was **withdrawn or replaced** by a later amendment or regulation (S.O. 1980, No. 90). As such, **the current version of the Order does not include active authority for levies or charges**.

However, for historical or contextual understanding, the **former powers** included:

- The ability to **fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or businesses within Nova Scotia involved in the **production or marketing of chickens**.
  
- The power to **classify producers into different groups** (e.g., small farms, large operations, regional producers), and to set **different levy amounts** for each group.

- The **use of collected levies** for various purposes, including:
  - Establishing **reserves** (financial buffers to stabilize markets).
  - Covering **operating expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of chickens.
  - Conducting **equalization or adjustment** among producers to ensure fair distribution of revenues from chicken sales. For example, if a producer sells chickens at a lower price due to market fluctuations, levies could be used to compensate them, or vice versa.

- The ability to determine **periods of time** over which such equalization or adjustment will occur.

---

**5. Key Implications and Purpose**  
Although the levy provisions have been **repealed**, the Order still establishes a foundational framework for:

- **Coordinated marketing** of chickens across provincial and international markets.
- **Stabilizing market conditions** through structured regulatory oversight.
- Ensuring **fairness and equity** among producers by enabling financial adjustments based on market performance.
- Providing a mechanism for **collective action** in marketing, especially in times of price volatility or market downturns.

The repeal of the levy section suggests that the government may have determined that such financial mechanisms were no longer necessary, effective, or appropriate in the current market environment—possibly due to changes in market dynamics, agricultural policy, or administrative efficiency.

---

**6. Conclusion**  
The *Nova Scotia Chicken Order* is a regulatory instrument that enables the Nova Scotia Chicken Marketing Board and the Nova Scotia Marketing Board to regulate chicken marketing in interprovincial and export markets with powers comparable to those used domestically. While the specific authority to impose levies and charges has been **repealed** (as of SOR/80-90), the Order remains significant in defining the structure, scope, and responsibilities of the regulatory bodies involved in chicken marketing.

It reflects a broader effort to ensure stable, equitable, and sustainable marketing practices for a key agricultural product in Nova Scotia, with a focus on protecting producers and maintaining market integrity.
