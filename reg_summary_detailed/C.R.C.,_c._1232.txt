**Detailed Summary of the *Navigable Waters Works Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Navigable Waters Works Regulations** and may be cited as such. It serves as a set of administrative rules implementing the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (Act) to regulate activities related to the construction, maintenance, and operation of works in navigable waters.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act*, which provides the legal framework for managing navigable waters and works within them.
- **Engineer**: Defined as a *district marine agent*, *district manager*, or *superintending engineer* of Marine Services under the Department of Transport. These officials are responsible for overseeing compliance with the regulations.
- **Work**: A structure or project that falls under the scope of *Part I of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act*. This includes dams, locks, power plants, bridges, and other structures that affect navigation in rivers or lakes.

---

### **3. Validity of Ministerial Approvals**

- **Approval Duration**:  
  Where the Minister approves a work and its site and plans under **paragraph 5(1)(a)** or **subsection 6(4)** of the Act, that approval is valid only for a specific *type of work* as listed in **Column I of the Schedule**, and for a *time period* specified in **Column II** of that schedule.  
  → This ensures that approvals are time-bound and tied to specific project types, preventing indefinite or unreviewed use of navigable water resources.

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was repealed by SOR/88-461, section 1. As such, it is no longer in force.*

---

### **4. Installation and Maintenance of Navigation Aids**

- **Mandatory Installation of Lights, Buoys, and Marks**:  
  No person may build or place a work in a navigable water unless **all required lights, buoys, and navigation marks** are installed and **maintained to the satisfaction of the Minister**.  
  → This ensures that navigation remains safe and that vessels can safely approach, pass through, or avoid structures.

- **Prohibition on Leaving Equipment Behind**:  
  After project completion, **no tools, equipment, vehicles, temporary structures, or parts thereof** used in the construction or placement of a work may remain in the navigable water.  
  → Prevents obstruction and environmental hazards.

---

### **5. Debris Management**

- If a work or part of a work causes **debris or material to accumulate** on the bed or surface of a navigable water, the **owner of the work** must remove it to the **satisfaction of the Minister**.  
  → Ensures waterways remain clear and navigable, reducing risks to vessels and ecosystems.

> 🔍 *Note: This provision applies specifically to dams or power plants (as defined in the section), not all types of works.*

---

### **6. Responsibilities of Owners of Works (Dams, Power Plants, etc.)**

Owners of works—particularly **dams, power plants, or structures affecting navigation**—must:

1. **Install, Maintain, and Operate Log Chutes**:  
   - To allow the safe transport of logs through or over the work.  
   → Prevents log jams and maintains flow and safety in river systems.

2. **Provide Public Access Roads or Footpaths**:  
   - Must maintain **roads or footways** enabling **free public passage** between the upper and lower reaches of a river.  
   → Promotes public access and safety for recreational and emergency use.

3. **Provide Navigation Records and Plans**:  
   - Furnish the Minister with:
     - Records of **water flow**
     - **Water elevation** above and below the work
     - All relevant **plans and documentation** related to navigation  
   → Ensures transparency and supports ongoing monitoring of navigational safety.

---

### **7. Minister’s Right to Measure Water Discharge**

- The **Minister or their authorized representative** may measure water discharge through or over any work.  
  → Allows the government to monitor hydrological impacts and ensure compliance with environmental and navigational standards.

---

### **8. Maintenance of Navigation Limits**

- The owner must **maintain the limits of flow and water elevation** as required by the Minister.  
  → Ensures consistent and safe navigation conditions, especially during seasonal or flood events.

---

### **9. Lighting Requirements for Works (Based on Size)**

For works involved in **exploration, development, or transport of natural resources** (permanent, temporary, floating, or anchored), owners must install and maintain **navigation lights** according to the size of the structure:

| Size of Work (Max Horizontal Dimension) | Number of Lights | Placement Requirements |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **≤ 9 meters** | 1 light | Visible in all directions; mounted on same horizontal plane |
| **> 9 m but < 15 m** | 2 lights | Diagonally opposite corners or position satisfactory to Minister; both visible in all directions |
| **≥ 15 meters** | Lights at each corner or outer quadrant (90° separation) | 90° apart; visible in all directions; mounted on same horizontal plane |

#### **Light Specifications**:
- **Color**: White  
- **Flash Pattern**: Quick flash of **60 flashes per minute**  
- **Range**: At least **12.8 km**  
- **Power Source**: Reliable primary source + **auxiliary power source** (to ensure operation during outages)  
- **Height**: Installed **not less than 6 meters above water level** so that **at least one light is visible from any approach until within 15 meters** of the work  
- **Operation**:  
  - Displayed **between sunset and sunrise**  
  - Also displayed during **periods of restricted visibility**  
  - All lights must **flash in unison** if multiple are present  

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was partially repealed by SOR/84-182 (s. 3) and SOR/88-461 (s. 3), and further amendments were repealed by SOR/2024-148 (s. 4). The current version may reflect outdated or obsolete provisions.*

### **10. Sound Signal Requirements**

For works subject to lighting requirements (same size categories), owners must install a **sound signal**:

#### **Sound Signal Specifications**:
- **Power Source**: Reliable primary + **auxiliary power source**  
- **Signal Pattern**:  
  - Two seconds of sound, followed by an **18-second pause**  
  - Repeated every **20 seconds**  
- **Frequency**: Maximum intensity between **100–1,000 Hz**  
- **Range**: **3.2 km** in any horizontal direction (measured at height ≤ 7.5 m)  
- **Number of Sources**: No more than **eight**  
- **Height**: Between **3 m and 30 m** above water  
- **Placement**: Positioned so signal is **audible in all directions** (in still air) up to required range  
- **Activation**: Must be sounded **when visibility drops below 8 km in any direction**

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was also repealed by SOR/2024-148, s. 4. As such, it is currently not enforceable.*

---

### **11. Identification Panels**

- Owners must install **identification panels** on their works to identify the structure.  
- Panel specifications:
  - **Black letters** on a **yellow background**
  - **Minimum height of 1 meter**
  - **Retro-reflective outlines or night illumination** to ensure visibility at night

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was repealed by SOR/84-182, s. 3.*

- The owner of a work must **notify the engineer** (in whose district the work is located) of:
  - Any **failure of lights or sound signals**  
  - Any **change in the position** of the work  
  - Any other fact that may affect **navigation safety**

→ Ensures timely updates to authorities about potential hazards.

---

### **13. Penalties for Violations**

### **Key Observations and Notes on Repeal Status**

- Several key sections of the regulation have been **repealed**:
  - **SOR/88-461, s. 1**: Repealed the validity clause of approvals.
  - **SOR/84-182, s. 3**: Repealed identification panel requirements.
  - **SOR/2024-148, s. 4**: Repealed both the **lighting** and **sound signal** requirements.
- As of the latest repeal (SOR/2024-148), **many of the most detailed technical requirements (lights, sound signals, identification panels)** are **no longer in force**.
- The current version of the regulation appears to be **outdated or partially obsolete**, with only core principles (e.g., debris removal, public access, navigation records) likely still applicable.
