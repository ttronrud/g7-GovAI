**Detailed Summary of the *Potato Wart Compensation Regulations, 2003***  
*(S.C. 1990, c. 22; made under paragraph 47(q) of the Plant Protection Act)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
These regulations establish a framework for compensating farmers and agricultural operators who suffer economic losses due to the presence of **potato wart**, a soil-borne fungal disease caused by *Synchytrium endobioticum*. The regulations were introduced to address financial hardship experienced by producers when government measures—such as restrictions, prohibitions, or treatments—are implemented to control the spread of this disease.

The regulations are made under **paragraph 47(q) of the Plant Protection Act**, which authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) to create compensation rules in response to plant health threats like potato wart.

---

### **2. Definition of Key Term**
- **"Potato wart"** is defined as the potato disease caused by the pathogen *Synchytrium endobioticum*, a soil-borne fungus that infects potato tubers and can lead to significant crop losses.

---

### **3. Eligibility for Compensation**
A person may be eligible for compensation **only if** the following conditions are met:

#### **(a) Loss Due to Government Action**
The loss must result from a **treatment, prohibition, restriction, or disposition** issued by the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** after **December 31, 2001**, due to the presence of potato wart.

#### **(b) Taxable Business or Farm Income**
The applicant must have:
- Reported **taxable business or farm income** in:
  - The year immediately preceding the year in which the notice was issued, **or**
  - The year in which the loss occurred (or the year the notice was issued).

> This ensures that only active, financially engaged agricultural operators are eligible.

#### **(c) Reasonable Mitigation Efforts**
The applicant must have taken **all reasonable measures to mitigate the loss**, including:
- Selling crops other than potatoes grown at a restricted location;
- Selling potatoes that are infested or suspected of being infested with potato wart for non-agricultural purposes;
- Applying for compensation from another government department or organization;
- Applying for compensation under an insurance or service contract.

> This requirement emphasizes that applicants must not have ignored or failed to act to reduce their losses.

#### **(d) Timely Application Submission**
An application must be submitted to the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** within **three years** of the date the CFIA issued the relevant notice.

> This establishes a strict deadline to ensure timely claims processing and prevent long-term financial uncertainty.

#### **(e) Amendments to Applications**
An applicant may **amend their application at any time** before the three-year deadline expires.

> This provides flexibility for applicants to correct errors or provide additional information.

#### **(f) Late Applications (Exceptional Circumstances)**
An application may be submitted **after the three-year period** if:
- There were **exceptional circumstances beyond the applicant’s control** (e.g., natural disaster, illness, legal issues, or unforeseen events);
- The application is submitted **within 14 days** after those circumstances cease.

> This exception recognizes that unforeseen events may prevent timely action, but it is narrowly defined and time-sensitive.

---

### **4. Exclusion of Double Compensation**
No compensation will be awarded under these regulations if:
- The same loss has already been compensated under:
  - These regulations;
  - The *Potato Wart Compensation Regulations* (the same document);
  - Any other compensation legislation or measure (including regulations under the Plant Protection Act related to potato wart);
  - Any other compensation program, including **insurance contracts**.

> This prevents duplication of payments and ensures that compensation is provided only once.

---

### **5. Amount of Compensation**
Compensation is calculated as follows:
- It equals the **direct costs** incurred by the applicant in connection with the loss caused by a measure listed in **Column 1 of the table** in the regulations.
- However, the total compensation **shall not exceed the amount specified in Column 2** of the table.

> The table outlines specific measures (e.g., crop removal, treatment, disposal) and sets maximum allowable compensation amounts per measure. For example:
> - Cost of finding and leasing a substitute farm site;
> - Costs of treating or disposing of infected potatoes;
> - Costs of equipment or facility treatment.

> The cap ensures that compensation remains reasonable and manageable, preventing excessive payouts.

### **6. Required Application Components**

|--------|-------------|
| **Proportionality** | Compensation is limited to direct costs and capped to prevent overpayment. |
| **Fairness & Accountability** | Applicants must demonstrate both loss and mitigation efforts. |
| **Prevention of Double-Dipping** | Compensation is not payable if already received elsewhere (including insurance). |
| **Timeliness** | Strict three-year deadline promotes efficient administration and reduces administrative burden. |
| **Flexibility** | Allows amendments before expiry and limited late submission for exceptional circumstances. |
| **Focus on Direct Losses** | Only direct costs related to specific CFIA actions are covered—indirect or speculative losses are excluded. |

### **Conclusion**
The *Potato Wart Compensation Regulations, 2003* serve as a targeted, fair, and administratively sound mechanism to support farmers and agri-businesses facing financial hardship due to the presence of potato wart. By clearly defining eligibility criteria, limiting compensation to direct and verifiable losses, and establishing reasonable timelines and documentation requirements, the regulations balance the need for financial relief with fiscal responsibility and regulatory integrity.

They reflect a government commitment to protecting agricultural livelihoods while maintaining effective plant health management through science-based disease control. The rules also reinforce the importance of proactive mitigation and responsible reporting, ensuring that compensation is both accessible and equitable.

**Note**: These regulations remain in force as of the date of this summary and are part of the broader framework under the *Plant Protection Act* to manage plant health risks and support agricultural stakeholders.
