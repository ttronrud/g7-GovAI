**Regulatory Summary: Transfer of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) within the Department of National Defence**

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, under **subsection 123(1) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision grants the Governor General the authority to make administrative transfers of federal public service entities, particularly when such transfers are recommended by the Prime Minister and are consistent with the objectives of public service efficiency and organizational structure.

**2. Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **formally transfer the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)** — a key federal agency responsible for protecting Canada’s communications and information systems — **from its previous status within the broader Department of National Defence (DND)** to a new organizational structure. This transfer is not merely administrative; it reflects a strategic realignment to better align the CSE with national security and intelligence priorities.

**3. Key Provisions of the Regulation**  
- **Transfer of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE):**  
  The regulation establishes the official transfer of the CSE within the Department of National Defence. This means that the CSE is restructured or reorganized as a distinct entity under the DND, with specific governance, operational, and reporting responsibilities defined in the accompanying annex (not included in the excerpt). This transfer may involve changes in reporting lines, staffing, budget allocation, or oversight mechanisms.

- **Application of Subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act:**  
  This provision applies to **all individuals employed or engaged** in the portion of the federal public administration known as the **Communications Security Establishment**. It ensures that all public servants working within the CSE are subject to the same employment standards, rights, duties, and protections as defined by the PSEA. This includes provisions related to:
  - Employment terms and conditions
  - Promotion and career development
  - Disciplinary procedures
  - Termination and redundancy
  - Collective bargaining rights (where applicable)

  The application of this subsection ensures continuity and legal protection for employees during and after the transfer, minimizing disruption to workforce stability.

**4. Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on **November 16, 2011**. This date marks the official implementation of the transfer and the commencement of the new organizational structure and employment rules for all CSE personnel.

**5. Context and Implications**  
- The transfer of the CSE to the Department of National Defence was part of a broader government initiative to strengthen national security infrastructure and ensure that critical intelligence and communications security functions are properly integrated into the federal security framework.
- The CSE is a vital component of Canada’s national security apparatus, responsible for:
  - Developing and implementing secure communications technologies
  - Protecting government and critical infrastructure data
  - Conducting cyber security research and operations
  - Providing cryptographic services and secure information systems
- By placing the CSE within DND, the government likely aimed to enhance coordination between national defense and intelligence operations, particularly in the context of evolving cyber threats and national security challenges.

**6. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- The regulation is a formal instrument of federal administrative law, ensuring that the transfer is legally grounded and compliant with the Public Service Employment Act.
- It demonstrates the government’s ability to restructure public service entities while maintaining employment protections and legal accountability.
- The use of subsection 123(1) reflects a discretionary but constitutionally authorized power to reorganize federal departments and agencies in the public interest.

**7. Limitations and Scope**  
- The regulation applies only to personnel employed in the **CSE portion** of the DND. It does not extend to other agencies or departments within DND.
- The transfer does not necessarily imply a change in the CSE’s mandate or mission; rather, it reflects a change in administrative placement and governance.

**Conclusion**  
These regulations represent a formal and legally binding transfer of the Communications Security Establishment within the Department of National Defence, effective November 16, 2011. The transfer is authorized under the Public Service Employment Act and ensures that all employees of the CSE are protected under the same employment standards. This move underscores the government’s strategic intent to strengthen national security by integrating critical communications and cyber defense functions under a centralized, defense-aligned structure.
