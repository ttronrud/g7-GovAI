### **2. Citation and Definitions**
The regulations are formally cited as:  
**"The Import Permits Regulations"**

#### Key Definitions:
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Export and Import Permits Act* (the enabling legislation). |
| **Applicant** | A resident of Canada who submits an application for an import permit under the Act. |

### **3. Application for an Import Permit**

A resident of Canada may apply for an import permit by providing the following information to the Minister:

1. **Applicant’s name and address**  
2. **Confirmation of residency status** in Canada  
3. **Importer’s name and address** (if different from the applicant)  
4. **Supplier’s name and address** (who will supply the goods)  
5. **Country of origin** of the goods  
6. **Country from which the goods are imported** (i.e., the exporting country)  
7. **Customs office** where the goods will enter Canada  
8. **Date of entry** into Canada  
9. **Description of the goods** (detailed enough to ensure clarity)  
10. **Number of units** and **value in Canadian currency**  
11. **Any additional information** requested by the Minister if clarification is needed or if the description is insufficient  

> 🔍 **Purpose**: To ensure transparency, traceability, and compliance with Canadian trade policy and customs controls.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This section was **repealed** by SOR/95-33, Section 3 — meaning it is **no longer in force**. The current application process under modern regulations likely includes digital forms, online submissions, and enhanced data requirements.

### **4. Issuance of the Permit**

When a permit is granted, the Minister must:

- **Affix their official signature** to each copy of the permit  
- **Issue two copies** of the permit and **transmit them to the applicant**

> ✅ This ensures legal validity and provides one copy for the applicant and one for customs processing.

> ⚠️ This provision was **repealed** by SOR/95-33, Section 4 — suggesting that the current issuance process has evolved, possibly involving electronic systems or centralized databases.

---

### **5. Pre-Import Certification and Submission to Customs**

Every person who receives a permit **must certify** the following **before importing** the goods:

1. That **all information provided in the application is accurate and true**  
2. That the applicant (or importer) is a **resident of Canada**  
3. That they **affix their signature** to the copy of the permit marked:  
   - **"For Customs Clearance Only"** (in English)  
   - **"Pour dédouanement seulement"** (in French)  
4. That they **transmit this signed copy to the collector of customs** at the designated customs office

> 🔐 This step serves as a legal affirmation of compliance and accountability.

> ⚠️ This requirement was **repealed** by SOR/96-49, Section 3 — indicating that modern customs procedures have moved away from mandatory physical certification and may now rely on electronic declarations or automated systems.

---

### **6. Lost or Destroyed Permits**

If a permit is **lost or destroyed**, the holder may request a replacement from the Minister by submitting:

1. A **statutory declaration** stating:
   - That the original permit has been **lost or destroyed**
   - An **explanation** of how the loss or destruction occurred  
2. In the case of a **lost permit**, an **undertaking to return the original** (if found) to the Minister without delay

> 📝 This provision ensures accountability and prevents fraudulent use of permits.

> ⚠️ This section remains in force as of the current version, though it may be supplemented by modern procedures such as digital tracking or secure document management.

## ✅ Conclusion

The **Import Permits Regulations (1954)** serve as a **historical document** outlining the procedural framework for applying for and managing import permits in Canada during the mid-20th century. While it provides valuable insight into past trade control mechanisms, **it is no longer in force** in its original form due to repeals and legislative modernization.

> 📌 **Bottom Line**:
