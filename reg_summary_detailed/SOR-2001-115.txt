### **Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Uranium Mines and Mills Exclusion Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**, after consultation with the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)**. They are grounded in two key pieces of federal legislation:

- **Section 159a of the Canada Labour Code** – which allows for the exclusion of certain employment conditions from the general application of labour laws.
- **Section 8.2b of the Non-Smokers’ Health Act** – which provides a basis for excluding specific provisions related to smoking in workplaces.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **exclude certain federal labour and health protections from applying to employment in uranium mines and mills in Saskatchewan**, while still ensuring that essential safety and operational standards are maintained through alternative provincial and federal laws.

---

#### **2. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply specifically to:

- **Uranium mines or mills located in the Province of Saskatchewan** that are **subject to the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**.
- Employment on or in connection with such facilities, including:
  - Workers employed by holders of surface leases to mine or process uranium-bearing materials under:
    - *The Provincial Lands Act* (R.S.S. 1978, c. P-31)
    - *The Forest Act* (R.S.S. 1978, c. F-19)
    - *The Forest Resources Management Act* (S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1)
  - Workers employed by operators of uranium mines or mills that mine or process uranium-bearing material for or on behalf of the above-mentioned holders.

> This definition ensures that the exclusion applies to both direct operators and those acting on their behalf.

#### **3. Excluded Provisions from Federal Labour and Health Laws**

The following **federal laws and their sections are excluded** from applying to employment in uranium mines and mills in Saskatchewan:

| Law | Excluded Sections/Provisions |
|-----|------------------------------|
| **Canada Labour Code** | Sections 122 to 158 (covering various employment rights, such as working hours, leave, overtime, and compensation) |
| **Non-Smokers’ Health Act** | All provisions **except Section 8.2** (which allows for smoking in designated areas, as long as it does not endanger health or safety) |

> This means that workers in uranium mines and mills are **not entitled** to federal protections related to:
> - Working hours and rest periods
> - Paid leave (e.g., maternity, sick, personal)
> - Overtime pay
> - Wage guarantees
> - Other labour standards under the Canada Labour Code

> However, **Section 8.2** of the Non-Smokers’ Health Act remains in force — allowing for designated smoking areas, provided they do not compromise health or safety.

#### **4. Applicable Laws and Regulations (Retained and Modified)**

Despite the exclusions, **certain provincial and federal acts and regulations remain in force** for uranium mine and mill operations. These are explicitly listed and include modifications to specific sections or regulations.

##### **A. Boiler and Pressure Vessel Act (R.S.S. 1978, c. B-5)**
- Applies **except Section 39**.
- Includes the following regulations:
  - *Regulations Respecting The Design, Construction, Installation and Use of Boilers and Pressure Vessels* (SR 262/57)
  - *Regulations Respecting Compressed Gas Pressure Vessels* (SR 99/70)
  - *Regulations Respecting Examinations and Certificates of Engineers and Firemen* (SR 311/77)
  - *Regulations Respecting the Welding of Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Pressure Piping* (SR 61/78)

> This ensures that safety standards for high-pressure systems remain in place.

##### **B. Electrical Inspection Act (S.S. 1993, c. E-6.3)**
- Applies with the following exceptions:
  - *Electrical Inspection Regulations* (Reg 1): **Sections 19 to 21 are excluded**
  - *Use of Electricity in Mines Regulations* (Reg 4): Applies fully
  - *Canadian Electrical Code (Adoption) Regulations* (Reg 5): Applies
  - *Canadian Electrical Code (Saskatchewan Amendments) Regulations* (Reg 6): Applies

> Ensures safe electrical systems in mines, with tailored provisions for mining environments.

##### **C. Electrical Licensing Act (S.S. 1988–89, c. E-7.2)**
- Fully applies — governs licensing of electrical professionals.

##### **D. Gas Inspection Act (S.S. 1993, c. G-3.2) and Gas Inspection Regulations (Reg 1)**
- Applies fully — ensures gas safety in mining operations.

##### **E. Gas Licensing Act (S.S. 1988–89, c. G-4.1) and Gas Licensing Regulations (Reg 1)**
- Applies **except Sections 10, 12, and 13** — which are excluded due to operational or technical reasons in mining contexts.

##### **F. Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act) (S.S. 1993, c. O-1.1)**
- Applies with significant exceptions:
  - *Occupational Health and Safety Regulations* (Reg 1, 1996): 
    - **Section 84** is excluded
    - **Parts XXVII, XXIX, and XXXI** are excluded (likely related to specific administrative or reporting requirements)
  - *Mines Regulations* (SR 284/78): 
    - **Part XXVII** is excluded (likely related to specific mine safety or administrative provisions)

> This allows for a streamlined OHS framework tailored to uranium mining operations.

##### **G. Passenger and Freight Elevator Act (R.S.S. 1978, c. P-4)**
- Applies with the **Passenger and Freight Elevator Regulations (Reg 1, 1982)** — ensuring elevator safety in mine infrastructure.

##### **H. Radiation Health and Safety Act (R.S.S. 1984–85–86, c. R-1.1)**
- Applies **with key exclusions**:
  - **Section 18** and **subsection 19(1)** are excluded
  - *Radiation Health and Safety Regulations* (Reg 1):
    - Subsections **21(6) and (7)** are excluded
    - Sections **24 to 28, 32**, and **40 to 46** are excluded
    - Clause **47(1)(c)** is excluded
    - Sections **48 to 50** are excluded
    - Subclauses **51(1)(b)(i)** and **2(b)(i)** are excluded
    - **Forms A and B of Part III of the Appendix** are excluded

> These exclusions reflect the fact that radiation protection in uranium mines is governed by **more specialized and stringent federal regulations** under the **Nuclear Safety and Control Act**, which are considered more appropriate and comprehensive.

#### **5. Amendments to Legal References (Section 3 – Interpretive Changes)**

To ensure consistency and clarity in the application of these regulations, several interpretive amendments are made:

| Change | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **"Notwithstanding section 29 of The Summary Offences Procedure Act, 1990"** → **"Notwithstanding subsection 787(2) of the Criminal Code"** | Replaces a reference to a summary offence provision with a reference to a criminal code provision (related to penalties for certain offences), ensuring alignment with current criminal law. |
| **Subsection 4(1) of the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Act** | The reference to “that are subject to the legislative authority of the province” is **read as if it does not exist** — meaning that the act applies regardless of provincial jurisdiction, reinforcing federal-level oversight. |
| **Reference to “C.R.C.” in SR 99/70 (Compressed Gas Pressure Vessels)** | “C.R.C.” (Canada Revenue Code) is replaced with a reference to the **Canadian Transportation Agency** — correcting a technical inaccuracy in the regulation. |
| **Section 3 of the Passenger and Freight Elevator Act** | The reference to “or subject to, the legislative authority of” is **read as if it does not appear** — removing jurisdictional barriers and ensuring applicability in mining settings. |

> These amendments clarify legal interpretation and ensure that applicable regulations operate without unintended jurisdictional conflicts.

---

#### **6. Precedence in Case of Conflict**

In the event of **inconsistency** between:
- The **Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)** and its regulations, and
- Any of the acts or regulations listed in Section 3 of these Saskatchewan Regulations,

👉 **The provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and its regulations prevail**.

> This is critical because uranium mining involves **nuclear materials and radiation**, and the NSCA is the primary federal legislation governing such risks. It ensures that **nuclear safety standards take priority** over other workplace laws.

#### **7. Repeal Clause**

- These regulations **do not
