**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Exemption Order for Certain Licences, Authorizations and Documents (Bull Trout – Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers Populations)

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under **Section 76 of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA)**, by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** and the **Minister of the Environment**.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This exemption order provides a legal mechanism to allow certain fishing activities involving the **Bull Trout (Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers populations)** to proceed without being subject to the restrictions imposed by **Section 32 of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**. Section 32 typically prohibits or restricts activities that may harm or threaten listed wildlife species at risk, especially those involving direct impacts on the species’ habitat or population.

However, this order **exempts specific licences, authorizations, and documents** related to fishing activities affecting the Bull Trout in the **Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers populations** from the application of Section 32, for a period of **one year** from the date the Bull Trout population is officially added to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk* in Schedule 1 to SARA.

**Scope of the Exemption:**

The exemption applies to the following specific regulatory instruments and authorizations, **to the extent they authorize fishing activities**:

1. **Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998**  
   - Specifically, the provisions of these regulations that authorize **sportfishing** in relation to the Bull Trout in the Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers populations are exempt from Section 32 of SARA.

2. **Licences issued under subsection 13(3) of the Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998**  
   - These are specific fishing licences granted under that subsection. The exemption covers these licences as long as they pertain to sportfishing of Bull Trout in the relevant river populations.

3. **National Parks of Canada Fishing Regulations**  
   - The provisions of these regulations that authorize **fishing activities** (including sportfishing) involving Bull Trout in the Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers are also exempt from the restrictions of Section 32 of SARA.

---

**Key Conditions and Limitations:**

- The exemption is **time-limited**: It applies only for a period of **one year** from the date the Bull Trout (Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers populations) is added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk under SARA.
- The exemption applies **only to the specified activities** (sportfishing) and **only to the specific populations** of Bull Trout in the Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers.
- The exemption **does not override** other applicable environmental or fisheries protections. It only removes the specific barrier posed by Section 32 of SARA for these activities.
- The exemption is **not a blanket protection** — it allows fishing to proceed under existing regulatory frameworks (Alberta Fishery Regulations and National Parks Fishing Regulations), but only to the extent that these regulations permit sportfishing of Bull Trout.

---

**Effective Date:**  
The order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette* (or official register), which is typically a matter of administrative process and public notice.

---

**Context and Rationale:**

- The Bull Trout (specifically the populations in the Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers) are considered a **species at risk** under SARA due to threats such as habitat degradation, competition with non-native species, and climate change.
- Despite their at-risk status, the government has determined that **sportfishing activities** in these populations, when conducted under existing, well-regulated frameworks, are **not currently causing significant harm** and may be essential for **local economic and cultural activities** (e.g., recreation, tourism).
- The exemption allows for a **pragmatic balance** between species conservation and human use, recognizing that some level of human interaction may be necessary while still ensuring that the species is not unduly threatened.
- The one-year duration allows for **monitoring and evaluation** of the impact of fishing on Bull Trout populations, with the possibility of renewal or revision based on scientific data and ecological assessments.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a targeted, time-limited exemption that permits sportfishing activities involving the Bull Trout in the Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers under existing provincial and federal regulations, without triggering the prohibitions under Section 32 of the *Species at Risk Act*. It reflects a careful, science-informed approach to species conservation, allowing for sustainable human use while maintaining the integrity of the species’ recovery plan. The exemption is not permanent and is subject to review and potential extension based on ongoing ecological monitoring and assessment.
