## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Ukraine Goods Remission Order**

### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- **Enacted by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.
- **Legal Basis:** Section 115a of the *Customs Tariff* (S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)) and the *Customs Tariff Act* (S.C. 1997, c. 36).
- **Purpose:** To provide temporary customs duty remission for goods originating in Ukraine, under specific conditions, during a defined period.

---

### **2. Scope of Remission**

#### ✅ **Remission of Customs Duties under the Customs Tariff**
- **Applies to:** Goods that originate in Ukraine and are imported into Canada.
- **Exclusions:**
  - Goods subject to the **General Tariff**.
  - Goods classified under specific tariff headings listed in the **Schedule** (see list below).
- **Definition of "Originates in Ukraine":**
  - The **last production process** (excluding minimal operations) must have occurred in Ukraine.
  - This means the goods must have undergone substantial transformation or manufacturing in Ukraine.

#### ✅ **Remission of Duties under the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**
- Applies to goods that have acquired their **physical and technical characteristics** in Ukraine.
- This is a more technical standard than "last production" — it focuses on the product's form, structure, and function being developed in Ukraine.

---

### **3. What Constitutes a "Minimal Operation"?**

Minimal operations are **excluded** from being considered as "last production" and therefore **do not count** toward origin in Ukraine. These include:

| Minimal Operation | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Preservation** | Ensuring goods remain in good condition during transport and storage (e.g., refrigeration, drying). |
| **Packaging / Repackaging** | Packaging, re-packaging, breaking up consignments, or preparing goods for retail (e.g., placing in bottles, cans, bags, boxes). |
| **Dilution** | Adding water or another substance that does not materially alter the product’s properties. |
| **Set/Kit Assembly** | Collecting goods to form sets, assortments, kits, or composite goods. |
| **Combinations** | Any combination of the above operations. |

> ⚠️ **Important:** If a good undergoes only minimal operations (e.g., repackaging), it does **not** qualify as originating in Ukraine for duty remission purposes.

---

### **4. Time Periods for Remission Eligibility**

| Type of Remission | Eligible Import Period |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Under Section 1 (Customs Tariff)** | From **June 9, 2022** to **June 9, 2026** |
| **Under Section 2 (Special Import Measures Act)** | Either:<br> - Imported between **June 9, 2022 and June 9, 2025**, or<br> - In **transit to Canada before June 10, 2025** |

> 🔁 The remission is **time-bound** and expires at the end of the specified period.

---

### **5. Claim Requirements**

- The **importer must submit a claim** for remission to the **Minister of Public Security and Emergency Preparedness** (not the Minister of Finance or Customs).
- Claim must be made **within two years** of the date of importation.
- Failure to file within this window will result in **loss of eligibility**.

> 💡 Note: This is a **mandatory claim process** — the importer cannot assume remission automatically.
