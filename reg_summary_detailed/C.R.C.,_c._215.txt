### 🌍 Scope of Application

- Applies to **milk produced in Ontario**.
- Also applies to **milk referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b) of the Act** that is produced in **Quebec** (i.e., milk from Quebec that is traded into Ontario).

> This means the regulation covers interprovincial trade between Ontario and Quebec, specifically when milk is shipped between these two provinces.

---

### ✅ Authority to Regulate Interprovincial Trade

Under subsection (2), the **Commission** and the **Commodity Board** are each authorized to regulate the marketing of milk in **interprovincial trade**, **provided** that:

1. Their powers are **limited** to:
   - Persons and property **situated within Ontario**, **except** those who ship milk **from Ontario to Quebec**.
   - Persons **situated in Quebec** who ship milk **from Quebec to Ontario**.

   > In other words, they can regulate the marketing of milk **within Ontario**, and **interprovincial trade**, but **not** the full scope of all milk movement between the provinces—only those involving persons or property located in Ontario or Quebec.

2. They may **exercise all or any powers** that they currently have under the Act and the Plan **in relation to local marketing within Ontario**, **as applied to interprovincial trade**.

   > This includes powers such as setting prices, establishing quotas, regulating distribution, and managing marketing plans.

3. **Exclusion of Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) Powers**  
   The authority granted to the Commission and Commodity Board **does not include** any powers exercised by the **Canadian Dairy Commission** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* in relation to interprovincial milk marketing.

   > This ensures that federal-level (CDC) oversight and policies remain distinct and separate from provincial regulatory powers.

### 💰 Levies and Charges (Commodity Board Powers)

The **Commodity Board** is authorized to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on milk or its components (e.g., fat, solids).
- **Collect** these levies from specific persons engaged in:
  - Production or marketing of milk.
  - Specifically, those described in **subsection 3(1)** of the Act (typically farmers, producers, or processors).

- **Classify persons into groups** (e.g., small farms vs. large dairies) and **set different levies or charges** for each group.

> This allows for targeted financial management based on producer size or type.

---

### 💵 Use of Levies and Charges

The funds collected (levies or charges) may be used **for the purposes of the Commodity Board**, including:

1. **Creation of reserves** (to buffer against price drops or market volatility).
2. **Payment of expenses and losses** arising from:
   - The sale or disposal of milk.
   - Market downturns or unexpected price fluctuations.
3. **Equalization or adjustment** of moneys realized from milk sales among producers.
   - This helps ensure that producers who earn more during a period are compensated to support those who earn less.

> This is a form of **producers' equity mechanism** to promote fairness and stability in the dairy sector.

---

### 🚫 Key Limitations and Exclusions

- **No power to regulate milk shipped from Ontario to Quebec** (in terms of the Commission or Commodity Board’s authority over such shipments).
- **No overlap with federal powers** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act*.
- Powers are **limited to persons and property in Ontario or Quebec**, with specific exceptions for interprovincial shipments.

---

### 📝 Legal and Practical Implications (Historical)

- This regulation was designed to **maintain provincial control** over milk marketing, especially during periods of market volatility.
- It allowed Ontario-based boards to **manage price stability, support producers, and manage risk** in interprovincial trade.
- The **separation of powers** between provincial (Ontario) and federal (CDC) bodies ensured that federal policies did not override provincial interests.

### 🚨 Status: Repealed

> ❌ This regulation has been **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by **SOR/2001-16, section 7**.  
> This means:
> - It is **no longer in force**.
> - It does **not apply** to current milk marketing practices in Ontario or Quebec.
> - Any current regulatory framework governing interprovincial milk trade must be found in **current versions of the Milk Act, 1965**, or in **replaced or updated regulations** (such as those under the *Ontario Dairy Marketing Act* or modernized versions of the *Milk Act*).

### ✅ Conclusion

This regulation was a **historical framework** that granted the Ontario Commodity Board and Milk Commission **limited authority** to regulate interprovincial milk trade—particularly in pricing, levies, and producer support—while excluding federal oversight and respecting provincial boundaries.

However, due to **market changes, policy reforms, and the shift toward more market-driven models**, the regulation has been **repealed** and is **no longer applicable**.
