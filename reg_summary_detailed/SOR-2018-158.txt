**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Spring Cisco (Coregonus sp.) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulatory instrument, titled the *Critical Habitat of the Spring Cisco (Coregonus sp.) Order*, is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is Canada’s primary legislation for the protection and recovery of wildlife species at risk. The Act was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) and is further amended by subsequent legislation, including the 2015 amendments (S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60).

The Spring Cisco (*Coregonus sp.*), a species of freshwater fish, is officially designated as **endangered** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA. This classification reflects the species’ small population size, limited geographic range, and significant threats to its survival.

---

**2. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

A formal **recovery strategy** for the Spring Cisco was developed to outline the actions necessary for the species’ recovery. This strategy includes the identification of **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery. The critical habitat identified in this strategy has been formally **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to information about the species’ protected areas.

The critical habitat is not only scientifically determined but also legally recognized as a component of SARA’s framework for species protection.

**3. Legal Basis for the Order**

This Order is issued by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**, who holds the statutory authority under **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the Species at Risk Act. These subsections empower the Minister to:

- Designate critical habitat for a species listed under SARA;
- Make a formal declaration of the specific geographic areas that constitute the critical habitat;
- Ensure that such designation is based on scientific evidence and recovery planning.

Subsection **58(1)** of SARA explicitly applies to the critical habitat of the Spring Cisco, confirming that the areas designated in this Order are legally protected under the Act.

**4. Key Provision: Exclusion from Prohibited Areas**

A significant legal condition in the Order is that **no portion of the designated critical habitat lies within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA. Subsection 58(2)(b) of the Act generally prohibits the use of certain areas (such as those designated as critical habitat) for activities that could harm the species or its habitat—**unless those areas are located in a place where such use is permitted under other provisions**.

By affirming that the critical habitat of the Spring Cisco is **not located in any area prohibited under subsection 58(2)(b)**, the Order confirms that the designated areas are not subject to undue restrictions or conflicts with other land-use designations. This ensures that the critical habitat is protected without being inadvertently excluded due to overlapping land-use regulations.

**5. Content and Effect of the Order**

- The Order **formally designates specific geographic areas** as critical habitat for the Spring Cisco (*Coregonus sp.*).
- These areas are identified in an **annexed map or description** (not included in this summary but referenced in the original document).
- The designation is based on scientific and ecological data from the recovery strategy.
- The critical habitat is legally protected under SARA, meaning that **prohibited activities** (such as development, pollution, or habitat destruction) are restricted in these areas.
- The Order does **not** extend to other species or areas unless specifically included.

---

**6. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government (in this case, July 3, 2018). This means that the legal protections begin immediately upon official registration, ensuring timely enforcement and implementation.

---

**7. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Provide **legal protection** to the essential habitats required for the survival and recovery of the endangered Spring Cisco;
- Support the **recovery strategy** by ensuring that the most ecologically important areas are preserved;
- Promote **ecological integrity** in freshwater ecosystems where the species occurs;
- Enhance **conservation planning** and environmental decision-making by clearly defining protected areas.

This Order represents a key step in Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the implementation of SARA’s mandate to prevent extinction and promote recovery of at-risk species.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Spring Cisco (Coregonus sp.) Order* is a legally binding, science-based designation that protects essential habitat for an endangered fish species. Issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans under SARA, it reflects the integration of scientific recovery planning with legal enforcement. By clearly identifying and protecting critical habitat—while confirming its exclusion from prohibited zones—the Order strengthens the long-term viability of the Spring Cisco and contributes to broader conservation goals in Canada’s freshwater ecosystems.
