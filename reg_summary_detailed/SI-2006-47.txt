**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Text:**

> *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, hereby, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)a of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, transfers from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to the Minister of Canadian Heritage the control and supervision of the portion of the federal public administration known as the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, and S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207 orders that the Minister of Canadian Heritage shall preside over the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, effective February 6, 2006.*

---

**1. Purpose and Context:**

This regulation establishes a formal transfer of administrative responsibility for the **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada (OIRSRC)** from the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** to the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.

The transfer is rooted in the recognition that the Office's mandate—specifically, the investigation, resolution, and reconciliation of the legacy of Indian residential schools—falls under the broader domain of **cultural heritage, Indigenous rights, and reconciliation**, which are core responsibilities of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

---

**2. Legal Authority:**

The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)a of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Act"). This provision allows the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign administrative responsibilities between federal ministers, provided that such a transfer serves the public interest and aligns with the structure and objectives of federal governance.

Additionally, the regulation cites **Section 207 of the Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22** (S.C. 2003, c. 22), which is the **Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement Act**. This section specifically provides the legal framework for the establishment and operation of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada and includes provisions that affirm the Minister of Canadian Heritage’s role in presiding over the Office.

**3. Key Elements of the Transfer:**

- **Transfer of Control and Supervision**: The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness relinquishes all authority, oversight, and administrative control over the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada.
- **Assumption of Responsibility**: The Minister of Canadian Heritage assumes full control, supervision, and operational leadership of the Office.
- **Presiding Role**: The Minister of Canadian Heritage is formally designated as the **presiding officer** of the Office, meaning they are responsible for setting strategic direction, ensuring accountability, and overseeing the implementation of the Office’s mandate.

---

**4. Effective Date:**

The transfer and the assignment of presiding responsibilities take effect on **February 6, 2006**.

---

**5. Significance and Implications:**

- **Reconciliation and Indigenous Rights**: The move reflects a shift in federal policy priorities, placing Indigenous reconciliation—particularly related to the legacy of residential schools—within the purview of cultural and heritage policy rather than public safety or emergency management.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: By placing the Office under the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the government ensures that the Office operates within a framework that emphasizes cultural sensitivity, truth-telling, and the rights of Indigenous peoples.
- **Alignment with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)**: Although the TRC was established later (in 2008), this transfer laid the groundwork for a federal commitment to addressing the harms caused by residential schools through dedicated, culturally appropriate institutions.

---

**6. Historical Background:**

The Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada was created as part of the **Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA)**, signed in 2006 between the Government of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, the Canadian Indian Brotherhood, and other Indigenous organizations. The Office was tasked with:

- Investigating the history and impacts of residential schools;
- Coordinating the implementation of the settlement agreement;
- Supporting the development of a national framework for reconciliation;
- Ensuring accountability and transparency in the resolution process.

This transfer ensured that the Office would be led by a minister with a strong mandate in cultural policy and Indigenous relations.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative and policy shift in the Canadian government’s approach to Indigenous reconciliation. By transferring the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the federal government formally recognized the cultural and historical dimensions of the residential school system and committed to a more holistic, rights-based, and culturally grounded process of truth-telling and healing.

It is a foundational step in Canada’s broader reconciliation journey and underscores the importance of placing Indigenous issues within the appropriate ministerial and policy framework.

**Note**: While the regulation is dated 2006, its provisions remain relevant and are often referenced in subsequent policy developments, including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action and ongoing reconciliation initiatives.
