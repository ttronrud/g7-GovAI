**Detailed Summary of the Investigation Drugs, Placebos and Emergency Drugs Remission Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Investigation Drugs, Placebos and Emergency Drugs Remission Order* (hereinafter referred to as the "Order") is a statutory instrument issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. The Order was enacted to promote public health and scientific advancement by providing a mechanism for the **remission (exemption) of customs duties** on specific types of pharmaceuticals used in medical research and emergency care.

The Order was published in the *Statutes Canada* as **S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4**, and may be cited as the *Investigation Drugs, Placebos and Emergency Drugs Remission Order*.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **facilitate the importation of investigational drugs, placebos, and emergency drugs** into Canada without the burden of customs duties. This supports:

- Clinical research and drug development (via investigation drugs and placebos),
- Rapid response to public health emergencies (via emergency drugs),
- The timely availability of new treatments for urgent medical conditions.

By reducing or eliminating customs duties, the Order encourages innovation in medicine and ensures that essential research and emergency medical supplies can be imported efficiently and affordably.

### **Definitions in the Order**

The Order defines three key categories of drugs:

1. **Emergency Drugs**  
   - Defined as *new drugs for emergency treatment* as specified in **Section C.08.010, Division 8 of the Food and Drug Regulations**.  
   - These are drugs intended for use in urgent or life-threatening situations where immediate treatment is required.  
   - In French: *drogue pour traitement d’urgence*

2. **Investigation Drugs**  
   - Defined as *new drugs* referred to in **Section C.08.005, Division 8 of the Food and Drug Regulations**.  
   - Includes **radio-pharmaceuticals** (drugs containing radioactive substances used in diagnostic or therapeutic procedures).  
   - In French: *drogue expérimentale*  
   - These are drugs used in clinical trials to evaluate safety, efficacy, or potential benefits.

3. **Placebos**  
   - Defined as *placebos imported with investigation drugs* for use in studies involving those drugs.  
   - Placebos are used in controlled clinical trials to serve as a comparison group to assess the true effect of an investigational drug.  
   - In French: *placebo*

> Note: The definition of "placebo" is specifically tied to the importation of investigation drugs, not standalone placebos.

### **Key Provision: Remission of Customs Duties**

Under **Section 3**, the Order grants **remission of customs duties** that would otherwise be payable under the **Customs Tariff** with respect to:

- Investigation drugs  
- Placebos (imported with investigation drugs)  
- Emergency drugs  

This means that importers are **not required to pay customs duties** on these specified drugs, provided they meet the conditions outlined below.

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following three conditions:

1. **Date of Importation**  
   - The investigation drugs, placebos, or emergency drugs must be **imported on or after January 1, 1985**.  
   - This establishes a clear time frame for eligibility, ensuring the policy applies only to drugs introduced after a defined threshold date.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   - A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date of importation.  
   - This creates a strict deadline to ensure accountability and prevent indefinite delays in processing claims.  
   - Failure to file within this period results in the loss of remission eligibility.

3. **Compliance with Reporting Requirements**  
   - Any person claiming remission must provide **such reports and information as the Minister of National Revenue may require** for the administration and oversight of the Order.  
   - This ensures transparency, traceability, and proper monitoring of the use of remitted drugs.  
   - Required information may include documentation related to the drug’s purpose, study design, importation records, and use in research or emergency settings.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is authorized under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations for the administration of financial matters, including customs duties, when it is in the **public interest**. The Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board recommended the Order, indicating that the policy aligns with broader government objectives related to public health, scientific progress, and economic efficiency.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Supports Medical Research**: By removing customs barriers, the Order enables researchers and institutions to import investigational drugs and placebos without financial constraints, accelerating clinical trials and drug development.
- **Improves Emergency Response**: Emergency drugs can be imported quickly and cost-effectively, enhancing Canada’s capacity to respond to public health crises.
- **Encourages Innovation**: The policy fosters innovation in pharmaceuticals by reducing the financial risk associated with importing new and experimental treatments.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: The requirement for timely claims and reporting ensures that the remission is used appropriately and not abused, maintaining the integrity of the customs and health regulatory systems.

---

### **Limitations and Scope**

- The remission **does not apply to all drugs**—only those specifically defined as investigation drugs, placebos, or emergency drugs under the Food and Drug Regulations.
- The policy is **time-bound** (post-January 1, 1985), so older imports are excluded.
- It applies **only to imports into Canada**, and does not cover exports or domestic distribution.
- The Order does **not exempt** drugs from other regulatory requirements (e.g., approval under the Food and Drug Regulations), only from customs duties.

### **Conclusion**

The *Investigation Drugs, Placebos and Emergency Drugs Remission Order* is a targeted, health-oriented regulatory measure designed to support medical research and emergency preparedness by exempting specific pharmaceuticals from customs duties. It strikes a balance between promoting public health innovation and maintaining fiscal and administrative accountability through clear eligibility criteria, time limits, and reporting obligations.

This Order remains a relevant example of how Canadian regulatory frameworks can be used to support scientific advancement while ensuring compliance with financial and administrative standards.
