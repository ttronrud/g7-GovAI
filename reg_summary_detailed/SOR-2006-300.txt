- **Subsections 266(1)a, (3)a, and (6)a** of the Act  
- **Subsection 463(1)b** of the Act

#### **2. Key Definitions and Provisions**

##### **(A) Prescribed Percentage of Voting Rights – Paragraph 266(1)(f) of the Act**
- For the purpose of **paragraph 266(1)(f)** of the Act, which governs the voting rights of shareholders in a cooperative credit association:
  - The **prescribed percentage of voting rights** attached to **all outstanding shares** is **10%**.
- This means that any shareholder holding **10% or more** of the outstanding voting shares is considered a **significant shareholder** under this provision.
- This threshold is used to determine when a shareholder’s actions (e.g., share purchases, voting, or information access) may trigger regulatory scrutiny or civil liability, especially in relation to insider trading or conflicts of interest.

> ✅ *Purpose:* To define a clear threshold for significant influence in a cooperative credit association, enabling regulators to monitor and regulate the activities of major shareholders.

##### **(B) Definition of "Take-Over Bid" – Subsection 266(3) of the Act**
- A **"take-over bid"** is defined as a take-over bid under **any legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule** to these regulations.
- The Schedule includes various provincial and federal securities acts that define "take-over bid" in different jurisdictions (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, etc.).
- This ensures that the definition of a take-over bid is **consistent with the applicable securities legislation** in each province or territory.

> ✅ *Purpose:* To align the definition of a take-over bid in the Cooperative Credit Associations Act with the relevant securities laws across Canada, ensuring legal coherence and enforceability.

> 🔍 *Examples of referenced acts:*
> - *Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5* (Ontario)

##### **(C) Prescribed Circumstances for Insider Trading – Paragraph 266(6)(c) of the Act**
This provision outlines specific **exemptions or justifications** for insider trading by insiders (e.g., directors, officers, or key employees) who purchase or sell securities **after acquiring confidential information**.

The following circumstances are **exempt** from being considered insider trading:

1. **Pursuant to a specific unsolicited order to purchase or sell**  
   - The insider acted as an agent based on a direct, unsolicited instruction from a third party (e.g., a client or investor) to buy or sell shares.  
   - This is considered legitimate trading activity, not insider trading, because the order was not derived from confidential information.

2. **Pursuant to participation in an automatic dividend reinvestment plan, share purchase plan, or similar automatic plan**  
   - The insider entered into such a plan **before** acquiring the confidential information.  
   - Example: A plan that automatically purchases shares when dividends are paid.  
   - This is exempt because the transaction was initiated prior to the breach of confidentiality.

3. **To fulfill a legally binding obligation entered into before acquisition of confidential information**  
   - Example: A contract or agreement that requires the insider to buy or sell shares at a specific time.  
   - If the obligation existed **before** the insider learned of confidential information, the transaction is not considered insider trading.

4. **Purchased or sold as agent or trustee in the circumstances described in (b) or (c)**  
   - This is a catch-all clause that allows for transactions made in an agent or trustee capacity under the same conditions as (b) or (c).

> ✅ *Purpose:* To provide **legitimate exceptions** to insider trading rules, protecting individuals who act in good faith and under pre-existing contractual or automated arrangements.

> 🚫 *Contrast:* If an insider trades based on confidential information **without** one of these justifications, it may constitute a violation of civil remedies and could lead to penalties or claims.

#### **3. Regulatory Effect and Commencement**
