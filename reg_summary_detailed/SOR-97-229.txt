**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Regulations Exempting Certain Precursors and Controlled Substances from the Application of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation was issued under **paragraph 55(1)(z)** of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA)*, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Health) to exempt certain substances from the provisions of the Act.

**Primary Purpose:**  
To **exempt specific substances** from the strict regulatory controls imposed by the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*, thereby facilitating their lawful use in authorized medical, industrial, or scientific contexts—without requiring full compliance with the Act’s licensing, reporting, or possession restrictions.

### **Key Provisions and Exempted Substances**

The following substances are explicitly listed as being **exempt from the application of the CDSA**:

1. **Bezitramide**  
   - Chemical name: *1-(3-cyano-3,3-diphenyl-propyl)-4-(2-oxo-3-propionyl-1-benzimidazolinyl)-piperidine*  
   - This compound was previously subject to control under the CDSA due to its potential for abuse or use in illicit drug production.  
   - **Status:** Exempted from the Act’s controls.  
   - **Note:** This exemption was **repealed** by **SOR/2003-35, section 1**, and **SOR/2000-218, section 1**, meaning the exemption no longer applies as of those dates.

2. **Piritramide**  
   - Chemical name: *1-(3-cyano-3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-(1-piperidino)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid amide*  
   - Includes its **salts, derivatives, and salts of derivatives**.  
   - This substance was also under control due to its pharmacological properties and potential for misuse.  
   - **Status:** Exempted under the original regulation.  
   - **Note:** This exemption was **fully repealed** by:  
     - *SOR/2003-35, section 1*  
     - *SOR/2000-218, section 1*  
     - *SOR/2003-35, section 2*  
     - *SOR/2000-218, section 2*  
     - *SOR/2002-360, section 1*  
   → Therefore, **the exemption is no longer valid**.

3. **Propylhexedrine**  
   - Chemical name: *1-cyclohexyl-2-methylaminopropane*  
   - Includes **any salt thereof**.  
   - This substance was used historically in over-the-counter decongestants and stimulants.  
   - **Status:** Exempted from CDSA controls.  
   - **Note:** This exemption was **repealed** by:  
     - *SOR/2003-35, section 3*  
     - *SOR/2002-360, section 2*  
   → Hence, **the exemption is no longer in effect**.

### **Historical Context and Timeline**

- **Original Enactment:**  
  The regulation was introduced on **May 14, 1997**, under **S.C. 1996, c. 19** (Statutes of Canada, 1996, Chapter 19).  
  It came into force on the date the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* came into force—**May 14, 1997**.

- **Repeal Timeline:**  
  The exemption provisions were progressively **repealed** through successive statutory instruments (SORs – Statutory Orders):  
  - *SOR/2000-218* (repealed key sections related to Piritramide and Propylhexedrine)  
  - *SOR/2002-360* (further repealed provisions)  
  - *SOR/2003-35* (comprehensive repeal of all exemptions for Bezitramide, Piritramide, and Propylhexedrine)  

- **Final Status (as of current law):**  
  **All exemptions listed in this regulation have been repealed.**  
  As a result, **none of the substances (Bezitramide, Piritramide, or Propylhexedrine) are currently exempt** from the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*.  
  They are now subject to the full scope of the Act, including restrictions on possession, manufacture, distribution, and use.

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Repeal Indicates Policy Shift:**  
  The repeal of these exemptions reflects a broader regulatory shift in Canada’s approach to controlled substances—increasing control over substances with potential for misuse, even if they were previously considered for medical or industrial use.

- **Public Health and Safety Focus:**  
  The removal of exemptions aligns with public health objectives to reduce diversion, abuse, and illicit production of substances with stimulant or psychoactive properties.

- **Regulatory Clarity:**  
  By repealing these exemptions, the government ensures legal clarity and consistent enforcement of drug control laws, reducing ambiguity in the application of the CDSA.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation, originally intended to exempt **Bezitramide, Piritramide, and Propylhexedrine** from the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*, has been **fully repealed** through subsequent statutory orders. As of the date of the repeals (primarily 2000–2003), **these substances are no longer exempt** and are now fully regulated under the CDSA.  

Therefore, **the regulation is not currently in force** and does not apply to any of the listed substances in Canada’s current drug control framework.
