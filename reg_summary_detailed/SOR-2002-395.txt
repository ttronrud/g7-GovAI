## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the CCRFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**  
*Enacted under S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1); pursuant to S.C. 1997, c. 36*  
*Based on the Canada–Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement (CCRFTA)*

---

### 🔍 **Overview**

The **CCRFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** establish the criteria under which goods can be deemed "originating" for tariff treatment under the **Canada–Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement (CCRFTA)**. These rules determine whether a product qualifies for preferential tariff treatment—such as reduced or zero tariffs—when traded between Canada and Costa Rica.

Originating goods are those that meet specific production and material requirements, ensuring that trade benefits are only granted to products substantially produced within the CCRFTA territory (Canada or Costa Rica).

## ✅ **When Does a Good Originate?**

A good originates in the territory of a CCRFTA country if it meets **one or more** of the following conditions:

---

### 1. **Automatic Origin (No Production Requirement)**  
Goods originate **automatically** if they are:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mineral or non-living natural resources** | Extracted in or taken from the territory of Canada or Costa Rica |
| **Vegetables** | Harvested in the territory |
| **Live animals** | Born and raised entirely in the territory |
| **Goods from live animals** | Obtained from live animals raised in the territory |
| **Hunting/fishing products** | Obtained from hunting or fishing in the territory |
| **Marine life** | Fish, shellfish, or marine life taken from sea/seabed/subsoil **outside** CCRFTA territory by a vessel: <br> - Registered/recorded/listed with a CCRFTA country, or <br> - Leased by a CCRFTA company, or <br> - Not exceeding 15 tons gross tonnage and licensed by a CCRFTA country |
| **Production on factory ships** | Goods produced on board a factory ship (from marine life) if the ship is registered/leased by a CCRFTA entity and flies its flag |
| **Seabed/subsoil extraction** | Goods extracted from continental shelf or EEZ (or beyond) by a CCRFTA-registered vessel flying its flag |
| **Outer space goods** | Obtained by a CCRFTA country/person and not processed outside CCRFTA territories |
| **Waste/scrap** | Derived from production or used goods collected in the territory, and is fit only for raw material recovery |
| **Produced from originating materials** | Produced entirely in the territory from originating materials (e.g., from minerals, plants, animals) or their derivatives at any stage |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These goods do **not** require a change in tariff classification or regional value content to qualify as originating.

---

### 2. **Change in Tariff Classification + Regional Value Content Requirement**

A good originates if:

- Each **non-originating material** used in its production undergoes an **applicable change in tariff classification** due to production in the CCRFTA territory; **AND**
- The applicable rule in **Schedule I** specifies:
  - Only a change in tariff classification (and all other requirements are met), **OR**
  - Both a change in tariff classification **and** a regional value-content requirement (and all other requirements are met)

> This means that even if some materials are imported, the final product must be classified differently in the HS than the raw inputs.

---

### 3. **Produced Entirely from Originating Materials**

A good originates if:

- It is produced **entirely** in the territory of one or both CCRFTA countries;
- **Exclusively** from **originating materials** (i.e., materials that themselves qualify as originating).

> This is the highest standard of origin—no non-originating materials are used.

---

### 4. **General Rule for Goods (with Exceptions)**

For most goods (excluding Chapters 39, 50–63), a good originates if:

| Requirement | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ✅ Production | Entirely produced in the territory of one or both CCRFTA countries |
| ✅ Non-originating materials | Either: <br> - Do **not** undergo a change in tariff classification (same heading/subheading, and not subdivided), **OR** <br> - Undergo an applicable change in classification |
| ✅ Regional value content | Must meet minimum threshold: <br> - **35%** if transaction value method is used <br> - **25%** if net cost method is used <br> *(unless Schedule I specifies a different threshold)* |
| ✅ All other requirements | The good must satisfy all other applicable requirements |

> 🔍 **How to determine heading/subheading match?**  
> Use **General Rules for Interpretation of the Harmonized System** and relevant **Chapter Notes**.

---

### 5. **10% Rule (for Non-Change in Classification)**

If non-originating materials do **not** undergo a change in tariff classification (same heading/subheading), the good originates **provided**:

- The **value** of those non-originating materials ≤ **10%** of the **transaction value** of the good, **adjusted to F.O.B. basis**  
- **AND** the good satisfies all other requirements

> ⚠️ **Important**: If the good has a regional value-content requirement, the value of those non-originating materials **must be included** in the regional value content calculation.

> ❗ **Exception**: This rule **does not apply** to non-originating materials used in goods from **Chapters 1–21**, unless the material is in a **different subheading** than the good.

---

### 6. **Special Rule for Fibres/Yarns in Chapters 50–63**

For goods in **Chapters 50 through 63** (e.g., textiles, apparel):

- If certain **fibres or yarns** used in the component determining tariff classification **do not undergo a change in classification**, the
