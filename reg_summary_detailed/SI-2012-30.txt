### **Detailed Summary of the Criminal Rules of the Ontario Court of Justice (2012)**

The **Criminal Rules of the Ontario Court of Justice**, approved on **March 22, 2012**, and coming into force on **July 1, 2012**, are a comprehensive set of procedural guidelines governing how criminal proceedings are conducted in the Ontario Court of Justice. These rules were made under **subsections 482(2) and 482.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Canada)** and are issued by the Ontario Court of Justice with the advice and concurrence of the Executive Council.

They are designed to ensure that all criminal proceedings are conducted **justly and efficiently**, reflecting both legal principles and practical considerations in the administration of justice.

## **1. Fundamental Objective (Rule 1.1)**

The central goal of these rules is to ensure that **proceedings in the Ontario Court of Justice are just and efficient**. This objective encompasses several key elements:

- **Fair treatment of prosecution and defence**: Ensuring both sides are treated equally and have adequate opportunity to present their cases.
- **Recognition of the rights of the accused**, including rights under the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* (e.g., right to a fair trial, protection against unreasonable search or seizure, right to counsel).
- **Recognition of the interests of witnesses**, including their ability to testify without undue burden or risk.
- **Efficient scheduling and decision-making**, taking into account:
  - The **gravity of the alleged offence** (e.g., seriousness of the crime);
  - The **complexity of the issues** involved;
  - The **severity of consequences** for the accused and others affected;
  - The **interactions with other legal proceedings** (e.g., civil claims, appeals).

> **Key Principle**: Every party—counsel, paralegals, agents, and litigants—must act in accordance with this fundamental objective and comply with these rules, practice directions, and any orders made by the Court.

> The Court must **take this objective into account** when exercising any power under the rules or interpreting or applying any rule or practice direction.
