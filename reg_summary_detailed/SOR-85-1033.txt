The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: **SOR/2017-84, section 1**
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of SOR/2017-84, which was issued on **March 21, 2017**.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The specific regulation referenced was previously a rule or provision under a prior statute or regulatory framework (though the original content is not provided in your query). The fact that it is listed multiple times as "Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1" suggests it may have been a rule that was either:
  - A standalone regulation,
  - A section of a broader regulation,
  - Or a provision that was part of a regulatory framework that was consolidated or replaced.

- **Reason for Repeal**: The repeal was likely part of a broader regulatory modernization, streamlining, or correction effort. Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
  - Obsolescence (no longer relevant to current practices),
  - Inconsistency with newer laws or policies,
  - Redundancy or overlap with other regulations,
  - Errors or ambiguity in the original text,
  - Alignment with updated statutory or administrative frameworks.

- **Legal Consequence of Repeal**: Once repealed, the regulation no longer has legal force. Any action or requirement previously governed by it is no longer enforceable or applicable. Entities subject to the regulation must now comply with the current, surviving provisions.

- **Where to Find the Repeal**: The repeal is formally recorded in the **Supplemental Regulations (SOR/2017-84)**, specifically under **section 1**, which identifies the provisions being removed. This is a standard mechanism in Canadian regulatory law for updating or removing outdated rules.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. It was removed by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, effective March 21, 2017. There is no active legal or operational content associated with this regulation today. Any references to it in legal or administrative contexts should be treated as outdated or obsolete.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Without the original text or context (e.g., which statute or regulatory framework it belonged to), a more detailed summary of its original scope or impact cannot be provided. For full context, one would need to consult the original regulation or the explanatory notes in SOR/2017-84.

If you can provide the name of the original regulation or the statute it was part of, I can offer a more targeted and detailed summary.
