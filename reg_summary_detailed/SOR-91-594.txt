## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Regulations**

### 🔹 **Overview and Background**
These regulations were promulgated under **subsection 75(1)** of the *Plant Breeders’ Rights Act*, following a public consultation process under **subsection 75(2)**. A draft version was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 20, 1991**, allowing interested parties to submit written representations to the Minister of Agriculture. Based on this input and recommendations from the Minister and the Treasury Board, the Governor in Council formally enacted the regulations.

The regulations establish the procedural, substantive, and administrative framework governing the **grant, maintenance, transfer, and enforcement of plant breeders’ rights in Canada**. They apply to plant varieties falling within specific categories listed in **Schedule I**.

> ⚠️ **Note on Repeals**: Several provisions have since been repealed:
> - "Recently prescribed category" (SOR/2017-94, s.12)
> - Criteria for "common knowledge" (SOR/2012-286, s.42)
> - Other sections (e.g., SOR/2012-286, s.43; SOR/94-750, s.10)
>  
> These indicate that the regulations have evolved, and current implementation may differ from this 1991 version. However, this summary reflects the original 1991 text as provided.

## 🔍 Key Definitions and Interpretations

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Description** | A narrative that defines the characteristics of a plant variety to demonstrate it is new. |
| **Identifiable Characteristics** | Features of a plant variety that allow clear distinction from all other varieties in its category. When included in a description, they ensure the variety is uniquely identifiable. |
| **Representations** | Refers to written submissions made to the Minister or Commissioner. |
| **Act** | Short for *Plant Breeders’ Rights Act*. |

---

## 🌿 Scope of Application

- The regulations apply to **any plant variety belonging to a category listed in Schedule I**.
- These categories typically include crops such as vegetables, fruits, ornamental plants, and woody plants (e.g., trees, shrubs), depending on the classification at the time of enactment.

> 🔁 **Note**: The "recently prescribed category" was repealed in 2017, suggesting that the regulatory framework has been updated to reflect current crop classifications.

---

## 📚 Criteria for "Common Knowledge" (Repealed)

Originally, the regulations defined when a plant variety was considered to be of "common knowledge" under **paragraph 4(2)(a)** of the Act:
1. The variety is already being **cultivated or exploited commercially**.
2. The variety is described in a **publicly accessible publication**.

> ⚠️ This provision was **repealed in 2012 (SOR/2012-286, s.42)**. As such, it no longer governs the assessment of novelty.

## ⏳ Timeframes for Applications and Sales

The **period for which the requirement of a sale or concurrence in a sale outside Canada applies** is defined differently based on the category of plant:

| Category | Period Begins |
|--------|---------------|
| **Woody plants (including rootstocks)** | Six years before the date the Commissioner receives the application |
| **All other categories** | Four years before the date the Commissioner receives the application |

> This provision ensures that the origin of commercial activity is tracked for novelty and non-obviousness assessments.
