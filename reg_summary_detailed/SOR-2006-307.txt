**Detailed Summary of the Going-Private Transaction (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulations are issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This authority is derived from specific provisions in the **Bank Act**:

- **Section 2** of the Bank Act — which defines a "going-private transaction."
- **Subsection 978(1)b** of the Bank Act — which provides the legal basis for regulating such transactions.

These regulations are formally enacted under:
- **L.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 1(2)** — the legislative enabling clause.
- **L.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 135** — the provision authorizing the regulation.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 40** — the foundational statutory framework (likely the Bank Act or related legislation).

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **define and regulate "going-private transactions"** involving banks and bank holding companies. Specifically, the regulations aim to:

- Prevent the **unauthorized termination** of the rights of holders of participating securities in a bank or bank holding company.
- Ensure that **holders are not deprived of their rights** (such as earnings participation and asset-sharing rights) without fair compensation or substitution.
- Protect investors by maintaining **proportionality and fairness** in transactions that could otherwise result in the loss of participation rights.

### **3. Definition of a "Going-Private Transaction"**

A **going-private transaction** is defined as:

> *An amalgamation or other transaction involving a distributing bank or a distributing bank holding company, other than an acquisition of shares under section 284 of the Act, that results in the interest of a holder of participating securities of the bank or bank holding company being terminated without the consent of the holder and without the substitution of an interest of equivalent value in participating securities of the bank or bank holding company or of another bank or another bank holding company that succeeds to the business of the bank or the bank holding company, which participating securities have rights and privileges that are equal to or greater than the affected participating securities.*

#### Key Elements of the Definition:

- **Scope**: Applies to **amalgamations or other transactions** involving a **distributing bank** or **distributing bank holding company**.
- **Exclusion**: Does **not apply** to **acquisitions of shares under section 284 of the Bank Act** (which governs certain share purchases, typically involving the transfer of ownership).
- **Core Requirement**: The transaction must result in the **termination of a holder’s interest** in participating securities **without consent**.
- **No Substitution**: There must be **no substitution** of the holder’s interest with:
  - A new interest of **equivalent value** in participating securities of the same or another bank/bank holding company, or
  - A participating security in a successor entity that **succeeds to the business** of the original bank or holding company.
- **Rights Requirement**: The substituted or affected securities must have **rights and privileges equal to or greater than** those of the original participating securities.

> In simpler terms: If a bank or holding company is restructured (e.g., merged or sold) in a way that removes a shareholder’s right to earnings or assets without their agreement and without replacing that right with a comparable one in another entity, it constitutes a going-private transaction.

### **4. Definition of "Participating Securities"**

These are securities that confer **economic rights** on holders, particularly in the context of earnings and liquidation.

#### For a **bank or bank holding company** (excluding federal credit unions):

- **Rights include**:
  - A right to **share in the earnings** of the bank or holding company.
  - A right to **share in assets** after liquidation, dissolution, or winding up.

> This means that if a shareholder owns participating securities, they are entitled to a share of profits and, in the event of closure, a share of the remaining assets.

#### For a **federal credit union**:

- "Participating securities" refers to **securities of the federal credit union**.

> Note: Federal credit unions are treated differently under this regulation due to their unique structure and regulatory oversight.

### **5. Regulatory Effect and Enforcement**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., when officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- The regulations **do not create new obligations** beyond defining what constitutes a going-private transaction.
- They serve as a **definitional tool** to ensure that transactions falling under the scope of the Bank Act are properly assessed and potentially subject to further regulatory scrutiny (e.g., approval, disclosure, or consent requirements).
- The definition helps regulators and financial institutions determine whether a transaction requires **additional review or approval**, especially under the broader framework of the Bank Act.

### **6. Regulatory Significance and Implications**

- **Investor Protection**: The rules prevent the **unfair erosion of shareholder rights** in mergers or restructuring.
- **Transparency and Fairness**: Ensures that any change in ownership or structure does not leave investors with diminished rights without compensation.
- **Compliance Tool**: Provides a clear legal benchmark for banks and holding companies to assess proposed transactions to avoid triggering regulatory scrutiny or legal challenges.
- **Alignment with Bank Act Principles**: Reinforces the Bank Act’s commitment to **financial stability, transparency, and investor protection** in the banking sector.

### **Conclusion**

The *Going-Private Transaction (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* provide a precise, legally grounded definition of when a transaction involving a bank or bank holding company constitutes a "going-private transaction." By focusing on the **termination of participating securities rights without consent or fair substitution**, the regulations protect the interests of shareholders and ensure that any restructuring of banking entities is conducted fairly and transparently. These rules are essential for maintaining trust in the banking system and ensuring compliance with investor protection standards under the Bank Act.

**Note**: While these regulations define what constitutes a going-private transaction, they do not themselves impose penalties or require approval — such enforcement mechanisms are typically governed by other provisions of the Bank Act or by regulatory policy. The definition serves as a foundational element for regulatory oversight.
