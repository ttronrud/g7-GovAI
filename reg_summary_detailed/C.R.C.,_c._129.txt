- **All producers and producer graders** must pay an **additional levy of $0.005 per dozen eggs sold**.
- This levy applies **in addition to any service charges** already set out in the official marketing *Plan*.
- The levy is a **mandatory contribution** to the Commodity Board, designed to fund marketing, quality control, and market development initiatives.

- When a **processor purchases eggs from a producer**, they must:
  - **Deduct the applicable levy** ($0.005 per dozen) from the total payment due to the producer.
  - **Pay the full amount of the levy** to the Commodity Board **not later than Wednesday of the week following the week in which the eggs were purchased**.
- The processor is responsible for ensuring timely and accurate payment.

#### **3. Levy Payment by Producers and Producer Graders (Direct Sales)**
- If a **producer or producer grader sells eggs directly to a consumer, retailer, or other non-processor**, they must:
  - Pay the levy **not later than Wednesday of the week following the week in which the eggs were sold**.
- This ensures that all sales channels—whether direct or through processors—contribute to the levy system.
