| **Non-Service Transactions** | Entering into any business transaction (e.g., purchasing goods, real estate, investments) with a client unrelated to immigration services. |
| **Intimate Personal Relationships** | Having an intimate personal relationship (e.g., romantic, familial) with a client or former client within **one year** of the service agreement’s completion or termination — unless the client is the licensee’s spouse at the time of service or has cohabited with the licensee for at least one year prior. |

> ⚠️ **Exception**: A client may consent to such transactions **only if**:
> - The transaction is fair and reasonable; and
