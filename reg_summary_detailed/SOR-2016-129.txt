**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Regulations Identifying the Provisions of the Laws of the Legislature of Yukon Conferring Rights of Access for the Purpose of the Exercise of a Mineral Right  
**Legal Authority:**  
- Paragraph 78(f)a of the *Yukon Surface Rights Board Act*  
- Made under the authority of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development  
- Statutory Citation: S.C. 2002, c. 7, s. 271; S.C. 1994, c. 43  

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation serves to formally identify and list the specific provisions of Yukon’s legislative laws that confer rights of access—specifically, rights to use or enter onto surface land—for the purpose of exercising a mineral right (such as mining, exploration, or extraction activities).  

The regulation is directly tied to **Section 65 of the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act**, which requires the Board to determine which existing laws of the Yukon Legislature provide surface access rights that may be relevant to mineral operations. By identifying these legal provisions, the regulation ensures clarity, consistency, and legal certainty in how surface rights are interpreted and applied in the context of mineral development.

**Key Components of the Regulation:**

1. **Identification of Relevant Legislative Provisions:**  
   - The *Schedule* to the regulation contains a detailed list of statutes and sections from the Yukon Legislature that grant or recognize rights of access to surface land.  
   - These provisions are specifically those that allow individuals, companies, or entities to access surface land for the purpose of carrying out mineral exploration, development, or extraction activities.  
   - The list includes laws related to land use, land tenure, surface rights, and access rights, such as:
     - Land titles and surface rights legislation  
     - Access rights granted under land-use bylaws or provincial statutes  
     - Rights granted through land grants or agreements  
     - Provisions related to Indigenous land rights or access agreements  

2. **Scope and Application:**  
   - The identified provisions are intended to be used by the Yukon Surface Rights Board when assessing surface access rights in mineral rights disputes or applications.  
   - This helps ensure that decisions made by the Board are grounded in clear, documented legal authority.  
   - It provides a standardized reference to prevent inconsistent interpretations of surface access rights across different mineral projects or jurisdictions.

3. **Legal Authority and Process:**  
   - The regulation is made under the authority of paragraph 78(f)a of the *Yukon Surface Rights Board Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to issue regulations to define the scope of rights and access relevant to mineral operations.  
   - The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is responsible for recommending the regulation, reflecting the importance of Indigenous land rights and access in Yukon’s legal and cultural context.  

4. **Effective Date:**  
   - The regulations come into force on the day they are officially registered in the *Statutes of the Yukon* (i.e., published in the Yukon Government Gazette).  
   - This ensures that the identified legal provisions become operative immediately upon formal adoption, allowing the Surface Rights Board to apply them in its operations without delay.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Clarity and Legal Certainty:** Provides a clear, legally binding list of which Yukon laws confer surface access rights, reducing ambiguity in mineral development planning and legal disputes.  
- **Support for Fair and Transparent Decision-Making:** Enables the Surface Rights Board to evaluate access rights based on well-defined statutory foundations, promoting fairness and consistency.  
- **Recognition of Indigenous and Community Rights:** By incorporating relevant access provisions, the regulation acknowledges that Indigenous communities and land users may have legal or customary rights to access land, which must be considered in mineral development.  
- **Alignment with Broader Resource Governance Frameworks:** Supports Yukon’s broader policy goals of balancing economic development (mining) with environmental protection, community interests, and Indigenous rights.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a foundational tool for the Yukon Surface Rights Board in managing surface access rights in the context of mineral rights. By formally identifying the relevant legislative provisions, it strengthens legal transparency, ensures compliance with Yukon law, and supports equitable access to land for mineral activities while respecting existing rights and interests—particularly those of Indigenous peoples and local communities.  

It is a critical component of Yukon’s regulatory framework for responsible and rights-based resource development.
