### **Detailed Summary of the Greenwood Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Greenwood Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of official rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada to ensure the safe operation of Greenwood Airport by restricting land use and development in its vicinity. These regulations were enacted after a public consultation process and are designed to prevent hazards to aviation—particularly those arising from terrain, structures, or environmental features—that could interfere with aircraft take-offs, landings, or flight paths.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The regulations are made pursuant to **subsection 5.5(1)a** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which allows for the publication of proposed zoning regulations. The final adoption follows **paragraph 5.4(2)(b)a**, which empowers the Minister of National Defence to issue regulations to protect airport safety.

- **Purpose**:  
  To prevent any development or natural growth on lands adjacent to or near Greenwood Airport that might compromise the safe operation of aircraft. This includes:
  - Structures or objects exceeding certain elevation limits.
  - Environmental hazards such as bird attractants or open water bodies.

---

## **2. Scope and Application**

### **Applicable Area**
- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Greenwood Airport**, including public road allowances.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part VII of the schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are currently part of the airport itself (e.g., runways, taxiways, terminal areas) are **not subject** to these zoning restrictions.

### **Key Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Greenwood Airport, located near the Village of Greenwood and the Town of Kingston, Nova Scotia. |
| **Airport Zoning Reference Point (AZRP)** | A fixed point used as a datum for elevation measurements. Located at the intersection of the centerline of runway 13–31 and the westerly end of the strip for runway 13. Coordinates: Northing 4,982,711.68 m; Easting 5,465,850.41 m (Nova Scotia Grid). |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area along each runway, designated for take-off and landing. Three strips exist: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 13–31 | 300 m wide (150 m on each side), 2,554.7 m long |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 08–26 | 300 m wide (150 m on each side), 2,552.4 m long |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Runway 01–19 | 150 m wide (75 m on each side), 1,330.7 m long |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip to protect aircraft during approach. Different slopes apply depending on runway. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the sides of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface. Slope: 1 m vertical to 7 m horizontal. |
| **Outer Surface** | A common imaginary plane at **45 meters above the AZRP elevation**, except where it would fall below **9 meters above ground level**—in such cases, it is set at 9 m above ground. |

> ⚠️ **Elevation Reference**:  
> The AZRP is set at **25 meters above sea level**, so the outer surface is at **70 meters above sea level** (25 + 45), unless terrain is too low.

---

## **3. Height Restrictions**

No person may:
- Construct or erect any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing ones), or
- Permit **natural growth** (e.g., trees, hills, vegetation),  
such that the **highest point exceeds** any of the following surfaces:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> These surfaces are carefully designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during approach and departure, minimizing risk from obstacles.

---

## **4. Environmental Restrictions (Bird Hazard Mitigation)**

To reduce bird strikes—a major aviation hazard—owners or lessees of affected lands are prohibited from using the land for:

- Sanitary landfills  
- Food garbage disposal sites  
- Sewage lagoons  
- Open water storage reservoirs  

These types of sites attract birds and increase the risk of bird strikes during flight operations.

## **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

### **Approach Surfaces (by Runway)**

Each approach surface begins with an **initial slope** (1:60 vertical to horizontal) from the end of the strip, rising to intersect with the outer surface. After that, the slope changes to **1:50** (except for runways 01 and 19, which use **1:40**) and continues to a horizontal line at a specified distance and elevation.

| Runway | Initial Slope | Final Horizontal Line Distance | Height Above Strip End |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 13 | 1:60 → 1:50 | 15,000 m horizontal, 2,400 m from centerline | 291 m |
| 31 | 1:60 → 1:50 | 15,000 m horizontal, 2,400 m from centerline | 291.6 m |
| 08 | 1:60 → 1:50 | 15,000 m horizontal, 2,400 m from centerline | 291.2 m |
| 26 | 1:60 → 1:50 | 15,000 m horizontal, 2,400 m from centerline | 291.2 m |
| 01 | 1:40 → horizontal | 3,000 m horizontal, 525 m from centerline | 75 m |
| 19 | 1:40 → horizontal | 3,000 m horizontal, 525 m from centerline | 75 m |

> These surfaces are drawn on **Public Works Canada Zoning Plan No. S-1750**, dated November 15, 1988.

### **Transitional Surfaces**

- Extend **from the lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surfaces.
- Slope at **1:7** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Rise until they intersect with the **outer surface** or the transitional surface of an adjacent runway strip.
- Designed to prevent obstructions from appearing at the edges of runways.

---

### **Outer Surface**

- A **constant elevation plane** at **45 meters above the AZRP (25 m ASL = 70 m ASL)**.
- **Exception**: If the ground is lower than 9 meters, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.
- The outer surface is defined by a complex **series of arcs and straight lines**, forming a closed boundary around the airport.
- It is constructed using:
  - Circles of **4,000 m radius** centered at midpoints of runway ends.
  - Specific azimuths and distances (e.g., 59°09′40″, 79°08′50″, etc.) to define the path of the arcs.
  - The entire boundary is referenced to the **Nova Scotia 3° MTM Coordinate System**, with central meridian at 64°30′W.

> The outer limits are fully illustrated in **Public Works Canada Zoning Plan No. S-1750**.

## **6. Public Consultation and Legal Process**

- The proposed regulations were **published twice** in:
  - The *Kentville Adviser* (May 9 and 16, 1995)
  - The *Canada Gazette, Part I* (April 23 and 30, 1994)
- This allowed **interested parties** (residents, developers, environmental groups, etc.) to submit **representations or objections** to the Minister of National Defence.
- After review, the Minister recommended the regulations, and the Governor General in Council approved them.

---

## **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of National Defence**.
- Violations may result in penalties, including:
  - Orders to remove or modify structures or features.
  - Fines or legal action.
- Compliance is monitored through land-use planning, zoning inspections, and environmental assessments.

---

## **8. Map and Reference Materials**

All geometric definitions and boundaries are based on the **Public Works Canada Greenwood Airport Zoning Plan No. S-1750**, dated **November 15, 1988**. This plan provides:
- Coordinates and azimuths
- Descriptions of surfaces
- Visual representations of strips, approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and outer limits

All distances and directions are **grid-referenced** to the **Nova Scotia 3° MTM system**, adjusted to July 1, 1979.
