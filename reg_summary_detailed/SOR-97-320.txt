### **3. Scope of the Quantity Limits**

#### **Tariff Item 0703.10.92 – Specific Fruit (e.g., Citrus or Other Specific Fruits)**
- **Product**: Goods under tariff item **0703.10.92**, which generally refers to **certain fruits** (e.g., citrus fruits, specific tropical fruits) that are eligible for preferential tariff treatment from Chile.
- **Limit Type**: A **single product quantity limit**.
- **Applicable Period**: The limit applies for the period specified in **Column 1 of Item 1 of the Schedule**.
- **Limit Amount**: The **applicable quantity limit** (as defined in **Column 2 of Item 1**) applies to the total amount of goods of this tariff item that can be imported from Chile during that period.

> **Note**: This is a **per-item limit** — meaning the total volume of goods under 0703.10.92 from Chile cannot exceed the specified amount during the designated period.

---

#### **Tariff Items 0810.10.11 and 0810.10.92 – Vegetables (e.g., Carrots, Potatoes, etc.)**
- **Products**:
  - **0810.10.11**: Certain vegetables (e.g., carrots, beets, parsnips)
  - **0810.10.92**: Other vegetables (e.g., onions, garlic, or similar)
- **Limit Type**: An **aggregate quantity limit** — meaning the **combined total** of goods from both tariff items is capped.
- **Applicable Period**: As specified in **Column 1 of Item 2 of the Schedule**.
- **Limit Amount**: The **aggregate quantity limit** (as defined in **Column 2 of Item 2**) applies to the total volume of goods under both 0810.10.11 and 0810.10.92 from Chile during that period.

> **Note**: This is a **combined limit** — the sum of both items cannot exceed the stated cap.

### **4. Schedule of Periods and Limits**
The Order specifies **six-year periods** with corresponding quantity limits. The schedule is repeated twice (likely a typographical or formatting error), but the actual periods are:

| Period | Start Date | End Date |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | July 5, 1997 | December 31, 1997 |
| 2 | January 1, 1998 | December 31, 1998 |
| 3 | January 1, 1999 | December 31, 1999 |
| 4 | January 1, 2000 | December 31, 2000 |
| 5 | January 1, 2001 | December 31, 2001 |
| 6 | January 1, 2002 | December 31, 2002 |

> **Observation**: The schedule appears to be duplicated — the same six periods are listed twice. This may be an error in the original document, possibly due to formatting or publication issues. The content is otherwise consistent.

---

### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day that Section 51 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 14) comes into effect.
- **Actual effective date**: **July 5, 1997** (as noted in the [Note] section).
- This aligns with the start of the first period (July 5, 1997 – December 31, 1997).

---

### **6. Key Regulatory Implications**
- **Importers from Chile** must ensure that their shipments of the specified fruits and vegetables do not exceed the prescribed quantity limits for each period.
- The limits are **binding and enforceable** under Canadian customs law.
- Exceeding the limits may result in **non-compliance**, leading to potential **rejection of shipments**, **fines**, or **loss of preferential tariff treatment**.
- The limits are **not per shipment**, but **aggregate over time** — meaning the total volume of goods from Chile under these tariff items must not exceed the cap during the specified period.
- The limits are **not cumulative across years** — each period is independent.

---

### **7. Context within the CCFTA**
This Order is part of a broader set of **market access and safeguard measures** included in the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement. While the agreement aims to reduce trade barriers and increase market access, it also includes **safeguards** to protect domestic producers from sudden or excessive imports.

This particular Order reflects a **temporary, time-bound mechanism** to manage the volume of specific agricultural imports from Chile, particularly those that may be competitive with Canadian domestic production.

---

### **8. Conclusion**
This regulation establishes **time-limited, aggregate quantity caps** on specific fruit and vegetable imports from Chile under the CCFTA. It applies to:
- **Tariff item 0703.10.92** (single product limit)
- **Tariff items 0810.10.11 and 0810.10.92** (combined aggregate limit)

These limits are in effect from **July 5, 1997, through December 31, 2002**, in six-year increments. The Order ensures that Canadian producers are not overwhelmed by large volumes of imports and helps maintain a balanced and sustainable agricultural market.

> **Note**: The duplication of the schedule is likely a formatting error and does not alter the substantive content.
