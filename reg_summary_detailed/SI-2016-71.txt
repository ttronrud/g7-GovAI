---

### 🔹 **3. Scope of Application**

> These are the primary federal social security programs in Canada.

- **Basic Old-Age Insurance for Urban and Rural Residents**

> These are China’s main pension schemes for employed and non-employed populations.

  - Any person who is **subject to the legislation** of either country (by employment, self-employment, or residence).
  - Any person who **derives rights** from such a person under either country’s legislation.

> This includes spouses, common-law partners, and dependants living with the individual.

### 🔹 **4. Key Principles and Rules on Jurisdiction**

#### 📌 **Rule 1: Employment in a Contracting State**
> An employed person working in the territory of a Contracting State is subject **only** to the legislation of that State.

#### 📌 **Rule 2: Self-Employed Persons**
> A self-employed person residing in one country and working in the other (or both) is subject **only** to the legislation of the **first** Contracting State where they reside.

> This ensures that self-employed individuals are not subject to overlapping obligations.

#### 📌 **Rule 3: Detachments (Temporary Assignments)**
> A person employed in one country and sent to work temporarily in the other is subject **only** to the legislation of the **home country** (where the employer is based), **as if the work were performed in that country's territory**.

- **Maximum duration**: **72 months (6 years)**.
- If the assignment extends beyond 72 months, the original country’s legislation continues to apply **only if both competent authorities agree**.

> This protects workers from being subject to the foreign country’s pension rules during temporary assignments.

#### 📌 **Rule 4: Crew Members**
> A person employed as a crew member on a ship or aircraft is subject **only** to the legislation of the Contracting State where they **reside**.

> This avoids conflicting pension claims based on location of employment.

#### 📌 **Rule 5: Government Employees**
> A person in government employment in one country who is sent to work in the other country is subject **only** to the legislation of their **home country**.

> Applies both ways:
- Chinese government employees sent to Canada → subject to Chinese legislation.
- Canadian government employees sent to China → subject to Canadian legislation.

> Ensures consistency in public sector employment protections.

### 🔹 **5. Reciprocity and Recognition of Residency for Pension Purposes**

#### ✅ **For Canadian Pension Benefits**:
If a person:
- Is employed or self-employed in China and makes **contributions to the CPP or provincial pension plans**,
- Then that period of residence in China is considered a **period of residence in Canada**.

> This applies to:
- The person themselves.
- Their **spouse or common-law partner**.
- Their **dependants** (children, parents, etc.) who live with them and are **not covered** by employment-based social security in China.

> This enables **accumulation of pension credits** in Canada for those who work in China.

#### ✅ **For Chinese Pension Benefits**:
If a person:
- Is employed in Canada and makes **mandatory contributions** under China’s social insurance system,
- Then that period in Canada is considered a **period of residence in China**.

> This allows Chinese citizens working in Canada to **build pension credits** in China.

> ⚠️ **Key Condition**: The person must make **mandatory contributions** (i.e., via employment or self-employment), not just be present.
