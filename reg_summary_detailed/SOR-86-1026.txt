**Detailed Summary of the Ferry Cable Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1230**

---

### **Overview**

The *Ferry Cable Regulations*, 2024 (C.R.C., c. 1230), were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **paragraphs 28(a) and (b)** and **section 29 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA)**. These regulations **revoke the previous Ferry Cable Regulations** and establish a new, updated set of rules governing the installation, operation, and maintenance of ferry cables in Canada’s navigable waters.

These regulations are designed to ensure **safety of navigation**, **prevent interference with vessel traffic**, and **protect the integrity of navigable waterways** by establishing clear standards for ferry cable operations.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (CNWA), the primary legislation governing the protection and use of navigable waters.
- **Down**: A ferry cable is considered "down" when it is **resting on the bed of a navigable water**.
- **Raised**: A ferry cable is considered "raised" when it is **not resting on the bed** of the water — i.e., it is suspended above the bottom.

These definitions are critical for determining operational conditions and lighting requirements.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Approval Requirement for Installation and Operation**
- **No person may lay, stretch, or maintain a ferry cable across, over, in, or under any navigable water** without first obtaining **prior approval from the Minister of Transport**.
- This ensures that all ferry cable projects undergo a formal review process before being implemented.

#### **2. Criteria for Ministerial Approval**
The Minister may approve a ferry cable plan only if:
- The operation of the cable will **not interfere with the safety of navigation** on the waterway; and  
- The vessel used to operate the ferry cable **meets the requirements** set out in the *Canada Shipping Act* (e.g., safety, structural, and operational standards).

This dual requirement emphasizes both **safety and compliance with national shipping standards**.

#### **3. Required Information in Approved Plans**
Plans submitted for approval must include the following detailed information:
- **Name of the navigable water**, proposed location, and depth of water at the site.
- **Type of operations** (e.g., passenger transport, freight, seasonal service).
- **Specifications and description** of the ferry cable (material, strength, length, anchoring system, etc.).
- **Lighting and signaling plans** for the on-shore terminal ends of the cable.
- **Proposed hours of operation** and **schedule of crossings**.
- If the cable operates seasonally, the **specific period of operation** must be included.

This comprehensive planning requirement ensures transparency, safety, and predictability in ferry cable operations.

#### **4. Lighting and Visibility Requirements**
The owner of a ferry cable must:
- Install **a red light and a green light at each on-shore terminal end** of the cable, ensuring they are clearly visible from **any direction** from a vessel approaching the cable.
- **Illuminate the red light when the cable is in the "raised" position** (i.e., suspended above the water).
- **Illuminate the green light when the cable is in the "down" position** (i.e., resting on the bed).
- Maintain **continuous illumination (24 hours a day)** to indicate the current status of the cable.

> ⚠️ **Purpose**: These lights serve as a critical navigational aid to prevent vessels from colliding with the cable. The color coding (red = raised, green = down) provides immediate visual cues to mariners.

#### **5. Seasonal Operation Exception**
If the Minister has approved the ferry cable for **seasonal use**, then the approval and compliance requirements under section 3(1) (i.e., the need for plan approval and lighting) **do not apply outside the approved operational period**.

> This allows flexibility for temporary or seasonal ferry services (e.g., during winter months or tourist seasons), reducing unnecessary regulatory burden during off-seasons.

#### **6. Operational Compliance**
- The ferry cable must be operated **strictly in accordance with the approved plans** approved by the Minister.
- This includes adherence to schedules, operational hours, and safety protocols.

#### **7. Maintenance Requirement**
- The ferry cable must be **maintained in the "down" position** when not in use.
- This reduces the risk of accidental vessel contact and ensures the cable is not exposed or suspended during inactive periods.

#### **8. Vessel Navigation Restrictions**
- **No person in charge of a vessel may navigate across a ferry cable when the red lights are illuminated** at either terminal end.
- This rule directly protects vessels from approaching a raised cable, which poses a significant collision risk.

#### **9. Responsibility of the Operator**
- The owner must maintain a **responsible person on duty** who is **capable of operating the ferry cable safely** at all times.
- This ensures continuous oversight and immediate response to emergencies or operational changes.

### **Enforcement and Penalties**

- Any violation of these regulations is an **offence punishable on summary conviction**.
- Penalties include:
  - A **fine of up to $500**, or  
  - **Imprisonment for up to six months**, or  
  - **Both a fine and imprisonment**.

These penalties are designed to deter non-compliance and reinforce the importance of safety and regulatory adherence.

---

### **Key Objectives and Rationale**

1. **Navigation Safety**  
   The primary goal is to prevent accidents involving vessels and ferry cables by ensuring clear visibility, proper signaling, and safe operational practices.

2. **Regulatory Clarity**  
   The regulations provide a standardized, transparent framework for all ferry cable operations, reducing ambiguity and legal risk.

3. **Environmental and Infrastructure Protection**  
   By requiring approval and proper planning, the regulations help prevent damage to navigable waters, ecosystems, and existing infrastructure.

4. **Flexibility with Seasonal Use**  
   The inclusion of seasonal operation provisions allows for practical, cost-effective ferry services without imposing unnecessary restrictions year-round.

5. **Compliance with Federal Shipping Standards**  
   Linking ferry operations to the *Canada Shipping Act* ensures that all ferry vessels meet national safety and operational benchmarks.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Ferry Cable Regulations* represent a modern, safety-focused regulatory framework that balances the practical needs of ferry operations with the imperative to protect maritime safety and navigable waters. By requiring detailed planning, clear signaling, and strict operational controls, the regulations ensure that ferry cables do not become hazards to navigation. They also provide a clear pathway for seasonal or temporary services while maintaining high safety standards.

These regulations are a key component of Canada’s broader effort to manage and protect its navigable waterways under the *Navigable Waters Protection Act*, ensuring that infrastructure development proceeds in a safe, lawful, and environmentally responsible manner.

✅ **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**:
- All ferry cable projects require **Ministerial approval**.
- **Lighting must be visible and correctly illuminated** based on cable position (red = raised, green = down).
- **No vessel may cross when red lights are on**.
- **Seasonal operations** are permitted with reduced compliance during off-seasons.
- **Violations carry significant penalties** — enforceable through summary conviction.

This regulation reflects a strong commitment to **maritime safety, regulatory accountability, and sustainable use of Canada’s waterways**.
