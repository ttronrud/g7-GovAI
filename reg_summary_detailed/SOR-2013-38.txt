**Detailed Summary of the Yukon Borrowing Limits Regulations**

---

### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
The Yukon Borrowing Limits Regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(5)a of the Yukon Act**.  
- **Statutory Reference**: S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 216(2); S.C. 2002, c. 7  
- This regulation establishes the legal framework for defining what constitutes "borrowing" by the Government of Yukon under the Yukon Act, particularly in relation to borrowing limits and financial disclosure requirements.

---

### **2. Definition of "Government"**
In these regulations, the term **"government"** refers to the **Government Reporting Entity (GRE)** as defined in the *CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook*, as amended from time to time.  
- This ensures consistency with public sector financial reporting standards and aligns Yukon’s borrowing rules with nationally recognized accounting practices.

### **3. What Constitutes Borrowing (Under Subsections 23(2) and (4) of the Yukon Act)**

The regulation defines several types of financial obligations or liabilities that are **deemed to constitute borrowing**, even if they are not traditional loans. These are subject to borrowing limits and disclosure requirements.

#### **(a) Loans Received by Government**
- Any **loan of money** received by the government — including loans raised through the issuance and sale of:
  - Bonds  
  - Debentures  
  - Notes  
  - Any other form of evidence of indebtedness  
- The **value of the obligation** is calculated as:
  - The **sum of outstanding principal and accrued interest**, *unless* it is a **discount bond**, in which case:
    - The value is the **principal repayable at maturity**.
- **Exclusion**: The value **excludes** any amount held in a **custodial account** that:
  - Is outside the government’s control  
  - Is deposited regularly as required by a loan agreement for repayment  
  *(This prevents double-counting or overstatement of borrowing when funds are held in escrow or third-party accounts.)*

#### **(b) Capital Leases**
- A **capital lease** entered into by the government is considered borrowing **if**:
  - The value of the obligation (as determined under paragraph 3(b)) **exceeds the threshold for disclosure** required in the **Yukon Public Accounts**.
- The value is calculated in accordance with the **CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook**, as amended.
- This means that even if the lease is structured as a rental agreement, if the lease effectively transfers ownership or has a long-term obligation, it may be treated as a borrowing obligation.

#### **(c) Sale-Leaseback Transactions**
- A **sale-leaseback** transaction is considered to create a liability if:
  - The government **acquires a tangible capital asset** (e.g., property, equipment) through a sale and then leases it back.
- The **value of the liability** is determined in accordance with the **CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook**, as amended.
- This ensures that the financial impact of such transactions — where the government sells an asset and then leases it back — is properly captured in borrowing calculations.

#### **(d) Loan Guarantees**
- A **contingent liability** arising from a **loan guarantee** provided by the government is considered borrowing **if**:
  - The full amount of the contingent liability is to be **disclosed in the Yukon Public Accounts**.
- The value of the contingent liability is the **full amount disclosed**, not a portion or estimated amount.

### **4. Exclusion: Internal Government Transactions**
- **No borrowing is deemed to occur** when a transaction takes place **between two parties within the government** (e.g., between departments or agencies).
- This exclusion ensures that internal transfers, inter-departmental funding, or internal financing arrangements do not count toward the borrowing limit or require disclosure under the borrowing rules.

---

### **5. Purpose and Application**
These regulations apply specifically to:
- **Subsections 23(2) and (4) of the Yukon Act**, which govern:
  - The **maximum borrowing limits** allowed by the government
  - The **disclosure requirements** for borrowing in the Yukon Public Accounts
- The definitions provided ensure that borrowing is measured consistently and transparently, aligning with financial accountability standards.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The regulations come into force on the day that **Division 4 of Part 4 of the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act** comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.
- **Note**: These regulations were in force as of **March 8, 2013** (see SI/2013-25).

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Ensures all significant financial obligations — including leases, guarantees, and internal transactions — are clearly defined and disclosed. |
| **Accountability** | Prevents underreporting of borrowing by treating capital leases and guarantees as borrowing when they meet disclosure thresholds. |
| **Consistency with Accounting Standards** | Uses the CPA Canada Public Sector Accounting Handbook to ensure uniformity in measuring values. |
| **Prevention of Over-Reliance on Internal Transactions** | Excludes internal government transfers from borrowing limits, focusing on external financial obligations. |
| **Financial Discipline** | Helps the government stay within legally defined borrowing limits, supporting fiscal responsibility. |

### **Conclusion**

The Yukon Borrowing Limits Regulations provide a **clear, standardized, and transparent definition of what constitutes borrowing** by the Government of Yukon. By including not only traditional loans but also capital leases, sale-leasebacks, and loan guarantees, the regulations ensure that the government's financial obligations are fully captured for both **budgetary control** and **public accountability**. The use of established accounting standards (CPA Canada) enhances credibility and consistency. The exclusion of internal government transactions avoids double-counting and ensures that borrowing limits reflect actual external financial commitments.

These rules are essential for maintaining fiscal discipline and ensuring that the public can understand and trust the government’s financial management.
