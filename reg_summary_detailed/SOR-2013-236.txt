**Detailed Summary of the Allocation Method Order (2014) – Softwood Lumber Products**

---

### **Overview**

The *Allocation Method Order (2014) – Softwood Lumber Products*, issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on **December 9, 2013**, establishes the method for allocating monthly export quotas of **softwood lumber products** from **Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan** to the United States under **paragraph 6.3(3)(a)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA). This Order applies specifically to the year **2014** and is based on historical export and production data from a reference period (November 1, 2010 – October 31, 2013).

The primary objective is to ensure **fair, transparent, and equitable distribution** of export quotas among primary producers and remanufacturers, while also maintaining **environmental and economic balance** in the Canadian softwood lumber sector.

## **Core Principles of the Allocation Method**

1. **Allocation Based on Historical Performance**
   - Export allocations are primarily determined by **historical export volumes** (for exporters) or **historical production volumes** (for producers with no export history).
   - This ensures that entities with a track record of exporting receive a fair share based on past behavior.

2. **Quota Distribution by Province**
   - Separate allocations are established for each province:
     - Ontario
     - Quebec
     - Manitoba
     - Saskatchewan
   - Each province has a fixed monthly export quota (the "quantity") that is distributed among eligible applicants.

3. **Eligibility and Relinquishment**
   - Any primary producer or remanufacturer may **relinquish** their export allocation for 2014 by notifying the Minister in writing by **December 9, 2013**.
   - Relinquished allocations are excluded from the total pool used in calculations.

4. **Transfers of Allocations**
   - A primary producer or remanufacturer may **transfer** a portion of their export allocation to another entity, **with Minister’s consent** under subsection 6.3(4) of the EIPA.
   - Such transfers are **only valid** if:
     - The transferred volume corresponds to a real product volume; or
     - The total volume transferred (including non-product volumes) does **not exceed 15%** of the original allocation.

> ⚠️ Note: Transfers are not automatically counted toward the transferee’s allocation — they are **deemed to belong to the original producer** in terms of export volume reporting.

## **Allocation Formulas by Province**

### **1. Ontario Quantity Allocation**

- **Base Allocation Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Ontario quantity}}{\text{Total historical export volume (Ontario)}} \right) \times \text{Producer's historical export volume}
  $$
  - Denominator excludes producers who relinquished their allocations.
  - Numerator is the producer’s historical export volume from Ontario to the U.S.

- **Remainder Allocation**:
  - After the base allocation is assigned, the **remaining Ontario quantity** is distributed **in order of receipt** of export permit applications.
  - Each applicant receives the amount they request until the remainder is fully allocated.
  - Applicants must **exhaust their initial allocation** before applying for the remainder.

> 📌 *Rule*: The base allocation is based on **historical export performance**; the remainder is distributed **on a first-come, first-served basis**.

### **2. Quebec Quantity Allocation**

Quebec allocation is more complex due to **dual criteria** (export volume vs. production volume) and a **reserve pool** mechanism to ensure minimum coverage.

#### A. **Remanufacturer Allocation (Based on Historical Export Volume)**

- Formula:
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Quebec quantity}}{\text{Total historical export volume (Quebec)}} \right) \times \text{Remanufacturer’s historical export volume}
  $$
  - Excludes producers who relinquished allocations.

- **Minimum Threshold Requirement**:
  - The **sum of all remanufacturers’ allocations** must be **at least 7.5% of the Quebec quantity**.
  - If not met, a **reserve pool** is created to cover the shortfall.

#### B. **Reserve Pool (Section 9)**

- Formula:
  $$
  \text{Reserve Pool} = \left( \text{Quebec quantity} - \text{Sum of remanufacturer allocations} \right) + \text{Shortfall to meet 7.5\% threshold}
  $$
  - The reserve pool is used to allocate additional volumes to **primary producers**.

#### C. **Primary Producer Allocation (Based on Historic Production Volume)**

- Formula:
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Reserve Pool}}{\text{Total production volume (by primary producers)}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s production volume (2010–2012)}
  $$
  - Only applies to primary producers who:
    - Did **not** export any products to the U.S. during the reference period, **OR**
    - Produced Quebec softwood lumber between **January 1, 2010 – December 31, 2012**.

- **Cap on Allocation**:
  - No primary producer can receive more than **40% of their average monthly production volume** (2010–2012) as an allocation.

> 🔍 *Key Rule*: Primary producers must choose between:
> - Receiving allocation based on **historic export volume** (if they exported in the past), or
> - Receiving allocation based on **historic production volume** (if they never exported).

> 📝 *Data Source*: Production volumes are based on records provided by the **Government of Quebec**, with the consent of the producer.

#### D. **Residual Non-Allocated Quantity (Section 11)**

- Formula:
  $$
  \text{Residual} = \text{Reserve Pool} - \text{Total allocated to primary producers}
  $$
  - This residual amount is **not distributed** and remains unallocated.

#### E. **Primary Producer Allocation (Based on Historic Export Volume)**

- Formula:
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Producer’s historical export volume}}{\text{Total historical export volume (by primary producers)}} \right) \times \text{Quebec quantity}
  $$
  - Excludes relinquished allocations.
  - Used only for producers who exported in the reference period.

> ⚖️ *Balance*: This allocation ensures that producers with export history are fairly rewarded, while the reserve pool ensures that even non-exporting producers get a fair share based on production.

### **3. Manitoba and Saskatchewan Quantity Allocations**

- **Formula** (identical in structure to Ontario):
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Province quantity}}{\text{Total historical export volume (province)}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s historical export volume}
  $$
  - Excludes producers who relinquished allocations.

- **Remainder Allocation**:
  - After the base allocation is assigned, the **remainder** is distributed **in order of application receipt**.
  - Applicants must **exhaust their base allocation** before applying for the remainder.

> ✅ *Simplified Process*: Manitoba and Saskatchewan follow the same rules as Ontario — **historical export volume
