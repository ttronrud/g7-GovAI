**Detailed Summary of the Windsor Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- The regulations are officially titled: **Windsor Airport Zoning Regulations**.
- They may be cited as such and are binding within the jurisdiction of the Province of Ontario.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Windsor Airport**, located in Windsor, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographical point used as a reference elevation for zoning and height control. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 606 feet above sea level** for all regulatory purposes. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface, **1,000 feet wide**, specifically designated for aircraft takeoff and landing in a particular direction (e.g., Runway 7-25). |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane that begins at the end of a strip and slopes upward from the strip’s end to a horizontal surface. The slope is defined by specific dimensions depending on the runway. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary flat plane centered on the ARP, located **150 feet above its elevation** (i.e., 606 + 150 = 756 feet above sea level). This surface serves as the baseline for height restrictions. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending outward from the outer edges of the strip and its approach surface, rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally) until it meets the horizontal surface or another transitional surface. |

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands**, including **public road allowances**, that are:
  - Adjacent to or in the **vicinity of Windsor Airport**.
  - More specifically described in **Part II of the Schedule**.

> This includes not only private property but also public roads and land buffers around the airport.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Erect or construct any building, structure, or object;
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object;

**If the highest point of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:**

#### **(a) Horizontal Surface**
- A defined perimeter line that forms a horizontal plane 150 feet above the ARP (i.e., 756 feet above sea level).
- The boundary of this surface is described in a detailed **legal description** (a compass traverse) starting from the **southerly angle of Lot 107** on Plan 1489 and proceeding through multiple intersections with roads, lot boundaries, and railway rights-of-way.
- It encircles key areas around the airport, including sections of Howard Avenue, Dougall Avenue, Stanley Street, Gladstone Avenue, Ypres Avenue, Walker Road, Tecumseh Road, Lauzon Road, and others.

#### **(b) Approach Surfaces**
- These are **inclined planes** extending from each end of certain runways:
  - **Runway 2-20 and 12-30**:
    - 500 feet wide on each side of the centerline at the strip ends.
    - Expands to 1,250 feet on each side at outer ends, which are **200 feet above the strip end elevation** and **10,000 feet horizontally** from the strip end.
  - **Runway 7-25**:
    - 500 feet wide at the ends.
    - Expands to **2,000 feet** on each side at outer ends (same 200 ft elevation and 10,000 ft horizontal distance).
- These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have clear visibility and unobstructed flight paths during approach and departure.

#### **(c) Transitional Surfaces**
- These are **inclined planes** rising from the outer lateral limits of the strips and their approach surfaces.
- Slope: **1 vertical foot per 7 horizontal feet** (1:7 ratio).
- Extend upward until they intersect the horizontal surface or another transitional surface.
- Designed to provide a smooth, gradual transition from the runway edge to the horizontal surface.

> All these surfaces are **illustrated and referenced** on **Plan No. 2586**, dated October 3, 1968, held in the Department of Transport in Ottawa.

---

### **5. Exception: Natural Growth**

- If a **natural object** (e.g., tree, bush, hill) on regulated land **exceeds the height** of any of the above surfaces:
  - The **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This provision allows for flexibility in dealing with natural features while still protecting aviation safety.

---

### **6. Specific Land Parcels Covered (Parcel A, B, C, D)**

The regulations specifically identify four parcels of land that fall under the zoning restrictions:

#### **Parcel A**
- Located in **Concessions 3 and 4**, **Township of Sandwich West**.
- Includes parts of farm lots (80–85), Lot 6, and various road allowances (Cabana Road, Howard Avenue, etc.).
- Defined by a detailed legal description starting at the **southerly angle of Lot 107 (Plan 1489)** and tracing through multiple road and lot boundaries.

#### **Parcel B**
- Located in **Concessions 5–9**, **Township of Sandwich South**.
- Includes parts of Lots 12–19, the West halves of several lots, and major road allowances.
- Also includes parts of **Talbot Road** and **North Talbot Road**.
- Defined by a complex compass traverse starting at the **eastern limit of a road allowance**.

> Note: The full descriptions of Parcels C and D are **not fully provided** in the excerpt given.

### **7. Regulatory Status and Revocation**

- The regulation was **originally enacted** but was **revoked** by **SOR/79-901, Section 1**.
- This means the **current version is no longer in force** as of the date of revocation.
- However, the summary provided appears to be a **historical or archived version** of the regulation, possibly preserved for reference or legal continuity.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The revocation indicates that **these regulations are no longer active**. Any current height or zoning restrictions at Windsor Airport would now be governed by **updated or replaced legislation**, possibly under the **Airport Operations Act**, **Zoning Bylaws**, or **Environmental Protection Regulations**.

---

### **8. Purpose and Intent**

The primary objectives of these regulations were:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Maintain clear flight paths** by limiting structures and natural features above specified elevation thresholds.
3. **Provide a legally defined, measurable boundary** for height control using precise geographic descriptions and elevation references.
4. **Allow flexibility** through the natural growth exception and ministerial direction.

### **9. Key Takeaways**

| Point | Summary |
|------|--------|
| ✅ **Applicability** | Applies to all lands adjacent to or near Windsor Airport, as defined in Part II of the Schedule. |
| ✅ **Height Limits** | Structures cannot exceed the elevation of the horizontal surface, approach surfaces, or transitional surfaces. |
| ✅ **Runway-Specific Surfaces** | Runways 7-25, 2-20, and 12-30 have different approach surface dimensions (especially 7-25 has the largest outer extent). |
| ✅ **Slope of Transition** | 1:7 ratio (1 ft vertical per 7 ft horizontal) ensures gradual rise from runway edges. |
| ✅ **Natural Features** | Trees or hills exceeding height limits can be removed by Minister’s direction. |
| ❌ **Revoked** | These regulations were **revoked by SOR/79-901**, meaning they are **no longer legally enforceable**. |

### **Conclusion**

While the **Windsor Airport Zoning Regulations** were historically significant in establishing **height and land-use controls** around the airport to protect aviation safety, they are **currently revoked**. As such:

- They **do not apply today**.
- Their detailed descriptions and legal boundaries may still be **relevant for historical, legal, or archival purposes**.
- Current zoning and aviation safety rules at Windsor Airport are likely governed by **more recent legislation**, including the **Airport Operations Act**, **Ontario Zoning Bylaws**, or **Transportation Safety Regulations**.

> 🔍 **Recommendation**: Any current land development or construction near Windsor Airport should be assessed under **up-to-date municipal or provincial regulations**, not this revoked 1968-era document.
