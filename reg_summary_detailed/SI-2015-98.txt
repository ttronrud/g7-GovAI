**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2014-146 (February 10, 2014):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2014-146, which had previously designated a different Minister as the appropriate Minister for The Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc. This repeal removes the prior designation and effectively nullifies the earlier administrative assignment.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs as the Appropriate Minister:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** as the **appropriate Minister** for **The Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc.** (commonly referred to as the "Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges Corporation").

   - This designation establishes the Minister as the principal federal government official responsible for overseeing the financial, administrative, and policy-related matters of the corporation.
   - As the appropriate Minister, the Minister has authority to:
     - Approve financial expenditures and budgets.
     - Provide policy direction and oversight.
     - Make decisions regarding the corporation’s operations, governance, and strategic planning.
     - Serve as the point of contact between the federal government and the corporation.

3. **Privy Council Membership:**  
   The regulation explicitly notes that the Minister is a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**. This is a formal recognition that the Minister has the necessary standing and authority to act in a ministerial capacity under the Financial Administration Act, particularly in matters involving Crown corporations.

---

**Purpose and Rationale:**

- The change in designation reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities in infrastructure management.
- The Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges are critical transportation infrastructure linking Montreal to the rest of Quebec and are vital to regional economic activity.
- By assigning oversight to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, the government ensures that the corporation’s operations are aligned with broader infrastructure policy goals, such as public safety, economic development, and long-term maintenance planning.
- This move also streamlines accountability and ensures that infrastructure projects are managed by a Minister with direct responsibility for transportation and community development.

---

**Implications:**

- **Administrative Clarity:** The designation provides clear governance structure for the corporation, reducing ambiguity in decision-making authority.
- **Policy Alignment:** The new Minister’s portfolio ensures that bridge operations and maintenance are integrated with broader infrastructure priorities.
- **Accountability:** The Minister is now formally accountable to Parliament for the financial and operational performance of the corporation.
- **Legal Continuity:** Despite the repeal of the prior Order, the corporation continues to operate under the same legal framework; only the responsible Minister has changed.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation, effective November 4, 2015, marks a significant administrative decision to reassign oversight of The Jacques-Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc. to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs. It removes outdated administrative provisions and establishes a current, coherent governance structure that aligns with the federal government’s infrastructure strategy. The change is grounded in statutory authority under the Financial Administration Act and reflects a commitment to efficient, accountable, and policy-aligned management of critical public infrastructure.
