### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **fee remission** (i.e., a reduction or cancellation of a fee) for certain export certificate fees in Canada, specifically for export certificates issued between **October 1, 2011, and September 30, 2013**. The remission is introduced because the collection of certain fees related to these certificates was deemed **unreasonable and unjust** by the Governor General in Council, based on recommendations from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Treasury Board.

### **Scope of the Remission**

The regulation applies to **the portion of the fee that exceeds $75.00** for specific export certificates issued during the specified time period.

#### **Applicable Fee Provisions (as referenced in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Fees Notice, Part 11):**
The remission covers fees paid or payable under any of the following provisions in the *Canadian Food Inspection Agency Fees Notice*:
- Paragraph 21(4)(a) or (6)(a)
- Subparagraph 21(6)(b)(i)
- Subitem 22(3) or (5)
- Subsection 23(2) or (5)
- Subsection 24(4) or (5)
- Subsection 25(3), (4), or (7)
- Subsection 26(3)
- Item 29 of the table in Part 11

These provisions relate to the fees associated with the issuance of **export certificates** for agricultural or animal products, such as meat, dairy, or other food items, which require inspection and certification before export.

---

### **Key Condition for Remission**

The remission **is only granted if**:
- The inspection that led to the issuance of the export certificate is conducted by an **accredited veterinarian**, as defined in **Section 2 of the Health of Animals Regulations**.

This ensures that the certification process maintains the required standards of animal health and food safety. The presence of an accredited veterinarian guarantees that the inspection meets regulatory requirements and that the export certificate is valid and trustworthy.

---

### **Effective Period**

The remission applies **only to export certificates issued during the period from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2013**.  
This time-bound scope indicates that the policy is a temporary measure to address concerns about fee fairness during that specific period.

---

### **Nature of the Remission**

- The remission **does not cancel the entire fee**; it only **removes the amount by which the fee exceeds $75.00**.
- For example, if a certificate fee was $100, the remission would reduce the amount payable to $25 (i.e., $100 – $75 = $25).
- Fees below or equal to $75.00 are **not subject to remission**.

---

### **Rationale and Policy Intent**

The government determined that collecting the full fees for export certificates during this period was **unreasonable and unjust**, likely due to:
- Economic hardship faced by small or medium-sized farms and exporters
- The fact that the fees were not directly tied to actual administrative or inspection costs
- A desire to support the agricultural sector during a time of economic uncertainty

By remitting the excess of fees above $75, the government aims to:
- Reduce the financial burden on exporters
- Promote fair and equitable access to international markets
- Maintain compliance with animal health and food safety standards through accredited inspections

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, time-limited measure to provide **financial relief** to exporters who obtained export certificates between October 1, 2011, and September 30, 2013, provided that the certification was based on an inspection by an accredited veterinarian. It reflects a policy decision to balance regulatory compliance with fairness and economic sustainability in the agricultural export sector.

It is important to note that this remission does not apply retroactively or beyond the specified period, nor does it extend to certificates issued outside the defined timeframe or to inspections conducted by non-accredited veterinarians.
