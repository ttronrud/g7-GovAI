### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg (Interprovincial) Pricing Regulations**

---

#### **Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are a formal legislative instrument issued under the **Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (FPMAA)**, specifically through the authority granted to the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency (CBHEMA)**. The agency was established by the *Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation* (SOR/87-40, 1987), which empowered it to implement a marketing plan for broiler hatching eggs.

The regulations in question were proposed under **paragraph 7(1)(d)** of the FPMAA, which allows for regulations of a class that are necessary to implement a marketing plan. This classification was confirmed by **section 2 of the Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order (C.R.C., c. 648)**.

The proposed regulations were submitted to the **National Farm Products Marketing Council (NFPMC)**, which reviewed them and **approved them on October 3, 1989**, finding them necessary for effective implementation of the marketing plan.

As a result, the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency** formally enacted these regulations on **October 20, 1989**, making them effective **December 1, 1989**.

These regulations are now known as the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg (Interprovincial) Pricing Regulations**.

#### **Key Definitions (with Note on Repeal)**

Several key terms were defined in the original text, but **all have been repealed** as of subsequent amendments:

- **Broiler hatching egg** – Repealed (SOR/2013-256, s. 1)  
- **Commodity Board** – Repealed (SOR/2013-256, s. 1)  
- **Hatchability** – Retained as a defined term  
- **Signatory provinces** – Repealed (SOR/2013-256, s. 1)  
- **Non-signatory provinces** – Repealed (SOR/2013-256, s. 1)  

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The repeal of these terms indicates that the regulatory framework has been modernized or replaced. The current system likely operates under a different structure or governance model. However, this summary reflects the *original content and intent* of the 1989 regulations as they existed at the time of enactment.

#### **Core Provisions: Minimum Price Requirements for Interprovincial Sales**

The regulations establish **minimum price thresholds** for the sale of broiler hatching eggs into **signatory provinces**, based on the province of origin and the mode of sale (intraprovincial or interprovincial). These rules aim to ensure fair pricing, protect producers, and prevent undercutting in interprovincial trade.

---

##### **1. Sales from Signatory Provinces to Other Signatory Provinces**

A person **shall not sell** broiler hatching eggs produced in a **signatory province** into another signatory province at a price **per dozen** that is less than the **sum of**:

- **Either**:
  - The **minimum price per dozen broiler hatching eggs** established in the province of production for intraprovincial trade (as set by the provincial Commodity Board), **or**
  - The **minimum price per saleable chick** established in the province of production, **multiplied by 12 times the hatchability** (i.e., the percentage of chicks that hatch from the eggs), **during the year prior to the year of sale**.

- **Plus**:
  - The **actual cost of transportation** from the vendor’s premises in the province of production to the purchaser’s premises in the destination signatory province.

> ✅ This ensures that interprovincial sales do not undercut intraprovincial prices and accounts for the cost of moving the eggs.

> 🔍 *Hatchability* is defined as the percentage of saleable chicks obtained from incubating broiler hatching eggs, as published annually by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in the *Hatchery Review*.

---

##### **2. Sales from Non-Signatory Provinces to Signatory Provinces**

A person **shall not sell** broiler hatching eggs produced in a **non-signatory province** into a signatory province at a price **per dozen** that is less than the **sum of**:

- **Either**:
  - The **average price per dozen broiler hatching eggs** charged by the seller in the province of production during the **four-week period immediately preceding the week of sale**, **or**
  - The **average price per saleable chick** charged during the same period, **multiplied by 12 times the hatchability** for the province of production (based on the year prior to the sale).

- **Plus**:
  - The **actual cost of transportation** from the vendor’s premises to the purchaser’s premises in the signatory province.

> ✅ This provision prevents sellers from pricing below market rates in the province of origin, even when selling to a different province.

> 📌 The use of **average price over a four-week window** reflects a more dynamic, market-based approach compared to fixed minimum prices.

---

##### **3. Special Provision for First-Time Sellers of Eggs from Non-Signatory Provinces**

If a person has **not previously sold broiler hatching eggs** produced in a non-signatory province **in intraprovincial trade** during the four-week period referenced above, then:

- They are **prohibited from selling** those eggs into a signatory province at a price **per dozen** that is less than the **sum of**:
  - The **market price per dozen broiler hatching eggs** (or per saleable chick, multiplied by 12 × hatchability) **payable at the time of sale** in the ordinary course of trade in the province of production (i.e., current market price).
  - The **actual transportation cost**.

> ✅ This rule protects new entrants or first-time sellers from being undercut by established sellers, ensuring they can enter the market at a fair price based on prevailing market conditions.

---

#### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Prevent Price Undercutting**  
   Ensures that eggs sold interprovincially are not priced below what is considered fair or sustainable in the province of origin.

2. **Protect Producers and Farmers**  
   Maintains stable and equitable returns for egg producers, especially in provinces with lower market access or weaker supply chains.

3. **Ensure Fair Competition**  
   Prevents dominant sellers from exploiting market gaps by offering artificially low prices to gain market share.

4. **Account for Transportation Costs**  
   Recognizes that shipping costs are a real and significant component of interprovincial trade and must be included in pricing.

5. **Use of Hatchability as a Quality Adjustment**  
   Adjusts pricing based on the actual viability of the eggs, ensuring that lower-hatchability eggs are not unfairly devalued.

#### **Important Observations and Contextual Notes**

- **Repeal of Key Terms**: The repeal of "signatory provinces," "non-signatory provinces," and the "Commodity Board" suggests that this regulatory framework is no longer in active use. The original structure may have been phased out due to:
  - Changes in agricultural policy
  - Shifts in market dynamics
  - The introduction of more flexible, market-driven pricing models
  - The broader modernization of Canadian agricultural marketing systems

- **Market-Based vs. Fixed Pricing**:  
  The regulations blend **fixed minimum prices** (for established producers) with **average market prices** (for new or variable sellers), reflecting a balance between stability and market responsiveness.

- **Time-Based Price References**:  
  The use of the **prior year’s hatchability** and **four-week average prices** ensures that pricing is tied to recent, relevant market data, reducing the risk of outdated or inaccurate benchmarks.

- **Geographic Scope**:  
  The rules apply only to **interprovincial trade**, not intraprovincial sales. This reflects a targeted approach to regulate trade between provinces where market competition is more intense.

#### **Conclusion**

The **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg (Interprovincial) Pricing Regulations (1989)** were a significant piece of agricultural policy designed to:

- Ensure fair and equitable pricing for broiler hatching eggs in interprovincial trade  
- Protect producers from being undercut by lower-priced sellers  
- Maintain market stability and transparency  
- Account for both product quality (hatchability) and logistics (transportation)

While the regulations were historically important in shaping the broiler egg market in Canada, they have since been **repealed or replaced** (as of 2013–2016), reflecting broader changes in agricultural regulation and market practices. Their original intent—ensuring fair pricing and protecting producer interests—remains relevant, but modern systems now likely rely on different mechanisms, such as voluntary pricing agreements, market monitoring, or digital pricing platforms.
