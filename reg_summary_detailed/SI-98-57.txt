### **Background and Context**

This proclamation was issued in recognition of the exceptional contributions made by **employees of the Canadian public service** during a period marked by several significant natural disasters in the early 1990s. The disasters included:

1. **The Saguenay Flood** – A major flood that occurred in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec.
2. **The Manitoba Flood** – A severe flooding event that impacted parts of Manitoba.
3. **The Ice Storm (Ontario and Quebec)** – A widespread ice storm that affected large areas of Ontario and Quebec, causing widespread power outages, infrastructure damage, and public safety concerns.

These events caused significant disruption to communities, with widespread damage to homes, roads, utilities, and public services. In response, public service employees—alongside members of the **Canadian Forces** and the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**—played a critical role in emergency response, recovery efforts, and providing essential services during and after the disasters.

1. **Formally recognize and acknowledge** the extraordinary service rendered by public service employees during these natural disasters.
2. **Highlight the dedication, professionalism, and efficiency** demonstrated by these employees in times of national crisis.
3. **Provide national-level recognition** of their contributions to the well-being and resilience of Canadian communities.
4. **Strengthen public appreciation** for the vital role of the public service in national emergency management and disaster recovery.

The proclamation emphasizes that the service provided by public servants was not only essential but also **outstanding**, and that such actions deserve formal and public acknowledgment at a national level.

- **Recognition of Service:**  
  The proclamation explicitly states that the service rendered by public service employees in responding to natural disasters is “worthy of recognition on a national basis.”

  - Dedication  
  - Professionalism  
  - Efficiency  
  - Commitment to serving Canadians

- **Collaborative Efforts:**  
  The proclamation notes that the success in responding to the disasters was not solely due to public service employees but also involved **members of the Canadian Forces and the RCMP**, underscoring the inter-agency cooperation essential in emergency response.

- **Formal Legal Weight:**  
  The document is issued as a **Proclamation**, which is a formal instrument of government under Canadian constitutional law. It carries legal and symbolic authority, making it binding on all Canadians and public institutions.

- **Public Notice Requirement:**

### **Significance and Impact**

1. **National Recognition:**  
   This was one of the first formal, high-level proclamations to publicly honor the work of public service employees during disaster response. It elevated the visibility of public servants beyond routine administrative functions and placed them in the context of national crisis management and community resilience.

2. **Cultural and Institutional Value:**  
   The proclamation serves as a historical and institutional record of how Canada values public service excellence, especially during emergencies. It helps reinforce a culture of service, accountability, and national unity.

3. **Inspiration for Future Policy:**  
   By publicly recognizing service in disaster response, the government may have laid the groundwork for future policies, awards, or programs that formally recognize public service contributions during emergencies.

4. **Symbolic Importance:**  
   The use of the Queen’s name and the formal structure of a royal proclamation reflects the constitutional monarchy’s role in recognizing national achievements, even as Canada has evolved toward a more modern, democratic form of governance.

### **Limitations and Contextual Notes**

- **Not a Legal Regulation or Policy Directive:**  
  This is **not a binding administrative regulation** or a rule that governs daily operations. It is a **symbolic and ceremonial proclamation** aimed at public appreciation and morale.

- **No Specific Awards or Mechanisms Mentioned:**  
  While the proclamation recognizes the service, it does **not specify any formal awards, bonuses, or benefits** that may follow. Any such recognition would likely be implemented through other government or public service mechanisms (e.g., commendations, medals, or internal honors).

- **Historical Context:**  
  The 1998 date places this proclamation in a period when Canada was still actively rebuilding after major natural disasters. It reflects a government response to public sentiment and the need to show appreciation for frontline workers during times of crisis.

### **Conclusion**

This proclamation is a **formal, constitutional expression of national gratitude** to public service employees who responded with professionalism and dedication during significant natural disasters in the 1990s. It underscores the importance of public service in national emergency response and reinforces the values of service, resilience, and unity that define Canadian society.

While it does not establish new legal obligations or administrative procedures, it serves as a powerful **symbolic gesture** that honors the often unsung contributions of public servants and strengthens public trust in the institutions that serve Canadians.

**In essence:**  
This is a **public recognition of service**, not a regulation. It celebrates the courage, competence, and commitment of public service workers during times of crisis and affirms their vital role in Canada’s national well-being.
