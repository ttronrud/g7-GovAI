**Detailed Summary of the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2020)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The Order is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, under **subsection 117.14(1)a of the Criminal Code** (R.S.C., c. C-46). This provision allows for the declaration of an amnesty period for individuals who previously possessed or were in possession of certain prohibited firearms or devices, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria.

The Order is rooted in **section 117.14** of the *Criminal Code*, which enables the government to declare amnesty periods for offences related to prohibited weapons — particularly where individuals have held or possessed such items under prior legal frameworks, and where there is a public interest in facilitating their safe disposal or reclassification.

  Includes firearms referenced in paragraphs 83(a) to (p) or items 87 to 96 of that schedule.

- **Specified Device**:
