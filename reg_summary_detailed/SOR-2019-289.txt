### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a temporary exemption from certain provisions of *Section 32 of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)* for specific fishing licences, authorizations, and documents related to the **Rainbow Trout (Athabasca River populations)**. 

The objective is to allow continued, regulated fishing activities involving these trout populations—despite their inclusion on the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk*—without triggering the full scope of SARA’s protective measures, such as restrictions on harvesting or licensing requirements, for a defined period.

This exemption is granted **only for a one-year period**, beginning on the date the Rainbow Trout (Athabasca River populations) is officially added to Schedule 1 of SARA (the List of Wildlife Species at Risk).

### **Key Provisions of the Exemption**

Section 32 of SARA generally applies to all activities that affect a species listed as at risk. It typically requires that any activity involving a species at risk be authorized under strict conditions, including environmental assessments and limits on harvest or disturbance.

However, this Exemption Order **exempts** the following specific types of licences, authorizations, and documents from the application of Section 32:

1. **Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998 – to the extent that they authorize sportfishing**  
   - This means that existing sportfishing rules established under Alberta’s Fishery Regulations (which govern recreational fishing) are **not subject to the full scope of Section 32 of SARA**.  
   - Sportfishing activities involving Rainbow Trout in the Athabasca River are permitted under the existing Alberta regulations, even though the species is at risk.  
   - This exemption does **not** extend to commercial fishing or other non-sportfishing activities.

2. **Licences issued under subsection 13(3) of the Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998**  
   - These are specific licences issued for sportfishing purposes under Alberta law.  
   - The exemption allows these licences to remain valid and enforceable without being subject to the restrictions or requirements that would otherwise apply under SARA.  
   - The exemption is limited to the types of licences defined in subsection 13(3), which typically cover recreational fishing rights.

3. **National Parks of Canada Fishing Regulations – to the extent that they authorize fishing**  
   - Fishing activities authorized under the National Parks of Canada Fishing Regulations (which apply in national parks, including those in the Athabasca region) are **exempt from Section 32 of SARA**.  
   - This includes fishing permits issued for use in national parks where Rainbow Trout are present.  
   - The exemption applies only to fishing activities authorized under these regulations and does not cover other forms of species interaction or habitat disturbance.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Applicability:**  
  The exemption applies **only** to the Rainbow Trout populations found in the **Athabasca River**.  
  It does not extend to other trout species or populations elsewhere in Canada.

- **Duration:**  
  The exemption is **limited to one year** from the date the Rainbow Trout (Athabasca River populations) is added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk in Schedule 1 of SARA.  
  After this period, the exemption will expire, and the full provisions of Section 32 of SARA will apply unless a new exemption is granted.

- **No Broad Protection:**  
  This is **not** a general protection or a declaration of the species as "not at risk." It is a targeted, time-limited exemption to allow for continued regulated sportfishing, based on the recognition of existing management frameworks and the need for stable access for recreational users.

- **No Extension or Renewal:**  
  The exemption is not renewable or automatically extended. It is a one-time, time-bound measure.

### **Rationale and Context**

- The Rainbow Trout (Athabasca River populations) were listed as at risk due to threats such as habitat degradation, overfishing, and climate change.  
- However, the federal government, through the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and the Environment, determined that existing provincial and federal fishing regulations already provide a reasonable balance between species protection and public access.  
- The exemption was intended to **avoid unnecessary disruption** to established recreational fishing opportunities while still recognizing the species’ vulnerability.  
- It reflects a **pragmatic approach** to species-at-risk management: allowing continued use of existing rules where appropriate, while ensuring that future management plans may include stronger conservation measures.

---

### **Implications**

- **Positive for Recreational Fishers:**  
  Sportfishing enthusiasts in the Athabasca River region can continue to fish under current rules without needing new federal authorizations or facing restrictions under SARA.

- **Environmental Concerns:**  
  Critics may argue that this exemption could contribute to population decline, especially if overfishing or poor habitat conditions are not addressed.  
  However, the exemption is limited in scope and duration, and it does not override the need for ongoing monitoring and conservation efforts.

- **Future Monitoring Required:**  
  The one-year period provides a window for stakeholders (including scientists, Indigenous communities, and fishery managers) to assess the impact of continued fishing and to develop more sustainable management strategies.

### **Conclusion**

This Exemption Order is a targeted, time-limited measure under the *Species at Risk Act* that allows sportfishing activities involving Rainbow Trout in the Athabasca River to proceed under existing provincial and federal regulations, without being subject to the full restrictions of Section 32 of SARA. It balances conservation concerns with the need to maintain access for recreational users and reflects a practical, short-term approach to species-at-risk management. The exemption expires after one year, after which stronger protections may be required under SARA.
