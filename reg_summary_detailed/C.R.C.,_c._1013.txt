The provided text consists of repeated references to the repeal and revocation of a regulatory provision:

- **[Repealed, SOR/2010-213, s. 1]**  
- **[Revoked, SOR/90-701, s. 1]**

However, **no actual regulation or legal text** is included in the input — only references to the repeal and revocation of a section. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be provided, as the regulation has been formally removed from the legal framework.

### Detailed Interpretation of the References:

1. **SOR/2010-213, s. 1**  
   - This refers to a statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Instrument) published in 2010, specifically numbered 213.  
   - Section 1 of this instrument **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or abolished) a prior regulation.  
   - The repeal indicates that the regulation in question was no longer in force after the date of publication of SOR/2010-213.

2. **SOR/90-701, s. 1**  
   - This refers to a statutory instrument from 1990, also numbered 701.  
   - Section 1 of this instrument **revoked** (a term often used synonymously with "repealed" in legal contexts) a prior rule or provision.  
   - The revocation suggests that the regulation was formally removed from law in 1990, and the repeal in 2010 likely confirmed or reaffirmed that removal.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text **no longer exists**. It has been:

- **Revoked in 1990** (via SOR/90-701, s. 1), and  
- **Repealed again in 2010** (via SOR/2010-213, s. 1), confirming its permanent removal from the legal system.

Thus, **there is no active or current regulation to summarize** — the provision has been formally abolished and is not in force.

> ✅ Final Answer: The regulation referenced in the text has been repealed and revoked, and therefore does not exist in current law. A detailed summary cannot be provided as the regulation is no longer in effect.
