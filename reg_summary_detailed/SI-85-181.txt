---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

On the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board, and pursuant to **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council has **revoked the previous Postal Imports Remission Order (C.R.C., c. 779)** and replaced it with a **new Postal Imports Remission Order**. This new order is issued to better align with current public policy, economic conditions, and regulatory needs, and is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

The new Order is titled:  
👉 **"The Postal Imports Remission Order"**  
It may be cited as: **C.R.C., c. 779** (though this is now a replacement, not a new enactment).

---

### **Key Objectives of the New Order**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **grant remission (i.e., exemption or reduction)** of **customs duties and certain excise taxes** on specific goods that are **imported by mail into Canada**, provided they meet certain criteria. This aims to:

- Facilitate access to essential or small-value goods through postal channels.
- Reduce administrative and financial burdens on individuals who receive small parcels by mail.
- Promote fairness and simplicity in the importation process for low-value, personal items.

---

### **Scope of Applicable Goods (What Is Included)**

The remission applies to **goods imported by mail** that meet the following conditions:

#### ✅ Goods Covered:
- **General goods** (excluding specific categories listed below)
- The term "goods" is defined broadly but **excludes** the following:

1. **Alcoholic beverages**  
2. **Cannabis products**  
3. **Vaping products**  
4. **Cigars**  
5. **Cigarettes**  
6. **Manufactured tobacco**  
7. Goods classified under **tariff item 9816.00.00** in the List of Tariff Provisions (Customs Tariff Schedule)  
8. Goods for which **duty is reduced under Section 85 of the Customs Tariff**  
9. **Books, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and similar publications** where:
   - The supplier is **required to register** under Subdivision d of Division V of Part IX of the **Excise Tax Act**, but **has not done so**

> ⚠️ **Note**: This means that *only* publications that are *not* registered under the Excise Tax Act are excluded from the remission. Registered publishers may still benefit from the exemption depending on other conditions.

#### 🔍 Definitions Used in the Order:
- **Cannabis product**: Defined as per **Section 2 of the Excise Act, 2001** (e.g., cannabis flowers, oils, edibles, etc.)
- **Vaping product**: Defined as per **Section 2 of the Excise Act, 2001** (e.g., e-cigarettes, vaporizers, e-liquids)

These definitions ensure that the scope of prohibited items is legally grounded and consistent with existing excise legislation.

### **Exclusions (What Is Not Covered)**

The remission **does not apply** to the following types of imports:

1. **Goods purchased from a retailer in Canada and mailed directly from outside Canada**  
   → Example: A Canadian resident buys a product online from a U.S. store and has it shipped directly to them via mail. This is excluded.

2. **Goods purchased or ordered through**:
   - A physical address in Canada
   - A post office box (PO Box)
   - A telephone number in Canada

   → This excludes transactions initiated or registered in Canada (e.g., ordering via a Canadian phone number or address).

3. **Goods imported by a person other than the one who ordered or purchased them**  
   → Example: A person in Canada orders a product, but a third party (e.g., a friend or relative) receives it on their behalf. This is excluded.

> 📌 **Key Point**: The remission only applies when the **person who ordered or purchased the goods** is the **same person who receives them** via mail.

---

### **Value Threshold for Remission**

- Remission is granted **only for goods with a value for duty not exceeding $20 CAD**.
- This applies to **customs duties and excise taxes**.
- The $20 limit is a significant threshold that ensures the benefit is accessible to small, personal, and low-cost items.

> 💡 Example: A person receives a $15 book or a $20 pair of socks via mail — the full customs and excise duties are waived.

---

### **Claim Process for Remission**

If the remission is **not claimed at the time of importation**, the benefit can still be claimed **within two years** of the date of importation.

- A **claim must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue**.
- The claim must include:
  - Details of the goods
  - Proof of importation (e.g., postal receipt or tracking number)
  - Evidence that the value did not exceed $20
  - Confirmation that the goods fall within the defined categories

> ⏳ **Deadline**: Claims must be filed **within two years** of importation. After this period, the claim is no longer valid.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The Order is issued under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations regarding the administration of federal finances.
- The Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board provided the recommendation, indicating that the change is both administratively sound and in the public interest.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council explicitly states that the revocation and replacement of the old order is in the **public interest**. This suggests that:

- The previous order may have been outdated or overly restrictive.
- There is a need for clarity, fairness, and simplicity in how small-value mail imports are handled.
- The new order improves access for individuals while maintaining compliance with excise and customs laws.

### **Conclusion**

This updated **Postal Imports Remission Order** modernizes and streamlines the rules for small-value mail imports into Canada. It provides a clear, fair, and accessible mechanism for individuals to receive goods by mail without paying customs or excise duties — **as long as the goods are not restricted, the value is under $20, and the purchaser is the recipient**.

However, it maintains important safeguards to prevent abuse, such as excluding controlled substances, tobacco, and publications that require registration. The two-year claim window ensures that individuals have reasonable time to seek remission, even if they missed the initial opportunity.

This regulation reflects a balance between **consumer convenience** and **fiscal responsibility**, and is a significant step in simplifying cross-border mail imports in Canada.
