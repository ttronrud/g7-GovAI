Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the regulation you provided, which is formally titled:

---

## **Registration of Bank Special Security Regulations**  
**(S.C. 1991, c. 46; effective June 1, 1992)**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

This regulation replaces two previous Orders in Council:
- **Payment of Fees Regulations (P.C. 1980-3281)** – established fee structures for registration services.
- **Registration of Security Regulations (P.C. 1982-56)** – governed the process of registering security interests.

The new **Registration of Bank Special Security Regulations** introduces a **modernized, centralized system for the registration of security interests** in the banking sector under the *Bank Act*. The primary objective is to improve transparency, ensure enforceability, and provide a clear, standardized process for banks to register and manage security interests—particularly those given by borrowers to banks under sections 426 and 427 of the *Bank Act*.

The system is designed to protect creditors (banks) by giving them public notice of a borrower’s pledge of assets as security for loans or advances, and to provide legal certainty in commercial transactions involving secured lending.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, which governs banking operations and security interests. |
| **Special Security** | A security interest created under either **section 426** (for property of a specific kind) or **section 427** (for general property or classes of property) of the *Bank Act*. |
| **Notice of Intention** | A formal declaration by a borrower that they intend to give a security interest to a bank under section 427. It is registered before the actual assignment of property. |
| **Certificate of Release** | A document issued by a bank confirming that a security interest has been released (i.e., the borrower no longer owes the bank under the security). |

---

### **3. Registration Process by Agents**

Agents (such as the Bank of Canada or authorized agencies) are responsible for managing the registration system. Their duties include:

#### **A. Upon Receipt of a Notice of Intention**
- The agent must:
  - **Number the notice consecutively** for tracking purposes.
  - **Endorse it** with the place, date, and time of receipt.
- Provide the bank with a **certified copy** of the registered notice, **endorsed with the agent’s signature and title**.

#### **B. Upon Receipt of a Certificate of Release**
- The agent must:
  - **Number the certificate consecutively**.
  - **Endorse it** with the place, date, and time of receipt.
  - Include the **number, place, date, and time of registration** of the corresponding notice of intention.
- Provide the bank with a **certified copy** of the registered certificate, **endorsed with the agent’s signature and title**.

#### **C. Cancellation of Notice of Intention**
- Once a **certificate of release** is registered, the **original notice of intention is automatically cancelled**.
- The notice may then be **removed from the system and destroyed**.

#### **D. Automatic Removal of Old Notices**
- A **registered certificate of release** may be **removed and destroyed** after **five years** from the date of receipt by the bank.

---

### **4. Annual Reporting Requirement by Banks**

Every bank must:
- **Send a statement annually during March** to each appropriate agency (e.g., Bank of Canada branch or regional office).
- The statement must:
  - List **every notice of intention** registered in the agency **more than five years before the end of the previous December**.
  - Include:
    - Number, place, date, and time of registration.
    - Name of the person who gave the security.
  - Or, state that **no such notices exist**.

#### **Effect of the Statement**
- Upon receipt of the statement, the registration of **each listed notice of intention is automatically extended** (i.e., the five-year period is renewed).

#### **Cancelling Outdated Notices**
- Upon receiving the statement, the agent must:
  - **Cancel** the registration of all notices of intention that:
    - Were registered more than five years before the end of the December preceding the statement’s receipt.
    - Are **not listed** in the statement.
- This ensures the system remains current and avoids the accumulation of obsolete records.

### **5. Forms Required Under the Act**

The regulation specifies standard forms for different types of security instruments:

| Section | Form Purpose |
|--------|--------------|
| **Schedule I** | Form for giving a **special security under section 426** (e.g., specific property like vessels, land, equipment). |
| **Schedule II** | Form for giving a **special security under section 427** (e.g., general property or classes of property). |
| **Schedule III** | Form for a **notice of intention** under section 427. |

These forms ensure consistency, legal validity, and uniformity in how security interests are documented and registered.

### **6. Fees for Services**

Fees are charged to cover administrative costs related to registration and inspection. Fees are tiered based on the service:

| Service | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **Registration of a notice of intention for an initial 5-year period** + certified copy | **$8** |
| **Registration of a notice of intention for each additional year beyond 5 years** | **$2 per year** |
| **Amendment to a notice of intention** + certified copy | **$3** |
| **Production of a copy of a notice or certificate of release** | **$3** |
| **Production of a copy of a register** (for inspection) | **$3** |
| **Search to determine if a person has a registered notice of intention** (including name of bank) | **$8** |
| **Comprehensive search** (to check if a named person appears in multiple notices) | **$12** |

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> **No fee** is charged for:
> - The **registration of a certificate of release**.
> - The **provision of a certified copy** of the certificate to the bank.

This reflects the principle that releasing a security interest is a routine administrative function and should not impose a financial burden on banks.

### **7. Security Instruments (Assignment of Property)**

The regulation includes two standard forms for assigning property as security under the *Bank Act*:

#### **Form A (Section 426 – Specific Property)**
- The borrower assigns **specific property** (e.g., a vessel, land, equipment) to the bank as security.
- The assignment is **continuing**, meaning it covers:
  - All past loans or advances.
  - Renewals or substitutions of those loans.
  - Interest on those loans.
- The borrower **warrants** that:
  - The property currently owned is **free from other mortgages, liens, or charges**, except for prior assignments to the bank.
  - Any future property acquired will also be free from such encumbrances, except for prior assignments to the bank.

#### **Form B (Section 427 – General Property)**
- The borrower assigns **all property** or **classes of property** (e.g., fishing vessels, equipment, supplies, or products from water bodies).
- The assignment applies **wherever the property is located**, including:
  - Fishing vessels, equipment, and supplies.
  - Products from lakes, rivers, or oceans.
- Same warranties apply:
  - Current property is free of liens.
  - Future property will be free of liens except for prior assignments to the bank.

> Both forms require:
> - A **date and signature**.
> - A **description and location** of the property (which may be extended to the back of the form or in a schedule).

### **8. Legal and Practical Implications**

#### ✅ **Benefits of the System**
- **Transparency**: Provides public access to security interests, helping prevent fraud and double-liens.
- **Enforceability**: A registered notice of intention or certificate of release serves as legal notice to third parties.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined registration and reporting reduce administrative burdens.
- **Accountability**: Annual statements ensure banks maintain up-to-date records.

#### ⚠️ **Key Limitations**
- The system is **limited to property under the Bank Act** (mainly tangible assets, vessels, and certain business property).
- **No automatic enforcement**—the bank must still take legal action to enforce the security interest if a borrower defaults.
- **Relies on borrower honesty**—if a borrower falsely claims property is free of liens, the bank may face legal risks.

---

### **9. Timeline and Implementation**

- **Effective Date**: **June 1, 1992**.
- **Replacement of Previous Rules**:
  - The **Payment of Fees Regulations (1980)** and **Registration of Security Regulations (1982)** are **fully revoked**.
- The new system operates under the **Bank Act**, specifically sections 426 and 427, which govern the creation and registration of security interests.

---

### **10. Summary in Plain Language**

This regulation establishes a **clear, transparent, and cost-effective system** for banks to register and manage security interests given by borrowers. It:

- Requires borrowers to give **formal notice** (a "notice of intention") before pledging assets.
-
