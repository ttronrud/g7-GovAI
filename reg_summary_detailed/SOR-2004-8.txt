**Detailed Summary of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Regulations**

**1. Legal Authority and Origin**  
The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**. This form of issuance reflects the standard constitutional and administrative process in Canada whereby the federal government, through the Crown (represented by the Governor General), enacts regulations based on statutory authority.  

The authority for these regulations stems specifically from **paragraph 36(1)(b) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision grants the government the power to make regulations that govern the employment of public servants, including matters related to recruitment, conditions of service, and administrative procedures within the public service.

---

**2. Scope of Application**  
The regulations specifically apply to the **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)**, which is a component of the broader Canadian Public Service.  

Under **subsections 37.3(1) and (37.3(2)) of the Public Service Employment Act**, the employment rules and procedures outlined in these regulations are directly applicable to the CCRA. These subsections typically govern the administrative framework for public service employment, including matters such as:

- Recruitment and selection processes  
- Employment conditions (e.g., pay, leave, promotions)  
- Disciplinary procedures  
- Job classification and career development  
- Employee rights and obligations  

Thus, the regulations establish a formal employment framework tailored to the unique operational environment of the CCRA, ensuring consistency with federal public service standards while allowing for agency-specific requirements.

**3. Effective Date**  
The regulations **come into force at 00:00:01 on January 24, 2004**. This precise time indicates a formal and official commencement date, ensuring that all employees and stakeholders are aware of when the new rules begin to apply.  

This effective date marks the point at which the regulations become legally binding and enforceable for the CCRA.

---

**4. Sunset Clause and Termination**  
The regulations **cease to have effect at 00:00:03 on January 24, 2004**.  

This detail—just two seconds after the effective date—suggests a **deliberate and precise sunset clause**, indicating that the regulations were intended to be temporary or transitional in nature.  

This short duration implies that:

- The regulations were likely introduced to implement a temporary policy, restructure employment practices, or respond to a specific administrative need.
- They were not intended to be long-term or permanent.
- Their temporary nature may have been due to a legislative review process, policy evaluation, or a planned replacement by more enduring or comprehensive regulations.

The immediate termination at 00:00:03 suggests a formal, symbolic, and legally precise end date, possibly to allow for a smooth transition to new or revised employment policies.

**5. Interpretation and Implications**  
- The regulation demonstrates a **temporary administrative measure** under the Public Service Employment Act.  
- It reflects the Canadian government’s use of regulatory tools to manage public service operations, particularly in specialized agencies like CCRA.  
- The short duration indicates that these regulations were likely part of a **transition period**, possibly during a reorganization, restructuring, or policy shift within the Public Service.  
- The fact that they are tied directly to the PSEA underscores the importance of maintaining consistent employment standards across federal agencies.

---

**Conclusion**  
These regulations represent a **brief, time-limited employment framework** for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, enacted under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act. They came into force and immediately expired on January 24, 2004, at precisely 00:00:01 and 00:00:03, respectively. This precise temporal structure suggests a transitional or interim nature, likely designed to address a specific administrative or policy need before being replaced by more permanent or comprehensive regulations.  

The regulations are not currently in effect and have no ongoing legal or operational relevance as of the present date.
