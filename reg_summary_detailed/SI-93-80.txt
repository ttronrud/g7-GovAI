**Detailed Summary of the Storage Charges Remission Order, 1993**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of National Revenue) to make orders for the remission (i.e., cancellation or refund) of certain government charges when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

This specific Order is made in response to a recommendation from the Treasury Board and the Minister of National Revenue, indicating that remission of storage charges is in the public interest.

### **2. Name and Citation**
The Order is formally titled:  
**The Storage Charges Remission Order, 1993**  
It may be cited as such and is referenced in the statutory instrument as *S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)* — indicating its origin in a broader legislative framework (the *Storage of Goods Regulations*).

---

### **3. Scope of Remission**
The Order provides for the **remission of storage charges** that were paid or are payable under **Section 4 of the Storage of Goods Regulations**.

Specifically, the remission applies to the **difference** between:
- The actual storage charges paid or payable for the period from **September 18, 1986, to September 14, 1988**, and  
- The storage charges that would have been payable **if the charges had started only on the fourth business day after the goods were left at the customs office**.

In simpler terms:
- The government is refunding the portion of storage charges that were paid **in excess** of what would have been charged had the charge period begun only **four business days after the goods were delivered to the customs office**.
- This effectively compensates for a perceived delay or misapplication in when the storage charges were triggered — meaning the original charge started earlier than it should have.

---

### **4. Conditions for Claiming Remission**
Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following condition:
- A claim for remission **must be made to the Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date the Order is made (i.e., within two years of its issuance in 1993).

This means:
- Individuals or entities who paid storage charges under the regulations are eligible to apply for a refund **only if they submit a formal claim within the two-year window**.
- Failure to make a claim within this period will result in the loss of the right to remission.

---

### **5. Purpose and Public Interest Justification**
The Order is grounded in the principle of **fairness and administrative justice**. It aims to:
- Correct an inequity where storage charges were applied from a date earlier than the actual start of the storage period (which should have begun only after a four-business-day waiting period at customs).
- Prevent undue financial burden on importers or businesses that were not responsible for the early commencement of charges.
- Align the charging mechanism with the practical realities of customs procedures, where goods are not immediately subject to storage charges upon arrival.

---

### **6. Key Dates and Periods**
- **Period of charges in question**: September 18, 1986 – September 14, 1988  
- **Reference point for fair charge calculation**: The fourth business day after the goods were left at the customs office  
- The remission covers the **excess** incurred due to the early application of charges.

---

### **7. Legal and Administrative Implications**
- The Order is a **non-binding administrative remedy** under the Financial Administration Act, not a legislative change.
- It operates as a **temporary, targeted relief** for a specific historical period and charge structure.
- It does not alter the underlying *Storage of Goods Regulations* but instead provides a one-time refund mechanism for those charges.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Storage Charges Remission Order, 1993** is a targeted administrative measure that refunds certain storage charges paid between 1986 and 1988 to businesses that were subject to charges beginning earlier than they should have, based on a four-business-day delay rule. The remission is limited to claims submitted within two years of the Order’s issuance, ensuring both fairness and administrative accountability. It reflects a public interest decision to correct an inconsistency in the timing of charge application and to provide financial relief to affected parties.
