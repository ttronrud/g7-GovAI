## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Coin-Operated Devices Remission Order**  
**Statutory Reference:**  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
**Made by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
**On the recommendation of:** The Minister of National Revenue  
**Pursuant to:** Subsection 23(2)a of the *Financial Administration Act*  

---

### 📌 **Purpose of the Order**
This regulation grants **tax remission** to certain registrants who made specific types of supplies—known as *eligible supplies*—during a defined period (the *eligible period*). The remission applies to the excise tax that would have been payable under Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* for those supplies, effectively reducing or eliminating the tax burden due to a temporary legislative provision that had previously exempted such supplies from excise tax.

This order was introduced to **correct a tax overpayment** that occurred during a period when a specific exemption (under subsection 165.1(2) of the Excise Tax Act) applied to coin-operated devices, but was later removed or modified. The remission compensates registrants who were affected by the change in tax treatment.

### 📚 **Key Definitions in the Order**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act* (the primary legislation governing excise taxes). |
| **Eligible Period** | The time period from **January 1, 1991, to April 23, 1996**. This is the window during which the temporary exemption (subsection 165.1(2)) applied to certain supplies. |
| **Eligible Supply** | A supply (e.g., a service or product) made during the eligible period where, **if subsection 165.1(2) had remained in effect**, the excise tax payable under Division II of Part IX of the Act would have been **zero**. This defines the scope of supplies eligible for remission. |
| **Net Tax** | Has the same meaning as defined in Division V of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*. It refers to the total excise tax payable by a registrant, calculated after deductions and credits. |
| **Person** | As defined in subsection 123(1) of the *Excise Tax Act*, generally refers to individuals or entities subject to excise tax registration. |
| **Registrant** | A person who was registered under the *Excise Tax Act* at any time during the eligible period. |
| **Reporting Period** | The period (e.g., monthly, quarterly) for which a registrant files tax returns, as defined in subsection 123(1) of the Act. |

### 📊 **Remission Formula (Section 2)**

A registrant who made eligible supplies during the eligible period is entitled to a **remission of excise tax** for a reporting period beginning during the eligible period.

The amount of remission is calculated using the following formula:

> **Remission Amount = (Net Tax for Reporting Period) – (Net Tax *without* excise tax collected on eligible supplies)**

In simpler terms:
- **Net Tax** = Actual excise tax owed for the reporting period (as calculated under the Act).
- **Adjusted Net Tax** = What the net tax would have been *if* the excise tax collected on eligible supplies had not been included in the calculation.

👉 Therefore, the remission **reduces the tax liability** by the amount of excise tax that would have been due on eligible supplies, which were *exempt* under the temporary rule (subsection 165.1(2)).

> ⚠️ *Note:* The remission is only granted for reporting periods that begin during the eligible period (i.e., from Jan 1, 1991, to Apr 23, 1996).

### 🚫 **Reduction of Remission (Section 3)**

The remission amount is **reduced** by the total of all amounts collected or collectible as excise tax on eligible supplies that:
1. Are **included in the registrant’s net tax** for the reporting period;  
2. **Remain unpaid** at the time the registrant files an application for remission;  
3. And meet **all of the following conditions**:
   - The net tax is a **positive amount** (i.e., the registrant owes tax);
   - **No assessment** of the net tax has been made under **section 296** of the *Excise Tax Act* before the application is filed;
   - Such an assessment **cannot be made** under section 298 of the Act at or after the filing date.

💡 **Purpose of this clause:**  
This prevents double recovery. If the tax was already assessed and the registrant is being assessed or will be assessed later, the remission is reduced to avoid overcompensation or unfair benefit.

---

### 💰 **Remission of Interest and Penalties (Section 4)**

If a registrant has **paid interest or penalties** on any amount for which a remission is granted, the registrant is entitled to a **full remission of those interest and penalties**.

> ✅ This ensures that registrants are not penalized financially for having made exempt supplies during the eligible period.

---

### 📝 **Application Requirements (Section 5)**

To qualify for remission, a registrant must:
- File a **written application** with the **Minister of National Revenue**;
- Submit the application **not later than two years after the date the Order is made** (i.e., no later than **January 1, 1993**).

> ⚠️ **Exception:**  
> If the amount has already been **rebated, credited, or remitted** under the *Excise Tax Act* or the *Financial Administration Act*, the remission does **not apply** to that amount.

### 🎯 **Policy Rationale & Public Interest**

- The Order recognizes a **temporary tax exemption** (subsection 165.1(2)) that was in place during the 1990s for certain coin-operated devices (e.g., vending machines).
- When the exemption was removed or changed, registrants who had made such supplies were **overcharged** with excise tax.
- This remission order **corrects that overcharge** by refunding the tax that would have been due under the original exemption.
- It serves the **public interest** by ensuring fairness and accuracy in tax treatment, especially in light of temporary or transitional legislative changes.

### ⚠️ Important Notes & Limitations

1. **Only applies to reporting periods beginning during the eligible period** — not retroactive to periods before Jan 1, 1991.
2. **Only applies to registrants who were active during the eligible period** — inactive or non-registered persons are not eligible.
3. **No remission if tax was already refunded or credited** — prevents double benefits.
4. **Application must be filed within 2 years** — failure to apply results in loss of benefit.
5. **Assessment matters** — if a tax assessment was made under section 296 before the application, the remission is reduced or denied.
