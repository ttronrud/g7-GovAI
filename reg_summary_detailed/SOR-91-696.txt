**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
*General Preferential Tariff Reduction Order, No. 1*

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.

**Legal Basis:**  
The Order is made pursuant to **paragraph 35(2)(b) of the Customs Tariff** (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)). This provision grants the Minister of Finance the authority to amend the customs tariff, including adjusting preferential duty rates, in accordance with established trade policy objectives.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **reduce or eliminate customs duties** on certain imported goods by replacing existing "General Preferential Tariff" rates with a "Free" rate. A "Free" rate means that the goods are **imported duty-free**, which promotes trade, supports economic development, and strengthens international trade relationships—particularly with countries or regions that are part of preferential trade agreements.

**Key Provisions and Amendments:**

1. **Amendment to Schedule I to the Customs Tariff:**  
   - The existing "General Preferential Tariff" heading in **Schedule I** is **revoked** (removed) for a list of specific tariff item numbers.  
   - In its place, the duty rate is substituted with **"Free"** (i.e., zero customs duty) for each of the following tariff item numbers:
     - [List of tariff items is implied in the text but not explicitly provided in the excerpt. The regulation references several items, though the full list is missing in the provided text.]

2. **Specific Amendment to Tariff Item No. 2918.11.20:**  
   - The regulation explicitly states that **tariff item No. 2918.11.20** in the **English version** of the Customs Tariff is amended.
   - The existing "General Preferential Tariff" rate is **revoked**.
   - It is **replaced with a "Free" rate**, meaning that goods classified under this item will be imported **without any customs duty**.

**Implications and Effects:**

- **Duty-Free Imports:**  
  Importers of goods classified under the affected tariff items will no longer have to pay customs duties under the general preferential tariff regime. This directly reduces the cost of importing these goods, potentially increasing competitiveness in domestic markets and encouraging trade.

- **Trade Facilitation:**  
  The change supports trade facilitation by simplifying the customs process and reducing compliance costs for businesses importing eligible goods.

- **Policy Intent:**  
  The move likely reflects a strategic decision by the government to:
  - Strengthen trade ties with specific countries or regions;
  - Encourage investment in sectors related to the goods listed;
  - Support domestic industries by lowering input costs;
  - Align with international trade agreements or regional cooperation frameworks.

- **Scope Limitation:**  
  The Order is **specific and targeted**—it only applies to the listed tariff items and does not affect other goods or tariff categories. This ensures precision in policy implementation and avoids unintended economic impacts.

**Citation and Legal Status:**  
- The Order may be cited as: **General Preferential Tariff Reduction Order, No. 1**.  
- It is an official instrument under the *Customs Tariff Act* and is legally binding upon all parties involved in customs operations.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a targeted reduction in customs duties for specific imported goods, effectively making them duty-free under the General Preferential Tariff. By replacing existing preferential rates with "Free" rates, the government aims to stimulate trade, reduce import costs, and support economic growth in targeted sectors. The amendment is narrowly focused, with clear legal authority and precise application to defined tariff items, ensuring transparency and enforceability within the Canadian customs framework.
