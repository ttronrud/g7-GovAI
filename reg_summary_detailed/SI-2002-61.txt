**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Remittance of Accrued Interest to the Province of Alberta under the Financial Administration Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
On the recommendation of:  
- The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food  
- The Treasury Board  

**Legal Basis:**  
Subsection 23(2.1) of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA)

**Key Provision:**  
The Governor General in Council has authorized the remittance (transfer) of any interest that has accrued—up to and including March 31, 2002—on the federal share of the *Gross Revenue Insurance Program Account* (GRIPA) specifically allocated to the Province of Alberta.

**Purpose and Context:**  
This regulation serves to return to the Province of Alberta a portion of interest income that had been generated on the federal contribution to the GRIPA. The Gross Revenue Insurance Program (GRIP) is a federal-provincial partnership designed to provide financial support to farmers and agricultural producers in the event of crop failures due to natural disasters or other covered events. The program is funded through a shared revenue model, with both federal and provincial contributions.

The federal government’s share of the program is held in a dedicated account (the GRIPA), and any interest that accrues on this federal share is typically retained by the federal government. However, this regulation explicitly provides that, in the public interest, such accrued interest up to March 31, 2002, shall be transferred to the Province of Alberta.

**Legal Justification:**  
The decision to remit the interest is based on a determination that it is in the *public interest* to do so. This implies that the transfer serves broader economic or administrative objectives—such as strengthening provincial agricultural support, enhancing fiscal equity, or promoting intergovernmental cooperation in rural and agricultural development.

**Scope and Timing:**  
- The interest applies only to the federal share of the GRIPA.  
- The period covered is from the inception of the interest accrual up to and including **March 31, 2002**.  
- The remittance is not retroactive beyond this date; no interest accrued after March 31, 2002, is included in this transfer.

**Administrative Process:**  
- The decision was made jointly by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (who has direct responsibility for agricultural programs) and the Treasury Board (which oversees federal financial administration and policy).  
- The Governor General in Council, as the formal executive authority, issued the regulation to implement the recommendation, ensuring it aligns with federal fiscal and administrative procedures.

**Significance:**  
This action reflects a policy choice to recognize and share the financial benefits generated from federal investments in provincial agricultural programs. By returning interest to Alberta, the federal government acknowledges the value of the partnership and supports the province’s capacity to fund and deliver agricultural insurance services, which are critical to rural economies.

**Implications:**  
- Alberta receives a direct financial benefit from the interest generated on its shared program funding.  
- It may serve as a precedent for future interest remittances in similar federal-provincial programs.  
- It underscores the principle of fiscal accountability and shared benefit in intergovernmental programs.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a formal, legally grounded transfer of interest income from the federal government to the Province of Alberta, specifically for the period ending March 31, 2002. It is enacted under the Financial Administration Act to fulfill a public interest objective and demonstrates a commitment to equitable sharing of benefits arising from federal-provincial cooperation in agricultural insurance. The transfer strengthens the financial foundation of Alberta’s agricultural support systems and reflects a collaborative approach to managing shared programs.
