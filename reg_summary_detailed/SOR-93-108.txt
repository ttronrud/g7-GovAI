**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Beef Cattle Producers’ Levies or Charges (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order**

---

### **Regulatory Background**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Sections 3 and 4 of the Quebec Beef Cattle Order**, which was originally established by **Order in Council P.C. 1992-1067**, dated May 21, 1992. The current Order, **SOR/92-293**, was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **March 5, 1993**, and is effective as of that date. It is formally titled:

> **Quebec Beef Cattle Producers’ Levies or Charges (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order**

This Order establishes a framework for the **collection of levies and charges** from beef cattle producers in the Province of Quebec who are involved in **interprovincial trade or export** of beef cattle.

---

### **Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms to clarify its scope and application:

1. **Beef Cattle**  
   - Refers to any beef cattle produced or marketed within the Province of Quebec.  
   - Covers all cattle raised for beef production, regardless of age or breed, as long as they are produced or marketed in Quebec.

2. **Buyer**  
   - A person who acquires or receives beef cattle from a producer, either directly or through an auction.  
   - Includes any entity (e.g., processors, dealers, exporters) purchasing cattle for their own use or resale.

3. **Commodity Board**  
   - The **Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec (Fédération)**, the Quebec Beef Producers’ Federation.  
   - Acts as the administrative body responsible for collecting levies and managing the funds.

4. **Producer**  
   - A person who:
     - Breeds beef cattle in Quebec for personal use or for others,
     - Produces them (e.g., through raising or breeding),
     - Markets them in any form (e.g., through sale, auction, or export).  
   - This definition includes both individual farmers and corporate entities engaged in beef cattle production or marketing.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Levies and Charges**
- Every **producer** must pay specific **levies or charges** to the Commodity Board for each beef cattle unit produced or marketed in **interprovincial or export trade**.
- The exact amounts, types, and conditions of these levies are detailed in an **attached schedule** (not included in this summary but referenced in the Order).
- The levies are designed to:
  - Support the sustainability and competitiveness of the Quebec beef industry,
  - Fund research, marketing, quality assurance, and export promotion,
  - Ensure fair and equitable contributions from producers involved in out-of-province or international markets.

#### **2. Payment Requirements**
- **Payment Deadline**:  
  Producers must pay all levies or charges **within the time limits** specified in the **by-laws** referenced in Section 3 of the original Quebec Beef Cattle Order.
- **Payment Location**:  
  All payments must be made to the **Commodity Board’s headquarters in Longueuil, Quebec**.

> This ensures centralized administration and financial accountability.

#### **3. Buyer Obligations (In Quebec)**
- Any **buyer within Quebec** who purchases beef cattle from a producer is required to:
  - **Deduct** the full amount of levies or charges payable by the producer to the Commodity Board.
  - **Remit those levies directly** to the Commodity Board at its Longueuil headquarters.
- This provision shifts the payment responsibility from the producer to the buyer **within the province**, effectively ensuring that levies are collected even if the producer does not directly pay them.

> This mechanism ensures that levies are collected regardless of the buyer’s location, and prevents producers from avoiding payment by selling to buyers who do not pay the fees.

### **Legal and Administrative Framework**

- The Order operates under the authority granted by the **Quebec Beef Cattle Order** (P.C. 1992-1067), which enables the Commodity Board to regulate levies and charges related to beef cattle trade.
- The **Commodity Board (Fédération)** is the sole entity authorized to:
  - Set, collect, and manage the levies.
  - Enforce compliance with payment requirements.
- The Order is **subject to Section 5**, which likely outlines exceptions, appeals, or administrative procedures (though not detailed here).

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of this regulation are:

1. **Revenue Generation**  
   - To generate stable, predictable funding for the beef industry through a structured levy system.

2. **Market Support**  
   - To support the competitiveness of Quebec beef in interprovincial and international markets by funding quality control, traceability, and marketing efforts.

3. **Equity and Fairness**  
   - To ensure that all producers involved in out-of-province or export sales contribute fairly to industry-wide initiatives.

4. **Administrative Efficiency**  
   - To streamline the collection process through a centralized system with clear responsibilities for both producers and buyers.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Producers**: Must track and pay levies on all cattle marketed outside Quebec or exported. Failure to comply may result in penalties or administrative action.
- **Buyers in Quebec**: Are legally obligated to withhold and remit levies, making them key intermediaries in the collection process.
- **Transparency**: The levies are tied to specific production or marketing activities, ensuring that only those engaged in interprovincial or export trade are subject to the charges.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Quebec Beef Cattle Producers’ Levies or Charges (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order** is a targeted regulatory instrument that ensures financial accountability and industry support for beef producers operating beyond Quebec’s borders. By requiring producers to pay levies and mandating buyers (within Quebec) to remit them directly to the Fédération, the Order creates a robust, enforceable system that promotes fair industry-wide contributions while supporting the long-term viability of Quebec’s beef sector in competitive markets.

This regulation reflects a balance between producer responsibility and industry development, aligning with broader agricultural policy goals of sustainability, quality, and market access.
