### **Key Provisions and Summary of Changes**

#### 1. **Transfer of Public Service Unit**
- The **Historic Places Policy Group** — a specific unit within the **Department of Canadian Heritage** — is transferred from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the **Parks Canada Agency**.
- This transfer includes:
  - **Control and supervision** of the group’s operations.
  - Responsibility for managing and overseeing the activities, policies, and day-to-day functions of the Historic Places Policy Group.
- The transfer is not a change in the group’s mandate or purpose, but rather a reorganization of administrative oversight to align with the broader mission of Parks Canada.

> **Rationale:** This move likely reflects a strategic realignment to strengthen Parks Canada’s capacity to manage and protect Canada’s historic places, particularly those located within national parks or heritage sites. Parks Canada, as a federal agency responsible for managing national parks and protected areas, is better positioned to integrate heritage conservation with natural resource management.

#### 2. **Transfer of Ministerial Powers, Duties, and Functions**
- The **Minister of Canadian Heritage** is transferring certain powers, duties, and functions related to **programs focused on heritage** to the **Minister of the Environment**.
- Specifically, these include:
  - The authority to **design and implement programs** whose **primary subject-matter is built heritage**.
- This includes programs related to:
  - Heritage preservation
  - Designation and protection of historic buildings and sites
  - Promotion of heritage tourism
  - Heritage education and public awareness initiatives
  - Policy development related to the built environment

> **Note:** The transfer is limited to programs that have **built heritage as their primary subject-matter**. It does not extend to other areas such as cultural identity, intangible heritage, Indigenous heritage, or natural heritage.

### **Legal Basis**
- The regulation is enacted under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to transfer control of public service units or ministerial functions between federal departments and agencies, provided that such transfers are in the public interest and serve to improve administrative efficiency or effectiveness.

### **Implications and Significance**

1. **Administrative Realignment:**
   - This reflects a shift in how Canada manages its heritage responsibilities. By moving the Historic Places Policy Group to Parks Canada, the government consolidates heritage management under a single agency with direct responsibility for protected natural and cultural landscapes.

2. **Enhanced Coordination:**
   - Parks Canada, with its direct stewardship of national parks and protected areas, can now better integrate heritage conservation into landscape management, visitor experiences, and environmental planning.

3. **Ministerial Responsibility Shift:**
   - The Minister of the Environment now bears responsibility for heritage-related programs. This may reflect a broader policy trend of integrating environmental and cultural values in national policy, recognizing that built heritage is often part of the broader ecological and cultural landscape.

4. **Policy Continuity:**
   - While the administrative control changes, the core policy objectives and program content remain intact. The transferred functions are not abolished — they are simply reassigned to a different department with a complementary mandate.

5. **Potential for Cross-Agency Collaboration:**
   - The transfer may foster collaboration between the Environment and Parks Canada and the Department of Canadian Heritage in areas such as urban heritage, historic preservation, and community engagement.

### **Limitations and Exclusions**
- The transfer **does not affect**:
  - Programs focused on intangible heritage (e.g., languages, traditions)
  - Indigenous heritage or cultural property
  - Programs related to natural heritage or biodiversity
- The **Department of Canadian Heritage** retains responsibility for broader cultural policy, including Indigenous relations, arts, and cultural diversity, unless otherwise specified.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization aimed at improving the effectiveness of heritage policy implementation in Canada. By transferring the Historic Places Policy Group to Parks Canada and shifting certain heritage-related program responsibilities to the Minister of the Environment, the government enhances coordination between environmental and cultural stewardship. It underscores a growing recognition that heritage and natural landscapes are interdependent and should be managed through integrated, place-based approaches.

This move exemplifies the government’s effort to streamline public service operations and align departmental responsibilities with the actual delivery of services and policy outcomes.
