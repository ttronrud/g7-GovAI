### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation referenced in question — specifically **Section 6 of Statutory Instrument SOR/2015-131** — is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.

**SOR/2015-131** stands for *Statutory Instrument 2015-131*, which is a regulatory document issued under the authority of a federal or provincial government (in this case, likely the Government of Canada or a provincial government, depending on context). These instruments are used to implement or amend laws.

**Section 6 of SOR/2015-131** was previously a legal provision that governed certain rules, requirements, or procedures — though the specific content of that section is not provided in the query.

**Reason for Repeal:**  
The repeal was enacted under **Section 6 of SOR/2015-131 itself**, which is a self-referential provision. This means that the instrument explicitly revoked or canceled its own section (Section 6). Such repeals are common when a regulation is outdated, redundant, inconsistent with new legislation, or superseded by a more comprehensive or updated rule.

**Implications:**  
- Any legal obligation, duty, or requirement previously established by Section 6 of SOR/2015-131 is no longer enforceable.
- Legal practitioners, compliance officers, or individuals relying on this section must refer to updated or current regulations for applicable rules.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative modernization or consolidation effort.

**Note on Lack of Content:**  
Since the actual text of Section 6 is not included in the original input, a detailed summary of its *substance* (e.g., what it regulated, who it applied to, or what actions it required) cannot be provided. The only factual information available is that it was repealed.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question — **Section 6 of SOR/2015-131** — has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable**. Its repeal was enacted through the same instrument (SOR/2015-131, s. 6), indicating a formal legislative decision to remove the provision. Without the original text of the section, the specific details of what it regulated cannot be summarized. For accurate and context-specific information, reference to the full text of SOR/2015-131 (or its official archived version) is required.
