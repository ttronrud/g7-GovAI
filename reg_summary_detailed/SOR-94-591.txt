### **Detailed Summary of the Teslin Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Publication**
The **Teslin Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, following a public consultation process mandated by **Section 5.5** of the same Act. 

- A proposed version of the regulations was published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** on **June 11 and 18, 1994**, and in **two successive issues of The Whitehorse Star** on **May 27 and 30, 1994**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Based on this public consultation, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, has formally adopted and enacted the regulations.

---

#### **2. Regulation Title**
These regulations are officially titled:  
**"The Teslin Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and serve to define spatial constraints and restrictions around Teslin Airport to ensure safe aviation operations.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions and Components**

The regulations define several key geographical and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Teslin Airport, located in the vicinity of Teslin, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a reference for measuring elevations and distances. Located on the centerline of runway 08–26, **838.2 meters from the threshold of runway 26**. Its elevation is **692.2 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 08–26). These surfaces define safe zones for aircraft during landing approaches. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the elevation of the ARP**, except where it would fall below 9 meters above ground level—then it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, including the runway. For runway 08–26, it is **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,796.4 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until they intersect with the outer surface. |

#### **4. Spatial Coverage of the Regulations**

- The regulations apply to **all land** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Teslin Airport.
- This includes **public road allowances** and other lands within the designated area.
- The **outer boundary** of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

This means that any land within a 4-kilometer radius of the ARP is subject to the zoning restrictions.

---

#### **5. Core Restriction: Height Limitations**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land subject to these regulations,
- If the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This restriction ensures that no obstruction (e.g., trees, buildings, towers) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

#### **6. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway 08 and 26)**
- Each approach surface is an **inclined plane** rising at a **1:40 ratio** (1 meter vertically per 40 meters horizontally).
- The plane rises to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
  - Located **3,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the runway.
  - Positioned **75 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**.
  - The outer ends of this horizontal line are **345 meters from the centerline** of the runway.
- Applies to both **runway 08 (approach)** and **runway 26 (approach)**.

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by preventing obstructions from interfering with the glide path.

##### **B. Outer Surface**
- A flat, horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation (692.2 m)**.
- However, **if this elevation would be less than 9 meters above ground**, the surface is adjusted to **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that even in low-lying areas, there is a minimum clearance to prevent ground-level obstructions.

##### **C. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip** and its **approach surfaces**.
- They continue upward until they meet the **outer surface**.
- These surfaces create a smooth transition between the runway edges and the outer boundary, ensuring safe flight paths without abrupt changes in terrain or height.

---

#### **7. Regulatory Plan Reference**
All spatial and dimensional definitions are based on **Teslin Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3012**, dated **August 25, 1993**, which serves as the official blueprint for the airport’s zoning and land use.

This plan provides the authoritative visual and technical foundation for the regulation’s implementation.

---

#### **8. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.
- To **protect the integrity of flight paths** by establishing clear height and spatial boundaries.
- To **balance development needs** with environmental and operational safety, particularly in a remote and sensitive region like the Yukon.
- To provide **clarity and enforceability** through precise, measurable definitions of surfaces and boundaries.

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Any individual or entity violating the height restrictions may be subject to penalties or enforcement actions.
- Compliance is monitored through land use planning, zoning inspections, and development approvals.

---

#### **10. Significance and Implications**

- This regulation is a critical component of **aviation safety infrastructure** in northern Canada.
- It sets a **clear boundary for development** around a major regional airport, protecting flight operations in a sparsely populated area.
- It reflects a **proactive approach to environmental and operational planning**, ensuring that future development does not compromise air traffic safety.
- The use of precise geometric and elevation parameters demonstrates a **technical and scientific basis** for zoning decisions.

### **Conclusion**

The **Teslin Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based framework to manage land use around Teslin Airport. By defining specific elevation limits through approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, the regulations protect aircraft operations from visual and physical obstructions. The rules are grounded in official planning documents, publicly consulted, and legally enforceable, making them a vital tool for aviation safety and sustainable development in the Yukon Territory.

These regulations exemplify how federal environmental and transportation policy can effectively integrate with regional planning to support both community growth and critical infrastructure safety.
