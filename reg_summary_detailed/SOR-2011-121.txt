## 🔍 **Core Provisions and Key Objectives**

### 1. **Zero Tax Rate for Real and Tangible Personal Property (Effective from Feb 17, 2012)**
> **Section: For the purposes of paragraph (a) of the definition tax rate in subsection 123(1) of the Act, the prescribed rate for British Columbia is 0%.**

- **Purpose:** This provision establishes that **no HST applies to real property or tangible personal property** that is **situated in British Columbia**.
- **Effective Date:** From **February 17, 2012 onward**.
- **Impact:** This means that for **property transactions (e.g., real estate sales, tangible goods)**, the tax rate is **0%**, effectively eliminating the provincial component of HST in these categories.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This does *not* apply to all taxable supplies. It only applies to the *basic tax content* of real or tangible personal property.

---

### 2. **Exclusion of Certain Taxes from Basic Tax Content Calculation (Effective Feb 17, 2012)**
> **No tax under subsection 165(2), section 212.1, or 218.1 or Division IV.1 of Part IX of the Act is to be included** in determining the value of A or B (basic tax content) for real or tangible personal property.

- **Purpose:** To prevent **double taxation** or **inclusion of already-taxed amounts** in the calculation of the HST base (i.e., the value of the supply).
- **Applies to:**
  - Value of A (in paragraph (a)) or B (in paragraph (b)) of the definition of "basic tax content" under subsection 123(1) of the Act.
- **Effect:** Ensures that only **un-taxed components** of the property value are used in HST calculations.

> ✅ Example: If a property includes a portion of the value from a previously taxed supply (e.g., a construction cost), that portion is **excluded** from the HST base.

---

### 3. **Adaptation of Tax Rate Formulas for Selected Financial Institutions (Effective Feb 17, 2012)**
> In applying the formula for basic tax content (A or J), the descriptions of **F and O** are adapted to read: **“is 0%, and”**.

- **Applicability:** For **selected listed financial institutions** (e.g., banks, credit unions, investment firms).
- **Purpose:** To ensure that **financial institutions are not subject to HST on their basic tax content** when calculating the value of supplies they make.
- **Mechanism:** The formula for calculating the tax base is adjusted so that the tax rate component is **zero**.

> 🔍 This reflects the government’s intent to **avoid tax on financial services** that are considered part of the financial system’s core operations.

### 4. **Special Rules for Real Property Sales (Arm’s Length and Tax Payability Before April 1, 2013)**
> Subsections (1) and (2) do **not apply** for the purposes of applying **section 193 (input tax credit)** or **section 257 (rebate)** in respect of a taxable supply of real property **if**:
- The supply is made by a **particular person** to another person;
- The two parties **deal at arm’s length** and are **not associated**;
- Tax becomes payable **before April 1, 2013**.

> **Exception:** If the input tax credit or rebate **exceeds** what would have been allowed in the absence of this rule, and **within one year** of when tax becomes payable, the person or an associated party **acquires an interest** in the property, then:
- The person is **deemed never to have been entitled** to the excess input tax credit or rebate.

- **Purpose:** To **prevent tax avoidance** through the use of input tax credits or rebates in connection with property transactions that result in future interest acquisition.
- **Anti-avoidance Tool:** Prevents manipulation of tax credits to shift tax burdens to future buyers.

> ❌ **Repealed (SOR/2012-191, s. 2)** – This provision has been **repealed**, indicating it is no longer in force.

### 5. **Adjustment of HST Rate for Employment/Income-Based Supplies (2013 Tax Year)**
> In applying **subsection 173(1)** of the Act (related to income inclusion), the description of **A in clause 173(1)(d)(vi)(B)** is adapted to read: **“is 5.75%”** if:
- The amount of supply is included in the individual’s **income from employment** for their **2013 tax year**, and
- The individual’s **last employer location** is in British Columbia; **OR**
- The individual is **resident in British Columbia** at the end of 2013 and the amount is included in income under subsection 15(1) of the Income Tax Act.

- **Purpose:** To ensure that **income from employment in BC** is taxed at a **5.75% HST rate** (the sum of 7% GST + 0% PST) — a transitional rate reflecting the HST structure.

> ⚠️ **Exception:** If **section 37 of the New Harmonized Value-added Tax System Regulations, No. 2** applies to determine the tax amount, then this rule **does not apply**.

---

### 6. **Special Rules for Surety Bonds and Construction Contracts (Effective April 1, 2013)**
> If a **surety** makes a construction supply to satisfy a bond and:
- A **contract payment** becomes due or is paid **before April 1, 2013**, and
- A **new payment** becomes due or is paid **on or after April 1, 2013**,

Then the formula in **clause 184.1(2)(d)(i)** is adapted to:
- **Tax rate = 12%**
- **First component = total payments due/paid before April 1, 2013**
- **Second component = 5%**
- **Third component = total payments due/paid on or after April 1, 2013**

> **Purpose:** To ensure **consistent tax treatment** of construction contracts that span the April 1, 2013 transition, avoiding sudden tax shifts.

> 📌 This rule ensures that **payments made before April 1** are taxed at a **higher rate (12%)**, while **post-April 1 payments** are taxed at **5%**, reflecting the transitional nature of the HST system.

---

### 7. **Tax Payable under Section 218.1(1.2) – The "Specified Year" Rule (April 1, 2013)**
> The tax payable under **section 218.1(1.2)** (for the specified year including April 1, 2013) is calculated as:
>  
> **Tax = (Base tax amount) × (Days before April 1 / Total days in year)**

- **Purpose:** To **prorate** the tax liability for the year, ensuring that only the portion of the tax that becomes payable **after March 31, 2013** is charged.
- **Effect:** Prevents double-counting or overpayment of tax for the transitional year.

> ✅ Example: If the tax rate was
