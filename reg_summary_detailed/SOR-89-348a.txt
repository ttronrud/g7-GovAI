**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Department of Forestry Terms Under Six Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1989**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

This regulation, officially titled the *Department of Forestry Terms Under Six Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1989*, establishes a special exemption from the general provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)* for a specific group of temporary employees in the **Department of Forestry** during a defined period.

The primary objective is to allow for **flexible, short-term employment** in the **Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support categories**—positions that are not permanent or long-term in nature—without being subject to the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act, which typically governs employment conditions, terms, rights, and protections for public servants.

---

### **2. Key Background Provisions**

The Order is based on two foundational "wheres" (reasons) that justify the exclusion and regulation:

#### **a) Practical and Policy-Based Exclusion (PSEA Section 41(1))**
- The **Public Service Commission (PSC)** determined that it would **not be practicable nor in the best interest of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* to individuals appointed on or after **July 1, 1989**, for **one or more periods totaling less than six months in any 12-month period**.
- This applies specifically to employees in the **Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support categories** within the **Department of Forestry**.
- The time frame of this exemption is strictly limited: from **July 1, 1989, to June 30, 1991**.

> *Rationale:* Short-term staffing (e.g., for seasonal work, project-based assignments, or temporary skill needs) would be disrupted or inefficient if governed by the full, rigid framework of the Public Service Employment Act, which includes lengthy contractual terms, formal procedures, and protections that are not aligned with temporary needs.

#### **b) Legislative Need for Specific Regulation (PSEA Section 37(1))**
- The PSC concluded that it is **desirable** to create **specific, tailored regulations** to govern the employment of such short-term staff.
- These regulations will define the conditions, rights, duties, and responsibilities of individuals hired under these temporary arrangements.

> *Rationale:* A blanket exclusion from the PSEA does not eliminate the need for clear rules governing how such temporary employees are hired, paid, evaluated, and terminated—hence, the need for an annexed set of regulations.

---

### **3. Legal Authority**

The Order is enacted under two specific subsections of the *Public Service Employment Act*:

- **Section 41(1):** Authorizes the Public Service Commission to **exclude certain persons from the operation of the PSEA** when it is determined that doing so is not practicable or in the public interest.
- **Section 37(1):** Grants the Commission the power to **make regulations** for specific employment situations where the PSEA does not apply.

These powers are exercised **on the recommendation of the Secretary of State and the Public Service Commission**, and the final approval is granted by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**—the formal executive authority of the Government of Canada.

### **4. Scope of the Exclusion**

#### **Who is Excluded?**
- All individuals **appointed on or after July 1, 1989**.
- For **one or more specified periods totaling less than six months in any consecutive 12-month period**.
- In the **Department of Forestry**.
- In the **Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support categories**.

#### **Time Period:**
- From **July 1, 1989, to June 30, 1991** (inclusive).

> *Note:* The exclusion applies only to **temporary appointments** and does not extend to permanent or long-term positions.

#### **Definition of "Persons" in this Order:**
- "Persons" refers to individuals who are **not employed under the Public Service Employment Act**—i.e., those hired under this special temporary arrangement.

### **5. Key Implications of the Exclusion**

- **No Application of PSEA Provisions:** These temporary employees are **not covered** by standard public service employment rights such as:
  - Job security
  - Collective bargaining rights
  - Promotion procedures
  - Retirement benefits
  - Standardized pay scales or tenure protections
- **Employment is governed solely by the annexed Regulations**, which define:
  - Eligibility criteria
  - Hiring procedures
  - Term limits and notice requirements
  - Compensation and conditions of service
  - Termination policies
  - Rights and responsibilities of both employer and employee

> *This creates a distinct, temporary employment regime separate from the broader public service framework.*

---

### **6. Structure of the Final Order**

The Order consists of:
1. A formal declaration of intent and policy rationale.
2. A legal citation: *Department of Forestry Terms Under Six Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1989*.
3. A definition of key terms (e.g., "persons").
4. The **approval of the exclusion** from the PSEA.
5. The **adoption of the annexed Regulations** (not included in this summary but referenced as an attachment).

---

### **7. Duration and Limitations**

- The exclusion and regulations are **time-bound**, ending on **June 30, 1991**.
- After this date, the full application of the *Public Service Employment Act* resumes for all employees in the Department of Forestry, unless further legislation is passed.
- The exemption is **not retroactive**—it only applies to appointments made on or after July 1, 1989, within the specified period.

---

### **8. Policy Significance**

This regulation reflects a **pragmatic approach to public service management** during a period of changing workforce demands. It acknowledges that:

- Some public service functions (like forestry operations) require **seasonal, project-based, or temporary labor**.
- Applying rigid employment rules to short-term staff could lead to inefficiencies, increased administrative costs, or difficulty in attracting qualified personnel.
- Flexibility in hiring is necessary to respond to **operational needs**, **budget constraints**, and **seasonal fluctuations**.

---

### **9. Conclusion**

The *Department of Forestry Terms Under Six Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1989* is a **targeted, temporary exemption** from the general employment framework of the Public Service Employment Act. It allows for:

- Flexible hiring of temporary staff in the Technical, Operational, and Administrative Support categories.
- Clear, defined conditions for short-term appointments (less than six months per 12-month period).
- A balanced approach that respects public service integrity while enabling operational efficiency.

This Order remains a **historical and policy-specific instrument**, relevant only to the Department of Forestry during the 1989–1991 timeframe and not applicable to other departments or future temporary staffing arrangements without new legislative action.

---

**In short:**  
This regulation enables the Department of Forestry to hire temporary staff for less than six months at a time during 1989–1991 without applying standard public service employment rules—making employment more flexible and operationally efficient, while being governed by specific, tailored regulations.
