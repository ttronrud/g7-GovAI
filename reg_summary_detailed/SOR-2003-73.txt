Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: CIFTA Remission Order, 2003**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is made under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which empowers the government to grant remission of customs duties under specific conditions.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this **CIFTA Remission Order, 2003** is to **grant a refund (remission) of customs duties** paid or owed on certain imported goods that were previously eligible for a preferential tariff rate under the **Canada-Israel Agreement (CIFTA)** — but were no longer eligible after January 1, 2003.

This remission aims to **compensate importers** for the loss of duty relief due to the termination or modification of the CIFTA tariff benefits, which were in effect as of December 31, 1997, but ceased to apply for goods imported on or after January 1, 2003.

---

#### **3. Definition of "Goods"**
- The term **"goods"** is defined as:
  > Goods that would have been eligible for the **Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff rate of duty** as of **December 31, 1997**, had they been imported on that date, **but are not eligible** for that rate of duty if imported on or after **January 1, 2003**.

- In simpler terms:
  - These are goods that qualified for preferential (lower) duty treatment under CIFTA in 1997.
  - After January 1, 2003, those same goods no longer qualify for that preferential rate under the new tariff regime.
  - The remission applies only to such goods that were imported during the specified period.

---

#### **4. Scope of Remission**
- **Period Covered**:  
  Imports made between **January 1, 2003**, and **December 31, 2005**, inclusive.

- **Amount of Remission**:  
  The remission is equal to the **difference** between:
  1. The customs duties payable at the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN)** Tariff rate **or** the **General Preferential Tariff (GPT)** rate (as applicable) under the Customs Tariff and its regulations **as they existed on January 1, 2003**,  
     **minus**
  2. The customs duties that would have been payable at the **Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff rate** (i.e., the preferential rate) **if the goods had qualified** for it under the rules as of January 1, 2003.

- **In essence**:  
  The remission compensates importers for the **duty increase** they experienced due to the loss of CIFTA preferential treatment. It effectively refunds the difference between the duty they paid (under MFN/GPT) and what they would have paid (under CIFTA).

---

#### **5. Conditions for Claiming Remission**
- A claim for remission **must be made to the Minister of National Revenue** within **four years** of the date the goods were imported.
- This is a strict deadline. Failure to file a claim within this period will result in the **loss of the right to remission**.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized by the government).

---

### **Key Implications and Context**
- **Historical Background**:  
  The Canada-Israel Agreement (CIFTA) provided duty-free or reduced tariff treatment for certain goods traded between Canada and Israel. This agreement was in place until it was effectively phased out or replaced by other trade arrangements, such as the broader Canada-Europe or Canada-Asia frameworks, or due to changes in trade policy.

- **Impact on Importers**:  
  Businesses that imported eligible goods into Canada between 2003 and 2005 may have faced higher duties than they would have if CIFTA had remained in effect. This Order allows them to recover the **duty differential**.

- **Administrative Burden**:  
  Importers must:
  - Identify goods that fall within the CIFTA eligibility criteria as of December 31, 1997,
  - Determine whether those goods were imported during the 2003–2005 window,
  - File a claim with the Minister of National Revenue within four years of importation.

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulation relies on the principle of **duty remission** under Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act, which allows for adjustments when changes in trade agreements result in undue financial impact on importers.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **CIFTA Remission Order, 2003** is a targeted, time-limited measure designed to **mitigate the financial impact** on Canadian importers who lost preferential tariff treatment due to the end of the Canada-Israel Agreement. It provides a clear, quantifiable refund for duty differences arising from the transition in tariff treatment, with strict eligibility and time limits to ensure fiscal responsibility and administrative feasibility.

---

**Note**: This Order is **not retroactive** — it only applies to goods imported between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005. It also does not apply to goods that were not eligible for CIFTA in 1997 or that were imported outside the specified timeframe.
