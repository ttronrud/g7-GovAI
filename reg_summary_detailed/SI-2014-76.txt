**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Indemnity Interest Remission Order (HST)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, as amended. It is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board**. This demonstrates that the decision is rooted in fiscal policy and administrative discretion, with input from key financial decision-makers in the federal government.

The regulation is formally referenced as:
- **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)** – the statutory source in the Statutes of Canada.
- **R.S., c. F-11** – the current version of the Financial Administration Act.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this order is to **remit (forgive or cancel) interest** that would otherwise be due by the Province of British Columbia under the Financial Administration Act in respect of a specific financial obligation.

This obligation arises from the **Comprehensive Integrated Tax Coordination Agreement (CITCA)** between the **Government of Canada** and the **Government of British Columbia**. Under this agreement, British Columbia received an **assistance amount of $1,599,000,000** from the federal government.

As part of the CITCA, British Columbia was required to **indemnify Her Majesty in Right of Canada** for a portion of the financial assistance received — meaning the province agreed to reimburse the federal government for certain costs or losses related to the agreement.

Under the Financial Administration Act, interest is normally charged on such obligations. This order **remits (exempts)** British Columbia from paying interest on this indemnity obligation.

### **3. Scope of the Interest Remission**
- **What is remitted**: Interest payable under **subsection 155.1(1) of the Financial Administration Act**.
- **What is covered**: The interest on the **indemnity obligation** of $1,599,000,000.
- **Condition of remission**: The remission is **not automatic** — it is granted **on specific conditions** related to the payment schedule.

---

### **4. Payment Conditions and Schedule**
The remission is granted **only if** the indemnity amount is paid in **five equal installments** of **$319,800,000** each.

The payment schedule is as follows:
| Payment | Due Date |
|--------|----------|
| 1st | March 30, 2012 |
| 2nd | March 28, 2013 |
| 3rd | On or before March 28, 2014 |
| 4th | On or before March 27, 2015 |
| 5th | On or before March 25, 2016 |

This schedule ensures that the province makes timely and structured payments, with the final payment due by **March 25, 2016**.

### **5. Consequences of Missed Payments**
If any payment is not made **on or before the specified date**, the following consequence applies:

- **Additional interest remission** is granted to British Columbia.
- This additional remission applies to the **interest attributable to the period** beginning on **March 28, 2012**, and ending on the **day before the specified due date** for the missed payment.
- **Example**: If the third payment is missed and the due date was March 28, 2014, then interest for the period from **March 28, 2012, to March 27, 2014** (i.e., the period before the missed payment) would be remitted.

This provision serves as a **safety net** — it incentivizes timely payment by offering relief from interest if a payment is delayed, but only for the interest that would have accrued during the period leading up to the missed payment.

---

### **6. Key Implications**
- **Fiscal Relief**: The order provides significant financial relief to British Columbia by eliminating interest on a large indemnity obligation, which helps reduce the province’s long-term financial burden.
- **Structured Repayment**: The five-year payment plan ensures manageable, predictable financial obligations for the province.
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: The conditional nature of the remission creates a clear incentive for compliance with the payment schedule.
- **Public Interest Justification**: The Governor General acts on the public interest, indicating that the policy serves broader economic and fiscal stability goals.

---

### **7. Legal and Policy Context**
- The **CITCA** was established to coordinate tax policies between Canada and British Columbia, particularly to avoid double taxation and ensure fairness in tax collection.
- The indemnity provision reflects a mutual understanding that while the province received financial support, it also bears responsibility for certain costs.
- The interest remission is a **fiscal accommodation** to support provincial financial health, especially in the context of complex intergovernmental agreements.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **conditional interest remission** that allows the Province of British Columbia to avoid interest charges on a $1.6 billion indemnity obligation arising from the Comprehensive Integrated Tax Coordination Agreement. The remission is tied to a structured five-year payment schedule, with additional interest relief provided if payments are delayed. The order balances fiscal responsibility with public interest, ensuring that the province can manage its obligations without undue financial strain while maintaining accountability and transparency in intergovernmental financial arrangements.

This regulation is a practical example of how federal financial administration laws can be applied to support provincial fiscal stability through targeted, condition-based relief.
