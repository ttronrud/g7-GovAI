### **Detailed Summary of the Wood Buffalo National Park Game Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Purpose**

The **Wood Buffalo National Park Game Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, under **subsection 7(1) of the National Parks Act**. These regulations **revoke the previous Wood Buffalo Park Game Regulations (P.C. 1954-1739)** and establish a modern, comprehensive framework governing **hunting, trapping, and wildlife protection** within **Wood Buffalo National Park (the "Park")**.

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **protect wildlife populations**, especially sensitive species such as bears, migratory birds, and fur-bearing animals.
- To **regulate human activity** (hunting, trapping, dog use, firearm use) to ensure sustainability and conservation.
- To **ensure fair access** to hunting and trapping for residents while preventing overharvesting or conflict with conservation goals.
- To **maintain ecological balance** and support scientific research and wildlife management.

These regulations came into effect on **December 8, 1954 (SOR/54-553)**, and were last amended in **1977 (SOR/77-412)**. They remain in force as of the latest version, though certain provisions have been **repealed or updated** over time (e.g., references to the Director, Minister, or Superintendent were removed in SOR/91-420).
