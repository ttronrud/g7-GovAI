### **Detailed Summary of the Eastern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were introduced under the **Canada Shipping Act**, specifically **Sections 635.15 and 635.16**, which authorize the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to amend or replace existing vessel traffic service (VTS) regulations.

- A prior version of these regulations — the *Eastern Canada Traffic Zone Regulations* — was issued by Order in Council **P.C. 1978-2590** on August 16, 1978.
- On **July 2, 1988**, a proposed version of the new regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, providing a reasonable opportunity for stakeholders (shipowners, masters, seamen, and other interested parties) to submit representations to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on that consultation, the Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Acting Minister of Transport, **revoked the 1978 regulations** and **adopted the new, updated regulations** effective upon the coming into force of **Section 73 to 76 of the Statutes of Canada, 1987** (an Act amending the Canada Shipping Act and related legislation).

> **Key Legal Basis**:  
> - Canada Shipping Act, Sections 635.15 (power to amend regulations) and 635.16 (power to revoke and substitute regulations).  
> - The new regulations are officially titled: **Eastern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations**.

#### **2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to the following types of vessels:

1. **Ships of 500 gross tons or more** in gross tonnage.
2. **Ships engaged in towing or pushing another vessel**, where the **combined gross tonnage** of the towing/pushing vessel and the vessel being moved is **500 gross tons or more**.
3. **Vessels carrying pollutants or dangerous goods**, or those **towing/pushing vessels carrying such substances**.

> This ensures that vessels posing higher risks due to size, operation, or hazardous cargo are subject to enhanced traffic monitoring and reporting requirements.

#### **3. Definition of the Eastern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone (VTS Zone)**

The zone consists of:

- All **Canadian waters on the east coast of Canada**:
  - **South of the 60th parallel of north latitude**.
  - **East of 66°00′ West longitude** within the **St. Lawrence River**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Waters within **Ungava Bay**.
  - Waters already covered by other existing **Vessel Traffic Services Zones** as defined in the *Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations*.

> This defines a large, strategically important maritime corridor used for commercial shipping, including trans-Atlantic and intra-Canadian routes, particularly through the St. Lawrence Seaway.

---

#### **4. Mandatory Reporting Requirements**

The master of a ship must submit a report in specified circumstances. These are categorized under **paragraph (1)** of the regulation.

##### **(a) Approaching the Zone (Entry)**
- **24 hours before entry**, or
- **As soon as practicable** if the estimated time of arrival (ETA) is less than 24 hours after departure from the last port of call.

> Purpose: Allows traffic management authorities to prepare for incoming vessels and assess traffic flow.

##### **(b) Departing from a Berth within the Zone**
- **Two hours before departure** from any berth located in the zone.

> Ensures coordination with port operations and departure planning.

##### **(c) Stranding or Incident While in the Zone**
- Immediately before getting underway if:
  - The vessel has **stranded** or **stopped due to breakdown** of:
    - Main propulsion systems
    - Steering systems
  - Or has been involved in a **collision**.

> Critical for emergency response and safety.

##### **(d) Crossing the Seaward Boundary**
- **Immediately before crossing** the seaward boundary of the zone.
- **Upon entry** or **departure** from the zone.

> Provides real-time tracking of vessel movements across the zone’s edge.

##### **(e) Arrival at a Berth within the Zone**
- Upon arrival at a berth.

> Enables port authorities to prepare for vessel docking.

#### **5. Content of Required Reports**

##### **For Entries, Departures, and Incidents (Paragraphs 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e))**

Each report must include the following information:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ship Details** | Name of the ship, radio call sign, name of master |
| **Position & Time** | Current position, time of arrival at position (in UTC) |
| **Course & Speed** | Course (if any), speed (if any) |
| **Weather Conditions** | Prevailing weather conditions |
| **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)** | ETA to destination (in (a)) or departure from berth (in b) |
| **Route Plan** | Intended route through the zone to destination |
| **Last Port of Call** | Name of the last port visited |
| **Draft** | Ship’s draft |
| **Cargo Information** | Any dangerous goods (by class) or pollutant carried or being towed |
| **Defects** | Any defects in hull, propulsion, steering, radar, compass, radio, anchors, or cables |
| **Pollution Risk** | Any discharge or threat of discharge of pollutant; any damage that could lead to discharge |
| **Agent Information** | Name of Canadian or U.S. agent |
| **Certificates** | Expiration dates of key certificates (e.g., Oil Pollution Liability Certificate, Pollution Prevention Certificate, Certificate of Fitness, etc.) |

> **Note**: Paragraph (1)(c) — for incidents like stranding — requires only the name of the ship and its position.

> **Paragraph (1)(d)** — crossing the boundary — requires:
> - Ship name, call sign, position, time of crossing, and prevailing weather and **ice conditions**.

> **Paragraph (1)(e)** — arrival at berth — requires:
> - Ship name, call sign, name of port, and time of arrival.
