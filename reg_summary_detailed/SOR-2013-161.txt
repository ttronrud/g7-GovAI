### **4. Exemption Clause – Transit Goods**
An important exception is provided under **Section 1**:
- The withdrawal of preferential tariff benefits **does not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada before January 1, 2015**.
- This means that goods that were already in the process of being transported into Canada prior to that date may still qualify for preferential tariff treatment, even if the origin country is on the list.

This exemption is intended to avoid disrupting legitimate trade flows and to prevent retroactive penalties or tariff increases for goods already in transit.

- This may lead to **increased costs** for Canadian importers, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, manufactured goods, and textiles where preferential access to certain markets is critical.
- It may also prompt **re-evaluation of trade agreements** or **origin certification procedures** to ensure compliance with Canada’s rules of origin.
