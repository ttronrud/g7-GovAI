### **Detailed Summary of the Employment Equity Programs Regulations (SOR/87-22)**

This regulation, formally known as the **Employment Equity Programs Regulations**, was issued by the Governor in Council on **January 1, 1989**, and remains in force until **March 31, 1993**. It was enacted under the authority of the **Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** and represents a significant policy shift in the appointment and treatment of **target group members**—specifically members of **Aboriginal peoples, visible minority groups, and disabled persons**—within the Canadian Public Service.

The regulation is structured around several key objectives: **removing barriers to equitable employment**, **revising outdated exclusionary practices**, and **ensuring fair and merit-based appointments** for individuals from historically marginalized groups. Below is a comprehensive, detailed summary of the regulation's provisions, rationale, and implications.

---

## **I. Background and Rationale**

The regulation arises from a formal determination by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** that:

1. **It is not practicable or in the public interest** to apply **Section 10 and subsection 12(3)** of the Public Service Employment Act to appointments of target group members from outside the Public Service to positions under **employment equity programs**.
   
2. **Section 12(1)** of the PSEA should be applied to **training positions** identified under employment equity programs, allowing for appointments of target group members from outside the Public Service **without requiring language skills** as a selection criterion—thereby removing a significant barrier for non-English or non-French speakers.

3. **Section 10 and subsection 12(3)** should **not apply** to appointments of target group members to **non-equity-program positions**—i.e., those not identified under the employment equity framework—especially when those individuals were previously appointed to **training positions** under equity programs.

4. **Appeal rights** must be preserved: individuals who would otherwise have the right to appeal appointments of target group members to non-equity positions **must retain their right to appeal**, as provided under subsection 21(1) of the PSEA.

5. The PSC recommends the **revocation of outdated and exclusionary orders**, including:
   - The **Northern Careers Exclusion of Native Persons Approval Order** (C.R.C., c. 1347)
   - The **Northern Careers Appointments Regulations** (C.R.C., c. 1346)
   - The **Visible Minority Employment Program Regulations** (P.C. 1986–2859)

These outdated rules had historically **excluded certain groups or positions** from equity-based hiring, often based on geographic, linguistic, or cultural factors, and were deemed **outmoded and inconsistent with modern equity principles**.

## **II. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

### **1. Revocation of Outdated Exclusionary Orders**

The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, **revokes** the following:

- **Northern Careers Exclusion of Native Persons Approval Order (C.R.C., c. 1347)**  
  → Removes the exclusion of Aboriginal (Autochthonous) persons from certain northern career opportunities.

- **Northern Careers Appointments Regulations (C.R.C., c. 1346)**  
  → Eliminates restrictive appointment rules that limited access to northern public service roles.

- **Exclusion of Provisions of the PSEA for the Visible Minority Employment Program (Order P.C. 1986–2859)**  
  → Removes the prior exclusion of certain provisions of the PSEA from the Visible Minority Employment Program, which had been in place since December 1986.

- **Visible Minority Employment Program Regulations (P.C. 1986–2859)**  
  → Fully revoked, ending the formal framework that had previously governed visible minority hiring.

> **Purpose**: To eliminate institutionalized discrimination and outdated policies that restricted access to public service roles based on race, region, or language.

### **2. New Exclusion Order (Substitution via Subsection 41(1))**

In place of the revoked exclusions, the Governor in Council **makes a new Order**—the **Employment Equity Programs Exclusion Approval Order**—which:

- **Excludes certain persons and positions** from the operation of certain provisions of the PSEA **only for the purpose of employment equity programs**.
- This exclusion applies **only during the period January 1, 1989 – March 31, 1993**.
- The exclusion is **limited and targeted**, meaning it does not remove equity protections from general public service employment but instead allows for **flexibility in appointments** to equity-focused roles.

> **Purpose**: To allow targeted, equitable appointments without requiring full compliance with standard hiring criteria (e.g., language proficiency) for members of target groups.

---

### **3. Appointment of Target Group Members to Equity-Program Positions**

The regulation grants the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** broad authority to appoint target group members from outside the Public Service to positions under employment equity programs, provided:

- The individual is **qualified** for the position, as determined by the Commission.

> This provision ensures that individuals from underrepresented groups can enter the public service through equitable pathways, even if they lack traditional credentials or experience.

---

### **4. Appointment to Training Positions**

The PSC may appoint a target group member to a **training position** under an employment equity program **if the position is commensurate with the individual’s capacities**.

> This provision recognizes that many members of target groups may need training before being placed in full-fledged roles. It removes the requirement that language skills or other traditional qualifications be mandatory for such training appointments.

---

### **5. Appointment to Non-Equity Positions After Training**

The PSC may appoint a target group member who was **previously hired for a specified period into a training position** under an equity program to a **non-equity position** (i.e., one not identified under the equity program), provided:

- The individual is **qualified** for the position.
- The appointment is made for an **indeterminate period** (i.e., not fixed or time-bound).

> This allows for a **smooth transition** from training to full employment, without requiring a new equity-based appointment process. It supports career progression and retention of equity hires.

---

### **6. Appeal Rights for Appointments**

The regulation **preserves the right to appeal** under subsection **21(1)** of the PSEA for appointments of target group members to non-equity positions.

> This ensures that individuals or stakeholders can challenge appointments if they believe the process was unfair or discriminatory, maintaining transparency and accountability.

## **III. Definitions and Scope**

The regulation defines key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Aboriginal peoples** | Same as in the original Order (Autochtones) |
| **Disabled persons** | Same as in the original Order (personnes handicapées) |
| **Employment equity programs** | Same as in the original Order (programmes d’équité en matière d’emploi) |
| **Members of visible minority groups** | Same as in the original Order (membres des minorités visibles) |
| **Target group members** | Same as in the original Order (membres des groupes-cibles) |
| **Order** | Refers to the Employment Equity Programs Exclusion Approval Order |

All other terms are interpreted as in the **Public Service Employment Act** and **Public Service Employment Regulations**, unless otherwise defined.

> **Scope**: Applies to **persons and positions** to which the Exclusion Approval Order applies.

---

## **IV. Conflict Resolution**

If there is any **inconsistency** between these regulations and the **Public Service Employment Regulations**, **these regulations prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.

> This ensures that equity-based appointment rules take precedence over general administrative rules when there is a conflict, reinforcing the priority of equity and inclusion.

---

## **V. Period of Application**

The entire regulation is **time-limited**:

- **Effective**: January 1, 1989  
- **Expires**: March 31, 1993  

> This reflects a **phased transition** in public service policy, allowing time for implementation, monitoring, and adjustment before the framework is reviewed or replaced.

---

## **VI. Policy Implications and Significance**

### ✅ **Positive Impacts**
- **Promotes equity and inclusion**: Removes barriers to entry for Aboriginal peoples, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities.
- **Supports diversity in the public service**: Encourages representation of historically marginalized groups.
- **Improves access to training**: Allows individuals to gain experience in public service without being blocked by language or credential requirements.
- **Facilitates career progression**: Enables training-to-employment transitions for equity hires.
- **Ensures accountability**: Maintains appeal rights to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory appointments.

### ⚠️ **Limitations and Criticisms**
- **Time-bound**: The policy ends in 1993, which may have limited long-term impact.
- **Conditional appointments**: Appointments depend on Commission judgment, which may introduce subjectivity.
- **Exclusion of language skills**: While beneficial for some, removing language requirements may affect operational effectiveness in language-specific roles.
- **No formal monitoring or reporting**: The regulation does not include mechanisms to assess outcomes or ensure compliance.
