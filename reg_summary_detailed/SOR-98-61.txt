**Detailed Summary of the Returning Persons Exemption Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Returning Persons Exemption Regulations* are a set of rules established under the *Customs Act* and the *Customs Tariff* to provide a simplified customs exemption for certain goods brought back into Canada by individuals returning from abroad. These regulations are specifically designed to ease the burden on returning travelers who bring small personal items into the country without having to pay customs duties, provided the value of the goods meets specific criteria.

Importantly, these regulations were **not required to be published under the normal procedures** of the *Customs Act* because they are a direct implementation of a public announcement made on **October 27, 1997**, as permitted under **paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a** of the *Customs Act*. This means the regulations were enacted without the usual public notice and publication process required for other types of regulatory amendments.

### **Legal Authority**

The regulations were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to:

- **Subsection 12(2)** and **paragraph 164(1)(i)** of the *Customs Act*  
- **Paragraph 133(f)** of the *Customs Tariff*

This legal foundation ensures that the regulations are both authorized and consistent with federal customs law.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Exemption**:  
  Refers to the benefit of **free customs duty** for goods classified under **heading 98.04** of the Customs Tariff, provided the **total value of the goods does not exceed the specified exemption amount** set out in a tariff item under that heading.

  > For example, if a person returns to Canada with personal items valued at less than a certain threshold (e.g., $100), those goods may be imported duty-free under this exemption.

### **Eligibility and Reporting Requirements**

#### **1. General Requirement (Subsection 1)**
Any person returning to Canada must:
- **Report in writing** the goods for which an exemption is claimed.
- State the **value of those goods in Canadian dollars**.

This written report is a mandatory step to claim the exemption.

#### **2. Oral Reporting Exception (Subsection 2)**
A person may make an **oral report** instead of a written one under the following conditions:
- The goods are **in the actual possession** of the returning person, or
- The goods are **part of the person’s baggage** carried on the same conveyance as the person.

And the person must be returning on one of the following:
- A **non-commercial passenger conveyance** (e.g., a flight, train, or ship that is not for commercial cargo transport), or
- A **bus**; or
- A **highway conveyance** at a **land border crossing** at a designated customs office, **and** is authorized under the *Presentation of Persons (2003) Regulations* to present themselves in an alternate manner under **subparagraph 11(d)(ii)**.

> This exception allows for greater convenience in situations where travelers are returning by common transport and cannot or do not wish to submit a written declaration.

#### **3. Reporting on Behalf of a Child (Subsection 3)**
If the goods are intended for the **exclusive use or benefit of a child under the age of reason** (i.e., too young to make a report), the report may be made **on behalf of the child** by:
- The **parent** or **guardian** of the child.

This ensures that children are not unfairly burdened by the requirement to report goods.

### **Application of Exemption to Goods with Higher Duty Rates**

#### **Condition for Exemption Application (Subsection 4)**
When goods are classified under tariff items:
- 9804.10.00  
- 9804.20.00  
- 9804.30.00  

And their **combined value exceeds the exemption amount**, the exemption **must be applied to the goods subject to the highest rate of customs duty**.

> This means that if a traveler brings multiple items with different duty rates, the exemption applies only to the most heavily taxed category — not all items. For example, if a traveler brings a small piece of clothing (low duty) and a bottle of alcohol (high duty), the exemption would only apply to the clothing, not the alcohol — or vice versa, depending on the duty rate.

> This rule ensures that the exemption does not result in a blanket duty-free status for all goods, but rather is applied where it is most beneficial and consistent with tariff structure.

### **Exclusions (When the Exemption Does NOT Apply)**

The exemption **does not apply** in the following cases:

1. **Alcoholic Beverages**:
   - Imported by a person who has **not reached the minimum legal age** to purchase alcohol in the province where the customs office is located.
   - Example: In Ontario, the minimum age is 18; a person under 18 cannot claim exemption for alcohol.

2. **Tobacco or Vaping Products** (excluding "vaping product drugs"):
   - Imported by a person who has **not attained 18 years of age**.
   - This restriction applies even if the product is not for consumption or personal use.

> These exclusions are designed to protect public health and ensure age restrictions are respected, particularly in the context of alcohol and tobacco use.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on January 1, 1998**.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Simplify Re-entry for Travelers** | Reduces administrative burden for returning individuals by allowing duty-free entry of small personal items. |
| **Ensure Compliance with Age Restrictions** | Protects minors from importing alcohol or tobacco, which are regulated by age limits. |
| **Promote Fair Application of Exemptions** | Applies exemptions only to the most heavily taxed goods when multiple items are present. |
| **Provide Flexibility in Reporting** | Allows oral reporting in specific, common travel scenarios (e.g., returning by bus or plane). |

### **Conclusion**

The *Returning Persons Exemption Regulations* provide a practical and targeted exemption for returning Canadians who bring personal goods into the country, under strict conditions. The rules balance **convenience for travelers** with **regulatory integrity**, especially regarding the protection of minors from alcohol and tobacco imports.

By being based on a prior public announcement and not requiring formal publication, the regulations reflect a streamlined administrative approach. However, they remain grounded in clear legal authority and include important safeguards — particularly around age-related restrictions and the proper application of exemptions to high-duty items.

These regulations remain relevant in the context of international travel and customs policy, though they may be reviewed or updated in light of changing trade practices, health regulations, or technological developments in border control.
