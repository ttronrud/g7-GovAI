**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (Subsection 4(1) and Paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security and Safety, International Relations and National Defence), No. 2002-1**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
This exemption order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**. This provision allows for temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when such exemptions are necessary for **security, safety, international relations, or national defence**.

The order is specifically designed to authorize the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** and the **Canadian Forces** to operate without being subject to certain regulatory restrictions on radio communications during a defined period.

---

### **2. Scope of the Exemption**
The exemption applies to the following:

- **Applicable Provisions of the Radiocommunication Act**:
  - **Subsection 4(1)**: Prohibits the intentional interference with or obstruction of radiocommunications.
  - **Paragraph 9(1)(b)**: Prohibits the use of radio apparatus to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications in a manner that could disrupt services.

- **Exempt Entities**:
  - The **Government of Canada**, as represented by:
    - The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**
    - The **Canadian Forces**

- **Temporal Period**:
  - The exemption is effective from **June 17, 2002**, to **June 29, 2002** (a period of 13 days).

---

### **3. Geographical Limitation**
The exemption is **geographically restricted** to a specific area within the province of **Alberta**, defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following geographic coordinates:

- **50°45′N; 113°34′W**  
- **50°45′N; 115°30′W**  
- **51°6′N; 113°34′W**  
- **51°6′N; 115°30′W**

This area represents a defined region in central and southern Alberta, likely encompassing key military or security installations, or areas where national defence or security operations are being conducted.

> ⚠️ *Note*: The exemption does **not** extend beyond this quadrilateral. Any interference or obstruction outside this area is not authorized under this order.

---

### **4. Conditions for Use of Exemption**

#### **Section 2 – Exemption under Subsection 4(1)**
- The exemption applies **only if**:
  - The radio apparatus used is installed, operated, or possessed **specifically to carry out interference or obstruction** of a radiocommunication.
  - Such interference or obstruction is conducted **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of the Radiocommunication Act.
  - The purpose is **security, safety, international relations, or national defence**.

> This means that the use of interference must be **authorized, justified, and directly related** to one of these critical national interests. It is not a blanket power to interfere with any radio signal.

#### **Section 2 – Exemption under Paragraph 9(1)(b)**
- The exemption applies **only if**:
  - The radiocommunication is interfered with or obstructed **for the purpose of security, safety, international relations, or national defence**.

> This reinforces that the **purpose** of the interference must be clearly tied to national-level objectives, not for tactical, commercial, or operational reasons unrelated to public safety or security.

---

### **5. Principle of Minimization**
To ensure responsible and accountable use of the exemption, the order mandates that:

> *"Every reasonable effort shall be made to confine or restrict to the extent possible interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication referred to in subsection (1) to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies, and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives of the interference or obstruction."*

This principle emphasizes:
- **Spatial limitation**: Interference should be confined to the smallest possible geographic zone.
- **Frequency efficiency**: Only the necessary radio frequencies should be used.
- **Duration control**: Interference should last only as long as absolutely required.

This requirement helps prevent unnecessary disruption of civilian or commercial radio services and supports accountability and proportionality in national security operations.

---

### **6. Legal Effect and Enforcement**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- It is a **temporary and limited** exemption, not a permanent or general authorization.
- The exemption is **subject to sections 3 and 4 of the Radiocommunication Act**, which typically govern the conditions under which exemptions can be granted and the oversight mechanisms in place.

---

### **7. Purpose and Strategic Rationale**
The primary objectives of this order are:
- To allow **national security and defence agencies** to conduct necessary radio interference operations during a specific window.
- To support **operational readiness** in areas of strategic importance (e.g., military exercises, counter-terrorism, or emergency response).
- To maintain **national sovereignty and security** in the face of potential threats to communication systems.

This type of exemption is typically invoked during **crises, emergencies, or high-risk scenarios** where standard communication rules would hinder effective response.

### **Conclusion**
This exemption order is a **targeted, time-limited, and geographically restricted** authorization that enables Canadian security and defence agencies to conduct radio interference operations during a specific period in Alberta. It reflects the balance between maintaining public communication integrity and allowing essential national security measures to operate under exceptional circumstances. The order underscores the importance of **proportionality, necessity, and accountability** in any interference with radiocommunications, even in the name of national defence.

It serves as a model for how regulatory frameworks can support national security while still protecting the broader public interest through strict procedural and operational safeguards.
