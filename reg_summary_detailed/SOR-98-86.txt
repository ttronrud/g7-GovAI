### 🔹 **5. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **Support Domestic Manufacturing**  
   Encourage Canadian producers to manufacture outerwear apparel by reducing the cost of raw materials (greige fabrics).

2. **Promote Industry Competitiveness**  
   Help Canadian manufacturers compete with imported outerwear by reducing input costs.

3. **Stimulate Growth in the Outerwear Sector**  
   Particularly benefit small and medium-sized producers who may otherwise struggle with high import costs of raw materials.

4. **Targeted Support**  
   Focus on **greige fabrics** (raw materials) rather than finished goods, ensuring that the subsidy supports the upstream production chain.

### 🔹 **6. Key Observations and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Phased Reduction in Remission** | Shows a policy shift from full support to more gradual, sustainable support over time. |
| **2008 Exception (75%)** | A notable increase in remission due to a two-part structure (50% + 25%), possibly to boost production during a period of market volatility. |
| **Cap Based on 1995 Remission** | Limits long-term financial benefit, ensuring fiscal responsibility. |
| **Three-Year Claim Window** | Encourages timely compliance and reduces administrative burden on the government. |
| **Exclusivity to Outerwear** | Ensures funds are used for specific, high-value products, not general textile manufacturing. |

---

### 🔹 **7. Practical Application**

- A Canadian producer (e.g., Doubletex Inc.) importing greige fabric from abroad in **2007** would be eligible for **75% remission** on the customs duty paid.
- If the producer imports $100,000 worth of greige fabric in 2007, they would receive a remission of **$75,000**.
- The producer must **file a claim with the Minister of National Revenue within 3 years** of import (i.e., by December 31, 2010).
- The total remission in any given year (e.g., 2012) cannot exceed the total remission amount received in **1995**.
