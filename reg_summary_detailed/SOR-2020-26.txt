### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The *Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback* (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) is officially listed as an **endangered species** under *Part 2 of Schedule 1* to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and is protected under federal law.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   A formal recovery strategy for this species was developed and has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy identifies the specific areas—known as *critical habitat*—that are essential for the survival and recovery of the species. These areas are defined as the places where the species depends on specific environmental conditions to complete key life cycle processes (e.g., spawning, feeding, shelter).

3. **Jurisdictional Consideration:**  
   The regulation explicitly confirms that **no portion of the critical habitat identified in this Order falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA**. This provision protects areas that are subject to special Indigenous rights or land claims agreements, particularly those involving wildlife management. By affirming that the critical habitat is not in such a location, the regulation avoids triggering additional legal obligations related to Indigenous land use rights under SARA.

4. **Consultation with Indigenous Wildlife Management Boards:**  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFDO) determined that the proposed critical habitat area **may fall within the jurisdiction of a wildlife management board** established under a **land claims agreement**. In response, the Minister **consulted with the relevant wildlife management board** as required under **subsection 58(8)** of SARA. This consultation ensures that Indigenous rights and traditional responsibilities are respected and that any potential impacts on Indigenous wildlife management are considered and addressed.

### **Legal Basis for the Order**

The Order is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Section 58(4):** Grants the Minister the authority to designate critical habitat for a listed species, based on the recovery strategy and scientific assessment.
- **Section 58(5):** Requires that the designation of critical habitat be made in a way that respects existing land use rights, including those under land claims agreements, and that the Minister must consult with relevant Indigenous authorities when necessary.

Additionally, **subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback, meaning that the designated area is legally recognized as essential for the species’ recovery and is subject to protection under the Act.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Designation of Critical Habitat:**  
  The Order formally identifies and designates specific geographic areas within Paxton Lake as the **critical habitat** for the *Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback*. These areas are those essential for the species’ survival and recovery, as defined in the recovery strategy.

- **Legal Effect:**  
  Once registered, the Order becomes legally binding and establishes that the designated areas are protected under SARA. Any actions that may destroy, degrade, or adversely affect this critical habitat are prohibited or require a permit unless authorized under the Act.

- **Effective Date:**  
  The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Government of Canada. This ensures immediate legal effect upon official publication.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Conservation Objective:**  
  The primary goal is to ensure the long-term survival and recovery of the *Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback*, a rare and localized population of a species that is already under significant threat.

- **Ecological Protection:**  
  By legally protecting its critical habitat, the Order safeguards the specific environmental conditions (e.g., water quality, temperature, depth, vegetation, and spawning substrates) that the species depends on.

- **Indigenous Engagement and Compliance:**  
  The Order reflects a commitment to **cooperative governance** and **Indigenous consultation**. The fact that the Minister consulted a wildlife management board demonstrates compliance with SARA’s requirement to respect Indigenous rights and responsibilities in the management of wildlife.

- **Transparency and Accountability:**  
  The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the *Species at Risk Public Registry* ensures that the public and stakeholders have access to the scientific basis for the designation, promoting transparency and public trust.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a formal, legally binding step in the recovery of the *Paxton Lake Limnetic Threespine Stickleback*. It designates specific areas as critical habitat under the *Species at Risk Act*, based on scientific evidence and recovery planning, while ensuring compliance with Indigenous rights and land claims through prior consultation. The Order supports conservation efforts, strengthens legal protections for the species, and exemplifies the integration of science, Indigenous engagement, and environmental protection in Canadian wildlife policy.

**Note:**  
This Order is part of a broader framework under SARA aimed at preventing species extinction and promoting biodiversity. It serves as a foundational step in the recovery process, which may include habitat restoration, monitoring, and ongoing management plans.
