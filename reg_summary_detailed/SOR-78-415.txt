**Detailed Summary of the Canada Cycle and Motor Company Limited Enterprise Development Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Purpose**  
The regulations are issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and the Treasury Board. This action is authorized under:

- **Section 7 of the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce Act**, which grants the government the power to make regulations related to enterprise development programs.
- **Vote 1, Vote L25, and Vote L30 of Appropriation Act No. 3, 1977**, which provide the financial authorization (appropriation) necessary to fund the program and related expenses.

The purpose of these regulations is to establish specific provisions governing **Enterprise Development Program Assistance** provided to **Canada Cycle and Motor Company Limited (CCMCL)**, a Canadian business involved in the manufacturing and distribution of cycles and motor vehicles.

The regulations are officially titled:  
**"Canada Cycle and Motor Company Limited Enterprise Development Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

**2. Definitions and Interpretation**  
All words and expressions used in these regulations are interpreted in the same way as they are defined in the broader **Enterprise Development Regulations**. This ensures consistency and clarity in application across related programs and contexts.

**3. Key Provision: Insurance Fee Payment for Private Lenders**  
A significant and specific provision in these regulations modifies the standard insurance fee payment structure for private lenders providing loans to CCMCL.

**Standard Rule (General Principle):**  
Under normal circumstances (as per subsection 37(2) of the Enterprise Development Regulations), the insurance fee payable by a private lender on loans **not exceeding twelve million Canadian dollars in aggregate** to CCMCL is **to be paid in advance to the Board** (the Board of Directors or governing body of the enterprise development program) in **semi-annual instalments**.

**Exception for a Specific Period:**  
However, a special provision applies to the period from **March 31, 1978, to September 30, 1979**:

- The insurance fees for this period **shall be paid in six semi-annual instalments**, beginning on **March 15, 1980**.

> This is a notable delay in payment — despite the fees being incurred during the years 1978–1979, the first instalment is not due until March 15, 1980. This may reflect administrative or financial planning considerations, such as budgetary timing, fiscal year alignment, or the need for delayed disbursement to manage cash flow or fund availability.

**4. Interpretation and Implications**  
- This regulation demonstrates a **tailored approach** to financial support for a specific company (CCMCL), allowing flexibility in how loan-related insurance fees are managed.
- The exemption for the 1978–1979 period suggests that the government or the enterprise development program may have faced operational or financial challenges during that time, or that the timing of fee collection was being adjusted for administrative convenience.
- The requirement to pay insurance fees in advance to the Board implies that the Board has a role in overseeing and managing the financial obligations of private lenders under the enterprise development program.

---

**5. Scope and Applicability**  
These regulations apply specifically to:

- Loans to **Canada Cycle and Motor Company Limited** (CCMCL) that do not exceed **$12 million in aggregate**.
- Private lenders who provide such loans and are required to pay insurance fees under the Enterprise Development Program.
- The timing and method of payment of those insurance fees.

---

**Conclusion**  
The Canada Cycle and Motor Company Limited Enterprise Development Regulations provide a structured, yet flexible, framework for managing insurance fees associated with private lending to CCMCL. By allowing semi-annual advance payments and introducing a delayed payment schedule for a specific period (1978–1979), the regulations reflect both the standard practices of enterprise development funding and the need for practical, time-sensitive financial management. The rules ensure transparency, accountability, and consistency in the administration of financial support to this industrial enterprise during a period of economic and industrial development in Canada.

These regulations are historical in nature, reflecting government policy and financial mechanisms from the late 1970s. They are not applicable in current regulatory frameworks and should be interpreted in the context of their original legislative and economic environment.
