## **III. Key Provisions on Residency, Coverage, and Benefit Entitlement**

### **A. General Rule: Employment and Coverage**
> **Principle**: A person employed in one country is generally subject only to the legislation of that country.

#### Exceptions:
1. **Temporary Assignments (≤5 years)**  
   - If a person is sent by an employer from one country to the other for ≤5 years, they are treated as if employed in the **originating country**.
   - Employers and affiliated/subsidiary companies are considered one entity under national law.

2. **Self-Employment**  
   - A person who is self-employed in the other country (or both) and who ordinarily resides in one country is subject only to the legislation of the **first (residence) country**.

3. **Cross-Border Self-Employment**  
   - If the same activity is classified as self-employment in one country and employment in the other, the rules in **paragraph 4** apply when the person is a resident of the first country; otherwise, the general employment rule applies.

---

### **B. Crew Members of Ships or Aircraft**
> A crew member who would otherwise be subject to both countries is treated as follows:
- **If the person ordinarily resides in Canada**: Subject only to **Canada’s legislation**
- **If the person ordinarily resides in Korea**: Subject only to **Korea’s legislation**

> This provision prevents double coverage and ensures consistency based on residence.

---

### **C. Exceptions to General Rules**
- The competent authorities (Canada and Korea) may **agree to grant exceptions** for specific individuals or groups.
- Any affected person must still be subject to the legislation of **only one** of the two countries.

---

## **IV. Benefit Calculations and Credit Rules**

### **A. Credit of CPP Contributions in Korea**
- A Canadian citizen working in Korea who contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** during their stay:
  - Those periods are **counted as periods of residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants **who are not employed or self-employed in Korea**.

> **Conditions**:
- Contributions must be made due to **employment or self-employment**.
- The period must be **credited under the CPP**.

### **B. Credit of Korean Coverage in Canada**
- A Korean national working in Canada who contributes to Korea’s pension system:
  - These periods are **not counted** as residence in Canada **if** the person is not covered under CPP or provincial pension plans due to employment/self-employment.

> **Exception**: A month of coverage under Korea’s system completed **after the age of eligibility** for CPP residence credits is considered a month of residence in Canada.

---

### **C. CPP Coverage in Korea**
- If a person is **not eligible** for Korean benefits due to insufficient coverage **under Korea’s own system**, the Korean agency may **credit 12 months of coverage per year** of CPP contributions certified by Canada.

> **Condition**: The person must have completed **at least 12 months** of coverage under Korea’s system to qualify for this credit.

---

### **D. Determining Benefit Amounts in Korea**
1. **Basic Pension Amount**:
   - Calculated as if all periods of coverage (Canada + Korea) were completed under **Korea’s system**.
   - Based on the person’s **average monthly income** during coverage under Korea.

2. **Partial Benefit Calculation**:
   - The actual benefit is calculated as a **proportion** of the Basic Pension Amount:
     $$
     \text{Partial Benefit} = \left( \frac{\text{Duration of Korea coverage}}{\text{Total duration of both coverage}} \right) \times \text{Basic Pension Amount}
     $$

> This ensures fairness in benefit allocation based on actual contribution history.

---

### **E. Termination of Entitlement via Korea’s System**
- A person who gains sufficient coverage under Korea’s system to qualify for an **equal or higher benefit without using the CPP credit** will **lose the right to the CPP-based benefit**.

---

### **F. Totalizing Provisions (for Old Age Security - OASA)**

> Allows individuals to accumulate periods of residence or coverage from both countries to meet eligibility thresholds.

#### For OASA:
- **Eligibility**: A person may be eligible for an OASA pension if total residence in Canada (including periods in Korea) meets the minimum required.
- **Only periods of residence completed on or after January 1, 1988** are counted.
- A month of coverage under Korea that occurs **after the age of eligibility** for residence credits is treated as a month of residence in Canada.

#### For CPP:
- A calendar year that includes **at least three months of coverage** under Korea’s system is counted as **one year of CPP contributions**.

### **G. Special Cases: Persons Outside Canada**

> Applies to individuals who would otherwise be eligible for Canadian benefits but have not resided in Canada long enough.

- **Old Age Security (OASA)**:
  - A person outside Canada is entitled to OASA **only if** their totalized periods of residence (in Canada and Korea) meet or exceed the **minimum residency requirement** for receiving a pension outside Canada.

- **Spouse’s Allowance and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**:
