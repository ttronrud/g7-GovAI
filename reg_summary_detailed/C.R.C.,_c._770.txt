**Detailed Summary of the I.O.S. Income Tax Remission Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **I.O.S. Income Tax Remission Order** and may be cited as such. It is a statutory instrument designed to provide a formal remission (i.e., forgiveness or exemption) of certain income taxes under the *Income Tax Act* for specific entities and individuals related to a particular corporation.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **"Act"**
- Refers to the *Income Tax Act* (Loi), which is the primary legislation governing taxation in Canada. All tax-related terms and provisions in this Order are interpreted in accordance with the Act unless otherwise specified.

#### **"I.O.S."**
- Stands for **I.O.S. Ltd.**, and includes any corporation, trust, legal entity, or other organization that is:
  - **Directly or indirectly controlled by or affiliated with I.O.S. Ltd. as of July 29, 1973**, or
  - **Subsequently created or acquired after that date** (including any entity formed after July 29, 1973).
- Specifically named entities included under "I.O.S." are:
  - Fund of Funds Limited  
  - I.O.S. Growth Fund Limited  
  - Fund of Funds Sterling Limited  
  - I.I.T., an International Investment Trust  
  - Investment Properties International Limited  
- Additionally, any entity that **acquires the assets** of any of the above-mentioned corporations, trusts, or affiliates is also included in the definition of "I.O.S."

> This broad definition ensures that not only the original entities but also any successor or successor-in-interest (e.g., through asset acquisition) are covered under the remission.

#### **"Liquidator"**
- Defined in three key categories:
  1. **Any person appointed under Canadian provincial or federal law** as a liquidator, receiver, or trustee of I.O.S. (the primary liquidator).
  2. **Any person (including directors, officers, employees, or agents)** who is appointed by a liquidator to act as an agent or trustee on behalf of that liquidator.
  3. **Any person ordinarily resident in Canada** who acts as an agent or trustee on behalf of a liquidator, receiver, or trustee of I.O.S. — **excluding** those who are themselves liquidators, receivers, or trustees under paragraph (a).

> This definition ensures that individuals acting in a representative or administrative capacity during a liquidation process are included in the scope of the remission.

### **3. Scope of Remission**

The Order grants a **full remission of income taxes** to the following parties **before any payment is made or liability arises**:

- **I.O.S. Ltd.** itself  
- **Any shareholder or unitholder of I.O.S.**  
- **Any other person** (including third parties)

**But only for taxes that arise or would arise due to:**

1. **The appointment of a liquidator** to manage I.O.S., or  
2. **The exercise of control over I.O.S.** or any action taken by a liquidator in respect of I.O.S.

> This means the remission applies **specifically** to income taxes that result from the **liquidation process** or the **transfer of control** of I.O.S. to a liquidator.

---

### **4. Key Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Remission is retroactive in nature**: It applies to taxes that are *exigible* (i.e., due and payable) under the Income Tax Act, even if those taxes were not yet paid or formally assessed — as long as they arose from the liquidation or control transfer events.
  
- **No remission for other tax events**: The remission is **limited** to taxes arising solely from:
  - The appointment of a liquidator, or
  - The liquidator’s exercise of control or actions in managing I.O.S.

  Taxes arising from ordinary business operations, profits, dividends, or other unrelated activities are **not** covered.

- **Pre-payment condition**: The remission is granted **before payment is made** and **before liability arises**, meaning the taxpayer must not have already paid or been assessed for the tax in question.

- **Exclusivity of scope**: The remission is not a general tax relief. It is a targeted measure to address the financial and administrative burden imposed on I.O.S. and its stakeholders during the liquidation process.

---

### **5. Purpose and Policy Rationale**

This Order appears to be a **special tax relief measure** enacted to:
- Mitigate the adverse tax consequences of a corporate liquidation.
- Prevent the imposition of income taxes on entities and individuals involved in the winding-down of I.O.S. due to the legal and operational changes associated with liquidation.
- Provide clarity and certainty to stakeholders (shareholders, unitholders, agents, and trustees) during a transitional period.

It reflects a policy choice to recognize that **the act of liquidation or transfer of control** may trigger tax obligations that are disproportionate or unjust in the context of corporate dissolution.

---

### **6. Legal Interpretation and Enforcement**

- Unless otherwise stated, all terms and expressions in this Order are interpreted **in accordance with their meaning in the Income Tax Act**.
- The Order is enforceable by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as a formal directive under the Act, and taxpayers may rely on it to claim tax remission.
- The remission is **not a refund**, but a **waiver of liability** — meaning the tax is not assessed or collected despite being due.

### **7. Conclusion**

The **I.O.S. Income Tax Remission Order** is a targeted, limited, and time-bound tax relief provision that:

✅ Exempts I.O.S. and its shareholders/unitholders from income tax liability  
✅ Specifically applies to taxes arising from the **appointment of a liquidator** or the **exercise of control by a liquidator**  
✅ Is effective **before any payment or assessment** occurs  
✅ Applies to a defined group of entities and individuals linked to I.O.S. as of July 29, 1973 or thereafter  
✅ Is limited in scope and does not extend to other tax events or general income

This Order serves as a protective mechanism during corporate liquidation, ensuring that the financial impact of such events does not unfairly burden stakeholders under the Income Tax Act.

**Note**: This Order should be read in conjunction with the *Income Tax Act* and relevant CRA guidance. It is not a general tax relief measure and is strictly applicable to the circumstances described.
