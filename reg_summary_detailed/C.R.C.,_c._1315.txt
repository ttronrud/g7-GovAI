**Detailed Summary of the International Joint Commission Immunity Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
This regulation is officially titled the *International Joint Commission Immunity Order* and may be cited as such. It establishes the legal framework governing the immunity of the International Joint Commission (IJC) and its personnel from legal processes in Canada.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
- **"Convention"**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, which provides the legal basis for immunity granted to international organizations and their officials. This Convention is the foundation upon which the immunity rights in this Order are built.  
- **"Organization"**: Refers to the *International Joint Commission (IJC)*, an international organization established under the *1909 Boundary Waters Treaty* between Canada and the United States. The IJC’s primary mandate is to manage and protect shared waters and ensure compliance with the treaty.

---

**3. Immunity of the Organization**  
- The IJC is granted **immunity from all forms of legal process** in Canada to the extent necessary for the performance of its official functions.  
- This immunity is **not absolute** and is subject to a critical exception:  
  - The immunity **does not apply** to legal proceedings that were **already commenced before this Order was made**.  
  - This means that any pre-existing lawsuits or judicial actions against the IJC are not barred by this Order and may proceed in Canadian courts.

---

**4. Immunity of Commissioners and Staff**  
- The **Commissioners** and **members of the staff** of the IJC are granted **immunity from all forms of legal process** in Canada in respect of:  
  - Words spoken or written; and  
  - Acts performed in their official capacity.  
- This immunity is derived from **Article V of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**.  
- The immunity is **not absolute** and may be **waived expressly** in any particular case. That is, if a Commissioner or staff member voluntarily agrees to be subject to legal process (e.g., through a written waiver), then immunity is forfeited in that specific instance.

---

**5. Immunity of Experts Performing Missions**  
- Experts who are temporarily assigned to perform missions on behalf of the IJC are granted **immunity in Canada** to the extent necessary to ensure the **independent and effective exercise of their professional functions**.  
- This immunity covers:  
  - Words spoken or written; and  
  - Acts carried out during the course of their mission.  
- The basis for this immunity is **Article VI of the Convention**, which extends similar protections to experts engaged by international organizations.  
- Like the other immunity provisions, this immunity is **conditional** and may be **waived expressly** in any particular case.

---

**6. Limitations and Exceptions**  
- The immunity granted under this Order **does not extend to proceedings that were initiated prior to the coming into force of this Order**.  
- This limitation ensures that the IJC and its personnel are not shielded from legal accountability for actions or omissions that occurred before the Order was enacted, preserving the principle of legal accountability for historical actions.

---

**7. Purpose and Legal Rationale**  
The Order is designed to:  
- Enable the IJC to carry out its duties effectively by protecting its officials from undue interference by Canadian courts or legal processes.  
- Ensure that Commissioners, staff, and experts can perform their duties without fear of being sued or subjected to legal scrutiny for official actions or communications.  
- Maintain the independence and integrity of the IJC, which is critical to its role in managing shared water resources between Canada and the United States.  

The use of the *United Nations Convention* as a model provides a well-established international legal framework, ensuring consistency with global norms on diplomatic and official immunity.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *International Joint Commission Immunity Order* grants comprehensive but conditional immunity to the IJC and its personnel—both in its institutional capacity and in the individual capacities of its Commissioners, staff, and mission experts. The immunity is essential for the organization’s operational independence, particularly in the context of cross-border environmental and water management. However, it is clearly limited by:  
- The prohibition of immunity for pre-existing legal proceedings;  
- The requirement that immunity may be waived in specific cases;  
- The reliance on established international treaty law (the UN Convention).  

This Order balances the need for operational freedom with the accountability required in the Canadian legal system.
