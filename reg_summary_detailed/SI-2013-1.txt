**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Forestry Revitalization Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The **British Columbia Forestry Revitalization Remission Order** is issued under the authority of **section 23a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1999, c. 31, s. 102; R.S., c. F-11)**. This provision allows the Governor in Council (effectively the provincial government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to make orders that provide remission (i.e., relief or forgiveness) of income tax liabilities in the public interest.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **provide tax remission to certain taxpayers** who have been affected by the **Forestry Revitalization Trust (FRT)** program, specifically those who received financial support through the **2011 Contractor Mitigation Account Subtrust**. The remission is designed to address the tax consequences of payments made to contractors under this mitigation program.

### **2. Key Definitions**

Several key terms are defined in the Order to ensure clarity and consistency:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Income Tax Act*, which governs the taxation of individuals and businesses in British Columbia.

- **Declaration of Subtrust**:  
  A formal document dated **January 3, 2012**, that outlines the terms and conditions governing the **Subtrust**. This declaration establishes how the Subtrust operates, including the eligibility criteria, the nature of payments, and the allocation of funds.

- **Eligible Taxpayer**:  
  A taxpayer who meets the criteria set out in **section 2.04 of the Declaration of Subtrust**. These criteria determine who qualifies for the remission benefit.

- **FRT Contractor Mitigation Amount**:  
  A specific amount of money paid by the Subtrust to contractors or entities as part of the Forestry Revitalization Trust’s mitigation strategy. This amount is designed to compensate contractors for losses or reduced income due to forestry activities. The definition is found in **section 2.01 of the Declaration of Subtrust**.

- **Eligible Amount**:  
  An amount paid by the Subtrust to an eligible taxpayer for their **Eligible Income Tax**, as defined in **section 2.02 of the Declaration of Subtrust**. This amount must be attributable to an **FRT Contractor Mitigation Amount**. In essence, it is the portion of tax liability that is linked directly to a mitigation payment made under the FRT program.

- **Subtrust**:  
  The **2011 Contractor Mitigation Account Subtrust**, established on **January 3, 2012**, and operates as a subtrust within the broader **BC Forestry Revitalization Trust II**. This structure ensures that funds are managed and distributed according to specific rules and objectives related to forestry revitalization and contractor compensation.

> *Note: Unless otherwise specified, all terms used in this Order have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act.*

### **3. Scope of Remission**

The Order grants **remission of income tax** (and related interest and penalties) under the following conditions:

#### **A. Remission of Income Tax and Related Charges**
- **Who qualifies**: Each **eligible taxpayer**.
- **What is remitted**:  
  - The income tax paid or payable under **Part I of the Income Tax Act** for a given taxation year.  
  - Any **related interest and penalties** associated with that tax.
- **Condition**: The remission applies only to the portion of the tax, interest, or penalties that are **attributable to an eligible amount** paid by the Subtrust to or for the benefit of the taxpayer.

> In simpler terms: If a taxpayer received a payment from the Subtrust (as part of the FRT mitigation program), and that payment was linked to a specific tax liability, then that tax liability (and any interest or penalties tied to it) is forgiven.

#### **B. Remission of Interest and Penalties**
- Remission is also granted for **interest and penalties** related to income tax under Part I of the Act.
- Again, this applies **only to the portion** of interest or penalties that relate to income tax attributable to an **FRT Contractor Mitigation Amount** paid to or for the benefit of the taxpayer.

> This ensures that not only the principal tax liability is reduced, but also the financial burden of interest and penalties that often accumulate on overdue or unpaid taxes.

### **4. Key Principles and Implications**

- **Public Interest Justification**: The Order is made because it is in the public interest to provide relief. This reflects a policy decision to support forestry revitalization efforts and to assist contractors who may have faced economic hardship due to forestry operations.

- **Targeted Relief**: The remission is not broad or general. It is **specifically tied** to:
  - Payments made by the Subtrust (the 2011 Contractor Mitigation Account Subtrust).
  - Payments that are attributable to **FRT Contractor Mitigation Amounts**.
  - Taxpayers who meet the eligibility criteria defined in the Declaration of Subtrust.

- **Tax Relief Mechanism**: This is not a refund or a credit. It is a **remission**, meaning the tax liability is formally canceled or waived — effectively reducing the taxpayer’s obligation to pay the tax in question.

- **Temporal Limitation**: The Order applies to taxation years for which the eligible amount was paid by the Subtrust. It does not retroactively apply to all past years unless the payment occurred in the relevant year.

### **5. Practical Example**

Imagine a contractor in British Columbia who:
- Was part of a forestry project.
- Received a payment from the **2011 Contractor Mitigation Account Subtrust** (a mitigation amount under the FRT program).
- As a result of this payment, their income tax liability was reduced or altered.
- The amount of tax they owed (or would have owed) in a given year was directly attributable to that mitigation payment.

Under this Order:
- The contractor is entitled to **remission of the income tax** (and any interest or penalties) that were attributable to that mitigation payment.
- The government formally waives that portion of the tax debt.

### **6. Legal and Policy Significance**

- **Supports Forestry Revitalization Goals**: The Order aligns with broader environmental and economic policies aimed at revitalizing forest-dependent communities and supporting sustainable forestry practices.
- **Provides Economic Relief**: It helps offset financial burdens on contractors who may have faced economic loss due to forestry activities.
- **Clear Regulatory Framework**: By referencing the Declaration of Subtrust, the Order ensures that eligibility is based on clearly defined, transparent criteria.

### **Conclusion**

The **British Columbia Forestry Revitalization Remission Order** is a targeted, legally grounded mechanism that provides **tax relief to eligible contractors** who received mitigation payments under the BC Forestry Revitalization Trust program. It waives income tax, interest, and penalties attributable to specific mitigation amounts, thereby supporting economic stability in forestry-related sectors and advancing public policy goals related to sustainable forest management.

This Order exemplifies how provincial governments can use tax policy tools to address economic impacts of environmental programs, ensuring fairness and accountability while promoting long-term ecological and economic sustainability.
