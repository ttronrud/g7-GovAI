### **Detailed Summary of the Procurement Review Board Regulations**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**
The **Procurement Review Board Regulations** were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs**, under **Sections 15 to 18 and 21 of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (CUSAFTA Act)**. These regulations came into force on **January 1, 1989** and are formally known as the **Procurement Review Board Regulations** (S.C. 1988, c. 65).

These regulations establish the **procedures, powers, duties, and operational framework** for the **Procurement Review Board (Board)**, which is responsible for reviewing complaints related to government procurement processes in Canada.

#### **2. Definitions and Key Terms**

- **Act**: Refers to Part II of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, which sets out the framework for procurement transparency and fairness in public contracts.
  
- **Intervenor**: A person granted leave to participate in proceedings before the Board, typically a potential supplier or a party with a direct interest in the procurement process.

- **Send**: Defined as transmitting a document or information via hand delivery, registered mail, facsimile, or other electronic means capable of producing a printed copy at the recipient’s destination.

- **Chairman**: The chief executive officer of the Board, responsible for leadership and management.

- **Member**: A member of the Board who serves in a full-time or part-time capacity.

- **Potential Supplier**: An actual or prospective bidder whose economic interests are directly affected by the award or non-award of a contract.

> Note: The term "send" was repealed in 1990 (SOR/90-206, s. 1(E)), but it was included in the original text.

#### **3. Scope and Applicability**

- The regulations apply to **procurements related to contracts** referenced in **Section 15 of the Act**.
- The **prescribed class of contracts** is defined under **Article 1309 of the CUSAFTA Agreement** — specifically, **eligible goods**.
- **Exemptions**:
  - **Defence contracts** and **security-related contracts** (e.g., arms, ammunition, war materials, or items essential to national security) are **exempt** from the Act and these regulations **unless** they fall under the coverage of **Annex 1304.3** of the Agreement.
- *Definition of Defence/Security Contracts*: Contracts involving procurement of items indispensable to national defence or security.

---

#### **4. Time Periods and Calculations**

Time limits for filing complaints, responding, and submitting reports are strictly defined:

- **General Rule**:
  - The **first day of a period is not counted**, but the **last day is counted**.
  - If the period is **less than 8 days**, intervening Saturdays and Sundays/holidays are **not counted**.
  - If the period is **8 days or more**, intervening weekends and holidays **are counted**, **unless** the final day is a weekend or holiday — in which case, it is extended to the **next business day**.

> This ensures that timeframes are not artificially shortened due to non-working days, while still maintaining practicality.

---

#### **9. Filing and Processing of Complaints**

A complaint must meet specific criteria to be valid:

- Must be **in writing** and addressed to the Board.
- Must include:
  - Name, address, and phone number of the complainant.
  - Original signed complaint (or by representative).
  - Name, address, and phone number of the **governmental institution** responsible.
  - Solicitation and contract numbers (and contracting officer details if available).
  - Copies of all **relevant documents**.
  - A **concise, logical, and detailed** statement of factual and substantive grounds.
  - A **clear request** for a determination.
  - A **statement of the form of relief** sought (e.g., reinstatement, compensation).

> If a complaint fails to meet these requirements, the Board sends a **notice of deficiencies**.

- **Filing Deadline**:
  - If the basis of the complaint was known **before bid opening or closing**, it must be filed **before that date**, but **no later than 10 days after knowledge**.
  - In all other cases, the complaint must be filed **within 10 days** of when the basis was known or should have been known.
  - **Exception**: If a complaint was first filed with the government institution, a **subsequent complaint** filed within **10 days** of the institution’s denial of relief is considered valid — provided the initial complaint was filed within the required time limits.

> The Board may consider complaints filed **outside these time limits** if **good cause** is shown or if the complaint raises **significant systemic issues**.
