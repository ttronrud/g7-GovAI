The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> **[Repealed, 1998, c. 10, s. 201, see SI/2013-107]**

This indicates that a set of regulatory provisions — originally part of a statute (likely a provincial or federal act) — were **repealed (cancelled or abolished)** in **1998** under **Section 201 of Chapter 10** of that year’s legislation. The repeal was formally confirmed or updated in **Statutory Instrument 2013-107** (SI/2013-107), which serves as the official record of the change.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Repeal of Provisions**
- The specific provisions referenced were **repealed in 1998**.
- The repeal was enacted under **Section 201 of Chapter 10** of the relevant statute (likely a regulatory or administrative act).
- This means that the legal text or rules previously contained in those sections are no longer in force.

#### 2. **Legal Authority for Repeal**
- The repeal was formally recorded in **Statutory Instrument 2013-107**, issued in 2013.
- SI/2013-107 is a **modernizing or amending instrument** that updates the legal framework by removing outdated, obsolete, or superseded regulations.
- The reference to SI/2013-107 suggests that the repeal was not immediate upon 1998 but was formally recognized and published in a later statutory instrument, likely to ensure clarity and consistency in the current legal code.

#### 3. **Purpose of Repeal**
Although the original content of the repealed provisions is not provided in the text, the common reason for repealing such provisions is typically:
- Obsolescence (e.g., outdated rules no longer applicable to modern practices),
- Inconsistency with newer legislation,
- Duplication or redundancy,
- Ineffectiveness or impracticality in enforcement,
- Alignment with broader policy reforms.

Given that the same entry is repeated 100 times, it likely represents a **list of multiple sections or subsections** that were repealed under the same authority — possibly a long list of minor or technical provisions within a larger regulatory framework.

#### 4. **Current Status**
- **All listed provisions are now repealed and inoperative.**
- They do not form part of current law.
- Any reference to these provisions in existing legal documents or administrative processes should be treated as outdated or invalid.
- Legal practitioners, regulators, or government bodies must consult **current legislation and SI/2013-107** for the updated legal text.

#### 5. **Implications**
- Any actions, decisions, or contracts based on these repealed provisions may be invalid or unenforceable.
- Regulatory agencies must ensure that their policies and guidance are based on current, active statutes and instruments.
- The repeal serves as a step toward legal modernization and streamlining.
