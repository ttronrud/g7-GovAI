### **4. Geographic Description of the Land**
The parcel is described in a detailed, technical **metes-and-bounds format**, referencing topographic maps and geographic coordinates. The description begins at a specific point and proceeds through a series of directional lines and elevation references.

#### **Key Mapping Reference:**
- The boundaries are based on the **first editions of the National Topographic System (NTS)** maps produced by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (formerly Department of Mines and Technical Surveys), Ottawa.
- The referenced map sheets include:
  - Pangnirtung, Clearwater Fiord, Nedlukseak Fiord, Ekalugad Fiord, Home Bay, Okoa Bay, Padloping Island, Cap Dyer, and one unnamed fiord.
- Scale: **1:250,000**, which provides a broad-scale view suitable for boundary definition and land use planning.

#### **Geographic Coordinates and Landmarks:**
The boundary is defined by a sequence of directional lines and elevation points, starting at the summit of **Overlord Peak** and ending at a point near **Mount Fleming**. Key features include:
