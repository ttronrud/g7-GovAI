The Consular Fees (Specialized Services) Regulations, made under paragraph 19(1)(a)a of the Financial Administration Act, establish fees for specialized consular services provided by consular officers or locally engaged employees at Canadian missions abroad or outside them. The fees are set out in a schedule, with the amount depending on the type of service (e.g., swearing in witnesses, certifying documents, providing translation). A locally engaged employee is defined consistently with the Locally-Engaged Staff Employment Regulations.  

Fees are not payable in specific circumstances: when the service is provided to a destitute person or where humanitarian or compassionate grounds apply; when requested by a Canadian or foreign official in an official capacity; for naval vessels or aircraft of Commonwealth countries; for citizenship purposes under the Citizenship Act; or for government remuneration, pensions, or official business.  

These provisions were originally effective upon registration but were repealed by SOR/2010-122, s. 1 and s. 2, meaning the regulations are no longer in force. The repeal indicates that the current framework for consular fees has been replaced, and the referenced fees no longer apply. The regulations were intended to provide clarity on fee structures and exemptions but are now obsolete.
