**Detailed Summary of the Inspection and Search Defence Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 26, s. 64)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Inspection and Search Defence Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under **section 231.1 of the National Defence Act**. These regulations empower authorized military personnel to conduct inspections and searches within Canadian defence establishments, works for defence or materiel, and related facilities, in order to ensure **safety, security, discipline, health, hygiene, efficiency, and compliance with military standards**.

The regulations are designed to uphold operational integrity and protect personnel and infrastructure by enabling routine and necessary checks in accordance with the **custom and practice of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)**.

These regulations may be cited as the **"Inspection and Search Defence Regulations"**.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Controlled Area**  
   - Refers to any:
     - Defence establishment (e.g., military bases, training facilities),
     - Work site involved in defence or materiel production (e.g., manufacturing, research), or
     - Any area under the operational control of the Canadian Forces or the Department of National Defence.
   - This is the primary jurisdiction where the regulations apply.

2. **Designated Authority**  
   - Includes:
     - The officer in command or person in charge of a controlled area or any restricted area within it.
     - Any individual acting under the authority of that officer or person in charge.
   - This role grants the power to conduct inspections and searches within a controlled area.

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

- Applies to **all persons subject to the Code of Service Discipline**, which includes:
  - Canadian Armed Forces members (officers and non-commissioned members),
  - Personnel working under the Canadian Forces or the Department of National Defence.
- The regulations govern both **inspections** and **searches** within or around controlled areas.

---

### **Right to Conduct Inspections**

- **Who can conduct inspections?**  
  Officers or non-commissioned members may perform inspections for the purpose of maintaining:
  - Military standards of:
    - Health
    - Hygiene
    - Safety
    - Security
    - Efficiency
    - Dress and equipment (kit)

- **Scope of inspections:**  
  Inspections may be carried out on:
  - Any individual (officer or non-commissioned member),
  - Any item or equipment,
  - Any location within a controlled area or in quarters under the control of the Canadian Forces or the Department.

- **Basis for inspections:**  
  Must be conducted in accordance with the **custom or practice of the service**, meaning they must follow established military procedures and traditions, not arbitrary or personal discretion.

---

### **Search Requirements Upon Entry/Exit**

- **Mandatory Search Requirement:**  
  Any person entering or exiting a **controlled area** (or a restricted area within it) must, **on demand**, submit to a **warrantless search** of:
  - Their **person**
  - Their **personal property**

- **Refusal to Submit:**  
  If a person refuses to submit to a search when required:
  - The **designated authority** may **search them without a warrant**.
  - This search may include both person and personal property.

- **Use of Force:**  
  - A designated authority may use **only the amount of force necessary** to carry out the search.
  - Force must be proportionate and strictly limited to what is required to ensure compliance and safety.

---

### **Gender-Specific Search Provisions**

- **Except where immediate security or safety is at risk**, a search of a person must be conducted by:
  - A **person of the same sex**.
- This provision is intended to respect privacy and dignity, particularly in sensitive or intimate settings.
- The exception applies only when:
  - There are **reasonable grounds to believe** that an immediate search is required to:
    - Maintain security, or
    - Prevent danger to the safety of any person.

---

### **Search of Personal Property**

- A designated authority may search **personal property** located about a controlled area or within a restricted area **if**:
  - There are **reasonable grounds to believe** that the property:
    - Contains or may contain something that could:
      - Endanger the safety of any person within the controlled area,
      - Threaten security,
      - Pose a hazard (e.g., weapons, explosives, contraband).

- This power is **not broad or unlimited** — it is conditional and based on **specific, reasonable suspicion**.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Service Custom & Practice** | All inspections and searches must follow established military norms, not arbitrary or unauthorized actions. |
| **Safety & Security** | The primary goal is to protect personnel and facilities from threats, including weapons, hazardous materials, or unsafe conditions. |
| **Discipline & Compliance** | Enforced through the Code of Service Discipline, ensuring accountability and adherence to standards. |
| **Proportionality & Necessity** | Searches and inspections must be reasonable, necessary, and limited in scope. |
| **Respect for Privacy** | Gender-specific rules protect individuals’ dignity, especially in personal searches. |

---

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- **No warrant required** for inspections or searches — this is a key feature enabling rapid response and operational efficiency.
- However, **searches must be justified** by:
  - Reasonable grounds (e.g., suspicion of contraband, danger),
  - Immediate need for security or safety.
- **No blanket or random searches** are permitted without justification.
- The power is **not extended beyond the controlled area** or restricted zones.

---

### **Enforcement and Accountability**

- The **designated authority** (e.g., base commander, unit supervisor) holds the discretion to carry out inspections and searches.
- While the power is broad, it is **subject to accountability** through:
  - Internal military oversight,
  - Reporting mechanisms,
  - Compliance with the Code of Service Discipline.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Inspection and Search Defence Regulations* provide a **clear, structured, and lawful framework** for the Canadian Armed Forces to maintain safety, security, and operational readiness within defence establishments. By balancing the need for vigilance with respect for individual rights, the regulations:

- Allow for **routine, service-based inspections**,
- Enable **warrantless searches** under specific, justified circumstances,
- Protect individuals through **gender-based search rules** and **proportionality standards**,
- Ensure that all actions are consistent with **military tradition, operational necessity, and legal authority**.

These regulations remain a cornerstone of internal discipline and security within the Canadian defence system, particularly in high-risk or sensitive environments.
