**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Fresh Grape Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Ontario Fresh Grape Order** and may be cited as such. It serves as a statutory instrument under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (Act), establishing specific rules and powers related to the marketing of fresh grapes in Ontario.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal framework for regulating the marketing of farm products, including fresh grapes.

- **Board**: Denotes the **Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario** (Régie). This body has broad authority to regulate the marketing of fresh grapes in both interprovincial and export markets, and may exercise powers similar to those it holds within Ontario locally.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the **Ontario Fresh Grape Growers' Marketing Board** (Office de commercialisation). This specialized body is responsible for managing the marketing and economic interests of fresh grape producers in Ontario.

- **Fresh grapes**: Defined as grapes produced in Ontario that are **not used by processors for processing** (e.g., for making raisins or juice). This excludes grapes that are specifically diverted into processing operations. The term emphasizes the focus on **fresh market sales**.

- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan for fresh grapes established and amended over time under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, as well as any regulations made to implement or support that Plan. The Plan guides pricing, distribution, and market strategies.

- **Processing**: Defined broadly to include any activity involving the transformation of grapes into products such as:
  - Grape juice
  - Beverages
  - Spirits or wine
  - Bottling
  - Distilling
  - Fermenting (with sugar or sulfur dioxide or other chemicals)

This definition ensures that only grapes not used in such processing are considered "fresh grapes" under this Order.

### **3. Regulatory Authority and Scope**

#### **General Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**
Both the **Farm Products Marketing Board (Board)** and the **Ontario Fresh Grape Growers' Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** are empowered to regulate the **marketing of fresh grapes** in:
- Interprovincial trade (sales between provinces)
- Export trade (sales outside of Ontario)

For these purposes, they may exercise **all or any powers** that they have under the Act and the Plan **within Ontario**, including powers related to pricing, marketing, and enforcement — but now extended to out-of-province and international sales.

This means that the regulatory framework governing local marketing (e.g., pricing, quality standards, distribution) can be applied consistently in broader markets.

### **4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board**

A key provision grants the **Commodity Board** specific authority in relation to **levies and charges** on fresh grape producers and marketers.

#### **Authority to Impose Levies or Charges**
- The Commodity Board may:
  - Fix, impose, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of fresh grapes** within Ontario.

#### **Classification of Participants**
- The Board may **classify producers and marketers into different groups** (e.g., small farms, large growers, cooperatives).
- Different **levies or charges** can be set for each group based on factors such as production volume, market share, or type of operation.

#### **Use of Levies and Charges**
Funds collected through these levies may be used for:
- Establishing **reserves** (financial buffers for future market downturns)
- Covering **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of fresh grapes
- Facilitating **equalization or adjustment** among producers

This equalization mechanism is critical — it ensures that producers who may have had poor sales in a given period (due to market fluctuations, weather, or demand) are compensated or supported financially, while those who had strong sales may contribute surplus funds. This promotes **market stability and fairness** among producers.

#### **Periodicity of Equalization**
The Commodity Board may determine **when and for how long** such equalization or adjustment will occur — for example, annually or during specific market downturns.

---

### **5. Repealed Provision**
- A prior section (formerly included in the Order) that granted similar powers to the Commodity Board was **repealed** by **SOR/80-90** (Statutory Order 80-90). This indicates that the current version of the Order reflects updated or revised regulatory policy, possibly to streamline or modernize the levy system.

---

### **6. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of this Order are:
- To **stabilize the market** for fresh grapes in Ontario by managing supply and demand through structured pricing and financial support.
- To **protect producers** from market volatility by providing financial safeguards through levies and equalization.
- To ensure **fair and equitable participation** in interprovincial and export markets.
- To provide a **clear, enforceable framework** for the Commodity Board to manage the economic interests of fresh grape growers.

---

### **7. Key Implications**

- **Financial Responsibility**: Producers must pay levies based on their size or category, which may impact small or new growers.
- **Market Stability**: The equalization mechanism helps prevent large losses during poor harvest years or market crashes.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Classification of producers and use of funds must be transparent and governed by the Plan and regulations.
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: The Board and Commodity Board have discretion to adapt levies and equalization policies to changing market conditions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Ontario Fresh Grape Order** establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for the marketing of fresh grapes in Ontario. It empowers the **Commodity Board** to impose and manage levies on producers, classify them into groups, and use collected funds to stabilize the market, support producers, and ensure fair distribution of revenues. The Order supports economic resilience in the fresh grape sector by balancing market efficiency with producer protection — especially in interprovincial and export markets where price volatility can be significant.

This regulation is a key tool in the broader system of farm product marketing under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, designed to promote sustainable, equitable, and stable growth in Ontario’s fresh grape industry.
