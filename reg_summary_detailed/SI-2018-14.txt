The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-70" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 70 of 2018 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter — e.g., environmental, health, transport, or employment regulation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the original regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a statutory instrument is marked as "repealed," it means:

1. **Legal Status**: The regulation is no longer in force and has been formally removed from the legal framework.
2. **Reason for Repeal**: It may have been replaced by a newer, more comprehensive, or updated regulation, or it may have been deemed outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current legislation.
3. **Date of Repeal**: In this case, the repeal was enacted through SI/2018-70, which likely came into effect on a date specified in that instrument (commonly shortly after its publication).
4. **Public Record**: The repeal is typically published in the official government gazette (such as the Canada Gazette, the UK Statutory Instruments, or a national legislative journal), and the repeal is noted in legal databases or legislation repositories.

To provide a detailed summary, we would need the full title of the repealed regulation (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2018" or "Regulation on [Specific Topic]").

Therefore, the current available information confirms only that:

> **SI/2018-70 has been repealed**, meaning the regulation it previously repealed is no longer legally valid. A detailed summary of its original content cannot be provided without further details about the regulation’s name, subject, and purpose.

If you can provide the full title or subject of the regulation (e.g., "The Health and Safety at Work Regulations 2018"), I would be happy to assist in summarizing it or its historical context.
