### ✅ **2. Amended Article II – Application to Laws and Amendments**

This article governs how the agreement applies to **new or revised laws** in either country.

#### Key Changes:
- **Paragraph (1)(a)(ii)**:  
  - The year **1954** is replaced with **1986** — likely to reflect updated eligibility thresholds or policy changes.

- **Deletion of Paragraph (3)**:  
  The old paragraph was removed and replaced with two new ones:

  **New Paragraph (3)**:  
  > "Subject to paragraph (4), this Agreement shall also apply to laws which amend, supplement, consolidate, or supersede the laws specified in paragraph (1)."  
  → Ensures the agreement remains relevant even when domestic laws evolve.

  > "This Agreement shall apply to laws which extend the laws of a Contracting State to new categories of beneficiaries unless an objection on the part of that Contracting State has been communicated to the other Contracting State not later than three months following the entry into force of such laws."  
  → Allows flexibility for new benefit categories (e.g., for new types of workers), but requires **advance notice and objection rights**.

- **Paragraph (4) is renumbered as (5)**:

### ✅ **3. Amended Article V – Entitlement and Periods of Coverage**

This is one of the most significant and complex sections — it governs **how residency and coverage periods are counted** for OAS, CPP, and spouse benefits.

#### Key Changes and Additions:

##### 🔹 **Paragraph 2(a) – Employment Mobility (Work Abroad)**  
> A person sent by an employer from one country to work in the other is **subject only to the laws of the first country** (where they were employed), **provided** the period abroad does not exceed **60 months**.

- **Affiliated Companies**:  
  If the employer and its affiliated company (as defined by domestic law) are treated as one entity, the work abroad is still governed by the first country’s rules.

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Prevents double taxation or benefit entitlement in the second country due to temporary work assignments.

##### 🔹 **Deletion of Paragraph (9)**  
Removed entirely — likely to simplify the structure or reflect outdated provisions.

##### 🔹 **New Chapter 2 – Totalization of Coverage and Residency Periods**

This replaces the old Chapter 2 and introduces a **totalization system** to allow individuals to accumulate periods of residence or coverage from both countries to meet eligibility requirements.

###### Key Rules:

1. **Totalization Principle**:
   - A person's entitlement to benefits (e.g., OAS, CPP) is determined by **summing**:
     - Periods of residence in Canada (after January 1, 1952)
     - Periods of coverage under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
     - Periods of coverage under U.S. laws (as specified)

   - **Periods must not overlap**.

2. **Residency Periods (OAS)**:
   - Only periods of **residence in Canada on or after January 1, 1952** count.
   - If total residence is less than one year, **no benefit is payable** under OAS based on these periods.
   - **Exception**: A quarter of U.S. coverage (on or after 1952) **counts as 3 months of Canadian residence**.

3. **Coverage Periods (CPP)**:
   - A calendar year with **at least one quarter of U.S. coverage** counts as **one full year of CPP coverage**.

4. **Partial Pensions and Spouse Allowances**:
   - If a person is entitled to a **partial pension or spouse’s allowance** under OAS via totalization:
     - The amount is calculated **only on periods of residence in Canada (after 1952)** or those deemed under Article VI.
     - No benefit is paid if total residence is below one year.

5. **Benefits for People Outside Canada**:
   - A person outside Canada who would otherwise qualify for a **full pension** but lacks the required minimum residency in Canada may still receive a pension **if totalized residency meets the minimum threshold**.
   - **OAS pension** is only payable outside Canada if **total residency equals or exceeds** the minimum required for such entitlement.
   - **Spouse’s allowance and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)** are payable only **to the extent allowed by OAS Act**.

6. **CPP Benefit Calculation**:
   - **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on **pensionable earnings under CPP**.
   - **Flat-rate portion**: Calculated as:
     > (Flat-rate amount under CPP) × (Ratio of actual CPP coverage / minimum qualifying period)
     - The ratio **cannot exceed 1.0** (i.e., no benefit can exceed what would be due with full coverage).

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Creates a **fair and transparent system** for people with dual residency or work history, especially those who move between countries or work temporarily abroad.

### ✅ **4. Amended Article XII – Information Sharing**

This section strengthens cooperation between the two governments.

#### New Sub-Paragraph (b):
> "To the extent permitted by the laws which they administer, and any other relevant national statutes, communicate to each other any information necessary for the application of this Agreement."

- This allows **secure exchange of data** (e.g., employment records, coverage periods) to verify eligibility.
- Must comply with **national privacy and data protection laws**.

#### Redesignation of Existing Sub-Paragraphs:
- (b) → (c)  
- (c) → (d)  
- Maintains clarity and order.

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Ensures both governments can verify eligibility and process claims efficiently, while respecting domestic legal and privacy constraints.

---

### ✅ **5. Amended Article XIII – Mutual Assistance in Administration**

#### New Sentence Added:
> "In accordance with arrangements to be agreed upon pursuant to Article XII(a), the Competent Authorities and agencies may also assist each other in administering the laws to which this Agreement applies."

- Allows **mutual administrative support** (e.g., joint reviews, audits, or training).
- Supports smoother processing of claims and reduces administrative burdens.

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Enhances cooperation and operational efficiency between the Canadian and U.S. agencies.

### ✅ **6. Entry into Force and Duration**
