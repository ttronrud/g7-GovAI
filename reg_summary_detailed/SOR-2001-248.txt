### **Overview**

These **Commissioner’s Standing Orders** establish a formal, structured process for resolving grievances related to decisions, acts, or omissions made during the **classification of a position** within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

This process is designed to ensure fairness, accountability, and consistency in how positions are classified and reviewed, particularly when members believe errors or injustices have occurred.
