The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2009-230, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **SOR/2009-230, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  This means the regulation no longer exists or is in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent statutory instrument.

- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  **SOR/2009-230** (Statutory Instrument 2009-230) is a regulatory amendment or correction issued by the Government of Canada.  
  Section 1 of this instrument specifically **repeals** the previously referenced regulation.

- **Date of Repeal**:  
  The repeal took effect on the date the instrument was published in the *Canada Gazette*, which was **May 22, 2009** (the date of publication of SOR/2009-230).

- **Nature of the Regulation (Prior to Repeal)**:  
  While the specific content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the repeated reference to "SOR/2009-230, s. 1" suggests that the regulation in question was likely a minor or technical rule, possibly related to:
  - Administrative procedures,
  - Licensing,
  - Compliance requirements,
  - Or a procedural rule under a broader statute (e.g., related to environmental, health, or safety regulations).

  Without the original text, it is not possible to determine the exact subject or scope of the regulation that was repealed.

- **Purpose of the Repeal**:  
  Repealing a regulation typically occurs when:
  - The regulation is outdated or no longer relevant,
  - It conflicts with newer legislation,
  - It is redundant or overlaps with another rule,
  - Or it is being replaced by a more modern, comprehensive, or clearly worded regulation.

- **Legal Implications**:  
  Any actions, decisions, or compliance measures based on the repealed regulation are no longer legally binding. Entities must now comply with the current, active regulations that have replaced it (if any), or with general statutes that govern the subject area.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in your query is **no longer in effect**. It was **officially repealed on May 22, 2009**, by **SOR/2009-230, section 1**. There is no active legal content to summarize, as the regulation has been removed from the current regulatory framework.

> 🔍 **Recommendation**: To find the replacement or context, check the original statute under which the regulation was issued (e.g., *Fisheries Act*, *Safety of Navigation Act*, etc.) or consult the *Canada Gazette* or official government databases such as [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca).

If you can provide the **name of the original regulation** or the **related statute**, I can help identify what was repealed and what now governs that area.
