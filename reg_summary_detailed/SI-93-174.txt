**Regulation Summary: Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1991-414 and Designation of the Minister of Finance as the Minister for the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Petro-Canada Public Participation Act**, specifically pursuant to **subsection 2(1)** of that Act, which defines the role of the "Minister" responsible for administering the Act. The power to designate the Minister is exercised by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.

This action reflects a formal administrative adjustment to clarify or update the responsible minister responsible for overseeing public participation in decisions related to Petro-Canada, a major Canadian oil and gas company under federal jurisdiction.

**2. Revocation of Prior Order**  
The regulation formally **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1991-414**, dated March 1, 1991. This prior order had previously designated a different minister as the responsible Minister under the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. By revoking this order, the current government removes the previous designation and invalidates any administrative or procedural authority that stemmed from it.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Finance**  
The Governor General in Council designates the **Minister of Finance** as the **Minister for the purposes of the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act**. This means that the Minister of Finance now holds the official responsibility for:

- Ensuring compliance with the public participation requirements of the Act;
- Overseeing the implementation of public consultation processes related to Petro-Canada projects or decisions;
- Acting as the point of contact for stakeholders, regulatory bodies, and the public regarding public participation in Petro-Canada matters;
- Approving or reviewing public participation plans and related administrative decisions.

**4. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- This designation is not merely procedural; it establishes the **formal governmental responsibility** for public engagement in Petro-Canada-related activities.
- The choice of the Minister of Finance may reflect the broader financial and economic oversight role of that department, particularly given Petro-Canada’s status as a federally owned corporation with significant financial implications.
- The designation ensures continuity and clarity in governance, especially in cases where public participation is required under the Act (e.g., environmental assessments, project approvals, or operational changes).

**5. Legal Citation and Publication**  
- The regulation is published in **Statutes Canada (S.C. 1991, c. 10)** and appears in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, on page 1183**, under the reference **SI/91-40** (Statutory Instrument 1991-40).  
- This publication ensures that the regulation is officially notified to all stakeholders, including government departments, public agencies, and the general public.

**6. Implications**  
- The revocation and re-designation streamline administrative accountability and align the responsible minister with current government priorities.
- It may also signal a shift in policy focus or administrative structure, potentially reflecting changes in how federal public participation is managed in energy-related sectors.
- Stakeholders (e.g., Indigenous communities, environmental groups, or the public) may now direct their participation requests or concerns to the Minister of Finance through official channels.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation serves as a formal update to the ministerial responsibility framework under the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. By revoking an outdated designation and appointing the Minister of Finance as the official Minister, the government ensures clarity, accountability, and consistency in public engagement processes related to Petro-Canada. It reflects the administrative and political priorities of the time and reinforces the importance of transparent, inclusive decision-making in federal energy policy.
