---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
Each line is a reference to a regulation that has been **repealed**. The phrase "Repealed, SOR/2014-104, s. 44" means:
- The regulation in question was officially canceled.
- The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2014-104**, issued by the Government of Canada.
- Section 44 of that instrument specifically contains the legal provision that repeals the referenced rule(s).

#### 2. **What Does "Repealed" Mean?**
Repeal means the regulation is no longer in force. It is removed from the legal framework and cannot be applied, enforced, or cited. Any actions or obligations previously governed by the regulation are now governed by other applicable laws or are no longer valid.

#### 3. **SOR/2014-104 – Order in Council**
- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument*.
- **SOR/2014-104** is a regulatory document issued in 2014.
- It is typically used to implement or amend legislation passed by Parliament.
- In this case, it contains a repeal of certain provisions, likely from a prior regulation (e.g., a federal regulation under a statute like the *Canada Labour Code*, *Fisheries Act*, or another relevant act).

#### 4. **Section 44 of SOR/2014-104**
- Section 44 specifically lists the regulations being repealed.
- The repetition of this line suggests that **multiple provisions or subsections** were repealed under this section — possibly across different parts of a larger regulation or a series of related rules.
- Without the full text of SOR/2014-104, it's not possible to identify the exact regulation(s) being repealed, but the reference implies that **a number of rules were removed** due to redundancy, obsolescence, or changes in policy.

#### 5. **Why Was It Repealed?**
Common reasons for repealing regulations include:
- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
- A new, more comprehensive or effective regulation has been introduced.
- There was a change in policy or legislative intent.
- The regulation created administrative or legal confusion.
- It was found to be inconsistent with other laws.

#### 6. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- Any legal interpretation, enforcement, or compliance activities based on the repealed regulation are now invalid.
- Government agencies, employers, or individuals must refer to current, active regulations instead.
- The repeal may also trigger a need for updates in internal policies, training materials, or legal databases.

#### 7. **Limitations of This Summary**
- This summary does **not** provide the original content of the repealed regulation(s), as that would require access to the full text of the prior regulation and SOR/2014-104.
- The exact subject matter (e.g., employment standards, environmental protection, health and safety) cannot be determined from this list alone.
- The number of repeals (28 entries) may suggest a large number of provisions were affected, but without context, it remains speculative.
