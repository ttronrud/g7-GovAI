It appears that you've started a request to provide a detailed summary of a regulation, but the actual regulation text or content is missing from your message. Could you please paste or provide the full text of the regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the regulation, I will deliver a comprehensive, clear, and structured summary that includes:

- The purpose and scope of the regulation  
- Key definitions and terms  
- Applicable entities or jurisdictions  
- Required actions, obligations, or prohibitions  
- Penalties or enforcement mechanisms  
- Relevant deadlines or timelines  
- Any exceptions or exemptions  
- How it fits into broader regulatory frameworks  

Please share the regulation text so I can assist you effectively.
