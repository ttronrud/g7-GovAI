**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Variation of Telecom Decision CRTC 95-21 – Rate Rebalancing (Governor in Council Order)**

---

### **Background and Context**

On **October 31, 1995**, the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** issued **Telecom Decision CRTC 95-21**, titled *“Implementation of Regulatory Framework — Splitting of the Rate Base and Related Issues.”* A key component of this decision was the **rate rebalancing plan**, designed to address the financial sustainability of local telephone services following the split of the telecommunications rate base between **local (access) and long-distance services**.

Under the original plan:
- **Local rate increases** of **$2 per month** were to be implemented.
- These were to be **offset by reductions in long-distance rates**.
- The rebalancing was to take effect on **January 1, 1996**, and again on **January 1, 1997**.
- The Stentor companies (except Maritime Tel & Tel Limited) were directed to file tariff applications outlining these proposals.

This framework aimed to ensure that **local telephone services**, which serve essential public needs and are often less profitable due to their infrastructure costs, would receive adequate financial support through **revenue transfers** from long-distance services — a mechanism known as the **Competitive Access Tariff (CAT)**.

### **Petitions Challenging the Original Decision**

Several stakeholders submitted petitions seeking to **vary or rescind** the original rate rebalancing plan:

1. **Stentor Companies (excluding Manitoba Telephone System)**:
   - Requested that the **reduction in long-distance revenues be eliminated**.
   - Argued that such reductions would harm the long-distance market, which was transitioning to a more competitive environment.

2. **AGT Limited**:
   - Requested that the **rate of return on equity** used to calculate the subsidy to local services be based on the **actual company-wide forecast rate of return**, rather than the rate specified by the CRTC.
   - This would have altered how much long-distance services would contribute to local services, potentially increasing the subsidy.

3. **People for Affordable Telephone Service (PATS)**:
   - Petitioned to **rescind the entire rate rebalancing portion** of the Decision.
   - Argued that the plan was unjust, potentially leading to higher local phone bills and undermining affordability.

### **Government Response and Regulatory Review**

In accordance with the **Telecommunications Act (S.C. 1993, c. 38)**:
- The **Minister of Industry** published a **notice of receipt** of the petitions in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **December 9, 1995**.
- The Minister provided an opportunity for **provincial consultation**, as required by **section 13** of the Act.

After careful consideration of all petitions, the **Governor in Council** (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry) reached the following conclusions:

---

### **Key Findings and Justifications**

1. **Rate Rebalancing Is Appropriate**  
   - The Government agrees with the CRTC that **rebalancing is necessary** to ensure that local services receive sufficient financial support.
   - The rebalancing maintains the **link between competitive and utility segments** of the telecommunications market, which is essential to the overall split-rate base framework.

2. **Use of Actual Company-Wide Forecast Rate of Return Is Not Appropriate**  
   - The Governor in Council **rejects AGT Limited’s request** to use the actual company-wide forecast rate of return.
   - Reason: Doing so would **break the link** between the competitive and utility segments, undermining the core objective of the rate base split — to create a fair and sustainable financial structure that supports both innovation and universal access.

3. **Lifeline Program is Essential**  
   - The Government recognizes the need for **universal access** to affordable telephone services.
   - To ensure affordability, a **lifeline program** will be introduced to support low-income or vulnerable subscribers, protecting the principle of equitable access across Canada.

4. **No Need for Long-Distance Rate Reductions**  
   - The long-distance market is in transition to a **competitive environment**.
   - Mandating further reductions in long-distance rates would:
     - **Undermine market-driven pricing**.
     - **Reduce incentives for investment** in infrastructure, R&D, and innovative services.
   - In fact, **significant price reductions have already occurred** in the long-distance market, and further cuts would compromise the ability to sustain investment needed for future growth and service quality.

5. **Investment in the Telecommunications System is Critical**  
   - The Government emphasizes that **investment in research, development, and new services** is vital to achieving national telecommunications policy goals.
   - These goals, as set out in **paragraphs 7(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), and (h)** of the Telecommunications Act, include:
     - Promoting universal access.
     - Encouraging innovation.
     - Supporting economic development.
     - Ensuring affordability and reliability of services.

### **Final Regulatory Action: Variation of Telecom Decision CRTC 95-21**

The Governor in Council **varies** the original Decision CRTC 95-21 in the following specific ways:

#### 1. **Replacement of Paragraph on Page 24**
> *"In light of the above considerations, the Commission finds it appropriate that the telephone companies proceed with a rate rebalancing plan. As in Decision 94-19, the contribution component of the CAT should be reduced by an amount equivalent to the revenues derived from the local rate increases contained in the rebalancing plan."*

- This reaffirms that the rebalancing is acceptable and that the **CAT contribution will be reduced** by the amount generated from local rate increases.
- It maintains the **financial linkage** between local and long-distance services, preserving the integrity of the split-rate base model.

#### 2. **Replacement of Paragraph on Page 25**
> *"The Stentor companies (other than MT&T) are directed to file, in the form of tariff applications, rate rebalancing proposals consisting of local rate increases of $2 per month, to take effect January 1 of each of the years 1996 and 1997, and a new proposed CAT, reflecting a reduced contribution charge equivalent to the revenues derived from the local rate increases. These proposals are to be filed no later than seven days after the making of this Order and December 1, 1996, respectively."*

- **Local rate increases remain at $2/month**, effective January 1, 1996 and 1997.
- A **new CAT** (Competitive Access Tariff) must be proposed, with a **reduced contribution charge** equal to the revenue from the local rate increases.
- **Filing deadlines**:
  - First filing: **Within 7 days** of the Order being issued.
  - Second filing: **By December 1, 1996**.

#### 3. **Replacement of Paragraphs on Page 26**
> *"The Commission would expect to give expeditious approval to rate rebalancing proposals."*

- The CRTC is expected to **review and approve** the proposals quickly to ensure timely implementation and minimize disruption.

### **Key Outcomes and Conclusions**

| Element | Outcome |
|-------|--------|
| **Rate Rebalancing** | **Retained and modified** — local rate increases of $2/month remain, with offsetting reductions in CAT contribution. |
| **Long-Distance Rate Reductions** | **Eliminated** — no further reductions in long-distance rates are required. |
| **Rate of Return Calculation** | **Rejected** — the use of actual company-wide forecast return is not permitted; Commission’s specified rate of return is preserved. |
| **PATS Petition** | **Rejected** — the rate rebalancing portion is **not rescinded**. |
| **AGT Limited Petition** | **Rejected** — the request to use actual forecast return is **not adopted**. |
| **Lifeline Program** | **Introduced** — to ensure universal access and affordability for all Canadians. |

### **Policy Implications and Significance**

- This variation reflects a **pragmatic balance** between:
  - Financial sustainability of local services.
  - Market competition in long-distance services.
  - Investment in future telecommunications innovation.
- It reinforces the **dual role** of the telecommunications sector: serving as a **public utility** (local access) and a **competitive market** (long-distance).
- The decision supports the **national policy objectives** of affordability, access, innovation, and investment.
- By preserving the link between competitive and utility segments, the regulation ensures that the **split-rate base model remains effective and stable**.

### **Conclusion**

The Governor in Council’s variation of **Telecom Decision CRTC 95-21** upholds the **core principle of rate rebalancing** while rejecting demands to eliminate long-distance rate reductions or alter the rate of return calculation. It maintains financial support for local services through **local rate increases**, with corresponding reductions in the CAT contribution, all within a framework that supports **market competition, investment, and universal access**. This decision is a critical step in Canada’s transition to a modern, competitive, and equitable telecommunications system.
