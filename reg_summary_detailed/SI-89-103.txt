### **Regulation Summary: Placement of Canadian Forces Personnel on Active Service under the North Atlantic Treaty**

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
This regulation enables Canada to fulfill its **obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO)** by placing officers and non-commissioned members (NCMs) of the Canadian Forces on **active service**. The decision is rooted in Canada’s commitment to collective defence, a core principle of the North Atlantic Treaty signed in 1949. Under this treaty, member nations agree to mutual defence in the event of an armed attack, and Canada’s participation in NATO operations requires the ability to deploy military personnel swiftly and effectively.

The regulation is specifically enacted to ensure that Canada can meet its **military commitments** in support of NATO operations—whether within Canada or abroad—by activating personnel from both the **Regular Force** and the **Reserve Force**.

---

#### **2. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under **paragraph 31(1)(b)** of the *National Defence Act* (R.S. 1985, c. 31 (1st Supp.), s. 60 (Sch. I, item 14)).

- **Section 31(1)(b)** empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence) to place members of the Canadian Forces on active service for specific purposes, including **collective defence**.
- This provision allows for the temporary activation of personnel to respond to international security threats or to support allied operations under NATO.

---

#### **3. Scope of the Regulation**

The regulation authorizes the placement of military personnel on active service in two distinct categories:

| **Force Component** | **Geographic Scope** |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Regular Force** | On active service **anywhere in or beyond Canada** |
| **Reserve Force** | On active service **anywhere beyond Canada** |

- **Regular Force**: Includes active-duty officers and non-commissioned members serving in the permanent, full-time component of the Canadian Armed Forces. They may be deployed domestically or internationally.
- **Reserve Force**: Comprises part-time personnel who are normally not on active duty. This regulation allows them to be activated for service **outside of Canada**, in support of NATO missions or other international operations.

> Note: The distinction in geographic scope reflects the differing roles and readiness levels of regular and reserve forces. The reserve force is not activated for domestic operations under this regulation, which limits its deployment to international missions.

---

#### **4. Key Objectives**
- **Fulfill NATO obligations**: Ensure Canada can contribute troops to NATO operations as required by treaty.
- **Enable rapid deployment**: Provide a legal mechanism to activate personnel quickly in response to defence-related emergencies or missions.
- **Maintain operational readiness**: Strengthen Canada’s ability to participate in joint military operations with allied nations.
- **Support international peace and security**: Facilitate Canada’s role in maintaining stability in NATO regions and beyond.

---

#### **5. Administrative Process**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, which is the formal executive authority of the Canadian government.
- It operates **on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence**, who assesses operational needs, security risks, and strategic requirements.
- This ensures that the deployment of personnel is both **strategic** and **legally sound**, with accountability at the highest level of government.

---

#### **6. Legal and Strategic Significance**
- This provision is a **critical tool** in Canada’s defence policy framework, allowing for flexible and responsive military action.
- It reflects Canada’s **commitment to collective security** and its role as a responsible member of NATO.
- The regulation supports **operational continuity**, enabling Canada to maintain a credible and deployable military force without requiring permanent changes to force structure or long-term mobilization.

---

#### **7. Limitations and Considerations**
- The regulation does **not** apply to domestic security operations (e.g., counter-terrorism or civil emergencies), which are governed by other legal authorities.
- Deployment is limited to **active service** under the specific mandate of collective defence under the North Atlantic Treaty.
- The activation of reserve force members is restricted to **international operations**, not domestic ones.
- The duration and conditions of service are not specified in this regulation and would be governed by operational orders, deployment plans, and directives issued by the Department of National Defence.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation provides a clear, legally grounded mechanism for Canada to deploy its military personnel—both regular and reserve—on active service in support of NATO commitments. It ensures that Canada can meet its international defence obligations efficiently and in compliance with domestic law. By enabling rapid mobilization of trained personnel, it strengthens Canada’s role in collective defence and reinforces its partnership with allied nations under the North Atlantic Treaty.
