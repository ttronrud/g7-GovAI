## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Eligible Mortgage Loan Regulations**

### 🔹 **1. Regulatory Authority and Purpose**
The Minister of Finance, in consultation with the Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, issued these regulations under **subsection 42(1)** of the *Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act*.  
**Purpose**: To define and establish the eligibility criteria for residential mortgage or hypothecary loans that are **not insured under a policy deemed to be a "policy" under section 19** of the Act. These regulations ensure that mortgage loans meet standards for affordability, risk, transparency, and borrower protection.

> ⚖️ **Key Point**: The regulations apply to **all mortgage or hypothecary loans not covered by insurance under section 19**, meaning loans that are either uninsured or fall outside the scope of standard mortgage insurance.

## 🔹 **5. High Ratio Loan (HRL) Criteria**

A high ratio loan must meet **all of the following**:

| Criterion | Details |
|--------|--------|
| **1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Limit** | <br>• If property value ≤ $500,000 → max **95%** of value<br>• If property value > $500,000 → max **$475,000 + 90% of value over $500,000**<br>→ This creates a tiered cap designed to cap risk for higher-value properties. |
| **2. Purpose** | Must either:<br>• Be for the **purchase** of the property, or<br>• Be to **discharge a prior uninsured low ratio loan**. |
| **3. Amortization Period** | Must amortize over **≤25 years**<br>→ **Exception**: Up to **30 years** if:<br>• Borrower is a **first-time home buyer**, or<br>• Property is **newly built**. |
| **4. Property Value Cap** | Must be **less than $1,500,000**. |
| **5. Interest Rate Fluctuations** | If variable rate allows amortization changes, **payment must be recalculated every 5 years** to match original schedule. |
| **6. Payment Start Date** | Scheduled payments begin on:<br>• Day of funding<br>• Day of closing (purchase agreement)<br>• Day of completion (improvement/conversion) |
| **7. Credit Score Requirement** | At approval, **at least one borrower or guarantor must have a credit score ≥600**. |
| **8. Debt Service Ratios** | GDS ≤ **39%**, TDS ≤ **44%** (calculated using **worst-case interest rate scenario**). |
| **9. Occupancy Requirement** | Property must contain **at least one housing unit** occupied by borrower or related person (spouse, common-law partner, parent-child). |
| **10. Repayability Assessment** | Must be **reasonably likely to be repaid** based on borrower’s ability to pay all debts and obligations over the term, using reasonable assumptions about peak payments. |
| **11. Securities Guarantee (Pool of Loans)** | If part of a pool used to issue marketable securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), **any securities issued after July 1, 2016 must be guaranteed under subsection 14(1) of the National Housing Act**. |

> 🚫 **Credit Score Exception**:  
> The 600 score requirement **does not apply** if **no more than 3%** of the lender’s HRLs and LRLs approved and funded during any of the following periods had borrowers/guarantors with scores <600:  
> - First 4 quarters of the last 5 quarters  
> - First 4 quarters of the last 6 quarters  
> - First 4 quarters of the last 7 quarters  

> 🔍 **Interest Rate Calculation for GDS/TDS**:  
> Used to calculate ratios based on **the greater of**:  
> - Loan interest rate + 2%  
> - **5.25%**  
> This ensures borrowers are assessed under stress conditions (e.g., rising interest rates).

> 📝 **Income Verification Requirement**:  
> Lender or insurer must make **reasonable efforts to verify income and employment status** (or plausibility of self-employed income). Failure to do so invalidates the loan's eligibility.
