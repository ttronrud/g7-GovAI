The regulation you referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-48, s. 2"** — is a **repealed provision** of a former regulatory instrument under the **Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** in Canada. Below is a detailed summary of the content, context, and implications of the provision, despite its current status as repealed.

---

### 🔍 **Summary of the Regulation (Repealed – SI/2015-48, s. 2)**

#### **Original Purpose**
This section of the regulation (now repealed) established a **special designation** for certain federal Crown corporations and government entities. It provided that **employees of these designated organizations who are not otherwise employed in the public service** would be **deemed to be employed in the public service** for the purposes of **subsection 35(2) of the Public Service Employment Act**.

This was a key mechanism to ensure that **public service employment rights and protections** — such as those related to **employment equity, collective bargaining, job security, and access to public service benefits** — applied to employees in these organizations, even though they were not formally part of the traditional "public service" structure.

#### **Key Provisions (as previously in force)**

1. **Designated Entities**  
   The following entities were specifically listed as portions of the federal public administration and thus falling under the public service for employment purposes:

   - Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)  
   - Canada Council for the Arts  
   - Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)  
   - Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME)  
   - Canadian Tourism Commission  
   - Defence Construction (1951) Limited (DCL)  
   - Export Development Canada (EDC)  
   - Farm Credit Canada (FCC)  
   - Government of Northwest Territories  
   - Government of Nunavut  
   - Government of the Yukon Territory  
   - National Arts Centre Corporation (NACC)  
   - National Battlefields Commission  
   - Royal Canadian Mint  
   - Seaway International Bridge Corporation Limited  

2. **Deemed Public Service Employment**  
   For the purposes of **subsection 35(2) of the Public Service Employment Act**, employees working in these entities who were **not otherwise employed in the public service** were **treated as being employed in the public service**.

   This meant that these employees would be entitled to:
   - The same employment protections as public service employees (e.g., against unfair dismissal, access to collective agreements, grievance procedures).
   - Benefits and rights under the PSEA, including those related to **employment equity, equal opportunity, and public service standards**.
   - The ability to participate in public service employment processes such as **public service appointments, promotions, and transfers**.

3. **Legal Basis**  
   The provision was grounded in **subsection 35(2) of the Public Service Employment Act**, which defines who qualifies as being "employed in the public service." By including these entities, the regulation expanded the scope of public service employment beyond traditional federal government departments and agencies.

#### **Why Was It Repealed?**

- **SI/2015-48** (Statutory Instrument 2015-48) was a **regulatory amendment** that **repealed this section**.
- The repeal was likely part of a broader **restructuring or modernization of the public service employment framework**.
- It may reflect a shift in policy toward:
  - Clarifying the boundaries between the public service and Crown corporations.
  - Moving toward more **sector-specific or corporate governance-based employment models**.
  - Reducing the application of public service employment rights to entities that operate with more commercial or independent autonomy.
- The repeal may also have been driven by **judicial or legislative interpretation** that found the original designation inconsistent with the intent of the PSEA or the need for clearer distinctions between public service and non-public service entities.

---

#### **Impact of the Repeal**

- **Employees in the listed organizations are no longer automatically deemed to be in the public service** under subsection 35(2) of the PSEA.
- They are now subject to **employment rules specific to their organization**, which may be governed by:
  - Corporate governance policies.
  - Private-sector or commercial employment standards.
  - Sector-specific legislation (e.g., for Crown corporations).
- This may result in **reduced access to public service protections**, such as:
  - Equal employment opportunity programs.
  - Collective bargaining rights.
  - Public service-specific grievance or appeal mechanisms.

---

#### **Current Status**

- ✅ **Repealed**: This section is **no longer in force**.
- ❌ **Not applicable**: As of the date of repeal (2015), the listed entities are **not automatically considered part of the public service** for employment purposes under the PSEA.
- ⚠️ **Some entities may still be covered** under other parts of the PSEA or by federal employment equity or human rights legislation, depending on their operations and structure.

---

#### **Key Takeaway**

This regulation was a **temporary or transitional measure** designed to extend public service protections to key federal Crown corporations and territorial governments. However, it has been **repealed**, signaling a policy shift away from broad public service status for these entities. As a result, employees in these organizations must now rely on **corporate policies or sector-specific legislation** rather than automatic public service employment rights.

---

### 📚 Additional Notes

- The **Public Service Employment Act** remains a cornerstone of employment law in Canada, particularly for federal government employees.
- The distinction between **public service** and **Crown corporations** is increasingly important in debates about **public accountability, employment equity, and workforce rights**.
- The repeal reflects a broader trend of **decentralizing public service employment standards** to better align with the operational realities of modern Crown corporations.

### Conclusion

Although this regulation has been **repealed (SI/2015-48, s. 2)**, it was historically significant in extending public service employment protections to key federal and territorial entities. Its repeal underscores a shift in policy toward recognizing the **distinct governance and operational nature** of Crown corporations, removing them from the automatic umbrella of public service employment rights. Employers and employees in the listed organizations must now navigate employment frameworks based on **corporate governance and sector-specific rules**, rather than public service status.
