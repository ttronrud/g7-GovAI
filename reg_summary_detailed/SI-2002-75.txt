### **2. Background and Timeline**

- On **March 12, 2002**, the Chief Statistician of Canada submitted a certified return under Section 13 of the EBRA for the **2001 decennial census**.
- Based on this return, the federal government had **60 days** to establish provincial commissions.
- On **March 21, 2002**, the Governor in Council issued **Order in Council P.C. 2002-447**, directing the issuance of a proclamation to formally establish the commissions.

### **3. Purpose of the Proclamation**

The primary purpose of this proclamation is to:
- **Formally establish** the electoral boundaries commissions for each province.

These commissions operate independently and are tasked with creating electoral districts that reflect current demographic shifts and are designed to uphold principles of fairness, accessibility, and representation.

- **Chairpersons**:
  - Appointed by the **Chief Justice of the province** (or, in rare cases, the Chief Justice of Canada).
  - This ensures provincial jurisdiction and judicial independence in the process.

### **6. Key Legal and Political Significance**

- **Independence of the Commissions**: The commissions operate independently of political parties, although they may receive public input and data.
- **Mandate to Review Population Data**: The 2001 census data provided the basis for adjusting district sizes to maintain **population equality** (typically within a 5% margin) across ridings.
- **Public Accountability**: The final recommendations must be submitted to the federal government and then approved by Parliament before implementation.
- **Future Censuses**: This process is repeated every ten years (decennial basis), ensuring that electoral boundaries remain responsive to demographic changes.

### **7. Publication and Legal Effect**

- The proclamation is published in the **Canada Gazette**, the official journal of federal government notices.
- By publication, it becomes a **publicly accessible and legally binding document**.
- All individuals, institutions, and government bodies are required to take notice and act accordingly.
- The Governor General (represented by Deputy Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and Puisne Judge Louise Arbour) affixes the **Great Seal of Canada**, affirming the legal validity and authority of the proclamation.

### **Conclusion**

This proclamation is a foundational step in Canada’s democratic process of ensuring fair and equitable representation in federal elections. By formally establishing and appointing the members of provincial electoral boundaries commissions, the federal government fulfills its statutory obligation under the **Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act** to respond to population changes and maintain balanced, representative electoral districts.

The commissions established under this proclamation were tasked with reviewing the 2001 census data and proposing new district boundaries for implementation in the next federal election cycle (scheduled for 2004). Their work laid the groundwork for a more representative and responsive electoral system in Canada.
