**Detailed Summary of the Textile Flammability Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Textile Flammability Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, establish minimum flammability standards for certain textile products to reduce the risk of fire hazards in consumer products. These regulations were introduced to ensure that textiles used in products commonly encountered in homes and public spaces meet specific flame resistance criteria.

The regulations are **administered by the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, and came into force upon registration.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Bedding**  
   - Defined as textile products used for sleeping or bedding purposes.  
   - Specifically includes items made from textile fibres (e.g., sheets, duvets, comforters, pillowcases).  
   - Applies to products that are **not** excluded under the scope of the regulations.

2. **Textile Products**  
   - Refers to products composed of textile fibres, **excluding bedding**.  
   - Includes items such as clothing, curtains, upholstery, and other non-bedding textiles.

---

### **Exclusions (Products Not Covered by These Regulations)**

The following products are **exempt** from the flammability requirements under these regulations:

- **Children’s sleepwear** in sizes up to and including **14X** (a size typically used for young children).  
- **Dolls, plush toys, soft toys, and toys intended to be entered by a child** (e.g., stuffed animals, play figures).  
- **Cribs, cradles, and bassinets** (infant sleep furniture).  
- **Playpens** (furniture used for child play).  
- **Expansion gates and expandable enclosures for children** (e.g., safety gates).  
- **Textile floor coverings** (e.g., rugs, carpets).  
- **Tents** (including outdoor tents or temporary shelters).  
- **Mattresses** (even though they are bedding, they are excluded due to their unique use and structure).

> **Note**: This exclusion means that while bedding is generally covered, certain types of bedding (like mattresses) are **not** subject to these flammability standards.

### **Flammability Requirements by Product Type**

The regulations set **minimum flame spread time** thresholds, which measure how quickly a material spreads fire. The test is conducted under standardized conditions to ensure consistency and safety.

#### 1. **Textile Products (excluding bedding)**  
- **Condition**: Products without a **raised fibre surface** (e.g., smooth fabrics like cotton or polyester).  
- **Requirement**: Flame spread time must be **greater than 3.5 seconds**.

#### 2. **Textile Products with a Raised Fibre Surface**  
- **Condition**: Products that have a raised fibre surface (e.g., woven textures, pile fabrics, or materials with tufts or loops) **and** exhibit **ignition or fusion of base fibres** (indicating a higher fire risk).  
- **Requirement**: Flame spread time must be **greater than 4 seconds**.

> *Example*: A fabric with a pile (like a throw blanket or upholstery) that catches fire and melts or burns the underlying fibres must meet the 4-second threshold.

#### 3. **Bedding**  
- **Condition**: Bedding that either:
  - Does **not** have a raised fibre surface, or  
  - Has a raised fibre surface and shows **ignition or fusion of base fibres**.
- **Requirement**: Flame spread time must be **greater than 7 seconds**.

> *Rationale*: Bedding is used in close proximity to people and is often in contact with bodies during sleep. A longer flame spread time significantly reduces the risk of fire spreading and causing injury.

### **Testing Standard**

All flame spread times must be determined using the following standardized method:

- **Standard**: **CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.5**  
  - Full title: *Textile Test Methods: Flame Resistance — 45° Angle Test — One-Second Flame Impingement*  
  - This standard specifies the exact procedure for applying a flame to a textile sample at a 45-degree angle for one second, then measuring how long it takes for the flame to spread across the surface.

> The standard is **amended from time to time** to reflect updated scientific understanding and safety improvements. Compliance must be verified using the current version in effect at the time of testing.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., the day of publication in the *Canada Gazette*).  
- This means they are immediately enforceable upon official publication.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

- To **protect consumers** from fire hazards associated with flammable textiles in everyday products.
- To ensure that textiles used in clothing, upholstery, and bedding do not ignite easily or spread flames rapidly.
- To align with international best practices in fire safety for consumer products.
- To reduce the risk of fire-related injuries and fatalities, especially in homes where children or elderly individuals may be at greater risk.

### **Key Takeaways**

| Category | Flame Spread Time Requirement |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Textile products (no raised surface) | >3.5 seconds |
| Textile products (raised surface with ignition/fusion) | >4 seconds |
| Bedding (any surface type with ignition/fusion) | >7 seconds |

✅ **Applies to**: Textile products (non-bedding), bedding  
❌ **Excludes**: Children’s sleepwear (up to 14X), toys, cribs, playpens, tents, floor coverings, mattresses

🧪 **Test method**: CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.5 (45° angle, 1-second flame impingement)

📅 **Effective date**: Upon registration in the *Canada Gazette*

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of covered textile products are required to ensure compliance.
- Products must be tested and certified according to the specified standard before being placed on the market.
- Non-compliance may result in product recalls, fines, or other enforcement actions under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act*.

### **Conclusion**

The *Textile Flammability Regulations* represent a targeted and science-based approach to enhancing fire safety in consumer products. By setting clear, measurable flammability standards—especially for bedding and textiles with high surface exposure—the regulations help reduce fire risks in homes and other living environments. The exemptions reflect practical considerations for products that are inherently low-risk or designed for specific uses (e.g., toys or children’s wear). The regulations remain a key component of Canada’s broader consumer product safety framework.
