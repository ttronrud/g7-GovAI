**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation establishes a formal administrative framework to group all ministers’ offices within the Government of Canada for the purpose of developing and maintaining a single, comprehensive pay equity plan. The objective is to ensure that pay equity principles are consistently applied across all ministerial offices, promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability in compensation practices.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Grouping of All Ministers’ Offices:**  
   The Order explicitly groups *all* ministers’ offices—regardless of department, portfolio, or level of seniority—into a single entity for the purposes of implementing and updating the pay equity plan. This means that all ministerial positions are treated as part of one unified group when assessing pay equity, analyzing pay disparities, and making adjustments.

2. **Purpose of the Pay Equity Plan:**  
   The primary purpose of this grouping is to:
   - Establish a single, centralized pay equity plan that applies across all ministerial offices.
   - Ensure that all ministerial employees are subject to the same pay equity standards and reporting requirements.
   - Facilitate the identification, analysis, and correction of pay disparities based on gender and other protected characteristics as required by the *Pay Equity Act*.
   - Enable consistent and equitable pay reviews, salary adjustments, and data collection across the ministerial level.

3. **Scope and Application:**  
   The grouping applies to all employees working in ministerial offices, including those in administrative, support, and professional roles. The plan will cover current and future positions, and will be updated periodically to reflect changes in workforce composition, job roles, and compensation structures.

4. **Implementation and Enforcement:**  
   - The Minister of Labour is responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and updating of the pay equity plan.
   - The grouping allows for a more coordinated and data-driven approach to pay equity, avoiding fragmented or siloed efforts across departments.
   - The plan will be subject to periodic review and public reporting as required by the *Pay Equity Act*.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the day it is registered in the *Canada Gazette*, which is the official publication of federal laws and regulations. This ensures legal validity and immediate applicability upon registration.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Enhanced Equity:** By grouping all ministers’ offices, the government ensures that pay equity is not treated as a departmental or isolated issue, but as a systemic and cross-cutting policy priority.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** A single pay equity plan promotes transparency in how pay disparities are identified and addressed, and ensures that all ministers are held to the same standards.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** Centralizing the process reduces duplication of efforts and streamlines data collection and reporting.
- **Alignment with Federal Pay Equity Mandate:** This Order fulfills the requirements of the *Pay Equity Act*, which mandates that public sector employees in federally funded organizations be assessed for pay equity based on gender and other protected grounds.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a critical step in advancing gender equity in federal government employment by creating a unified, transparent, and enforceable pay equity framework for all ministers’ offices. It reflects a commitment to fairness and accountability in public sector compensation and ensures that pay equity is not an afterthought but a foundational principle in government operations.
