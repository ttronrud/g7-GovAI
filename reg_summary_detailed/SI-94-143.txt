**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology) under **section 12 of the Telecommunications Act**, constitutes a formal **reconsideration and modification** of a specific portion of **Decision CRTC 94-19**, titled *“Review of Regulatory Framework”*, which originally directed certain telecommunications companies to implement a **rate rebalancing plan**.

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Original Decision (CRTC 94-19)**  
   On **September 16, 1994**, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) issued *Decision CRTC 94-19*, which included a directive that:
   - **AGT** (Agricultural and General Telecommunications) and other **Stentor companies**, including **Manitoba Telephone System (MTS)**, file **tariff applications** proposing:
     - A **local rate increase of $2 per month**.
     - Corresponding **reductions in long-distance rates**.
   - These rate changes were to take effect on **January 1, 1995, 1996, and 1997**.

2. **Application to Manitoba Telephone System**  
   On **November 1, 1994**, the CRTC confirmed via a letter that the provisions of Decision CRTC 94-19 apply specifically to **Manitoba Telephone System (MTS)**.

3. **Petitions for Review**  
   After the issuance of Decision CRTC 94-19, the **Governor in Council received petitions** under **subsection 12(1) of the Telecommunications Act**, requesting that:
   - A portion of the decision (specifically the rate rebalancing plan) be **rescinded**, or
   - Be **referred back to the CRTC for reconsideration**.

4. **Supporting Public Notices**  
   To guide implementation of the broader regulatory framework, the CRTC issued two key public notices:
   - **Public Notice CRTC 94-52 (November 1, 1994)**: Addressed the implementation of a **split rate base**, **1995 contribution charges**, and **broadband initiatives**.
   - **Public Notice CRTC 94-56 (December 7, 1994)**: Focused on the **Stentor Broadband Initiative** and **Canada/US cost comparisons**.

   These notices were intended to support the objectives outlined in the original decision and provide a more comprehensive framework for rate regulation and investment in telecommunications infrastructure.

### **Governor in Council’s Determination**

The Governor in Council concluded that:
- The **original rate rebalancing plan** (local rate increases of $2/month and long-distance reductions effective January 1, 1995, 1996, and 1997) **should be reconsidered** in light of:
  - The new regulatory framework introduced in Public Notices CRTC 94-52 and 94-56.
  - The evolving telecommunications policy objectives.
- This reconsideration is **necessary and appropriate** to achieve the policy goals set out in **Section 7 of the Telecommunications Act**, particularly the following objectives:
  - (a) Promoting fair and competitive access to telecommunications services.
  - (b) Encouraging investment in infrastructure.
  - (c) Supporting the development of broadband services.
  - (e) Ensuring cost recovery for essential services.
  - (f) Promoting efficiency and innovation.
  - (g) Ensuring affordability for consumers.
  - (h) Maintaining a balanced and sustainable rate structure.

### **Key Actions Taken by the Governor in Council**

1. **Refers the Rate Rebalancing Plan Back to the CRTC**  
   - The Governor in Council formally **refers** the portion of Decision CRTC 94-19 that mandates the **$2/month local rate increase and long-distance reductions** to take effect on **January 1, 1995, 1996, and 1997**, **back to the CRTC for reconsideration**.  
   - This action effectively **pauses enforcement** of the original plan until the Commission completes its review.

2. **Stays the Implementation of the Plan**  
   - The execution of the rate rebalancing plan is **stayed** (paused) **pending the CRTC’s reconsideration**.  
   - This means that no local rate increases of $2/month or long-distance rate reductions will take effect on January 1, 1995, or any subsequent dates, until the Commission issues a new decision.

3. **Specifies a Key Requirement for Reconsideration**  
   - It is **material** to the CRTC’s review that they **compare the Phase III cost allocations** (a specific cost distribution model used in rate-setting) with **external benchmarks** (such as those from the U.S. or other international markets).  
   - This ensures that the cost recovery model is **fair, transparent, and competitive**, and not based solely on internal assumptions.

4. **Sets a Deadline for Completion of Reconsideration**  
   - The CRTC is required to **complete its reconsideration of the rate rebalancing plan no later than October 31, 1995**.  
   - This tight deadline underscores the urgency of the policy review and the government’s commitment to timely regulatory action.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Policy Alignment**: The regulation ensures that the rate structure is aligned with modern telecommunications policy goals, including **broadband investment**, **cost efficiency**, and **consumer affordability**.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: By referring the matter back to the CRTC, the government allows for **independent, transparent, and evidence-based review** by the regulatory body, which is better positioned to assess technical, financial, and competitive factors.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement to compare cost allocations with external benchmarks enhances **accountability** and ensures that pricing decisions are not arbitrary or inward-looking.
- **Prevention of Unfair Burden**: The stay prevents potentially **unaffordable rate increases** from being imposed on consumers prematurely, especially in light of petitions and concerns about equity.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **corrective and adaptive step** in the evolution of Canada’s telecommunications regulatory framework. It reflects a shift from a rigid, one-size-fits-all rate rebalancing plan to a more **flexible, evidence-based, and policy-driven approach**. By referring the original decision back to the CRTC for review, the government demonstrates a commitment to **consumer protection**, **market competitiveness**, and **regulatory transparency**—all essential elements of a modern telecommunications policy.

The final outcome of the CRTC’s reconsideration, due by **October 31, 1995**, would determine whether the $2/month local rate increases proceed, are modified, or are rescinded entirely, based on updated cost data, market conditions, and policy objectives.
