**Detailed Summary of the Transitional Regulations for the Purpose of the National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This set of **Transitional Regulations** was introduced to ensure a smooth and legally sound transition in the administration of cost recovery charges—specifically those related to the National Energy Board (NEB)—as a result of a major reform in Canada’s energy regulatory framework.

The key legislative change involved the **replacement of the National Energy Board (NEB)** with the **Canadian Energy Regulator (Regulator)**, established under **section 10 of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CERA)**. This transition was formalized by **S.C. 2019, c. 28**, which enacted the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* and the *Impact Assessment Act*, while amending the *Navigation Protection Act* and other related statutes.

The Transitional Regulations serve as a bridge between the old system (under the NEB) and the new system (under the Regulator), ensuring continuity in the calculation and management of **cost recovery charges**—a critical financial mechanism used to recover operational and administrative costs from regulated energy projects.

---

### **Key Legal Authority**

- The regulations are made under **section 43** of the *Act to enact the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy Regulator Act*, to amend the *Navigation Protection Act* and make consequential amendments to other Acts.
- The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) issued these regulations **on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources**.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the **commencement day** of the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (i.e., the day the Act officially starts to apply).
- If the regulations are registered (published) after that day, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.
- The **commencement day** is defined as the day the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* comes into force.

> *Note: These regulations were in force as of August 28, 2019 (SI/2019-86).*

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Commencement Day** | The day the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* comes into force. This is the pivotal date marking the transition from NEB to Regulator. |
| **National Energy Board (NEB)** | Refers to the NEB as it existed *immediately before* the commencement day, under the original *National Energy Board Act*. |
| **NEB Regulations** | Refers to the *National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations* as they existed *immediately before* the commencement day. |
| **Regulator** | Refers to the *Canadian Energy Regulator*, established under section 10 of the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act*. |

---

### **Core Provisions and Transitional Obligations**

On and after the commencement day, the **Regulator must apply the NEB Regulations as if it were the National Energy Board**, with specific obligations:

#### 1. **Continuation and Completion of Existing Calculations**
- The Regulator must **continue and complete** any cost recovery charge calculations that were **already underway** by the National Energy Board before the transition.
- This includes:
  - Determining costs relevant to cost recovery calculations.
  - Assessing other related matters (e.g., cost allocation, eligibility, or justification of charges).

> This ensures that no ongoing financial assessments are abandoned or disrupted due to the change in regulatory body.

#### 2. **Initiation and Completion of New Calculations**
- The Regulator must **begin and complete** any new cost recovery charge calculations that are required under the NEB Regulations but were **not previously started** by the NEB.
- These new calculations must be based on the same legal and procedural framework as the original NEB Regulations.

> This ensures that all required cost recovery determinations are fully implemented, even if they were not initiated before the transition.

---

### **Interpretation and Adaptation of the NEB Regulations**

To facilitate the transition, the regulations provide **specific interpretive rules** for how references in the NEB Regulations must be read and applied:

#### A. **Reference to the National Energy Board**
- Any reference to the **NEB** in the NEB Regulations must be **read as a reference to the Regulator**, **if the context relates to a period on or after the commencement day**.

> Example: A provision stating “the NEB will determine costs for the period 2018–2019” must now be interpreted as “the Regulator will determine costs for the period 2018–2019” — but only if the period ends on or after the commencement day.

#### B. **Cost and Forecast Attribution Rules**
This is a critical and nuanced provision that defines how costs are attributed in the transition:

- A **cost or forecast** for cost recovery purposes must be interpreted as:
  
  1. **For periods ending before the commencement day**:
     - The cost or forecast must be one that the **NEB determined** to be attributable to its responsibilities under:
       - The *National Energy Board Act*, or
       - Any other Act of Parliament.
     - This preserves the historical cost determinations made by the NEB.

  2. **For periods beginning on or after the commencement day**:
     - The cost or forecast must be one that the **Regulator determines** (as if it were the NEB) to be attributable to:
       - The Regulator’s mandate under the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act*, including:
         - Costs related to applications that are **denied or withdrawn**.
     - These costs are to be treated **as if they were determined by the NEB** under its prior responsibilities.

> This ensures legal continuity and consistency in cost attribution, even though the regulatory body has changed. It effectively "transfers" the NEB’s cost determination authority to the Regulator in a legally valid way.

---

### **Legal and Practical Significance**

- **Continuity of Financial Accountability**: The regulations prevent gaps in cost recovery assessments, which could otherwise lead to financial disputes or regulatory uncertainty.
- **Legal Validity**: By treating the Regulator as if it were the NEB in terms of cost attribution, the rules provide a legally sound basis for applying past and future cost determinations under the new regulatory regime.
- **Administrative Clarity**: The rules give clear direction to the Regulator on how to interpret and implement the NEB Regulations, reducing ambiguity during the transition.
- **Cost Recovery Fairness**: Ensures that cost recovery charges are based on accurate, consistent, and legally defensible cost data, regardless of the change in regulatory body.

---

### **Conclusion**

These **Transitional Regulations** are a critical piece of administrative law designed to ensure that the **shift from the National Energy Board to the Canadian Energy Regulator** does not disrupt the financial accountability mechanisms that govern cost recovery in the energy sector.

By:
- Requiring the Regulator to apply the NEB Regulations as if it were the NEB,
- Continuing and completing prior calculations,
- Beginning and completing new ones,
- And providing clear rules for how costs are attributed across the transition,

the regulations provide **legal certainty, financial stability, and administrative continuity** during a significant restructuring of Canada’s energy regulatory system.

They reflect a careful balance between **legal reform** and **practical implementation**, ensuring that the new Regulator can operate effectively while respecting the obligations and decisions of its predecessor.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
These transitional regulations ensure that the Canadian Energy Regulator applies the former National Energy Board’s cost recovery rules as if it were the NEB, maintaining continuity in cost determinations—both for ongoing and new assessments—by clearly defining how costs are attributed before and after the regulatory transition.
