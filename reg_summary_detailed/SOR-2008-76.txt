### **Detailed Summary of the Point Lepreau, New Brunswick Nuclear Facility Exclusion Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The regulation establishes a **specific exclusion** from certain provisions of the **Canada Labour Code (CLC)** and the **Non-smokers’ Health Act (NSHA)** for employment at the **Point Lepreau Nuclear Facility** in New Brunswick. This exclusion is necessary because the facility is a **nuclear power plant operated by the New Brunswick Power Nuclear Corporation**, which is a corporation acting as an agent of the Government of New Brunswick under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)*.

Key legal foundations include:
- The **Canada Labour Code (S.C. 1997, c. 9)**, which governs labour standards, industrial relations, occupational health and safety, and smoking regulations in federally regulated workplaces.
- The **Minister of Labour's consultation** with the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** under subsection 159(2)(b) of the Canada Labour Code, ensuring that nuclear-specific safety and regulatory concerns are addressed before implementing exclusions.
- The **Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour) enacts these regulations under specific sections of the Canada Labour Code and the Non-smokers’ Health Act, including:
  - Sections 121.1d, 121.2e, 121.5f, 158 to 160g, and 265 to 267h of the Canada Labour Code.
  - Sections 8.1i and 8.2j of the Non-smokers’ Health Act.

#### **2. Definition of the Point Lepreau Facility**

- **"Point Lepreau facility"** refers specifically to the nuclear facility operated by the **New Brunswick Power Nuclear Corporation** located at Point Lepreau, New Brunswick.

---

#### **3. Exclusion of New Brunswick Labour Laws (for Construction-Related Employment)**

- The **laws of New Brunswick that apply to construction** (e.g., the Industrial Relations Act, Occupational Health and Safety Act, etc.) **do not apply** to employment related to **construction activities** at the Point Lepreau facility.
- This exclusion is **limited to construction-related work** and does **not extend** to ongoing operations or maintenance.

> **Note**: This exclusion is made for clarity and to avoid conflicts with federal nuclear safety regulations.

---

#### **4. Application of Parts I, II, and III of the Canada Labour Code**

Despite the general exclusion under section 4 of the Canada Labour Code, the following **parts of the CLC apply** to employment at the Point Lepreau facility:

##### **Part I – Industrial Relations**
- **Excluded from full application**, **except**:
  - Sections **121.1 to 121.5** (which relate to the rights of workers to form or join unions, and to engage in collective bargaining).
- **Key adjustments**:
  - The term **"construction industry"** is redefined to mean **the businesses engaged in the operation and maintenance of the Point Lepreau facility**.
  - The terms **"construction project"** and **"construction work"** are reinterpreted as referring to **operation and maintenance aspects of refurbishment projects**.
  - The reference to **"refurbishment"** in the *Major Projects Regulation – Industrial Relations Act* is interpreted as meaning **operation and maintenance aspects of refurbishment**.
- **Collective agreements** that existed before the regulations came into force and covered **construction aspects of refurbishment** are **extended to apply to operation and maintenance aspects** of the same project.
- A specific collective agreement — between **New Brunswick Power Holding Corporation** and the **International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 37 (effective Dec 31, 2007 – Dec 31, 2010)** — is **deemed to be a Public Service Labour Relations Act (PSLRA)** agreement, even though it was originally under the Industrial Relations Act.

> **Purpose**: To ensure continuity of employment terms and protect workers’ rights during major facility upgrades, while aligning with the unique nature of nuclear operations.

##### **Part II – Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)**
- **Excluded from full application**, **except**:
  - Sections **158 to 160** (which cover general duties related to workplace safety and reporting of hazards).
- **Applicable laws and instruments** (incorporated by reference):
  - *Boiler and Pressure Vessel Act* and regulations
  - *Elevators and Lifts Act* and regulations
  - *Electrical Installation and Inspection Act* and regulations
  - *Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act)* and regulations — **excluding** the definition of "construction" in section 1.
- **Key interpretation**:
  - The definition of **"where construction is carried on"** in the OHS Act is **redefined** to mean **"where the operation and maintenance aspects of the refurbishment project are carried on"**.
- **Precedence of Nuclear Safety Regulations**:
  - The **provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)** and its regulations **take precedence** over any conflicting provisions in these regulations regarding occupational health and safety.
  - This ensures that nuclear-specific safety standards — which are more stringent and technically specialized — govern the workplace.

> **Purpose**: To maintain strict compliance with nuclear safety standards while allowing the use of relevant OHS legislation where applicable, without duplicating or undermining nuclear oversight.

##### **Part III – Labour Standards**
- **Excluded from full application**, **except**:
  - Sections **265 to 267** (which cover matters such as minimum wage, working hours, and rest days).
- **Applicable laws and instruments** (incorporated by reference):
  - *Employment Standards Act* and regulations
  - *Days of Rest Act* and regulations
  - *New Brunswick Day Act*
  - *Wage-Earners Protection Act*

> **Purpose**: To preserve core labour standards while recognizing the unique operational environment of a nuclear facility, where certain standard labor protections may not be practical or safe.

#### **5. Application of the Non-smokers’ Health Act (NSHA)**

- **Excluded from full application**, **except**:
  - Sections **8.1 and 8.2** (which relate to the right to smoke-free environments and the obligation to provide smoke-free areas).
- **Smoke-free regulations**:
  - The **Smoke-free Places Act (S.N.B. 2004, c. S-9.5)** and its regulations (excluding subsection 2(3)) are **incorporated by reference** and apply to the **use of tobacco** in the Point Lepreau facility.
  - This means that **smoking is prohibited in designated areas** (e.g., workspaces, break rooms), consistent with public health standards, but the broader scope of the NSHA is excluded.

> **Purpose**: To balance public health protections with the operational needs and safety requirements of a nuclear facility, while still ensuring that tobacco use is regulated in appropriate areas.

---

#### **6. Incorporation by Reference**

- All referenced Acts and regulations (e.g., the Judicature Act, Public Interest Disclosure Act, OHS Act, etc.) are **incorporated by reference** and apply to the Point Lepreau facility **to the extent relevant** to:
  - Industrial relations
  - Occupational health and safety
  - Labour standards
  - Tobacco use
- This includes **all amendments** made to these Acts or regulations **after** the coming into force of these regulations — unless otherwise specified.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that the regulations remain current and responsive to changes in applicable legislation.

---

#### **7. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Office of the Registrar of Regulations in New Brunswick.

### **Key Objectives and Rationale of the Regulation**

| **Preserve Worker Rights** | Workers are protected under core labour standards (e.g., wages, rest days) and industrial relations rights (e.g., unionization, collective bargaining), even in a nuclear setting. |
| **Clarify Scope of Application** | The term "construction" is redefined to exclude traditional construction and apply only to operation and maintenance, reflecting the actual nature of work at the facility. |
| **Maintain Regulatory Continuity** | Existing collective agreements are extended to cover maintenance work, ensuring stability and fairness for employees during facility upgrades. |
| **Support Public Health** | Tobacco use is regulated through the Smoke-free Places Act, promoting a healthier workplace without overreaching into nuclear operations. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Point Lepreau, New Brunswick Nuclear Facility Exclusion Regulations** are a carefully crafted legal instrument that:
- Recognizes the **unique nature and risks** of nuclear facilities,
