**Detailed Summary of the Playpens Regulations (S.C. 2016, c. 9, s. 67; S.C. 2010, c. 21)**  
*Pursuant to Section 37a of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)*

---

### **Overview**
The *Playpens Regulations* are a set of detailed safety standards established by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, under Section 37a of the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)*. These regulations apply specifically to **playpens** and **accessories used with playpens**, such as change tables and sleep accessories. The primary objective is to ensure that these products are safe for children under 90 cm in height by preventing injuries from mechanical hazards, toxic substances, fire risks, and structural instability.

The regulations define key terms, establish strict performance and material requirements, and include comprehensive testing procedures to verify compliance.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Playpen** | A product designed to provide a confined play area for children ≤90 cm tall; has non-inflatable sides attached to the floor; includes structural components; and can be used as a stand-alone product. |
| **Accessory** | Any product (e.g., change table, sleep accessory) designed or advertised to be used with a playpen. Must support a child’s weight and be attached to the playpen. Functions include changing diapers, providing sleeping space, or enabling caregiver interaction. |
| **Fastener** | Includes both removable fasteners (e.g., zippers, snaps, straps) and permanent joining elements (e.g., screws, bolts, nails). |
| **Occupant Retention Area** | The enclosed space within the playpen or accessory bounded by the playing/sleeping surface and the interior sides. |
| **Structural Cover** | A removable textile or pliable cover attached to the frame via fasteners that defines the occupant retention area. Must be removable. |
| **Supplied with** | Refers to accessories designed and sold together with a specific playpen or accessory from the same manufacturer. |

## **Core Safety Requirements**

### **1. Toxic Substance Limits (Section 25 of Toys Regulations)**
Any playpen or accessory containing toxic substances must comply with the *Toys Regulations* regarding those substances. Specific limits apply to **lead, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, and barium**:

- **Lead**: ≤90 mg/kg (total lead) in removable stickers, films, or surface coatings.
- **Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Selenium, Barium**: No migration exceeding **1,000 mg/kg** from the material.
- **Mercury**: ≤10 mg/kg (total mercury).

> *Testing must follow Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)* as defined by the OECD (ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17).

---

### **2. Stitching Requirements**
- All stitching must be **lock-stitching** to prevent unraveling or tearing during use.

---

### **3. Injury Prevention from Shearing or Pinching**
- No part of the product accessible to a child may cause injury due to **shearing or pinching**.

---

### **4. Durability of Textile Components**
- Textile or pliable materials **permanently affixed** to rigid parts must not:
  - Tear or detach during testing (per **Schedule 1**).
- **Mesh components** must:
  - Not tear or detach during testing (per **Schedule 2**).
  - Have openings **too small** to allow passage of a hemispherical probe (per **Schedule 3**).

> *Probe size: Hemispherical tip with diameter of 5.33 mm or larger.*

---

### **5. Flame Resistance**
- All textile or pliable materials must have a **flame spread time >7 seconds** when tested per **CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.5** (45° angle test, one-second flame impingement), **unless**:
  - The material has a raised fiber surface, and
  - The base fibers ignite or fuse during testing.

> This ensures resistance to fire in case of accidental exposure.

---

### **6. Post Height Limit**
- Any post (vertical support) must not extend more than **1.5 mm** above the lowest point of the upper surface of the adjacent side (measured within 76 mm from the outer surface).

> Prevents sharp protrusions that could injure a child.

---

### **7. Openings in Occupant Retention Area**
- When tested (per **Schedule 4**), there must be **no completely bounded opening** through which a **60 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm solid block** can pass in any orientation.

> Prevents children from slipping through gaps.

---

### **8. Smooth Finishing of Hard Materials**
- All **wood, plastic, or metal** parts must be:
  - Smoothly finished (no sharp edges, points, cracks, burrs).
  - Free from defects that could cause injury.

> Applies to both exposed surfaces and cut edges.

---

### **9. Cut Edges of Metal Tubing**
- If a cut edge is accessible to a child:
  - It must be **smoothly finished**, or
  - Protected by a **cap** that remains in place under a **90 N force** in any direction.

> Prevents lacerations from sharp edges.

---

### **10. Threaded Bolt Ends**
- If accessible to a child, the **threaded end of every bolt** must be covered by:
  - An **acorn nut**, or
  - A device offering equivalent protection.

> Prevents children from inserting fingers or objects into threaded holes.

---

### **11. Small Parts Safety (Schedule 5)**
- Any part **small enough to fit into the small parts cylinder** (Schedule 5) must be:
  - **Affixed securely** so it does not detach when subjected to **90 N of force** in any direction.

> Prevents ingestion of small, detachable components.

---

### **12. Slots, Notches, Grooves**
- Any opening in wood, plastic, or metal accessible to a child must meet one of two criteria:
  - It admits a **9.53 mm probe** if it admits a **5.33 mm probe**; or
  - Its **depth ≤ minor span dimension** (if that dimension is ≥5.33 mm and <9.53 mm).

> Prevents children from inserting fingers or objects into narrow openings.

---

### **13. Cord, Strap, and Loop Safety (Schedule 6)**
- **Cords/straps** attached at only one end must not exceed **188 mm in length** when stretched with a **22 N force**.
- In **change table accessories**, the portion extending into the playpen’s occupant retention area must also not exceed 188 mm under 22 N.
- **Loops** must not:
  - Allow passage of a **small head probe** inside the occupant retention area.
  - Allow passage of a small head probe outside the area and remain in place when pulled into the retention area.
- For **change table accessories**, loops must not allow passage of the small head probe into the playpen’s retention area.

> Prevents entanglement or strangulation hazards.

---

### **14. Floor and Mattress Pads (Schedule 15)**
- Floor pads or mattress pads must:
  - Be **≤38 mm thick**.
  - When pushed against any side, leave **no gap >30 mm** between pad and side.

> Ensures stability and prevents children from slipping through gaps.

---

### **15. Structural Stability of Playpens (Schedules 7–14)**

#### **Schedule 7 – Support Points**
- At least **three support points** (below or near posts) must remain in contact with an inclined plywood sheet during testing.  
- Points must not be in a straight line.

#### **Schedule 8 – Top Rail Height**
- When no load is applied:
  - Top rail of every side must be **≥508 mm** above the playing surface.
  - In specific test conditions (e.g., with load or after movement), minimum height is **≥460 mm**.

#### **Schedule 9 – Folding Top Rails**
- For folding playpens with hinges:
  - A probe must be able to insert into the folded space to a depth equal to or greater than the **minimum distance between folded segments**.
  - If a hinge can be unlatched independently, the **interior folding angle must be ≥75°** within 76 mm of the hinge.

#### **Schedule 10 – Brackets**
- Brackets must:
  - Be free from visible cracks.
  - Fasteners must not pass completely through the bracket wall.
  - No part of a fastener must completely detach.

#### **Schedule 11 – Folding Mechanism**
- A top rail must fold when the latching mechanism is unlatched.

#### **Schedule 12 – Load Catching**
- A load (as shown in Figure 2) must **not remain caught** on any accessible mechanism, fastener, or projection.

#### **Schedule 13 – Damage Resistance**
- The playing surface, components below it, and rigid structural parts must show **no damage** during testing.

#### **Schedule 14 – Removable Panels**
- Rem
