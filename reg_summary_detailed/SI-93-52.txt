Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers and Duties under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **Section 2 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 1990, c. 1), which empowers the federal government to transfer certain powers, duties, and functions between departments or ministers within the public service.
- This specific transfer is **not a general reorganization**, but a targeted reallocation to support a specific national project.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Transfer**
- The transfer is made **specifically for the Hibernia Development Project**, a major offshore petroleum project located in the North Atlantic, off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.
- The objective is to ensure **effective development, management, and implementation** of the project through a centralized and specialized federal oversight mechanism.

---

#### **3. Scope of the Transfer**
- The powers, duties, and functions currently held by the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** under:
  - **Section 9** of the *Department of Industry, Science and Technology Act*
  - **Section 15** of the same Act
- Are being **transferred to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**.
- These sections relate to:
  - The authority to **develop a project of special assistance** (i.e., a project of national strategic importance that requires federal support).
  - The power to **implement the project through loan agreements** with the owners of the Hibernia Development Project.

---

#### **4. Basis of the Transfer: Hibernia Development Plan**
- The transfer is directly tied to the **Hibernia Development Plan**, which was:
  - Initially approved by the **Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board (CNOPB)** in **Decision 86.01**.
  - Subsequently amended by **Decision 90.01**.
- This plan outlines the technical, financial, and operational framework for the development of the Hibernia field, including the roles of federal government, project owners, and stakeholders.
- The transfer ensures that the federal government’s involvement in the project is under the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, whose mandate aligns more closely with energy and resource development.

---

#### **5. Key Implications**
- **Strategic Alignment**: The transfer reflects a shift in federal policy to place energy and resource projects under the jurisdiction of the Ministry responsible for energy, mines, and resources — reinforcing a coherent policy framework for Canada’s offshore oil and gas sector.
- **Project Oversight**: The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources will now be responsible for:
  - Coordinating the development of the Hibernia project.
  - Approving or managing **loan agreements** with the project owners (typically the joint venture partners, such as the Hibernia Development Company).
  - Ensuring that the project adheres to national standards for safety, environmental protection, and economic benefit.
- **Continuity of Federal Support**: The project will continue to receive federal financial and technical assistance, but now under the oversight of a ministry with direct responsibility for energy policy and infrastructure.

---

#### **6. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- This transfer is **not a change in the project’s status** or its operational structure; it is a **restructuring of federal administrative responsibility**.
- It does not alter the project’s ownership, operational control, or the roles of private investors or contractors.
- The transfer is **limited in scope** — it applies only to the powers and functions related to project development and financing via loan agreements under the specific provisions of Sections 9 and 15 of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology Act.

---

#### **7. Context and Background**
- The Hibernia project was one of Canada’s largest offshore oil developments, with significant economic and strategic importance for Newfoundland and Labrador.
- The original involvement of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology reflected the broader federal interest in technological innovation and industrial development in resource sectors.
- As the focus of Canada’s energy policy evolved, the project was increasingly managed under the purview of energy and natural resources ministries.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **targeted administrative transfer** of federal responsibilities to better align the governance of a major energy project with the current federal policy priorities. By transferring the powers to develop and finance the Hibernia Development Project to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, the government ensures that the project receives consistent, expert, and strategically aligned oversight within a ministry directly responsible for energy and natural resources.

This action supports the long-term sustainability and success of the Hibernia Development Project while reinforcing the federal government’s commitment to responsible resource development in Canada’s offshore regions.
