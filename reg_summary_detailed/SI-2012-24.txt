This indicates that a specific provision (section 5) of **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2014 No. 35** has been **repealed** — that is, officially cancelled or removed from legal effect — by the same instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Statutory Instrument**: SI 2014/35  
  This is a secondary legislation document introduced in the United Kingdom (or a jurisdiction that follows similar legislative processes) to amend or replace existing laws. The exact title of SI 2014/35 would normally be specified (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2014 (SI 2014/35)").

- **Section 5**: The specific section within SI 2014/35 that was repealed is **Section 5**. This section previously governed a particular legal rule, requirement, or procedural provision.

- **Repeal**: The repealing provision (also in SI 2014/35, under section 5) formally removes the legal effect of the original section. This means:
  - The content of the original section no longer applies.
  - Any legal obligations, definitions, or rules previously established by that section are now void.
  - The repeal is effective from the date of enactment or as specified in the instrument.

- **Reason for Repeal**: While the provided text does not specify the reason, common reasons for repealing a section include:
  - Obsolescence (the provision is no longer relevant).
  - Inconsistency with current legislation.
  - Duplication or overlap with other provisions.
  - A more modern or efficient regulation being introduced in its place.
  - Legislative simplification or streamlining.

- **Jurisdictional Note**: Since the reference is to SI/2014-35, this is likely from a UK or Commonwealth jurisdiction. The exact nature of the repealed provision would depend on the title and subject matter of SI 2014/35 (e.g., environmental regulation, employment law, health and safety, etc.).

### Conclusion:

The provided information confirms that **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2014 No. 35 has been repealed** by that same instrument under section 5. This means the provision previously contained in that section is no longer legally enforceable. Without the full text of SI 2014/35, the precise content of the repealed section cannot be identified, but the legal consequence is clear: it is removed from the statute book and has no further effect.

To obtain a detailed understanding of what the original section governed, one would need to consult the full text of SI 2014/35, which is available through official legislative databases such as:
- [UK Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)
- [CanLII](https://www.canlii.org) (if applicable in Canada)
- Or the relevant national legal repository.

👉 **Note**: The repeated references suggest that the original regulation or section was either a standalone provision or part of a broader instrument, and its removal was part of a legislative update.
