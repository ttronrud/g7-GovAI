### 🔹 **Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (the primary legislation governing trust and loan companies in Canada). |
| **Foreign bank** | Has the same meaning as defined in **Section 2 of the Bank Act** — a bank incorporated outside Canada. This definition is critical for determining the scope of certain exceptions involving foreign financial institutions. |

> These definitions ensure consistency with broader financial regulations and facilitate cross-jurisdictional interpretation.

### 🔹 **Core Provisions: Permitted Transactions with Related Parties (Under Section 488 of the Act)**

A company may enter into the following transactions **directly or indirectly** with a **related party** — provided such transactions are conducted fairly and in accordance with sound business practices.

#### ✅ 1. **Allocation of Amounts under Income Tax Act Provisions**
The company may allocate funds as follows:
- Pursuant to specific subsections of the **Income Tax Act**, including:
  - **18(2.3)** – Tax credit allocation
  - **125(3)** – Interest expense deductions
  - **127(10.3)** – Capital cost allowance (CCA) adjustments
  - **181.5(2)** – Tax on deemed income
  - **190.15(2)** – Tax on foreign income
  - **191.1(3)** – Tax on certain types of income

> This allows for tax-related fund transfers between the company and its related parties, subject to compliance with tax rules.

---

#### ✅ 2. **Agreements under Section 191.3(1) of the Income Tax Act**

Two types of tax-sharing agreements are permitted:

##### A. **Company Pays Tax, Related Party Pays Costs**
- The company agrees to **pay all or part of the tax** of the related party.
- In return, the **related party agrees to pay the company an amount at least equal to the additional costs incurred** by the company due to the agreement — including:
  - Additional taxes under the Income Tax Act
  - Administrative or compliance costs

> Example: If a related party has a tax liability due to a restructuring, the company may cover that tax, and the related party must reimburse the company for any extra expenses (e.g., legal fees, audit costs).

##### B. **Related Party Pays Tax on Company’s Behalf**
- The **related party agrees to pay all or part of the tax** of the company.

> This is a reciprocal arrangement where a related party assumes tax obligations for the company, often used in intercompany tax planning.

> ⚠️ These agreements must be clearly documented and justified as commercially reasonable.

---

#### ✅ 3. **Issuance of Conversion Privileges, Options, or Rights**
- The company may issue **conversion privileges, options, or rights** to acquire securities — **even if such issuance is not otherwise permitted** under the original terms of the security.

> Example: A company may issue an option to convert bonds into shares, even if the original bond terms do not allow this — as long as it's done with a related party.

> This provision allows flexibility in capital structure management when dealing with related entities.

---

#### ✅ 4. **Purchase for Cancellation of Shares or Debt Obligations**
- The company may **purchase shares or debt obligations** issued by or to it — **even if such purchases are not otherwise allowed** under the original issuance terms.

> Example: A parent company may buy back its own shares from a subsidiary (a related party), even if the subsidiary’s charter doesn’t permit such a transaction.

> This is often used for capital management or restructuring.

---

#### ✅ 5. **Redemption of Redeemable Shares or Debt Obligations**
- The company may **redeem** redeemable shares or debt instruments — **even if redemption is not otherwise permitted** under the original terms.

> Example: A subsidiary may redeem its redeemable preferred shares from a parent company, even if the original terms didn’t allow early redemption.

> This enables flexibility in debt and equity management with related parties.

---

#### ✅ 6. **Payment or Delivery Due to Reduction in Stated Capital**
- The company may **pay or deliver money or property** as a result of a **reduction in stated capital** — either of the company or the related party.

> Example: If a company reduces its capital by retiring shares, it may pay a related party (e.g., a shareholder or subsidiary) in return.

> This provision supports corporate restructuring and capital reduction activities.

### 🔹 **Special Provisions: Transactions with Foreign Banks (Controlled by a Foreign Bank)**

A company **controlled by a foreign bank** may engage in the following transactions with:
- The **foreign bank**, or
- A **financial institution controlled by that foreign bank**

#### ✅ Permitted Transactions:
1. **Transactions that form an integral part of financial services provided to customers**  
   - These must be **core financial services** delivered to customers (e.g., lending, investment advice, payment processing).
   - Must not be purely internal or non-commercial.

2. **Deposits with the foreign bank or financial institution**, subject to strict limits:
   - **Term**: Not longer than **30 days**
   - **Purpose**: For **short-term liquidity management only**
   - **Amount Limit**: The total amount deposited by the company with **all related parties** (including the foreign bank and other affiliates) **must not exceed 50% of the company’s regulatory capital**

> ⚠️ This restriction is designed to:
> - Prevent excessive exposure to foreign banks,
> - Avoid systemic risk,
> - Ensure liquidity is managed prudently.

> Example: A Canadian trust company controlled by a U.S. bank may deposit $10 million in a short-term account with the U.S. bank for 15 days. If the company has $20 million in regulatory capital, the total deposits with all related parties must remain ≤ $10 million.
