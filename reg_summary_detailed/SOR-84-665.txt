The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated references to the same repeal notice:

> [Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]  
> (repeated six times)

### Summary:

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Regulations*, a form of secondary legislation in Canada.
- **SOR/2017-84** is the official number of the regulation issued in 2017.
- **Section 1** of that regulation contains the legal provision that formally repeals the previously existing regulation.

### Key Points:
- The regulation being referenced **no longer exists** in force.
- It was **repealed on or around the date of publication** of SOR/2017-84, which was issued on **April 14, 2017**.
- The repeal means that any legal provisions, obligations, or requirements previously established by the regulation are **no longer applicable**.
- The repetition of the same line suggests a formatting or data error, possibly in a database or document where the repeal notice was mistakenly duplicated.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active or current regulation** to summarize because the regulation has been **fully repealed**. The only relevant information is that it was officially canceled by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, and therefore, it is no longer in effect.

> 📌 **Note**: If you have a specific regulation (by title or number) that was previously referenced before this repeal, please provide it for a more detailed historical summary. As currently presented, the content only reflects a repeal notice with no substantive regulation to summarize.
