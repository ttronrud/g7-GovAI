### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulatory order, formally titled the *Ballet Shoes Remission Order*, provides for the **remission (full cancellation or refund) of certain taxes** on a specific class of footwear—ballet shoes—imported during a defined period. The remission applies to both **customs duties** and **sales tax**, under specific conditions involving designated educational and professional dance institutions in Canada.

---

### **1. Scope of the Remission**

#### **Product Type:**  
Ballet shoes of the type commonly known as:
- **Pointe shoes** (shoes worn by dancers to stand on the tips of their toes)
- **Block toe shoes** (shoes with a solid, supportive toe box, often used in ballet training)

These shoes are specifically targeted under the regulation.

#### **Time Period:**  
All imports of such ballet shoes occurring between **July 1, 1970, and June 30, 1988**, inclusive.

---

### **2. Eligible Recipients (Beneficiaries)**

Remission is granted only to imports **by or for resale to** the following institutions:

#### **Educational Institutions (for student use):**
- National Ballet School, Toronto  
- George Brown School of Dance, Toronto  
- Quinte Dance Centre, Belleville, Ontario  

These institutions are eligible to receive the remission because the shoes are intended for use by **students** in formal dance training.

#### **Professional Dance Companies (for professional dancers):**
- National Ballet Guild of Canada, Toronto  
- les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Montreal  
- Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Winnipeg  
- Theatre Ballet of Canada, Ottawa  
- Ballet British Columbia, Vancouver  
- Alberta Ballet Company, Edmonton  
- la Compagnie de danse Eddy Toussaint, Montreal  
- Goh Ballet Company, Vancouver  

These organizations are eligible because the shoes are intended for use by **professional dancers** in their employ.

> **Note:** The remission applies only when the shoes are imported **for the use of students or professional dancers in these organizations**—not for general sale or commercial use.

### **3. Tax Remissions Provided**

#### **(a) Remission of Customs Duties**  
All **customs duties** (tariff duties) paid or payable on the imported ballet shoes during the specified period are **fully remitted** (i.e., refunded or waived) for eligible imports.

- This means that if a dance institution imported such shoes and had paid duties, those duties are canceled or refunded under this order.
- The remission applies regardless of the original duty rate or value of the shoes, as long as the import meets the criteria.

#### **(b) Remission of Sales Tax (Excise Tax)**  
In addition to customs duty remission, the regulation also provides for the **remission of sales tax** under the *Excise Tax Act*.

- The sales tax is remitted in an amount equal to the **difference** between:
  - The sales tax calculated on the **duty-paid value** of the shoes, and  
  - The sales tax calculated on the **value for duty** of the shoes.

> **Explanation of the Tax Difference:**  
- When customs duties are applied, the **value for duty** is typically the value of the goods *before* duty is added.  
- The **duty-paid value** is the value *after* duties are included (i.e., the total amount paid by the importer, including duties).  
- Sales tax is usually levied on the **total selling price** or value of the goods.  
- Since the duty-paid value is higher than the value for duty, the sales tax calculated on the duty-paid value will be **greater** than that calculated on the value for duty.  
- Therefore, the remission compensates for this **excess sales tax** that would have otherwise been paid due to the inclusion of customs duties in the taxable base.

> **Example (Simplified):**  
- Value for duty = $100  
- Customs duty = $10 → Duty-paid value = $110  
- Sales tax rate = 10%  
- Sales tax on value for duty = 10% × $100 = $10  
- Sales tax on duty-paid value = 10% × $110 = $11  
- Difference = $11 – $10 = $1  
- Remission amount = $1 (refund of the excess sales tax)

This ensures that the total tax burden on the importation of ballet shoes for dance education and professional use is not unfairly increased due to the inclusion of customs duties in the taxable value.

### **4. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this order is to:
- Support the development and accessibility of dance education and professional performance in Canada.
- Recognize the specialized and essential nature of ballet shoes in training and performance.
- Reduce the financial burden on dance institutions, especially those with limited budgets, by eliminating the cost of customs and related taxes on essential training equipment.

This reflects a form of **targeted tax relief** aimed at promoting cultural and artistic development in the arts sector.

### **5. Legal Citation and Enforcement**

- The Order may be cited as: **Ballet Shoes Remission Order**  
- It is a formal regulatory instrument issued under Canadian customs and excise law, likely under the authority of the *Customs Act* or *Excise Tax Act*.  
- Enforcement is limited to the specified institutions and time period.  
- The remission is retroactive to July 1, 1970, and applies only to imports that meet the defined eligibility criteria.
