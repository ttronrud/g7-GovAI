**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Prescribing the Maximum Total Amount for Agreements Involving Leases of Residential Property

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 73(2.1)(b)a of the Nunavut Act**, as recommended by the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** and approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**.

**Statutory Reference:**  
- **S.C. 1998, c. 15, s. 13(3)**  
- **S.C. 1993, c. 28** (original enactment of the Nunavut Act)

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to establish a **threshold limit** for the total amount of financial obligations that the Government of Nunavut may incur under agreements involving the **lease of residential property**. This threshold determines whether **prior approval by the Governor in Council** is required for such agreements.

**Key Provision:**  
Under paragraph 73(2.1)(b) of the Nunavut Act, **the Governor in Council must approve** any agreement involving the lease of residential property **if the total amount the Government of Nunavut is required to pay exceeds a specified maximum**.

The Order sets this maximum amount at **$15,000,000 (Canadian dollars)**. Specifically:

> *The approval of the Governor in Council is not required if the maximum total amount that the Government of Nunavut must pay under such agreements is less than $15,000,000.*

In other words:
- If the total lease payments (e.g., rent, compensation, or other financial obligations) under a residential property lease agreement are **less than $15 million**, the Government of Nunavut does **not need** to seek formal approval from the Governor in Council.
- If the total amount **exceeds $15 million**, then **prior Governor in Council approval is required** to proceed with the agreement.

**Scope of Application:**  
This regulation applies specifically to **agreements involving the lease of residential property**. This includes:
- Leases of housing units (e.g., government-owned homes or apartments)
- Leasing arrangements between the Government of Nunavut and individuals or organizations (e.g., Indigenous communities, residents, or housing providers)
- Any financial obligations arising from such lease agreements (e.g., rent, maintenance, or other monetary commitments)

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on **September 24, 1998**.

**Significance and Context:**  
This regulation serves as a **financial and administrative safeguard** to ensure that large-scale residential leasing arrangements — particularly those involving significant public expenditure — are subject to high-level oversight. It reflects the importance of accountability in the use of public funds, especially in the context of housing policy in Nunavut, where Indigenous land and housing rights are central to governance and community development.

By setting a clear monetary threshold, the regulation:
- Simplifies administrative processes for smaller leases
- Ensures that major financial commitments are reviewed and approved by the highest level of government decision-making (the Governor in Council)
- Promotes transparency and fiscal responsibility in government housing programs

**Conclusion:**  
This Order is a key component of the governance framework under the Nunavut Act, providing a clear, enforceable threshold for when government leasing of residential property requires formal approval. It balances administrative efficiency with fiscal oversight, ensuring that significant financial commitments are appropriately scrutinized while allowing routine, smaller-scale leasing arrangements to proceed without bureaucratic delay.
