The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-54, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2017-54**, specifically under **Section 1** of that instrument.
- **Effective Date**: While the exact date is not listed in the provided text, Statutory Instruments (SORs) are typically published and take effect shortly after being released. SOR/2017-54 was published in 2017, so the repeal became effective in that year.
- **Legal Implication**: Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer in force. Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by it are removed from the legal framework. This means that the regulation no longer applies to any current or future legal or administrative context.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because the regulation was outdated, redundant, inconsistent with newer legislation, or superseded by a more comprehensive or updated rule. Common reasons for repeal include legislative modernization, streamlining of regulations, or alignment with broader policy objectives.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active regulation** in this list — it is a list of **repealed provisions**. The original regulation has been formally removed from the legal code through **SOR/2017-54, s. 1**, and therefore **does not currently exist or apply**. Any reference to it in legal or administrative contexts must be treated as obsolete.

If you have the original regulation or its text, I can provide a more detailed analysis of its content and intent prior to repeal.
