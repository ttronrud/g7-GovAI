- **Legal Authority**: Section 69a of the *Department of Employment and Social Development Act* (DESDA).
- **Reference to Prior Acts**:

  - S.C. 2005, c. 34; S.C. 2013, c. 40, s. 205 (historical references to prior regulatory frameworks)

> This regulation establishes procedural rules governing how parties may challenge provisions of key federal social security legislation before the **Social Security Tribunal**.

---

### **2. Scope of Challenges Allowed**
Parties may file a **constitutional challenge** to certain provisions of the following Acts or their regulations:

| Act | Provision Challenged |
|-----|------------------------|
| Canada Pension Plan (CPP) |
| Old Age Security Act (OAS) |

| Canada Disability Benefit Act (CDBA) |

> The challenge can be based on:
> - **Constitutional validity**
> - **Applicability**
> - **Operability** (i.e., whether the provision is workable or can be implemented)

---

### **3. Requirements for Filing a Constitutional Challenge**
A party must file a **notice of challenge** with the Tribunal that includes:

1. **Clear identification** of the specific provision being challenged (e.g., section number, title, or clause).
2. **Material facts** relied upon to support the constitutional challenge (e.g., evidence of infringement of Charter rights, inconsistency with constitutional principles).
3. **Summary of the legal argument** to be advanced in support of the challenge (e.g., grounds under Section 1 of the Charter, equality rights, or reasonable accommodation).

> This notice must be submitted **at least 10 days before** the scheduled hearing date.

---

### **4. Service of Notice and Proof of Service**
- The notice must be **served on the persons listed in subsection 57(1) of the Federal Courts Act**.
- A **copy of the notice and proof of service** must be filed with the Tribunal.
- **Failure to file proof of service** may result in:
  - The Tribunal, **on its own initiative or at a party’s request**, postponing or adjourning the hearing.

> This ensures that all relevant parties are properly notified and that the Tribunal maintains procedural integrity.

---

### **5. Hearing Formats – Flexibility and Accessibility**
The Tribunal must hold hearings in one of the following formats, **as requested by the appellant**:

- In writing (e.g., through submissions and written arguments)
- By **teleconference, videoconference, or other telecommunications means**
- In person

> **Exceptional Flexibility**:
- Despite the appellant’s request, the Tribunal **may allow other parties** to participate in a hearing via a different format **if it determines such participation is warranted** based on the needs and circumstances of that party (e.g., disability, location, language barriers).

> **Tribunal Discretion to Deviate from Requested Format**:
- The Tribunal may hold a hearing in a format **other than requested by the appellant** if it finds that:
  1. The requested format would **not allow for a full and fair hearing**;
  2. The format would **raise security or health concerns** that cannot be reasonably mitigated; or
  3. The format would be **impractical due to extraordinary circumstances**, such as:
     - Fire, flood, or natural disaster
     - Epidemic or pandemic
     - Political turmoil
     - Act of terrorism
     - Major accident

> This provision ensures that hearings remain accessible, fair, and safe even in exceptional or unforeseen situations.

---

### **6. Privileged or Private Hearings – Protection of Sensitive Information**
The Tribunal may, **on request or on its own initiative**, hold a hearing **in private** and restrict public access to:
- The full appeal record
- Or parts of it

This is permitted **only if the Tribunal determines** that reasonable alternative measures (e.g., redactions, limited public release) **cannot adequately mitigate one or more of the following serious risks**:

1. **Undue hardship** to an individual due to disclosure of personal information (e.g., medical records, mental health data) — where the societal interest in public access is outweighed by the harm to the individual.
2. **Serious risk to the life, liberty, or security** of a person.
3. **Serious risk to the fairness** of the proceeding — where public access would compromise the integrity of the process.
4. **Serious risk to public security** (e.g., national security, threats to public order).

> This provision protects vulnerable individuals and sensitive information while balancing transparency and public interest.

---

### **7. Amendments and Repeal**
- **Amendment Note**: The regulation was amended by *SOR/2013-60* (a prior regulatory update).
- **Repeal Clause**: The *Social Security Tribunal Regulations, 2022* are **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or replaced).
- **Effective Date**:
  - The regulations come into force on the day that **Division 20 of Part 4 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2021, No. 1** comes into force.
  - If the regulations are registered (published) **after** that date, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This indicates a transitional approach — the new regulations are intended to replace or update previous versions, with a clear timeline for implementation.

---

### **8. Date of Entry into Force**
- **In force**: December 5, 2022 (as noted in SI/2022-59 — Statutory Instrument 2022-59)
- This date marks when the regulations were officially adopted and became operational.

## **Conclusion**

The *Social Security Tribunal Regulations, 2022* establish a **clear, flexible, and rights-based procedural framework** for challenging provisions of major federal social security legislation. While the regulation itself has been **repealed**, its content reflects a broader commitment to:

- **Transparency**

- **Procedural fairness**
- **Adaptability to real-world challenges**

It represents a significant step toward ensuring that social security programs are not only financially sustainable but also constitutionally sound and accessible to all Canadians.
