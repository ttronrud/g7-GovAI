**Detailed Summary of the Teslin Tlingit Council (GST) Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make orders related to the administration of taxes when it is in the public interest.

The Order specifically addresses the **remission (forgiveness or refund) of Goods and Services Tax (GST)** paid by the Teslin Tlingit Council during a defined period. It is a legally binding instrument that implements a provision in the **Teslin Tlingit Council Self-Government Agreement**.

---

**2. Legal Basis and Reference**  
- The Order is based on **Section 7(2) of S.C. 1991, c. 24**, which is part of the *Financial Administration Act*.  
- It is directly tied to the **Teslin Tlingit Council Self-Government Agreement**, signed on **May 29, 1993**, and as amended on **November 2, 2000** (the "agreement").  
- This agreement establishes the self-government framework for the Teslin Tlingit Council, including financial and tax-related arrangements.

---

**3. Definitions**  
The Order includes two key definitions:  
- **"Agreement"**: Refers to the *Teslin Tlingit Council Self-Government Agreement*, as it was in effect on **November 2, 2000**. This version includes all amendments and updates made up to that date.  
- **"Person"**: Uses the same definition as in **subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act**, which generally refers to any individual, corporation, or other entity that is subject to tax under the Excise Tax Act. In this context, it applies to the Teslin Tlingit Council or any entity recognized under the agreement.

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
The Order grants a **remission of GST** to the **Teslin Tlingit Council** under the following conditions:

- **Tax Subject to Remission**: GST paid by the Council under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.  
  - Part IX of the Excise Tax Act typically governs tax treatment for **self-governing First Nations** and related tax exemptions or remissions.  
  - The remission applies specifically to **GST paid during the period from October 1, 1997, to October 31, 2000**.

- **Remission Mechanism**:  
  The remission is granted **to the extent and in the manner provided for in Sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**.  
  These sections outline specific provisions within the agreement that authorize the government to refund or remit certain taxes paid by the Council during that period. This means the remission is not arbitrary but is directly linked to the terms of the self-government agreement.

- **Exclusion Clause**:  
  **No refund is payable under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**.  
  This is a critical limitation: even though the Council may be eligible for a GST remission under the agreement, it cannot also receive a refund under the broader self-government act’s refund provisions (Section 18.1). This ensures that the remission is exclusive and avoids double-dipping or overlapping benefits.

---

**5. Purpose and Public Interest**  
The Governor General in Council determines that it is in the **public interest** to grant this remission. This reflects a broader policy goal of supporting **Indigenous self-governance**, recognizing the financial challenges faced by First Nations in establishing and operating self-government institutions, and ensuring that tax obligations are aligned with the terms of negotiated agreements.

---

**6. Effective Date**  
The Order **comes into force on November 2, 2000**. This date coincides with the date the Self-Government Agreement was updated (as of November 2, 2000), ensuring that the remission is implemented in alignment with the finalized agreement.

---

**7. Key Implications**  
- **Financial Relief**: The remission provides direct financial relief to the Teslin Tlingit Council by forgiving GST paid between 1997 and 2000.  
- **Legal Clarity**: It formalizes the tax treatment of the Council under the self-government framework, providing legal certainty.  
- **Policy Alignment**: It reinforces the principle that self-governance agreements include financial provisions that are mutually binding and consistent with federal tax law.  
- **Prevention of Overlap**: By explicitly excluding refunds under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, the Order prevents potential conflicts or redundancies in tax relief mechanisms.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Teslin Tlingit Council (GST) Remission Order* is a targeted, legally grounded instrument that provides a formal and enforceable mechanism for remitting GST payments made by the Teslin Tlingit Council during a specific period. It operates within the framework of the self-government agreement and respects the boundaries of federal tax law, ensuring that the remission is both lawful and in the public interest. The Order serves as a practical implementation of the financial provisions agreed upon in the 1993 self-government agreement, supporting the Council’s transition to self-governance while maintaining fiscal accountability.
