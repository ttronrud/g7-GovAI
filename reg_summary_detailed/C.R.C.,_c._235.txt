**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Tobacco Order**

---

**1. Citation and Purpose**  
This regulation is officially known as the *Prince Edward Island Tobacco Order*. It establishes the legal framework governing the marketing of unmanufactured flue-cured tobacco produced in Prince Edward Island (PEI), particularly in interprovincial and export trade. The Order operates under the authority of the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* ("Act") and is designed to ensure fair, equitable, and sustainable marketing practices for tobacco producers in the province.

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act*, which provides the legislative foundation for the regulation of tobacco marketing and the establishment of the relevant boards and plans.
  
- **"Board"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Marketing Board*, which has broad regulatory powers over the marketing of tobacco both within the province and in interprovincial and export markets.

- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Tobacco Commodity Marketing Board*, established under the Act. This body is specifically tasked with managing the marketing of tobacco in interprovincial and export markets, and overseeing financial mechanisms related to production and sales.

- **"Plan"**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Tobacco Commodity Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan sets out the objectives, strategies, and operational guidelines for the marketing of tobacco, including pricing, distribution, and financial mechanisms. Any regulations made under the Act to implement or adjust the Plan are also part of this framework.

- **"Tobacco"**: Defined as *unmanufactured flue-cured tobacco produced in the Province of Prince Edward Island*. This excludes processed or manufactured tobacco products and focuses exclusively on raw, agricultural tobacco.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**  
Both the Marketing Board and the Commodity Board are granted **equal regulatory authority** over the marketing of tobacco in interprovincial and export trade. Crucially, they may exercise **all or any powers** that they have under the Act and the Plan in relation to local marketing within PEI—**as if those powers were exercised in the provincial market**—when dealing with persons and property located within the province. This means that decisions made in interprovincial or export contexts can be applied to domestic producers and businesses in the same way as domestic marketing decisions.

This provision ensures consistency and fairness in how tobacco producers are treated, regardless of whether their operations are local, interprovincial, or international.

**4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board (Relevant Section)**  
Although a prior version of this provision (SOR/80-90) has been **revoked**, the current text grants the Commodity Board the following **key powers** with respect to the marketing of tobacco in interprovincial and export trade:

- **Authority to impose levies or charges**:  
  The Commodity Board may establish, set, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals and entities engaged in the **production or marketing of tobacco** within Prince Edward Island.

- **Classification of producers into groups**:  
  The Board may **classify tobacco producers into different groups** (e.g., by size, type of operation, or region) and determine **different levies or charges** for each group. This allows for a tiered or differentiated system that can reflect varying levels of production, financial capacity, or market exposure.

- **Use of levies and charges**:  
  The funds collected through these levies or charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:
  - Creation of **financial reserves** (to manage future market fluctuations or downturns),
  - Payment of **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of tobacco,
  - **Equalization or adjustment** of financial benefits among producers.  
    This means that if some producers receive higher returns from sales (e.g., due to market conditions), the Commodity Board can redistribute funds to ensure that all producers are fairly compensated, especially those who may have experienced lower returns or losses.

- **Periodic application**:  
  The Commodity Board may determine the **time periods** (e.g., annual, seasonal) during which these levies or adjustments apply. This provides flexibility to respond to market dynamics and economic conditions.

---

**5. Key Objectives and Implications**  
The core purpose of this Order is to:

- Ensure **economic stability** for tobacco producers by creating financial safeguards against market volatility.
- Promote **equity** among producers by allowing for financial equalization, so that no producer is unfairly burdened or rewarded based on market fluctuations.
- Enable the Commodity Board to **manage risks** associated with interprovincial and export trade, including price instability, demand shifts, or supply disruptions.
- Provide a **transparent and structured financial mechanism** to support the long-term viability of tobacco production in PEI.

---

**6. Important Notes and Context**  
- The **revocation of SOR/80-90** indicates that previous provisions on levies or charges have been replaced or removed, suggesting a possible shift in policy or administrative approach. The current version reflects a more targeted and updated framework.
- The Commodity Board's powers are **not general**—they are specifically tied to tobacco marketing and financial management, and are governed by the Act and the Plan.
- The Order emphasizes **provincial control** over the marketing of tobacco, ensuring that decisions are made with the interests of PEI producers in mind.

**Conclusion**  
The *Prince Edward Island Tobacco Order* provides a comprehensive regulatory structure for managing the marketing of unmanufactured flue-cured tobacco in PEI. It empowers the Commodity Board to impose tiered levies and charges on producers, use the collected funds for financial stability and equity, and ensure fair outcomes across the industry. By linking financial mechanisms to market realities and producer needs, the Order supports both the economic sustainability of tobacco production and the fairness of interprovincial and export trade practices.
