**Detailed Summary of the Indian Statute-Barred Income Tax Assessment Remission Order**

---

**1. Purpose and Background**  
The *Indian Statute-Barred Income Tax Assessment Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council. This action is taken in the public interest to provide relief to certain Indigenous individuals (referred to as "Indians") who have been assessed for income tax under the *Income Tax Act* but are now unable to pay due to the expiration of the statutory limitation period for the assessment—specifically, before the year 1988.

The Order is based on a recommendation from three key federal government departments:
- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**  
- The **Minister of National Revenue**  
- The **Treasury Board**

This reflects a collaborative approach between Indigenous affairs and financial administration, recognizing both the historical and administrative context of Indigenous taxation.

**2. Legal Authority**  
The Order is enacted under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This section empowers the Governor in Council to make orders for the remission of certain financial assessments when it is in the public interest. It provides the legal basis for the government to forgive or cancel tax liabilities that were previously assessed and not paid, particularly when the statutory time limit for legal action has expired.

---

**3. Scope and Applicability**  

**Definition of "Indian"**  
The term *"Indian"* is defined in accordance with **subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act**. This means the Order applies to individuals who are legally recognized as "Indians" under the Indian Act, which includes:
- Status Indians (those who have Indian status by birth or by descent)
- Individuals who are members of an Indian band or community, as defined in the Act

This ensures that the remission is targeted and consistent with existing legal definitions of Indigenous status in Canada.

---

**4. What is Remitted?**  
The Order grants a full remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of the following for any eligible Indian:

- The **amount of income tax** assessed against the individual  
- Any **penalties** assessed in connection with the tax liability  
- All **interest** that has accrued on the unpaid tax, penalty, or interest  

This means that if an individual was assessed for income tax under the *Income Tax Act* and the assessment was not paid, and the statutory limitation period for the assessment expired before 1988, then the entire tax liability—including penalties and interest—is forgiven.

---

**5. Key Eligibility Criteria**  

An individual is eligible for remission **only if** the following conditions are met:

1. The individual is an "Indian" as defined under subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act.  
2. The tax assessment (including penalties and interest) was made under the *Income Tax Act*.  
3. The amount assessed, any related penalties, and all interest due have **not been paid**.  
4. The **statutory limitation period** for the assessment has **expired before 1988**.  

> *Note:* The expiration of the limitation period is a critical criterion. This means that the tax assessment was not pursued legally after the deadline set by statute (e.g., 3 years from the date of assessment or the date of the tax return), and that this deadline passed before 1988. This ensures that the Order applies to assessments that were effectively "time-barred" and could not be legally enforced due to the lapse of time.

---

**6. Exclusions and Limitations**  
- The Order **does not apply** to assessments that were paid in full or partially.  
- It **does not apply** to assessments where the limitation period expired **on or after 1988**.  
- It does **not cover** tax liabilities arising from other sources (e.g., property taxes, corporate taxes, or other acts outside the scope of income tax assessments).  
- It does **not extend** to individuals who are not recognized as "Indians" under the Indian Act.

---

**7. Public Interest Justification**  
The Governor General in Council has determined that it is in the **public interest** to grant this remission. This reflects a broader recognition of:
- Historical inequities in the application of tax laws to Indigenous peoples  
- The long-standing and often unjustified delays in tax collection from Indigenous communities  
- The need to promote reconciliation, equity, and fairness in the Canadian tax system  
- The principle that tax assessments that are time-barred should not be enforced, especially when the taxpayer has not had a reasonable opportunity to pay  

---

**8. Citation and Legal Status**  
The Order is officially cited as:  
**The Indian Statute-Barred Income Tax Assessment Remission Order**  

It is a formal, legally binding instrument that can be referenced in court, tax assessments, or administrative proceedings.

---

**9. Implications and Significance**  

- **Historical Justice**: This Order serves as a form of redress for Indigenous individuals who may have faced unfair or unenforceable tax assessments due to administrative or procedural lapses.  
- **Equity and Fairness**: It ensures that individuals who were assessed before 1988 and could not pay due to the expiration of the limitation period are not burdened with outdated tax debts.  
- **Administrative Efficiency**: By remitting these assessments, the government reduces the administrative burden of pursuing long-dormant tax claims.  
- **Policy Alignment**: The Order aligns with broader federal policies promoting reconciliation, Indigenous rights, and the recognition of historical injustices.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Indian Statute-Barred Income Tax Assessment Remission Order* is a significant and targeted piece of legislation that provides a formal, legally sound mechanism for the remission of income tax liabilities that were assessed against Indigenous individuals and became time-barred before 1988. It reflects a commitment to equity, historical justice, and the public interest, while operating within the established legal framework of the Financial Administration Act. This Order not only simplifies the tax obligations of eligible individuals but also contributes to broader efforts of reconciliation between the Canadian government and Indigenous peoples.
