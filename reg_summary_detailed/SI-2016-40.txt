**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2013-303 and Designation of the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada as the Appropriate Minister

**Legal Authority:**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph (c.1)a of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act** (R.S., c. F-11).
- It is promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- The legal basis is found in **Section 69(2) of the Financial Administration Act**, as amended by **S.C. 1992, c. 1** (Statutes of Canada, 1992, Chapter 1, Section 69(2)).

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2013-303:**
   - The regulation formally **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2013-303**, issued on March 19, 2013.
   - This prior order had previously designated a different individual or body as the "appropriate Minister" with respect to the **Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board (CTAISB)**.
   - By repealing this order, the government removes the previous designation and effectively ends the legal basis for that prior appointment.

2. **Designation of the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada as the Appropriate Minister:**
   - The regulation designates the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** as the **appropriate Minister** for the purposes of the Financial Administration Act with respect to the **Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board (CTAISB)**.
   - This designation is significant because it establishes the **formal governmental authority** under which the CTAISB operates in terms of financial administration, including matters such as budgeting, procurement, and financial oversight.

---

**Purpose and Significance:**

- The Financial Administration Act governs how federal institutions are funded and how financial matters are managed. The "appropriate Minister" is responsible for ensuring that a federal agency like the CTAISB complies with financial regulations and reporting requirements.
- By designating the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, the government is:
  - Centralizing financial accountability for the CTAISB under a high-level, constitutional office.
  - Ensuring continuity and stability in financial oversight, particularly in the context of intergovernmental or institutional governance.
  - Aligning the CTAISB’s financial governance with broader federal administrative practices.

> **Note:** The President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada is typically the **Prime Minister** or, in some cases, a senior cabinet minister. This role is a constitutional office that serves as a formal representative of the Crown in matters of governance. In this context, the designation ensures that the CTAISB has a clear, senior-level point of contact for financial administration and compliance.

**Effective Date and Legal Status:**
- The regulation comes into force immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette.
- It is a **statutory instrument (SI/2013-30)**, meaning it is a secondary legislation that implements or modifies provisions of primary legislation (the Financial Administration Act).
- It is legally binding and has the force of law under the authority granted by the Financial Administration Act.

---

**Context and Background:**
- The 2013 order (P.C. 2013-303) may have been issued during a transitional period or in response to a specific administrative need. Its repeal suggests a shift in governance structure or a decision to streamline oversight.
- This change reflects a broader trend in federal governance to centralize or clarify financial accountability for regulatory and safety bodies like the CTAISB.

---

**Conclusion:**
This regulation effectively:
- Ends a previous designation of an appropriate Minister for the CTAISB,
- Establishes the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** as the current appropriate Minister under the Financial Administration Act,
- Ensures that the CTAISB operates within a clear, constitutionally recognized framework for financial administration and accountability.

It is a key administrative step in maintaining compliance with federal financial governance standards and reinforcing the role of senior government leadership in oversight of safety and transportation regulatory bodies.
