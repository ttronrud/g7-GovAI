The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *SOR/2017-84, section 1* (Statutory Instrument 2017-84)
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the coming into force of SOR/2017-84, which was published in the Canada Gazette on **April 14, 2017**.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: The regulation previously listed was formally canceled and no longer in force. Section 1 of SOR/2017-84 explicitly repeals the prior regulation, meaning it is no longer applicable, enforceable, or legally binding.

### Context:
SOR/2017-84 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued by the Government of Canada. It typically contains amendments or repeals of existing regulations. In this case, the repealing section (section 1) targets a specific regulation that was previously in effect — though the original regulation itself is not provided in your query.

### Key Implications:
- **Legal Effect**: Any reference to the repealed regulation in legal, administrative, or operational contexts is now **invalid**.
- **No Current Application**: The provisions of the repealed regulation are no longer part of Canadian law.
- **Need for Replacement**: If the repealed regulation had served a specific function (e.g., licensing, compliance, or procedural rules), that function may now be governed by a new regulation or policy introduced in its place — though that would need to be identified through further review of SOR/2017-84 or related legislation.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in your query has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. It was formally removed from the legal framework by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which was enacted in April 2017. As such, it should not be referenced or applied in any current legal or regulatory context.

> 🔍 **Note**: To determine what the original regulation was (e.g., its title or subject matter), you would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation that was repealed — which is not included in your input. The repealing instrument (SOR/2017-84) may list the specific regulation being repealed in its body, but that information is not provided here.

If you can provide the **title or subject** of the original regulation, I can help identify its content or successor.
