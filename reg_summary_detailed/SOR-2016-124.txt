### **Detailed Summary of the National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations – Authorizations**

This regulation, issued by the **National Energy Board (NEB)** under **subsections 112(5)a and (5.1)b of the National Energy Board Act**, establishes a comprehensive framework for **authorizing and regulating activities that may disturb or interfere with pipelines** in Canada. It aims to **prevent pipeline damage**, **protect public safety**, **minimize environmental harm**, and **ensure the integrity of underground infrastructure**.

The regulation came into force on **June 19, 2016**, and applies to all activities involving ground disturbance within a **30-meter prescribed area** (measured perpendicularly from the centerline of a pipeline), **except in offshore areas**.

## **I. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (CERA). |
| **Commission** | Refers to the regulatory body established under subsection 26(1) of the Act (i.e., the current regulator, now known as the **Canadian Energy Regulator**). |
| **Facility** | Any structure such as roads, railways, ditches, sewers, pipelines, power lines, or telecommunications lines. |
| **Offshore Area** | Submarine areas adjacent to Canada’s coast. |
| **Overhead Line** | An above-ground power, telephone, or telecommunication line. |
| **Pipe** | A conduit used for transporting hydrocarbons or other commodities. |
| **Working Day** | A day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday. |

> **Prescribed Area**: A 30-meter strip on either side of the pipeline centerline — the zone where ground disturbance is strictly regulated.

## **II. General Requirements for Ground Disturbance Activities**

Any person intending to:
- Construct a facility across, on, along, or under a pipeline, or
- Engage in an activity causing a ground disturbance within the prescribed area,  
**must make a locate request at least three working days before the activity begins**.

### **How to Make a Locate Request**
1. **If in an area with a one-call centre**: Submit the request to the **one-call centre**.
2. **If outside a one-call centre area**: Submit the request **directly to the pipeline company**.

> ⚠️ **Exception for Emergencies**: In cases where immediate action is required to prevent life-threatening danger or significant property/environmental damage, the 3-day rule does **not apply** — the request must be made as soon as possible.

---

## **III. Role of One-Call Centres**

A **one-call centre** is an organization that:
- Receives locate requests from within a defined geographic area;
- Notifies all affected pipeline operators (members) of proposed construction or ground disturbance activities.

This system ensures that all pipeline operators are aware of planned activities that could impact underground infrastructure, allowing them to take preventive measures.

---

## **IV. Obligations of Contractors and Project Managers**

All individuals or companies undertaking construction or activities must:
- Inform **all employees, contractors, and subcontractors** working on their behalf of their obligations under these regulations.
- Ensure full compliance with all applicable safety, technical, and procedural requirements.

---

## **V. Prohibition Areas**

If a pipeline company, after receiving a locate request, designates a **prohibition area** (which may extend beyond the prescribed 30-meter zone), then:
- **No ground disturbance is allowed** within that area during the period specified in **subsection 335(7)** of the Act.

This is a proactive safety measure to avoid accidental damage to pipelines.

---

## **VI. Authorization Conditions for Activities (Non-Offshore Areas)**

Authorization to carry out activities (construction, excavation, maintenance, etc.) within the prescribed area is granted **only if** the following conditions are met:

### ✅ **General Authorization Criteria (for most activities)**  
For construction, activities, or operations (excluding overhead lines), authorization is granted if:
1. The pipeline company is **authorized** to carry out the activity under the Act;
2. A **locate request** is made in accordance with Section 3;
3. The requesting party obtains from the **other pipeline company** (if applicable) the information required under **paragraphs 6(1)(a) and (c)** of the *Obligations of Pipeline Companies* regulations — specifically:
   - Location of the pipeline;
   - Type of pipe and material;
   - Depth and direction of the pipeline.

> This ensures transparency and coordination among multiple pipeline operators.

---

### ✅ **Construction of Overhead Lines (Special Case)**  
Authorization is granted if:
1. A locate request is made;
2. The person **confirms with the pipeline company** that all nearby pipeline segments have been properly marked;
3. The person obtains the required information (as above).

> **Prohibited Actions**: No poles, pylons, towers, guy wires, anchors, or supporting structures may be placed **across, on, along, or under** the pipeline.

> **Additional Requirements**:
- Must comply with provincial and federal laws;
- If the pipeline is patrolled by aircraft, **aerial warning devices must be installed and maintained** to prevent aircraft collision risks.

---

### ✅ **Maintenance of Existing Facilities**  
Maintenance activities that cause ground disturbance are authorized if:
- The person complies with **paragraphs 10(1)(b) and (c)** of the *Obligations of Pipeline Companies*;
- Follows the **measures listed in paragraphs 10(3)(c) to (h)** — including proper procedures for excavation and reporting.

---

### ✅ **Operation of Vehicles or Mobile Equipment Across Pipelines**  
Authorization is granted if:
- The person obtains **written consent** from the pipeline company.

> **Exception: Agricultural Activities**  
For vehicles used in **agricultural activities** (e.g., plowing, harrowing, tillage, pasturing), authorization is granted if:
1. The **axle weight and tire pressure** are within the manufacturer’s approved limits;
2. The **crossing point has not previously been notified** under section 7 of the *Obligations of Pipeline Companies*.

> **Note**: Agricultural activities include tillage, plowing, disking, and pasturing.  
> ❌ Excluded: Building new structures, placing footings, foundations, or fence posts.

---

## **VII. Construction and Activity Compliance Requirements**

All parties must comply with the following **technical and procedural measures**:

### **For Construction or Activities:**
- Carry out work **in accordance with the technical details** in the consent request and as accepted by the pipeline company;
- Complete the work **within two years** of obtaining consent (unless otherwise agreed);
- Follow **instructions from the pipeline company’s authorized field representative** regarding safety and security;
- Obtain **written consent** before interfering with or altering a pipe;
- Carry out any interference **under the pipeline company’s direct supervision**;
- **Immediately notify** the pipeline company of any contact with a pipe or its coating;
- **Notify at least 24 hours before backfilling** over a pipe (unless otherwise agreed).

> ⚠️ **Excavation Restrictions (within 3 m of pipe)**:
- Mechanical excavation within 3 meters of a pipe is **only permitted** if:
  - The pipe is **exposed by hand** at sufficient intervals (parallel excavation), OR
  - The pipeline company has used a method to confirm the pipe’s exact location and has informed the contractor;
- If excavation **crosses the pipe**, the pipe must be exposed at the crossing point, and the pipeline company must confirm the pipe is at least **60 cm deeper** than the excavation.
- If ground conditions make location impractical, the **pipeline company must directly supervise** the excavation.
