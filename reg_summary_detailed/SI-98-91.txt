**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation is a formal government order issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act* in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It specifically modifies the boundaries of a land grant by including certain portions of land adjacent to Yellowknife Bay, thereby extending the rights of ownership or use to areas previously excluded.

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Issuing Body**: His Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
- **Legal Basis**: Paragraph 13(b) of the *Territorial Lands Act*, which empowers the Governor General to make land grants or modifications to existing grants, particularly in relation to land adjacent to water bodies or in areas of public or Indigenous significance.

This indicates that the regulation is not merely a routine land transfer but one grounded in specific statutory authority, likely involving public interest, Indigenous land rights, or environmental considerations.

### **2. Scope of the Land Modification**
The regulation amends the grant of land by **including specific portions** of land described in an attached schedule. These portions are defined as:
- Any part of the lands described in the schedule that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark of Yellowknife Bay**.

This inclusion is significant because:
- The 30.48 metres (100 feet) threshold is a standard distance used in land surveying and legal descriptions to define land adjacent to water bodies.
- The "ordinary high water mark" is the benchmark used to determine the boundary between land and water, typically established through hydrological surveys. This ensures that the included land is directly adjacent to the bay and not merely a distance away.

This inclusion may be driven by:
- Environmental protection (e.g., access to water, flood zones, or ecological zones),
- Indigenous land rights or traditional use,
- Infrastructure development (e.g., access roads, utilities, or public facilities),
- Or legal clarification of land boundaries.

### **3. Specific Lots Included in the Grant**
The regulation explicitly identifies the following **lots** in **Block 19** of the City of Yellowknife:
- Lots 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

These lots are part of a larger land parcel within the city of Yellowknife, and their inclusion in the grant is now expanded due to the addition of the adjacent water-access zone.

---

### **4. Legal Documentation and Recordation**
- The lots are referenced on a **plan of survey of record number 40264**, held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.
- A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District in Yellowknife under **file number 66**.

This ensures:
- Legal transparency and traceability,
- Public access to the official land records,
- That the land description and boundaries are officially recorded and recognized in the territorial land registry.

---

### **5. Implications and Significance**
- **Boundary Expansion**: The land grant is now larger than originally described, incorporating land adjacent to Yellowknife Bay.
- **Legal Clarity**: This regulation provides clear legal authority for the ownership or use of the newly included land, which may be critical for development, conservation, or Indigenous land claims.
- **Public Access**: The recordation in the Land Titles Office ensures that all stakeholders (e.g., developers, Indigenous groups, government agencies) can verify the boundaries and rights associated with these lots.
- **Environmental or Cultural Consideration**: The inclusion of land near a bay suggests that the decision may be tied to environmental protection, Indigenous traditional use, or water-related infrastructure.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally expands the grant of land in Block 19, City of Yellowknife, by including any portion of the described lands within 100 feet (30.48 metres) of the ordinary high water mark of Yellowknife Bay. It is issued under statutory authority, supported by a recorded survey plan, and filed in the official land registry. The order serves to clarify land boundaries, ensure legal consistency, and likely reflects a broader policy objective related to environmental, cultural, or developmental interests in the Yellowknife area.

This is a typical example of how land grants in Canada are adjusted to reflect practical or legal needs while maintaining compliance with territorial land laws.
