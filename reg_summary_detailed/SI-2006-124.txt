**Date of Regulation:** 1991 (as part of the enactment of the Excise Tax Act)  
**Effective Date:** Implied upon issuance (the remission is retroactive to the specified period)

---

**Key Provisions and Details:**

1. **Purpose of the Regulation:**  
   The regulation provides for the remission (i.e., forgiveness or cancellation) of a specific excise tax liability that was previously assessed and paid by **Valley Gospel Mission**, a religious organization. This action is taken in the **public interest**, as determined by the Governor General in Council (the highest executive authority in Canada), acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**.

2. **Nature of the Tax:**  
   The tax in question is an **excise tax** under **Division II of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**. This division typically applies to certain goods and services, including **religious publications** such as religious books. The tax was levied on the sale of religious books during a specific time period.

3. **Time Period Covered:**  
   The tax remission applies to sales of religious books that occurred between **April 1, 1997**, and **September 30, 2001**. This period spans five years and reflects a specific commercial activity of the organization during that time.

4. **Amount of Tax and Interest:**  
   The total amount being remitted is **$1,232.60**, which includes:
   - The original excise tax paid on the sales of religious books.
   - Related interest accrued on that tax during the period in question.

5. **Legal Basis:**  
   The remission is authorized under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the Governor General in Council to remit taxes or tax liabilities when it is in the **public interest**. This provision allows for discretionary relief, particularly in cases involving religious, charitable, or non-profit activities that may be considered to serve a public benefit.

6. **Reasoning for Remission:**  
   While not explicitly stated in the regulation, the public interest justification implies that:
   - The sale of religious books by Valley Gospel Mission serves a **public service or community benefit**.
   - The tax burden on such activities may be disproportionate or contrary to the broader goals of promoting religious freedom and access to religious materials.
   - The organization operates as a **non-profit, charitable, or faith-based entity**, and the tax may have had an undue financial impact on its operations.

7. **Administrative Process:**  
   - The **Minister of National Revenue** identified the tax liability and recommended the remission.
   - The **Governor General in Council** reviewed the recommendation and, finding it in the public interest, formally approved the remission.

8. **Impact:**  
   - The remission effectively **cancels** the excise tax and interest owed by Valley Gospel Mission for the specified period.
   - The organization is relieved of the financial obligation, which may support its ability to continue providing religious services or materials to the public.

**Significance and Context:**

This regulation exemplifies how Canadian tax policy can accommodate religious and charitable activities. By exempting or remitting excise taxes on religious publications, the government acknowledges the role of faith-based organizations in promoting access to religious education and community engagement. It also reflects a broader principle in Canadian law that taxes should not unduly burden activities that serve public or moral values, especially when those activities are non-commercial or community-oriented.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a discretionary, public-interest-based tax remission that forgives $1,232.60 in excise tax and interest paid by Valley Gospel Mission for the sale of religious books between April 1, 1997, and September 30, 2001. It is grounded in the Financial Administration Act and reflects a policy choice to support religious and charitable activities within the Canadian public interest.
