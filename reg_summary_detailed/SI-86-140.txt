### **1. Revocation of Prior Order**
- The regulation formally **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1974-1281**, dated May 30, 1974.
- This earlier order had previously established fees for services provided by Her Majesty in respect of the importation and exportation of animals and animal by-products into and out of Canada.

### **2. Authority Granted to the Minister of Agriculture**
- The Minister of Agriculture is now **authorized to prescribe fees** for services provided by the Government of Canada in connection with:
  - The **importation** of animals and animal by-products into Canada.
  - The **exportation** of animals and animal by-products from Canada.
- This authority is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board) to authorize fee-setting powers in specific administrative contexts.

  - Respond to evolving trade practices and international requirements.

### **4. Key Implications**

- **Regulatory Clarity**: By revoking the 1974 order, the Government removes ambiguity and outdated provisions, promoting a transparent and up-to-date regulatory environment.

### **5. Legal Basis**
- The regulation is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the federal government to authorize fees for services provided by the Crown, particularly in areas of public interest and administrative necessity.
- This authority is exercised through the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board, reflecting a standard process for administrative fee regulation in Canada.

This regulation represents a significant update to Canada’s administrative framework for animal and animal by-product trade. By revoking the 1974 order and empowering the Minister of Agriculture to prescribe current fees, the Government enhances regulatory agility, ensures financial sustainability, and aligns fee structures with modern trade and public health standards. It reflects a commitment to efficient, transparent, and responsive governance in agricultural and food safety policy.
