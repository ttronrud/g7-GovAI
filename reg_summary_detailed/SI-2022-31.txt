> This is a significant administrative realignment that reflects a strategic shift in how the federal government manages public health policy.

#### **4. Scope of the Transfer**
The transfer specifically includes:
- All **powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of Health under:
  1. **Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA)**  
     - This includes regulatory authority over prescription drugs, illicit drugs, narcotics, and controlled substances.
     - Functions such as setting drug schedules, licensing pharmacies, overseeing drug trafficking, and enforcing compliance with drug control policies.
  2. **Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA)**  
     - Authority over the regulation of tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, smokeless tobacco) and vaping products (e.g., e-cigarettes, vaping devices).
     - Includes powers to set age restrictions, regulate advertising, require product labeling, and enforce compliance with safety and health standards.

> Importantly, the transfer **does not** extend to other areas of health policy (e.g., public health initiatives, medical research, or hospital funding), which remain under the broader purview of the Minister of Health or other relevant departments.

#### **5. Rationale and Policy Implications**
- **Enhanced Focus on Mental Health and Addictions**:  
  The transfer aligns with Canada’s broader public health strategy to address substance use disorders, including mental health conditions, as interconnected issues. By placing drug and tobacco regulation under a dedicated mental health and addictions portfolio, the government aims to:
  - Improve integration of substance use treatment and prevention.
  - Promote a more holistic, person-centered approach to addiction services.
  - Strengthen cross-sector coordination between mental health, substance use, and public health programs.

- **Improved Policy Consistency and Accountability**:  
  Having drug and tobacco regulation under a minister with a specific mandate in mental health and addictions allows for:
  - More coherent policy development.
  - Better alignment with public health goals (e.g., reducing harm, preventing addiction, supporting recovery).
  - Greater accountability in addressing the social and health impacts of substance use.

- **Clarification of Ministerial Roles**:  
  The creation of an **Associate Minister of Health** ensures that health-related functions (such as public health monitoring, disease prevention, and health promotion) are still supported, even as core regulatory powers are transferred.

#### **6. Effective Date and Implementation**
- While the regulation does not specify an effective date in the provided text, such transfers are typically implemented immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and are subject to internal departmental implementation plans.
- The actual operational changes would be rolled out through:
  - Departmental policy updates
  - Training for federal officers and regulators
  - Communication to stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, industry, public)

#### **7. Constitutional and Administrative Context**
- The Governor General in Council acts on the **advice of the Prime Minister**, which is consistent with the constitutional principle of responsible government.
- This transfer is **not a change in law**, but a **reorganization of ministerial responsibilities** within the existing legal framework.
- It does not alter the substance of the CDSA or TVPA, only the **minister responsible for administering them**.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **strategic reorganization** of federal health governance in Canada. By transferring the regulatory powers over controlled drugs and tobacco products from the Minister of Health to the **Minister of Mental Health and Addictions** (with an Associate Minister of Health), the government seeks to:
