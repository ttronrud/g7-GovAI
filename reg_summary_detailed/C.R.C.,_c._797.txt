**Detailed Summary of the Machinery Sales Tax Remission Order**

---

**Title:**  
*Machinery Sales Tax Remission Order*

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *Machinery Sales Tax Remission Order*.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **remit (i.e., refund or cancel) sales tax** that was previously paid or is otherwise payable under the *Excise Tax Act* on certain machinery and equipment, in specific circumstances where **customs duties have already been remitted** under prior government orders.

This remission is designed to **prevent double taxation** — specifically, to avoid the situation where a business pays sales tax on goods based on a full duty-paid value, when in fact customs duties on those goods have already been reduced or forgiven (remitted) under a separate customs regime.

---

### **Key Provisions and Scope**

#### 1. **Applicable Goods**
The remission applies to **goods classified under specific tariff items** in Schedule II to the *Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-54*. These tariff items are:

- 42700-1 to 42700-5  
- 42700-9 to 42700-16  
- 42701-1 to 42701-3  

These tariff headings generally relate to **machinery and equipment**, including industrial, mechanical, and manufacturing machinery.

> *Note:* The specific nature of these goods may include items such as machine tools, processing equipment, or industrial machinery, though the exact description would depend on the tariff classification.

#### 2. **Timing of the Remission**
- The customs duty remission must have occurred **after November 5, 1980**.
- The goods must have been **released and accounted for under the Customs Act on or after November 5, 1980**.

This establishes a clear temporal boundary — the remission is only applicable to goods that entered the Canadian market after that date and were processed through customs accordingly.

#### 3. **Legal Basis for the Remission**
- The customs duty remission is authorized under **orders made after November 5, 1980**.
- These orders remain in force due to **section 133 of the Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-54, as amended** (specifically, section 133 of *Customs Tariff, R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*).

This ensures that the customs duty remission is legally valid and continues to be recognized under the current tariff framework.

#### 4. **Mechanism of Sales Tax Remission**
The sales tax remitted under this Order is **equal to the difference** between:

- **The amount of sales tax originally paid or payable** on the goods, and  
- **The amount of sales tax that would have been payable if the duty-paid value used to calculate the sales tax had been reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission.**

In simpler terms:

> If customs duties were reduced (e.g., by $10,000), the value used to compute sales tax is also reduced by that amount. Since sales tax is typically calculated as a percentage of the duty-paid value, the resulting sales tax liability is lower.  
>  
> This Order refunds the **excess sales tax** paid — i.e., the difference between what was actually paid and what would have been due under the adjusted (lower) duty-paid value.

#### 5. **Nature of the Remission**
- It is a **partial refund or credit** of sales tax — not a full refund.
- It is **only applicable where customs duties were previously remitted** under the specified tariff items and after November 5, 1980.
- The remission is **conditional** on the goods being released and accounted for under the Customs Act on or after that date.

### **Key Implications**

1. **Tax Relief for Businesses**  
   Businesses that imported machinery under these tariff items and paid sales tax based on a higher duty-paid value may now claim a refund of the overpaid tax due to the earlier customs duty remission.

2. **Prevention of Double Taxation**  
   This Order ensures that businesses are not taxed twice — once on customs duties and once on sales tax — when duties have already been remitted.

3. **Alignment with Customs Policy**  
   The Order reflects a coordinated policy between customs and excise taxation, ensuring that changes in customs duty obligations are reflected in the sales tax calculation.

4. **Historical Context**  
   The date of November 5, 1980, marks a significant policy shift in Canadian trade policy. The Order codifies the tax consequences of that shift for machinery imports.

### **Practical Example**

Suppose a Canadian business imports a machine under tariff 42700-1:

- Original customs duty paid: $50,000  
- Customs duty remitted: $20,000 (under a post-November 5, 1980 order)  
- Duty-paid value used for sales tax calculation: $100,000 (original value)  
- Sales tax rate: 10%  
- Sales tax originally paid: $10,000  

But if the duty-paid value is reduced by the $20,000 remitted, the new value is $80,000.  
New sales tax due: 10% × $80,000 = $8,000  

Therefore, the **difference** in sales tax = $10,000 – $8,000 = **$2,000**  

→ The business is entitled to a **remission (refund) of $2,000** under this Order.

### **Conclusion**

The *Machinery Sales Tax Remission Order* is a targeted tax relief mechanism that ensures **fairness and consistency** in the taxation of machinery imports when customs duties have been remitted. It corrects overpayment of sales tax by refunding the difference that results from a lower duty-paid value, thereby aligning excise taxation with customs duty adjustments. The Order applies only to specific machinery under defined tariff items, released after November 5, 1980, and is grounded in statutory authority and policy continuity.

This regulation is a critical component of Canada’s integrated customs and excise tax system, promoting tax equity and reducing administrative burden on importers of industrial equipment.
