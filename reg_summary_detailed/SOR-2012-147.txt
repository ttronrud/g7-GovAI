Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

> **"Regulations Designating Physical Activities"**  
> Made under **paragraphs 84(a) and (e)** of the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012*  
> S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 52  
> Ottawa, July 6, 2012  
> (Repealed or amended by SOR/2013-186, s. 1)

## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation designates specific **physical activities** that are subject to mandatory **environmental assessment (EA)** under the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012)*. It defines what constitutes a "designated project" and specifies which types of projects must undergo a formal environmental review before proceeding.

The regulation came into force on **July 6, 2012**, and was initially issued under the authority of **paragraphs 84(a) and (e)** of CEAA 2012, which empower the Minister of the Environment to designate certain physical activities requiring environmental assessment.

Importantly, **many definitions in the regulation have been repealed** (e.g., paper product, pulp, pulp and paper mill, right of way, abandonment, decommissioning, Class IA/IB nuclear facilities), indicating that the scope of the regulation has been streamlined or replaced by more current legislation. This reflects a broader legislative shift toward focusing on major infrastructure and resource development projects with significant environmental impacts.

## 📚 Key Definitions (with Notes on Repeal)

| Term | Meaning | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Aerodrome** | Same as in the *Aeronautics Act* | Still in force (as defined) |
| **Area of mine operations** | Ground-level area occupied by open pits, underground workings, mills, or storage areas | **Repealed** |
| **Canal** | Artificial waterway constructed for navigation | In force |
| **Drilling program** | As defined in *Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations* | In force |
| **Exploratory well** | As defined in *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* (excludes delineation and development wells) | In force |
| **Flowline** | As defined in *Canada Oil and Gas Installations Regulations* | In force |
| **Hazardous waste** | As defined in *Export and Import of Hazardous Waste Regulations* (excluding nuclear substances) | In force |
| **Marine terminal** | Area used for ship berthing, cargo handling, passenger movement, and maintenance; includes adjacent areas | In force |
| **Migratory bird sanctuary** | Areas listed in the *Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations* | In force |
| **New right of way** | Land proposed for transmission lines, pipelines, railways, or highways, not adjacent to existing rights-of-way | In force |
| **Nuclear facility** | As defined in *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* | In force |
| **Nuclear substance** | As defined in *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* | In force |
| **Offshore** | Includes areas requiring authorization under *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord* or *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord* | In force |
| **Oil and gas pipeline** | Pipeline used for transmission of hydrocarbons alone or with other commodities | In force |
| **Water body** | Natural water bodies (canals, reservoirs, oceans, wetlands) up to high-water mark; excludes sewage lagoons or mine tailings ponds | In force |
| **Wildlife area** | As defined in *Wildlife Area Regulations* | In force |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Several definitions (e.g., abandonment, decommissioning, Class IA/IB nuclear facilities, pulp, paper product, waste management system) were **repealed** by **SOR/2013-186, s. 1**. This suggests that the regulation was updated to align with more current environmental and regulatory frameworks, removing outdated or obsolete categories.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Regulation

The primary purposes are:

1. **To identify physical activities that require a mandatory environmental assessment** under CEAA 2012.
2. **To assign responsibility for oversight** of these activities to specific federal agencies based on the type of project.
3. **To ensure that major developments with significant environmental impacts** are properly evaluated before proceeding.

These designated activities are linked to specific **paragraphs in CEAA 2012**, particularly:
- **Paragraph (b) of the definition "designated project" in subsection 2(1)** – applies to projects listed in the schedule.
- **Paragraph 58(1)(a)** – applies to activities designated under subsection 14(2) of CEAA 2012 (e.g., new or expanded facilities).

---

## 📋 Schedule of Designated Physical Activities

The regulation lists **48 physical activities**, grouped into categories. Below is a **detailed breakdown** of each category with thresholds and conditions.

---

### 🌊 **1. Construction, Operation, Decommissioning & Abandonment in Wildlife Areas or Migratory Bird Sanctuaries**

Projects that must undergo environmental assessment **if located in protected areas**:

- New **electrical generating facility or transmission line**
- **Structure for water diversion** (dam, dyke, reservoir)
- **Oil or gas facility or pipeline**
- **Mine or mill**
- **Industrial facility**
- **Canal or lock**
- **Marine terminal**
- **Railway line or public highway**
- **Aerodrome or runway**
- **Waste management facility**

> 🔍 *Note:* These projects are subject to environmental assessment **even if not otherwise regulated**, due to their location in ecologically sensitive zones.

---

### 🔋 **2. New Energy Facilities with Threshold Capacities**

Projects requiring assessment based on **capacity thresholds**:

| Project | Capacity Threshold |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Fossil fuel-fired generating facility** | ≥ 200 MW |
| **In-stream tidal power facility** | ≥ 50 MW |
| **Tidal power facility (non-in-stream)** | ≥ 5 MW |
| **Hydroelectric generating facility** | ≥ 200 MW |

> ✅ These are **new** facilities. Expansion projects are covered in the next section.

---

### 🔧 **3. Expansion of Existing Energy Facilities**

Expansion requires assessment if it results in:

- **≥ 50% increase in capacity**, and
- **Total capacity meets or exceeds the threshold**

Examples:
- Fossil fuel plant: increase of ≥50% and total ≥200 MW
- In-stream tidal: ≥50% increase and total ≥50 MW
- Tidal (non-in-stream): ≥50% increase and total ≥5 MW
- Hydroelectric: ≥50% increase and total ≥200 MW

> 🔍 This ensures that even incremental expansions of large facilities trigger environmental review if they significantly increase impact.

---

### 🌊 **4. New Dams or Dykes with Reservoirs**

- Construction of a new dam/dyke that creates a reservoir with a surface area **exceeding the annual mean surface area of a natural water body by ≥1,500 hectares (ha)**.

> ⚠️ This threshold is designed to prevent projects that create large artificial lakes, which can disrupt ecosystems, fish migration, and flood patterns.

---

### 🌊 **5. Expansion of Existing Dams or Dykes**

- Increase in reservoir surface area by **≥50%** and **≥1,500 ha** in annual mean surface area.

> 🔍 This prevents incremental expansions that could significantly alter hydrology and ecological conditions.

---

### 💧 **6. New or Expanded Water Diversion Structures**

- **New structure** diverting **≥10,000,000 m³/year** of water from a natural water body to another.
- **Expansion** of existing structure resulting in:
  - ≥50% increase in diversion capacity
  - Total capacity ≥10,000,000 m³/year

> 🌍 This protects river systems and aquatic ecosystems from over-extraction.

---

### 🏭 **7. New Oil Sands Mines**

- **New oil sands mine** with bitumen production capacity of **≥10,000 m³/day**

> ⚠️ Oil sands development is known for high environmental impact (e.g., land disturbance, water use, greenhouse gas emissions), so this threshold ensures major projects are assessed.

---

### 🏭 **8. Expansion of Existing Oil Sands Mines**

- Increase in mine operations area by **≥50%**
- Total bitumen production capacity ≥10,000 m³/day

> 🔍 Prevents gradual expansion of oil sands operations that could exceed environmental thresholds.

---

### 🌊 **9. Offshore Exploratory Wells (First Drilling Program)**

- Drilling of **offshore exploratory wells** in areas covered by exploration licenses under:
  - *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*
  - *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*

> 🚨 These are the **first drilling programs** in a region — a high-impact phase requiring environmental review.

---

### 🚢 **10. New Offshore Platforms or Vessels**

- Construction of **new floating or fixed offshore platforms, vessels, or artificial islands** for
