**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Athabasca River Populations Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
March 9, 2021  
**Effective Date:**  
The day on which the Order is registered (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette)

**Governing Legislation:**  
*Species at Risk Act (SARA)*  
S.C. 2002, c. 29  
Specifically, **Section 58** of SARA, which provides the legal framework for identifying, designating, and managing critical habitat for listed wildlife species.

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Endangered Status of the Species**  
   The Rainbow Trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) Athabasca River population is officially designated as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**. This status means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires special protection and recovery measures.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**  
   A formal **recovery strategy** for this population was developed and has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy identifies the specific areas—known as *critical habitat*—that are essential for the survival and recovery of the species.

3. **Legal Requirement to Exclude Certain Areas**  
   Under **Section 58(2)(b)** of SARA, certain areas may be excluded from critical habitat designation if they are located within a **protected area** under federal jurisdiction, such as a national park.  
   In this case, a portion of the identified critical habitat lies within **Jasper National Park of Canada**, which is governed by the *Canada National Parks Act*.

   Furthermore, **Section 58(5)** of SARA requires that any such exclusion be justified and formally documented. It also mandates that the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** must consult with the **Minister responsible for Parks Canada**—specifically, the **Minister of the Environment**—before making an exclusion.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Applicability of Section 58(1)**  
  The critical habitat for the Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Athabasca River population is **applicable under Section 58(1) of SARA**, **except** for the portion located within **Jasper National Park of Canada**.

- **Exclusion of Critical Habitat in Jasper National Park**  
  The Order explicitly **excludes** the portion of the critical habitat that lies within Jasper National Park. This exclusion is based on the fact that:
  - The area is already protected under the *Canada National Parks Act*.
  - Such areas are generally managed for conservation and public use, and direct human activities (like development or resource extraction) are restricted.
  - The exclusion is consistent with the intent of SARA to avoid overlapping critical habitat designations with existing protected areas where such overlap would not serve the species' recovery.

- **Legal Basis for the Exclusion**  
  The exclusion is made **pursuant to Section 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA:
  - **Section 58(4)** allows the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to make orders designating critical habitat.
  - **Section 58(5)** requires consultation with the Minister of the Environment (representing Parks Canada) before such an order is made.  
    → This consultation process was completed, confirming that the exclusion is both legally valid and environmentally sound.

### **Purpose and Implications**

- **Conservation and Recovery Goals**  
  The Order ensures that the species’ recovery strategy remains focused on areas where active management and protection are needed, while respecting the existing protections in national parks.

- **Prevention of Regulatory Conflict**  
  By excluding the Jasper National Park portion, the Order avoids potential conflicts between federal environmental protection mandates and the development or use of land within national parks.

- **Transparency and Public Access**  
  The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the *Species at Risk Public Registry* ensures transparency and allows stakeholders, scientists, Indigenous communities, and the public to access information about where the species lives and where protections apply.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the **critical habitat** of the endangered Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Athabasca River population, **excluding** the portion located within **Jasper National Park of Canada**. This exclusion is legally justified under SARA, based on the protection of national parks and the need for inter-ministerial consultation. The Order supports the species' recovery by ensuring that only areas outside of existing protected zones are subject to specific critical habitat management, while preserving the integrity of national park ecosystems.

The Order comes into force upon registration and serves as a key tool in the long-term conservation and recovery of this vulnerable fish population.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Species: Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) – Athabasca River population  
- Status: Endangered under SARA  
- Critical habitat: Identified in recovery strategy, registered publicly  
- Excluded area: Within Jasper National Park  
- Legal basis: SARA Sections 58(4) and 58(5), with required consultation  
- Purpose: To balance species recovery with existing protected area management  

This regulation reflects a balanced, science-based, and legally compliant approach to species conservation in Canada.
