## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Implementing United Nations Resolution 1970 (2011) and Related Measures**

### 📌 **1. Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations were enacted by the **Governor in Council** of Canada, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, under two key pieces of Canadian legislation:

- **Section 4(1) to (3) of the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**  
- **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**

They implement **United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011)**, adopted on **February 26, 2011**, which called for **economic sanctions** against Libya due to its actions threatening international peace and security.

The Governor in Council concluded that:
- The situation in Libya constituted a **grave breach of international peace and security**.
- The measures in Resolution 1970 were necessary to **prevent further destabilization** and to **address serious international risks**.

Thus, these regulations provide the **domestic legal framework** to enforce those UN sanctions in Canada.
