### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**
- The regulation is issued under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207; R.S., c. P-34).
- This provision grants the Governor General in Council the authority to transfer control and supervision of certain public service functions or units from one department to another, particularly in the context of restructuring or reorganizing federal public administration.

**2. Nature of the Transfer:**
- The **control and supervision** of the **Internal E-staffing Unit** within the **Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (HRSD)** is being transferred.
- The Internal E-staffing Unit is a specialized unit responsible for managing and administering **electronic (e-) staffing processes** within the federal public service. This may include digital tools, systems, and procedures related to hiring, recruitment, job postings, candidate management, and workforce planning via electronic platforms.

**3. Transfer Destination:**
- The unit is being transferred to the **Public Service Commission (PSC)**.
- The Public Service Commission is the independent body responsible for overseeing the integrity, fairness, and effectiveness of the federal public service, including recruitment, merit-based appointments, and administrative accountability.

**4. Effective Date:**
- The transfer becomes effective on **July 1, 2011**.
- This means that from that date onward, the Public Service Commission assumes full responsibility for the governance, oversight, policy direction, and administrative management of the Internal E-staffing Unit.

**5. Purpose and Implications:**
- The transfer reflects a broader effort to **enhance transparency, accountability, and merit-based practices** in public service staffing.
- By placing the e-staffing unit under the Public Service Commission, the government ensures that digital recruitment processes are subject to **independent oversight**, reducing potential for bias or inefficiency.
- It also aligns with modernization goals, as electronic staffing systems require consistent standards, data security, and compliance with public service values such as fairness and equity.

**6. Legal and Institutional Context:**
- The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* allows for strategic reallocation of administrative responsibilities to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
- The Public Service Commission, as a key institution in federal governance, is better positioned than a departmental unit to ensure that staffing processes—especially those involving digital tools—are equitable, transparent, and compliant with public service principles.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization aimed at strengthening the integrity and efficiency of federal public service staffing through the transfer of the Internal E-staffing Unit from the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development to the Public Service Commission. Effective July 1, 2011, the PSC now has authority over all aspects of the unit’s operations, ensuring that electronic recruitment and staffing processes adhere to public service standards and are subject to independent review.

This move underscores the government’s commitment to modernizing public service delivery while maintaining rigorous oversight and accountability in personnel management.
