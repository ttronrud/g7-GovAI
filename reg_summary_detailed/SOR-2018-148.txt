**Detailed Summary of the Blood Drug Concentration Regulations (S.C. 2018, c. 21, s. 2; R.S., c. C-46)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Blood Drug Concentration Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, under **section 253.1a of the Criminal Code** of Canada. These regulations establish specific blood concentration thresholds for certain drugs and alcohol, which are used to determine legal liability under relevant provisions of the *Criminal Code*, particularly in the context of impaired driving.

The regulations came into force on the day they were made and apply immediately upon issuance, with no delay before publication in the *Canada Gazette*—a requirement under **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**.

### **Key Provisions and Purpose**

#### 1. **Prescribed Blood THC Concentration (for subsection 320.14(4))**
- **Drug:** Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
- **Threshold:** **2 ng of THC per mL of blood**
- **Purpose:** This concentration is the legal threshold used to determine impairment under **subsection 320.14(4)** of the *Criminal Code*, which applies to offences related to impaired driving involving cannabis.
- **Note:** This is a specific threshold for THC and applies only in the context of a driver being found to have a blood concentration of THC at or above this level, potentially leading to a conviction for impaired driving.

#### 2. **Prescribed Blood Drug Concentrations (for paragraph 320.14(1)(c))**
- **Scope:** Applies to each drug listed in **Column 1 of the table** attached to the regulations.
- **Thresholds:** The corresponding blood concentration for each drug is specified in **Column 2** of the table.
- **Purpose:** This provision establishes legally recognized blood concentration limits for various controlled substances (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, etc.) to determine whether a person is impaired while operating a motor vehicle.
- **Legal Basis:** These thresholds are used under **paragraph 320.14(1)(c)** of the *Criminal Code*, which allows for a finding of impaired driving when a person has a blood concentration of a specified drug at or above the prescribed level.

> *Note: While the full table is not included in your text, the regulation references it as a key component. In practice, the table would list drugs such as:*
> - Cocaine
> - Methamphetamine
> - Oxycodone
> - Fentanyl
> - Heroin
> - And others
> *Each with a corresponding blood concentration limit (e.g., 0.5 ng/mL for cocaine, 0.5 ng/mL for methamphetamine, etc.).*

#### 3. **Prescribed Blood Alcohol Concentration and THC Concentration (for paragraph 320.14(1)(d))**
- **Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC):** **50 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood**
- **THC Concentration:** **2.5 ng of THC per mL of blood**
- **Purpose:** This dual threshold applies under **paragraph 320.14(1)(d)** of the *Criminal Code*, which governs impaired driving involving both alcohol and cannabis.
- **Interpretation:** A person may be found impaired if they have:
  - A BAC of **50 mg/100 mL or higher**, **OR**
  - A THC concentration of **2.5 ng/mL or higher**, **OR**
  - A combination of both.
- **Significance:** This provision reflects a shift in Canadian law to recognize that cannabis use, even at low levels, can impair driving ability. The higher THC threshold (2.5 ng/mL) compared to the 2 ng/mL threshold in subsection 320.14(4) indicates a distinction in how alcohol and cannabis are treated under the law.

> *Note: This threshold of 50 mg/100 mL for alcohol is notably higher than the commonly known 0.08% (80 mg/100 mL) limit in many jurisdictions, suggesting a possible policy shift or regional variation. However, in Canada, the standard for impaired driving due to alcohol is generally 0.08%, so this may reflect a specific context or application in certain circumstances (e.g., for specific drug combinations or in certain provinces).*

### **Legal and Procedural Context**

- **Authority:** The regulations are made under **section 253.1a of the Criminal Code**, which grants the Minister of Justice the power to prescribe blood drug concentration levels for the purposes of impaired driving offences.
- **Applicability:** The regulations apply to all persons operating a motor vehicle in Canada, where the presence of a prescribed drug or alcohol concentration in the blood constitutes an offence under the *Criminal Code*.
- **Effective Date:** The regulations come into force on the day they are made, meaning they are immediately enforceable upon issuance.
- **Publication Requirement:** Under **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, these regulations are valid and enforceable from the moment they are made, even before being published in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures prompt legal effect without delay.

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Cannabis and Impaired Driving:**
   - The regulation recognizes that even low levels of THC can impair driving ability.
   - The distinction between 2 ng/mL (for specific subsections) and 2.5 ng/mL (for combined alcohol and cannabis cases) reflects nuanced legal treatment of cannabis impairment.

2. **Drug-Specific Thresholds:**
   - The table of drug concentrations allows for tailored legal responses based on the specific drug involved, acknowledging differences in potency, effects, and metabolism.

3. **Legal Clarity and Enforcement:**
   - Provides clear, objective thresholds for police, courts, and forensic laboratories to use in determining whether a driver is impaired.
   - Supports consistency in prosecution and sentencing decisions.

4. **Policy Shift:**
   - Reflects Canada’s evolving approach to cannabis regulation, especially in light of the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2018.
   - Demonstrates a move toward science-based standards for impaired driving, rather than relying solely on subjective assessments.

### **Conclusion**

The *Blood Drug Concentration Regulations* establish precise, legally binding thresholds for blood alcohol and drug concentrations that are used to determine impaired driving offences under the *Criminal Code*. These thresholds are critical for ensuring fair, consistent, and evidence-based enforcement of impaired driving laws. The regulation sets a **2 ng/mL THC threshold** for specific cases, a **50 mg/100 mL alcohol threshold** (or higher), and a **2.5 ng/mL THC threshold** when combined with alcohol, reflecting a comprehensive and scientifically grounded framework for assessing impairment in drivers.

These rules are foundational in modern Canadian law, particularly in the context of cannabis legalization and the ongoing effort to balance public safety with individual rights.
