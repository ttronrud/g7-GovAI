**Detailed Summary of the Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the *Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs. It is grounded in **section 5(1)** of the *Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act* (R.S.C. 1970, c. 45 (1st Supp.), s. 3).

The primary objective of the Order is to **establish precise geographical coordinates** for key points along the coastlines and islands of **Area 7** — the Canadian Arctic Islands and Mainland — from which **baselines** can be determined to define Canada’s territorial sea limits.

Canada has historically exercised **sovereignty over the waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago**, and this Order formalizes that sovereignty by providing a legally recognized, geographically accurate framework for defining maritime boundaries.

### **2. Legal Basis and Purpose**

- **Legal Authority**: The Order is made under subsection 5(1) of the *Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act*, which empowers the Government to define baselines for territorial sea purposes.
- **Purpose**: To establish definitive, measurable geographical coordinates for points used to determine:
  - The **baseline** (the reference line from which the territorial sea is measured),
  - The **extent of Canada’s territorial sea**,
  - And the **maritime boundaries** in the Canadian Arctic region.

This ensures consistency, legal clarity, and international compliance with maritime law principles, including those under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Canada adheres to.

### **3. Name and Citation**

- The Order is officially titled:  
  **Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order**  
- It may be cited as: *Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order*

---

### **4. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act* — the enabling legislation that provides the legal basis for this Order.
- **Area 7**: Defined as the **Canadian Arctic Islands and Mainland**, including all **islands and low-tide elevations** adjacent to this region. This encompasses the vast and remote Arctic territory where Canada asserts sovereignty.
- **C.H.S. Chart**: Stands for *Canadian Hydrographic Service Chart* — the official nautical chart used to determine geographic positions. These charts are critical for ensuring accuracy in measuring coordinates.

---

### **5. Content of the Order**

The Order includes **three Schedules (I, II, and III)**, each listing specific geographical coordinates of points used to define baselines in different parts of Area 7.

#### **Schedule I – Straight Baselines**
- Applies to **coastal areas** where a **straight-line baseline** connects the listed points.
- The baseline is formed by drawing **straight lines** between the coordinates provided in the schedule.
- These are typically used in areas with well-defined, linear coastlines (e.g., between islands or mainland segments).
- Coordinates in **Columns II and III** of each item are derived from the **C.H.S. Chart** specified in **Column IV** of that item.

#### **Schedule II – Low-Water Line Baselines**
- Applies to **coastal areas** where the baseline follows the **low-water line** along the coast.
- The baseline is the **line of low water** (the lowest tide level) that runs along the coast, connecting the listed points.
- This method is commonly used for mainland coastlines or areas with natural, irregular shorelines.
- Again, coordinates in Columns II and III are determined from the **C.H.S. Chart** referenced in Column IV.
- **Reference to Schedule II** is included in the text to ensure consistency and clarity.

#### **Schedule III – Low-Water Lines for Islands and Low-Tide Elevations**
- Applies to **islands and low-tide elevations** (such as rocks or sandbars exposed at low tide).
- The baseline is defined as the **low-water line** along these features.
- This ensures that even small or irregular landforms are properly included in Canada’s maritime boundary.
- These coordinates are also derived from the **C.H.S. Chart** referenced in the schedule.

### **6. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on **January 1, 1986**. This date marks the formal implementation of the baseline definitions for Area 7, establishing a legal and geographic foundation for Canada’s maritime jurisdiction in the Arctic.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**

- **Sovereignty Assertion**: The Order reinforces Canada’s **sovereignty and jurisdiction** over the waters surrounding the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, a region of strategic and environmental importance.
- **Legal Clarity**: Provides a **clear, measurable, and internationally recognized** method for defining maritime boundaries, which is essential for:
  - Fisheries management,
  - Maritime navigation,
  - Environmental protection,
  - International dispute resolution.
- **Compliance with UNCLOS**: While not explicitly stated, the use of low-water lines and straight baselines aligns with international maritime law principles, particularly those related to the definition of territorial seas and baselines.
- **Scientific and Practical Foundation**: Reliance on **C.H.S. Charts** ensures that coordinates are based on up-to-date, officially verified hydrographic data, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

### **8. Key Provisions in Plain Language**

| Provision | Plain Language Meaning |
|--------|------------------------|
| Coordinates from Charts | All coordinates are measured using official Canadian Hydrographic Service charts to ensure accuracy. |
| Straight Baselines (Schedule I) | Lines are drawn directly between listed points to form the baseline. |
| Low-Water Line Baselines (Schedule II) | The baseline follows the natural edge of the coast at low tide. |
| Baselines on Islands (Schedule III) | The baseline follows the low-water line on islands and low-tide landforms. |
| Effective Date | Begins on January 1, 1986 — legally binding from that date. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order* is a foundational legal instrument that formally defines Canada’s maritime boundaries in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. By establishing precise, chart-based coordinates and specifying baseline types (straight lines or low-water lines), it provides a **robust, legally sound, and internationally recognized framework** for asserting and managing Canada’s territorial sea rights.

This Order reflects Canada’s long-standing commitment to sovereignty in the Arctic and supports effective governance of its vast, remote, and ecologically sensitive territories.

**Note**: This Order is part of a broader series of baseline definitions across Canada’s maritime zones (e.g., Areas 1–6, 8, etc.), and together they form a comprehensive system for determining Canada’s territorial sea and fishing zone boundaries.
