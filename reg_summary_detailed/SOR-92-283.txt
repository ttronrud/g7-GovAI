**Detailed Summary of the Resident Canadian (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

**Regulatory Background and Authority:**

The *Resident Canadian (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under specific authority provided by **paragraph (b) of the definition of "resident Canadian" in Section 2** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 45), and further referenced in **Section 531** of the same Act.

These regulations are designed to **identify specific classes of Canadian citizens who, despite residing outside Canada, are considered "resident Canadians"** for the purposes of determining the regulatory status of trust and loan companies. This classification is essential for ensuring that certain financial institutions—particularly those with Canadian ownership or control—maintain compliance with Canadian financial regulations, even when their operations or key personnel are located abroad.

**Effective Date:**

The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**.

**Regulatory Title:**

The regulations may be cited as the *Resident Canadian (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations*.

### **Classes of Persons Considered Resident Canadians (Under Paragraph (b) of Section 2)**

The regulations define three distinct categories of Canadian citizens who are deemed "resident Canadians" for the purposes of the Trust and Loan Companies Act, even though they are not ordinarily resident in Canada. These categories are:

---

#### **1. Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada Whose Principal Reason for Residing Outside Canada is to Act as a Full-Time Employee of a Body Corporate**

This category applies to Canadian citizens who:
- Are **not ordinarily resident** in Canada,
- Are residing **outside Canada**,
- And whose **principal reason** for living abroad is to serve as a **full-time employee** of a body corporate (a corporation or business entity).

**Eligibility Conditions:**
The body corporate must meet **one of the following criteria**:
- More than **50% of its voting shares** are **beneficially owned** by resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a) or (c)** of the definition of "resident Canadian" in Section 2 of the Act; **or**
- The body corporate is **under the control or direction** of such resident Canadians; **or**
- A **majority of its directors** are resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a) or (c)** of the definition; **or**
- The body corporate is a **subsidiary** of a body corporate that meets any of the above conditions (i.e., the parent company qualifies under one of the listed criteria).

> **Key Point**: The residency status of the individual is not based solely on physical presence or duration of stay, but on the **nature of their employment** and the **residency status of the corporate entity they work for**. The individual is considered a resident Canadian **only if their primary purpose for being abroad is employment** in such a qualifying corporation.

#### **2. Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada Who Are Full-Time Employees of an International Association or Organization of Which Canada Is a Member**

This category applies to Canadian citizens who:
- Are **not ordinarily resident** in Canada,
- Are residing **outside Canada**,
- And are **full-time employees** of an **international association or organization** to which **Canada is a member**.

**Examples of qualifying organizations** may include:
- The United Nations
- The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- The World Bank
- The International Labour Organization (ILO)
- NATO
- The Organization of American States (OAS)

> **Key Point**: The individual must be a full-time employee of such an organization. The fact that Canada is a member of the organization is a necessary condition. This provision recognizes the role of Canadian nationals working abroad in international institutions and ensures their continued inclusion in the Canadian financial regulatory framework.

---

#### **3. Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada Who Were, on Their Sixtieth Birthday, Ordinarily Resident in Canada and Have Been Residing Outside Canada for Less Than 10 Consecutive Years**

This category applies to Canadian citizens who:
- Were **ordinarily resident in Canada on their 60th birthday**, and
- Have since **resided outside Canada** for **less than 10 consecutive years**.

> **Key Point**: This provision is based on a **"returning resident"** principle. It recognizes individuals who had a strong Canadian connection (by having been resident in Canada at age 60) and who have only recently moved abroad, not for long-term or permanent reasons. The 10-year limit ensures that individuals who have been abroad for extended periods are not considered resident Canadians, preserving the integrity of the residency definition.

---

### **Purpose and Regulatory Significance**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- **Clarify the definition of "resident Canadian"** in the context of trust and loan companies, which are subject to specific regulatory oversight under the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
- Ensure that **Canadian-owned or Canadian-controlled entities**, even if physically located overseas, remain under Canadian regulatory jurisdiction.
- Provide **practical, objective criteria** for determining residency status, particularly for Canadian citizens working abroad in international roles or in Canadian-controlled corporations.

This helps prevent regulatory gaps and ensures that financial institutions—especially those involving trust or loan activities—remain accountable to Canadian financial laws and oversight, regardless of where their key personnel or operations are located.

---

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Trust and loan companies must consider the residency status of their members and directors when applying for licenses or meeting reporting obligations.
- **Corporate Governance**: The requirement that a majority of directors or a majority of ownership be held by resident Canadians reinforces Canadian control over entities that may be considered "Canadian" in character.
- **International Mobility**: The rules provide a structured pathway for Canadian citizens working abroad (especially in international organizations or foreign corporations with Canadian ownership) to maintain their residency status under Canadian law.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Resident Canadian (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* establish a clear, structured, and practical framework for identifying Canadian citizens who are considered "resident Canadians" despite living abroad. By focusing on employment in Canadian-controlled corporations or international organizations, and on individuals with a historical connection to Canada (e.g., having been resident at age 60), the regulations ensure that the regulatory framework remains both **pragmatic and protective of Canadian financial interests**.

These provisions remain relevant as Canada continues to engage with international financial institutions and supports the mobility of its citizens in global employment markets.
