**Detailed Summary of the Food and Agricultural Organization Remission Order**

**Title:**  
Food and Agricultural Organization Remission Order

**Effective Date:**  
January 2, 1952

**Purpose and Authority:**  
This regulation grants official authority to the Government of Canada to provide **free entry, refund, or remission** (i.e., exemption or reduction) of certain customs duties, consumption or sales taxes, and excise taxes—where applicable—on specific goods imported into Canada. The authority is granted under the **Customs Tariff and the Excise Tax Act**.

**Applicable Goods and Categories:**  
The regulation specifically covers the following categories of goods:

1. **Printed Matter** – Includes all forms of printed materials such as brochures, reports, journals, newsletters, and other printed documents.

2. **Official Publications** – Government-issued or officially recognized publications, such as agricultural reports, statistical data, or policy documents.

3. **Films and Sound Recordings** – All types of films (motion pictures, educational, documentary, etc.) and sound recordings (e.g., audio tapes, CDs, radio broadcasts, or recordings used for educational or informational purposes).

4. **Articles and Materials Used in Production** – Any materials, equipment, or components used in the manufacturing, production, or duplication of the above-mentioned goods (e.g., film stock, printing plates, recording equipment, or related supplies).

**Applicable Parties:**  
The exemption applies **exclusively** to the **Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)**, which is a specialized agency of the United Nations. This means the benefits are available only when the goods are imported or purchased in Canada for the following purposes:

- Use by the FAO  
- Sale by the FAO  
- Free distribution by the FAO  

**Conditions and Procedures:**  
The exemption is not automatic. It is subject to strict compliance with the **conditions and procedures** outlined in the accompanying **Schedule** to the Order. These conditions likely include:

- Proper documentation and certification of the FAO’s official status and purpose.  
- Proof that the goods are being used, sold, or distributed in furtherance of FAO’s mandate (e.g., promoting food security, agricultural development, or international cooperation).  
- Compliance with Canadian customs and tax regulations.  
- Submission of required forms or declarations to customs authorities.  
- Verification that the goods are not being diverted for commercial or private use.  

**Tax Exemptions Covered:**  
The remission applies to the following taxes:

- **Customs duties** (import duties)  
- **Consumption or sales taxes** (such as the Goods and Services Tax or similar taxes at the time)  
- **Excise taxes** (where applicable, particularly on films or sound recordings)

**Scope and Limitations:**  
- The exemption is **limited to imports or purchases made in Canada**.  
- It applies only to goods used, sold, or distributed by the FAO.  
- The goods must be directly related to the FAO’s mission in agriculture, food security, or related fields.  
- The exemption does not extend to private individuals, commercial entities, or other UN agencies unless explicitly authorized.  

**Significance:**  
This Order reflects Canada’s international obligations and support for multilateral organizations. By exempting FAO imports from taxation, Canada facilitates the organization’s ability to operate efficiently and disseminate critical information and materials globally—especially in areas such as agricultural development, food safety, and rural economic growth.

**Legal Basis:**  
The Order derives its authority from the **Customs Tariff and the Excise Tax Act**, which allows for special remission or exemptions for designated foreign organizations or purposes under specific conditions.

**Conclusion:**  
The Food and Agricultural Organization Remission Order of January 2, 1952, establishes a formal and legally binding mechanism to exempt FAO from import duties, consumption taxes, and excise taxes on printed materials, official publications, films, sound recordings, and production-related materials when imported into or purchased in Canada. This support enables the FAO to fulfill its global mission without financial barriers, provided all procedural and compliance requirements are met as detailed in the Schedule.
