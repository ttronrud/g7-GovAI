## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Assessment of Pension Plans Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Authority and Purpose**
The regulation is enacted under two primary statutes:

1. **Section 38a of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act (OSFI Act)**  
2. **Section 39c of the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (PBSA)**

These provisions empower the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to establish rules for assessing pension plans based on their size, structure, and administrative burden.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that pension plan administrators contribute fairly to the administrative costs of regulating pension plans in Canada, particularly those governed by the *Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985* and the *Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act (PRPPA)*. The assessment serves as a funding mechanism for the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) to cover operational expenses related to plan registration, supervision, and inspection.

### 🔹 **Key Definitions in the Regulations**

| Term | Definition |

| **Act** | Refers to the *Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act* |
| **Beneficiary** | - For **PRPPA-registered plans**: A member or survivor with an account in the plan. <br> - For **PBSA-registered or filed plans**: A person entitled to a pension benefit, **excluding** those who have fully transferred their benefit credits (e.g., via life annuity purchase) or who have had their benefits purchased by the plan administrator after plan termination. |
| **Number of Beneficiaries** | - For **PBSA-filings**: Count on the filing date. <br> - For **PRPPA-registered or PBSA-registered plans**: Count at the end of the previous pension plan year. |
| **Pension Plan Year** | - For PBSA plans: As defined in subsection 2(1) of the PBSA. <br> - For PRPPA plans: A calendar year. |
| **Termination** | - For PBSA plans: Same meaning as in subsection 2(1) of PBSA. <br> - For PRPPA plans: Termination under subsections 62(1), (2), or (6) of the PRPPA. |
| **Winding-Up** | - For PBSA plans: Same as in subsection 2(1) of PBSA. <br> - For PRPPA plans: Same as in subsection 2(1) of PRPPA. |
| *(Note)* | Several terms such as "member," "cessation of membership," "retire," "survivor," and "plan" have been **repealed** (removed) by amendments in SOR/2019-53 and SOR/2016-275. The current definitions reflect updated terminology. |

### 🔹 **Assessment Formula**

The **assessment amount** is calculated using the following formula:

> **Assessment = (Pension Plan Assessment Base) × (Basic Rate)**

#### ✅ 1. **Pension Plan Assessment Base**

This base is determined by two separate components, each capped:

- **First component (for beneficiaries over 50):**  
  `Lesser of`  
  → (Number of beneficiaries in excess of 50)  
  → AND 950  

- **Second component (for beneficiaries over 1,000):**  
  `Lesser of`  
  → 75% of (Number of beneficiaries in excess of 1,000)  
  → AND 19,000  

> 📌 **Total Assessment Base** = Sum of the two components  
> ⚠️ The base is **not** the total number of beneficiaries. It is a **scaled, capped figure** that limits the financial exposure of large plans.

#### ✅ 2. **Basic Rate**

The basic rate is calculated as:

> **Basic Rate = (Estimated Annual OSFI Expenses) × 20%**

Where:

- **Estimated Annual OSFI Expenses** =  
  \[
  \frac{(\text{Total past 5 years of actual expenses}) + (\text{Total assessments received (if B=0)}))}{\text{Estimated total assessment bases of all plans}}
  \]

> 🔍 **Breakdown**:
> - Numerator:  
>   - Sum of actual expenses incurred by OSFI for administering PBSA and PRPPA over the **last 5 fiscal years** (2nd to 6th preceding years).  
>   - Plus: Total assessments received (and fees collected) during those years, **but only if the assessment base (B) was zero** (i.e., no assessment was due).  
> - Denominator: Estimated total of all pension plan assessment bases across all plans.

> 📌 This formula ensures that the rate is **proportional** to the administrative cost of managing pension plans and adjusts based on historical spending and plan size.

### 🔹 **Exemptions from Assessment**

Despite the general rule, the assessment is **zero** under the following conditions:

#### ✅ For **PRPPA-registered plans**:
- The plan is **terminated and wound up no later than four months** after the end of the pension plan year.

#### ✅ For **PBSA-registered or filed plans**:
- The plan is **terminated and wound up no later than six months** after the end of the pension plan year, **OR**
- The plan has been terminated for **five or more pension plan years**, **OR**
- The plan is terminated with a **solvency deficit** (as defined in subsection 24.1(1) of the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985*) **AND**:
  - The plan is a **negotiated contribution plan** (as defined in subsection 2(1) of PBSA), **OR**
  - The employer required to contribute to the plan is:
    - A **bankrupt** (under the *Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act*),  
    - An **insolvent person** under a partial or complete stay of proceedings (under s. 69 or 69.1 of BIA), **OR**
    - A **debtor company** with an active stay of proceedings under s. 11.02(1) or (2) of the *Companies’ Creditors Arrangements Act*.

> 💡 These exemptions aim to protect small or financially distressed plans from excessive administrative costs, especially when they are winding down due to insolvency or operational closure.

### 🔹 **Publication of Basic Rates**

- The **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** must publish in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*:
  - A notice of the **basic rate** effective for each fiscal year, **no later than 180 days before the start** of the fiscal year.
- **Exception**:  
  For fiscal years beginning on **April 1, 2016 and April 1, 2017**, the notice for **pooled registered pension plans** must be published **no later than January 31, 2017**.

> 📌 This ensures transparency and predictability for plan administrators, allowing them to budget and plan for assessments in advance.

---

### 🔹 **Notification to Administrators**

- The Superintendent is required to **send each pension plan administrator a written notice** of the assessment due to them.

> This ensures that plan administrators are informed, can respond, and can appeal if necessary.

---

### 🔹 **Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 175 of the Sustaining Canada’s Economic Recovery Act (S.C. 2010, c. 25)** comes into force.

## 📌 Key Takeaways & Practical Implications

| Feature | Practical Meaning |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Capped Assessment Base** | Prevents large plans from facing disproportionately high fees. Even very large plans are capped at 950 (for >50 beneficiaries) and 19,000 (for >1,000 beneficiaries). |
| **Proportional Basic Rate** | The rate is derived from actual historical costs and is adjusted annually to reflect real-world administrative needs. |
| **Exemptions for W
