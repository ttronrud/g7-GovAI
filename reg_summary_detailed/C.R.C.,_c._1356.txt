#### **3. Payment of Pension Benefits from the Superannuation Account**

##### **(a) Payments to Pensioners Who Left Before April 1, 1970**
- **Who is eligible?**  
  Pensioners who:
  - Ceased employment with the Company *prior to April 1, 1970*, **or**
  - Are receiving or become eligible for annuity benefits in respect of someone who met the above criteria.

- **When are payments made?**  
  Payments begin on the **first day of the second month** after the Company receives the employee’s **completed appointment form** (as set out in the Schedule).

- **What is paid?**  
  The total amount includes:
  1. Any pension payable under the former pension plan.
  2. Any *ex gratia supplementary pension payments* made by the Company in **August 1975**.

> ✅ These payments are made **out of the Superannuation Account**, which is a fund established under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

##### **(b) General Payment Timeline**
- For **all other pensioners** (not covered in subsection 3(a)), payments are made **on or after October 1, 1975**.

##### **(c) Terms and Conditions of Payments**
- All pension benefits paid under these regulations are subject to the **same terms and conditions** as they would have been under the *former pension plan*.

> This ensures continuity and fairness in benefit calculation and structure.

---

#### **4. Capitalization and Interest Payments to the Superannuation Account**

When the Company pays out pensions under sections 3(1) and (2), it must also make two types of contributions to the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, credited to the **Superannuation Account**:

1. **Capitalized Value of Pension Benefits**  
   - The amount equal to the **capitalized value** (as determined by the Minister) of any pension benefits payable from the Superannuation Account under section 3(1)(d) and subsection 3(2).

2. **Interest on the Amounts**  
   - The amount of interest that would have been credited to the Superannuation Account on the amount described in (1), during the period:
     - From the **date of the Minister’s notice** to the Company
     - Until the date of actual payment.

> This ensures that the financial value of the transferred pension obligations is properly accounted for in the new system.

---

#### **5. Counting Period of Service as Pensionable Service**

##### **Eligibility for Service Recognition**
An employee may count part of their **period of service to his credit** as *pensionable service* under the Act under two conditions:

1. **Written Request**  
   - Submitted **within six months after October 1, 1975** to the Minister, requesting that the period of service be counted.

2. **Completion of Document (Appendix A)**  
   - The employee completed the form in **Appendix A** to the *Reciprocal Pension Transfer Agreement* **before October 1, 1975**.

##### **How Service is Counted**
- From the date the Minister receives the request or the document is completed:
  - The Company will credit to the employee **a portion of their period of service**.
  - The amount credited is determined by the Minister and is calculated as:
    > The amount that would be required to purchase the service **in the most recent period of service** (in time), **when applied to the service period**.

> This ensures that only the most recent service is considered, and the value is based on what the employee would have had to pay to acquire that service under the new Act.

---

#### **6. Contribution to the Superannuation Account (by the Company)**

For each employee described in section 5, the Company must pay into the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** to the Superannuation Account **within one year of October 1, 1975** the **lesser of**:

##### **Option 1: Double the Act-Required Contribution**
- An amount equal to **twice** the amount the employee would have been required to pay under the Act for a corresponding period of service **if**:
  - The employee had been a contributor under the Act during that service period, and
  - The employee’s salary during that period was equal to the salary actually paid or deemed received under the former pension plan.

- Interest is added at a rate determined by the Minister, calculated from the **middle of each fiscal year** during the service period, ending on **September 30, 1975**.

##### **Option 2: Double the Amount to Purchase Service**
- An amount equal to **twice** the amount that the Company believes (in its opinion) would have been required to pay to purchase the period of service, **plus any interest** credited on that amount **up to October 1, 1975**.

> The Company chooses the **lower** of these two amounts.

##### **Interest on the Payment**
- The Company must also pay into the Superannuation Account an amount equal to the interest that would have been credited to the account on the amount described in subsection (2), during the period:
  - From **October 1, 1975**, to the date of payment.

> This ensures that the interest component of the pension obligations is fully recognized in the new system.

#### **7. Electing to Pay for Remaining Service (Optional)**

If after the above payments, an employee has **remaining service** that was not counted as pensionable service, they may choose to **pay for it**.

##### **Option A (Within Six Months of Notification)**
- If the employee elects **within six months** of being informed of the remainder:
  - Pays **one-half** of the amount calculated in section 5 (i.e., half of the amount that would have been required to purchase the service).

##### **Option B (After Six Months)**
- If the employee elects **after six months**:
  - The amount is calculated **as if paragraph 6(1)(j) of the Act applied** to them.

> This provides flexibility, allowing employees to either pay a reduced amount early or accept the full Act-based calculation later.

---

#### **8. Form and Agreement for Pension Transfers**

The regulation includes a **form** (appended to the regulations) that must be completed and signed by the pensioner. The form includes:

- A request to **redirect annuity payments** to the **Receiver General for Canada**, which will deposit them into the **Superannuation Account**.
- A statement that such payments constitute a **full discharge** of the Company’s obligations to the employee regarding annuity payments under the former policy.

> This form is critical for ensuring that pension payments are properly redirected and accounted for under the new system.
