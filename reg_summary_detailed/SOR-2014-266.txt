**Detailed Summary of the *Emergency Protection Orders Regulations* (S.C. 2013, c. 20)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Emergency Protection Orders Regulations* (S.C. 2013, c. 20) are a set of administrative rules made under the **Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act** (commonly referred to as the *Family Homes Act*). These regulations establish the procedures and standards for issuing **emergency protection orders (EPOs)** in cases of **family violence**, particularly within Indigenous communities on reserves in Canada.

These regulations provide a rapid, accessible, and safety-focused process for individuals experiencing immediate threats—such as physical, emotional, or financial harm—due to violence by a spouse or common-law partner. The goal is to protect vulnerable persons (such as children or elders) and ensure timely judicial intervention without requiring lengthy legal procedures.

- They are designed to **implement Section 16** of the Act, which empowers designated judges to issue emergency protection orders when there is a risk of harm from family violence.
- The regulations are intended to **facilitate swift action** in urgent situations where safety is at risk, especially in remote or reserve communities where access to formal courts may be limited.

### **3. Jurisdiction**

- These regulations apply in **any province** where:
  - A **designated judge** is authorized to act under the Act; and
  - **No provincial rules of practice or procedure** have been established for applications under Section 16 of the Act.
- **Exception**: In provinces where the designated judge is a **Justice of the Peace (JP)**, the regulations apply *except* to the extent that provincial laws or rules override them.

---

### **4. How Applications Are Made**

- An application may be made **in person** or **by telecommunication** (e.g., phone, email, fax).
- If made by telecommunication:
  - The applicant (or their representative) must be **available to speak directly** with the judge via a real-time communication method.
  - This ensures that the judge can verify the identity and intent of the applicant and assess the urgency of the situation.

---

### **5. Representation of the Applicant**

- A person may act on behalf of the applicant **only if** the designated judge is satisfied that:
  1. The representative is acting with the **applicant’s consent** (given under oath or affirmation).
  2. **In the absence of consent**, the judge must be satisfied that:
     - The person is a **peace officer** or an **appropriate individual** (based on occupation, community status, relationship, or knowledge of circumstances);
     - The person is acting in **good faith**;
     - Either:
       - The applicant is **unable to give consent** (e.g., due to mental incapacity, fear, or trauma), or
       - There are **reasonable grounds to believe** that the applicant or a vulnerable person is **immediately at risk of harm or property damage** due to family violence.

> This provision ensures that third-party representation is only permitted when it is both legally justified and in the best interest of the applicant's safety.

---

### **6. Confidentiality Orders**

- The applicant or representative may request that certain information be kept **confidential** during or after the hearing.
- Confidential information includes:
  - Names of the applicant, respondent, witnesses, or vulnerable persons;
  - Any details that could identify individuals.

- The designated judge may issue a **confidentiality order** if:
  1. Confidentiality is **necessary for the safety** of the applicant, witness, or vulnerable person; **or**
  2. The **risk of harm or emotional distress** from public disclosure outweighs the public’s right to know.

- **Mandatory confidentiality**: If the judge is satisfied that any information meets either condition above, a confidentiality order **must be issued**, even if not requested.

> This protects victims from retaliation, stigma, or further trauma, especially in culturally sensitive or isolated communities.

6. Duration of the conjugal relationship  
7. Description of actions by the respondent that make the applicant fear for their safety or property  
8. History of past family violence
