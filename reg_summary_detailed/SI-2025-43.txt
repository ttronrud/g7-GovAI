The provided regulation is a formal government order that modifies the administrative framework of the *Poverty Reduction Act* (S.C. 2019, c. 29) by repealing a prior order and designating a specific minister to serve in a key capacity under the Act. Below is a detailed summary of the regulation:

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**

- The regulation is issued under **section 4 of the Poverty Reduction Act**, specifically subsection **s. 315**, which grants the Governor General in Council (the executive authority of the Canadian government) the power to make orders related to the administration and implementation of the Act.
- The authority is exercised **on the recommendation of the Prime Minister**, indicating that the decision is part of the federal government’s policy and administrative process.

---

**2. Repeal of Prior Order**

- The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2020-123**, issued on **March 9, 2020**.
- This prior order likely established or modified provisions related to the administration, implementation, or oversight of the Poverty Reduction Act, such as the designation of responsible ministers, funding mechanisms, or operational procedures.
- By repealing this order, the government is effectively **removing the previous administrative framework** and replacing it with a new, updated structure—consistent with current policy priorities or changes in ministerial responsibilities.

---

**3. Designation of Minister**

- The regulation **designates the Minister of Employment and Social Development** as the **Minister for the purposes of the Poverty Reduction Act**.
- This designation means that the Minister of Employment and Social Development is now the **primary point of responsibility** for the administration, implementation, and oversight of the Act.
- The Minister is also recognized as a **member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal recognition of their status as a senior federal cabinet minister and a member of the government’s executive body.

---

**4. Purpose and Significance**

- This action streamlines governance by assigning clear leadership to the Poverty Reduction Act.
- It ensures that the Act’s objectives—such as reducing poverty through targeted programs, policy development, and interdepartmental coordination—are managed under the leadership of a minister with direct responsibility for employment and social development.
- The designation enhances accountability and coordination, as the Minister of Employment and Social Development has existing mandates related to poverty, social services, employment programs, and income support—making them well-positioned to lead poverty reduction efforts.

---

**5. Legal and Administrative Impact**

- The repeal of P.C. 2020-123 removes any conflicting or outdated provisions that may have existed under the prior order.
- The new designation creates a clear, current, and legally binding assignment of ministerial responsibility under the Act.
- This change may reflect a shift in government priorities, a reorganization of departments, or a desire to strengthen coordination between poverty reduction and employment/social development policies.

**Conclusion**

This regulation is a procedural and administrative update to the Poverty Reduction Act. It removes an older order and formally assigns the leadership of the Act to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, ensuring that poverty reduction efforts are now under the direct oversight of a minister with relevant expertise and responsibilities. The change reinforces policy coherence and strengthens the government’s capacity to deliver targeted, effective poverty reduction initiatives.
