**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which provides the legal framework for the inclusion of certain lands—specifically those adjacent to water bodies—within land grants, particularly in relation to Indigenous or designated lands.

This provision allows for the inclusion of land within a certain distance of a shoreline, typically for purposes such as access, use, or protection, especially where land rights or interests are being defined or adjusted.

**2. Scope of the Order**  
The order specifies that a **portion of land** described in an **annexed schedule**—which is not fully reproduced here—shall be **included in a land grant**. This portion is defined as lying **within 30.48 meters (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark** along the **shoreline of Great Slave Lake**.

Great Slave Lake is a major natural lake located in the **Northwest Territories**, Canada. The ordinary high water mark is the standard reference point used in land surveys to define the boundary between land and water, typically marking the highest level reached by water under normal conditions (not during floods or exceptional weather).

**3. Specific Land Description**  
The affected land is a portion of **Lot 17, Block 19**, located in the **Northwest Territories**. This lot is referenced in official survey records:

- **Plan of survey of record number 83825**  
  - This plan is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** maintained in Ottawa.
  - A copy of this plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in **Yellowknife**, under **file number 3578**.

This means that the land is formally documented and legally recognized under the Northwest Territories land registration system, and the inclusion of the shoreline portion is being formally recorded in that system.

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
The inclusion of land within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark is likely intended to:

- **Protect access** to the lake for Indigenous communities or land users.
- **Recognize traditional use or occupancy** of shoreline areas.
- **Ensure legal clarity** regarding land boundaries and rights, especially in areas of potential dispute or for future development or management.
- **Support environmental or cultural stewardship**, particularly in northern regions where water-based activities and traditional practices are central.

Such a provision may also serve to **align with Indigenous land rights**, as the Territorial Lands Act has historically been used in the context of land grants to Indigenous peoples, and shoreline access can be vital for cultural, subsistence, or economic activities.

**5. Legal Effect**  
By this order, the specified portion of Lot 17, Block 19—within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of Great Slave Lake—is **formally included in the grant of land**. This means:

- The land is now legally part of the granted parcel.
- It is subject to the same rights, restrictions, and obligations as the rest of the lot.
- It may be subject to future land use planning, title transfers, or regulatory oversight depending on the jurisdiction.

The order is binding and will be recorded in the **Land Titles Office** in Yellowknife, ensuring that the change is officially recognized in the land registry.

**6. Key Terms**  
- **Ordinary high water mark**: The standard water level during normal conditions, used as a legal boundary.  
- **30.48 meters (100 feet)**: A standard distance used in land surveying and legal descriptions to define shoreline zones.  
- **Territorial Lands Act**: The primary legislation governing land grants and land ownership in the Northwest Territories.  
- **Governor General in Council**: The formal executive authority of the Canadian government, acting on ministerial advice.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a formal, legally binding directive that expands the boundaries of a specific land grant by including a shoreline strip adjacent to Great Slave Lake. It reflects a recognition of the importance of shoreline access, likely in service of Indigenous rights, environmental protection, or land use planning. The order is based on established legal provisions and is properly documented in official land records, ensuring transparency and enforceability.
