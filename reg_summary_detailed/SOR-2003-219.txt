---

## 🎯 **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of **Sections 3 to 7** is to:

- Define **who must provide information**,  
- Specify **what information must be shared**,  
- Establish **when and how** that information must be transmitted,  
- Ensure **accuracy and timeliness** of data to support customs compliance and security screening.

This is done to fulfill the requirements of **Section 107.1 of the Customs Act**, which mandates that certain parties provide passenger details to the CBSA before a commercial conveyance arrives in Canada.

---

## ✅ **Prescribed Circumstances and Conditions**

For the regulations to apply, the following conditions must be met:

1. The conveyance must be a **commercial conveyance** (air, water, or land).
2. The conveyance is **expected to arrive in Canada**.

> This ensures that only relevant, incoming commercial traffic is subject to passenger data reporting.

---

## 👥 **Prescribed Classes of Persons Required to Provide Information**

Only two classes of individuals are required to provide passenger data:

1. **Commercial Carriers** (e.g., airlines, shipping lines)  
2. **Charterers** who have contracted to carry persons or goods to Canada

> This means that **only those directly involved in the transportation of passengers or cargo** are obligated to comply.

---

## 📄 **Required Passenger Information**

The following information must be provided about each person on board or expected to be on board:

| Information Element | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Personal Identity** | Surname, first name, middle names, date of birth, citizenship/nationality, gender |
| **Travel Documents** | Type and number of passports or other valid travel documents; name of issuing country/entity |
| **Reservation Record Locator (RRL)** | Unique identifier assigned by the booking system (if applicable) |
| **Unique Passenger Reference** | A unique ID assigned by the carrier or its representative; **for crew members**, this includes notice of their status as crew |
| **Reservation System Data** | Any information held in the carrier’s or representative’s reservation system (e.g., booking details, itinerary, status) |
| **Carriage Details (by mode of transport)** | <br> - **Air**: Date/time of take-off from last embarkation point, last embarkation point, date/time of arrival in Canada, first disembarkation point, flight code (carrier + flight number) <br> - **Water/Land**: Same as above, but without flight code |

> This comprehensive data set enables the CBSA to verify identities, detect potential risks, and facilitate efficient processing at border points.

---

## 📡 **Method of Information Transmission**

- All information must be provided **electronically**.
- Must follow the **technical standards and procedures** set out in the **CBSA Carrier Messaging Requirements** document, as amended from time to time.

> This ensures interoperability, data integrity, and secure transmission between carriers and the CBSA.

---

## ⏰ **Timeliness of Information Submission**

| Information Type | Deadline |
|------------------|---------|
| **Crew Members** | No later than **1 hour before departure** |
| **All Other Passengers** | No later than **the time of departure** |
| **Passenger Data in Reservation System (paragraph 5(e))** | <br> - **For each passenger on board at departure**: Not later than **30 minutes after departure** |

> This strict timeline ensures that the CBSA has access to up-to-date passenger details during critical phases of arrival.

---

## 🛠️ **Correcting Incomplete or Inaccurate Information**

- If a party becomes aware **before or at the time of departure** that the information provided under Section 107.1 is **incomplete or inaccurate**, they must:
  - Provide the **corrected or missing information**  
  - Do so **without delay**  
  - In accordance with the **manner described in Section 6** (i.e., via electronic means following the approved messaging protocol)

> This ensures that the CBSA receives accurate, real-time data even if errors are discovered post-booking.

---

## ⚠️ **Exception to Timeliness Rule**

- **Section 107.1(1)** does **not apply** to the information specified in **paragraph 5(e)** (reservation system data).
- This means that the requirement to provide data about the passenger’s full reservation record is **not subject to the same strict deadlines** as other personal details.

> This exception allows for more flexibility in sharing detailed booking data, which may be updated dynamically.

---

## 🔁 **Amendments to Paragraph 5(e)**

The original paragraph 5(e) has been **replaced** with a more detailed version:

> "Any information about them that is referred to in the **Schedule** and is available in a reservation system of the person who is required to provide information or in a reservation system of the representative of such a person."

This means that **additional data beyond basic personal details** (such as itinerary, loyalty program benefits, contact info, etc.) must be shared when available in the reservation system.

---

## 📅 **Amendment to Section 7(2)**

Section 7(2) has been updated to require that:

> The information in paragraph 5(e) must be provided for **each person expected to board** **not later than 72 hours before departure**.

> This ensures that the CBSA receives **early access** to full passenger profiles, especially for long-haul or international flights.

> This is a significant enhancement over prior rules, allowing for proactive risk assessment and planning.

---

## 🔁 **Amendment to Section 8 – Updates to Reservation Data**

A new subsection is added to Section 8:

> If any information in paragraph 5(e) is **added or changed** in a reservation system **after** it was submitted to the CBSA, the person who provided the information must **immediately update** the CBSA with the revised data at specific times:

| Time of Change | Deadline for Update |
|---------------|----------------------|
| More than 24 hours before departure | Not later than **24 hours before departure** |
| Between 24 hours and 8 hours before departure | Not later than **8 hours before departure** |
| Less than 8 hours before departure | Not later than **time of departure** |

> This ensures that **dynamic changes** (e.g., last-minute seat changes, name corrections, added passengers) are reflected in the CBSA’s records in real time.

---
