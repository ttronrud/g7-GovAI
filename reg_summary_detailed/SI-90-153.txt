**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation establishes the authority for the Canadian government to set and prescribe fees for the processing of applications submitted to the **Canadian Heraldic Authority (CHA)** for the grant of coats of arms.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The primary objective is to ensure that the **cost of services** provided by the Canadian Heraldic Authority—specifically, the administrative and procedural expenses involved in processing applications for coats of arms—is **borne by the applicant** rather than being covered by public funds.

2. **Legal Basis**:
   - The regulation is grounded in **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision grants the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) the power to authorize the setting of fees for government services, provided such fees are reasonable and necessary.
   - The Governor in Council has determined that the cost of processing applications should be passed on to the individual or entity requesting the grant of a coat of arms.

3. **Authority to Prescribe Fees**:
   - The **Prime Minister**, on the recommendation of the **Treasury Board** (the body responsible for managing federal government financial and administrative policies), is authorized to issue a **regulatory order** to set the specific fee amount.
   - This means the Prime Minister has the power to formally establish the fee structure through a formal order, which will be subject to the required administrative and financial review processes.

4. **Scope of Application**:
   - The fee applies to **applications submitted to the Canadian Heraldic Authority** for the **grant of coats of arms**.
   - This includes, but is not limited to, applications for:
     - Arms for individuals (e.g., citizens, veterans, or those with a specific historical or familial significance),
     - Arms for organizations (e.g., corporations, municipalities, or institutions),
     - Arms for public bodies or government entities.

5. **Implications**:
   - The regulation shifts the financial responsibility from the government to the applicant, promoting accountability and sustainability in the operation of the CHA.
   - It ensures that the service of granting coats of arms—while ceremonial and symbolic—is not funded at public expense, which could otherwise lead to inconsistent or unmanageable costs over time.
   - It aligns with broader government principles of **cost recovery** and **financial accountability** in administrative services.

6. **Governance and Oversight**:
   - The decision to set the fee is made in consultation with the **Treasury Board**, which ensures that the fee is fair, transparent, and consistent with broader fiscal policies.
   - The **Prime Minister** acts as the administrative conduit, issuing the fee order on behalf of the Governor in Council, which reflects a delegation of authority within the executive branch.

### Conclusion:

This regulation formally authorizes the Canadian government to impose a fee on individuals and organizations applying for coats of arms through the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It is a clear example of how public administration manages service costs through fee-based models, ensuring that the financial burden of processing such requests is borne by the recipients rather than the taxpayer. The regulation is both legally sound and operationally practical, supporting the continued operation of the CHA while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
