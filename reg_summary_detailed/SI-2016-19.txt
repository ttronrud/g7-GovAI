The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2018-89"** — indicates that the specific legislative instrument (SI) numbered **2018/89** has been formally repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The instrument is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable. It was officially withdrawn or replaced by a newer legal provision.

- **SI Number**: SI/2018-89 refers to a **Statutory Instrument** issued in 2018, numbered 89. Statutory Instruments are secondary legislation used in the United Kingdom (and other Commonwealth jurisdictions) to implement or amend primary legislation.

- **Nature of the Instrument**: While the specific content of SI 2018/89 is not provided in your query, the fact that it is marked as "repealed" implies that it was a piece of secondary legislation (such as a rule, order, or directive) that had previously governed a particular area of law — for example, environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing procedures, or administrative processes.

- **Reason for Repeal**: Common reasons for repealing a statutory instrument include:
  - The instrument was outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It was superseded by a more comprehensive or updated piece of legislation.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with primary law or new policy objectives.
  - A more effective or equitable regulatory framework was introduced.

- **Legal Effect**: Once repealed, the provisions of SI/2018-89 are **no longer enforceable**. Any actions or decisions based on it are no longer legally valid. Legal or regulatory authorities must now refer to the current, active legislation that replaced it (if applicable).

- **Source of Information**: The repeal is typically recorded in the **UK Statutory Instruments database** (e.g., legislation.gov.uk), where the instrument is listed under "Repealed" with a note indicating the date of repeal and the instrument that replaced it (if any).

### Example (Hypothetical Context):
If SI/2018/89 had been a regulation on the use of certain chemicals in food processing, its repeal might have been due to the introduction of a new food safety regulation (e.g., SI/2020/123) that provides a more modern and science-based framework.

### Conclusion:
**SI/2018-89 is a repealed statutory instrument**, meaning it is no longer in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework, likely to make way for updated or more effective regulations. To understand the full scope of what it originally regulated, one would need to consult the original text of the instrument (archived on legislation.gov.uk or similar sources), as well as the official notice of repeal.
