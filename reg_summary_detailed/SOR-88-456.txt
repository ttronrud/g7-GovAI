### **2. Name and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled:  
  **Hazardous Materials Information Review Regulations**  
  (May be cited as: *Hazardous Materials Information Review Regulations*)

### **4. Criteria for Validity of Exemption Claims (Section 11 of the Act)**

For a claim for exemption from disclosing information under **section 11** of the Act to be valid, the Minister must consider **three core criteria**:

#### ✅ **Primary Criteria (Must be met for validity)**:
1. **Not Publicly Available**  
   The information must not be accessible to the general public or otherwise available through open channels.

2. **Reasonable Measures to Maintain Confidentiality**  
   The claimant must have taken reasonable steps to ensure the information remains confidential (e.g., internal access controls, non-disclosure agreements).

3. **Actual or Potential Economic Value**  
   The information must have **actual or potential economic value** to the claimant or their competitors due to its non-public nature. Disclosure would result in:
   - A **material financial loss** to the claimant, OR
   - A **material financial gain** to the claimant’s competitors.

#### ✅ **Additional Criterion (For Validity Only – Not for Rejection)**:
- The **cost and business resources** expended by the claimant to develop the information must be **substantial** in the circumstances.

> 🔍 **Important Note**: This additional criterion is **not used to deny** a claim — it only strengthens the case *for* exemption when present.

---

### **5. Confidentiality Exception – What Does “Not Publicly Available” Mean?**

Even if the information is known to certain individuals, it **does not cease to be non-publicly available** if:
- The individuals obtained it **in confidence** (expressly or impliedly),
- Are **contractually or legally bound** (by trust, law, or equity) to maintain confidentiality, or
- Possess it **without lawful authority** (i.e., without right to possess it).

> 🚫 This means that mere internal knowledge or employee access does not automatically make information public.

---

### **6. Fees for Claims**

Fees are required under **subsection 11(3)** of the Act and vary based on claim type and number.

#### 🔹 Original Claim Fees:
- **One original claim**: $1,800  
- **More than one original claim filed at the same time**:
  - First 15: $1,800 each
  - Next 10: $400 each
  - Beyond 25: $200 each additional claim

#### 🔹 Refiled Claim Fees:
- **One refiled claim**: $1,440  
- **More than one refiled claim**:
  - First 15: $1,440 each
  - Next 10: $320 each
  - Beyond 25: $160 each additional claim

> 💡 **Note**: Refiled claims are less expensive than original claims, reflecting reduced burden.

#### 🔹 Reduced Fee for Small Businesses:
- If the claimant:
  - Had **gross annual revenue ≤ $3 million** in the prior fiscal year, AND
  - Employed **≤ 100 employees**
- Then the fee for a claim is **half** the amount required under **section 4 or 5** (which typically refers to standard filing fees).

> 📌 This provision supports small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by reducing compliance costs.
