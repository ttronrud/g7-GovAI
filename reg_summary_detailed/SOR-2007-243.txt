**Detailed Summary of the First Nations Taxation Enforcement Regulations (S.C. 2005, c. 9)**

---

### **Overview**

The *First Nations Taxation Enforcement Regulations* (S.C. 2005, c. 9) are a set of administrative rules made under the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act* (the "Act"). These regulations establish a clear, structured framework for enforcing property tax obligations among First Nations in Canada. They define key terms, outline procedures for tax enforcement, and set limits on enforcement measures to ensure fairness, transparency, and respect for First Nations' rights and self-governance.

The regulations govern how First Nations can collect unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties on taxable property, and what enforcement actions may be taken if those payments are not made. Importantly, they include safeguards to protect individuals and ensure due process, while also providing mechanisms for debtors to redeem or challenge enforcement actions.

---

## **General Enforcement Principles**

Enforcement measures (such as liens, seizures, or assignments) must:
- Be carried out **in accordance with procedures** set out in sections 3 to 22 of the Act.
- Comply with **specific conditions** and **procedural requirements** established in these regulations.

> These measures are not arbitrary; they are governed by procedural fairness and must follow defined steps.

---

## **Delivery of Notices**

Notices issued under these regulations must be delivered to specific parties:

1. **For taxable property**: To all persons named on the **tax roll** for that property.
2. **For personal property**: To all **holders of security interests** registered under provincial property laws where the personal property is located.

This ensures that relevant parties are informed and given an opportunity to respond.

---

## **Interest and Penalties on Unpaid Taxes**

The regulations impose **strict caps** on interest and penalties:

- **Interest rate**: Cannot exceed **15% per year**.
- **Total penalty amount**: Cannot exceed **10% of the unpaid tax amount**.

These caps prevent excessive financial penalties and protect debtors from punitive enforcement.

---

## **Tax Arrears Certificate (Pre-Enforcement Requirement)**

Before any enforcement action can be initiated, the tax administrator must:

- Issue a **tax arrears certificate** to every person on the tax roll.
- Deliver it to the address listed on the tax roll.

### **Conditions for Issuance**
- The certificate **cannot be issued** for **at least six months** after the taxes became due.
- The certificate must include:
  - Amount of unpaid taxes
  - Amount of any penalty (current and future)
  - Interest owed (current and future rate)
  - Deadline by which all amounts can be paid **without incurring further interest or penalties**

> This provides debtors with a clear, formal notice of their obligations and a window to settle debts before enforcement begins.

---

## **Liens and Discharge**

- A tax administrator must **maintain a list of all liens** created under the property taxation law.
- The property taxation law must specify **how a lien may be discharged**.
- Upon full payment of taxes, interest, and penalties, the tax administrator must **register a discharge of the lien without delay**.

> This ensures that liens are not permanent and are removed once debt is satisfied.

---

## **Seizure and Assignment of Taxable Property**

If taxes, interest, or penalties remain unpaid **more than nine months after a tax arrears certificate is issued**, the tax administrator may deliver a notice to the debtor describing the possible enforcement action — including **seizure and assignment** of the taxable property.

### **Public Tender or Auction of the Right to Assignment**

- The right to assign the property may be sold **no earlier than six months after** the notice is delivered.
- The sale must be conducted via **public tender or auction**.
- A **notice of sale** must be:
  - Published in the **local newspaper with the largest circulation** at least once in each of the four weeks before the sale.
  - Posted in a **prominent place on the reserve** at least **10 days before** the sale.

### **Upset Price (Minimum Bid)**

- The upset price (minimum bid) must be:
  - The total of unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties **calculated to the end of the redemption period**, **plus 5%** of that total.

> This ensures that the sale is not below a fair market value and provides a floor for the bid.

### **If No Bid Meets the Upset Price**

- The **First Nation is deemed to have purchased** the right to assignment for the upset price.

---

## **Redemption of Taxable Property**

Within **three months after the public tender or auction**, the debtor may **redeem** the property by paying:

- The **upset price plus 3%**.

Upon redemption:

- If the right was sold to a bidder: The First Nation must **repay the bidder the amount of the bid** immediately.
- The tax administrator must **notify the Minister in writing** of the redemption.

> This gives debtors a final chance to pay and retain ownership.

---

## **Assignment of Taxable Property**

- No assignment may occur until the **end of the redemption period** (as defined in subsection 14(1)).
- At the end of the redemption period:
  - The property is assigned to the **highest bidder** (if any), or
  - To the **First Nation** as the deemed purchaser (if no bid met the upset price).

> This ensures a fair, transparent, and competitive process.

### **Restrictions on Assignment**

Taxable property **cannot be assigned** to any person or entity that would **not have been entitled** under:
- The *Indian Act*, or
- The *First Nations Land Management Act*

> This protects the legal rights of First Nations and ensures that only legally entitled parties can acquire property interests.

---

## **Registration of Assignments**

All assignments must be **registered in every registry** where the property is registered at the time of assignment.

> This ensures legal recognition and prevents future disputes.

---

## **Distribution of Sale Proceeds**

At the end of the redemption period, proceeds from the sale of the right to assignment are distributed in the following order:

1. To **holders of registered interests** in the property (in priority under law)
2. To the **First Nation**
3. Any **remaining proceeds** go to the **debtor**

> This prioritizes legitimate property interests before returning any surplus to the debtor.

---

## **Seizure and Sale of Personal Property**

If taxes, interest, or penalties remain unpaid **more than 30 days after a tax arrears certificate is delivered**, the tax administrator may issue a **notice of seizure and sale** for personal property located on the reserve.

### **Exemptions**

Personal property that would be **exempt under a superior court writ of execution** (e.g., basic necessities) is **exempt from seizure** under the taxation law.

### **Notice of Seizure and Sale**

Must state:
- If the debtor does **not pay within 7 days**, the property will be seized.
- If the debtor fails to pay **taxes, interest, and seizure costs**, the property may be sold after meeting publication requirements.

### **Seizure by Authority**

After 7 days, the tax administrator may request a **sheriff, bailiff, or by-law enforcement officer** to seize personal property in the debtor’s possession on the reserve.

> The seizer must provide the debtor with a **receipt** for the seized items.

---

## **Public Auction of Personal Property**

- The sale must be by **public auction**.
- A notice must be published in **two consecutive issues** of the local newspaper with the largest circulation.
- The **first publication must occur at least 60 days after seizure**.

> This ensures adequate notice and transparency.

### **Postponement of Sale**

If a **challenge to the seizure** is filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, the sale is **postponed until after the court rules**.

> This protects the debtor’s right to legal recourse.

---

## **Interaction with Provincial Laws**

- If personal property is subject to a **registered security interest**, the seizure and sale process is subject to **provincial laws** governing such interests.
- Proceeds from the sale are distributed in order of **priority under provincial law**:
  1. Registered security interest holders
  2. First Nation
  3. Debtor (any remaining proceeds)

> This respects provincial regulatory frameworks while allowing First Nations to enforce tax obligations.

---

## **Discontinuation of Services**

A First Nation may **discontinue services** provided to a debtor if:

1. Revenues from property taxation are used to fund those services;
2. The property taxation law allows for discontinuance of such services due to unpaid taxes; and
3. Taxes, interest, and penalties remain unpaid for **more than 30 days** after a tax arrears certificate is issued.

### **Prohibited Discontinuations**

The following services **cannot be discontinued**:
- Fire protection
