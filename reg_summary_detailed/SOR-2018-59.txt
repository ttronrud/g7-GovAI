Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the **Compensation Regulations** under the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*, as enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance (S.C. 2016, c. 7, s. 142; R.S., c. C-3).

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Compensation Regulations (S.C. 2016, c. 7, s. 142)**

### 🔹 **Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish a **clear, fair, and transparent framework** for determining and paying **compensation to holders of shares or liabilities** of a **federal member institution** (e.g., a federally regulated bank or credit union) in the event of its **winding up or restructuring**.

The regulations are made under **subsection 39.28(1)a** of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDICA)*, which empowers the Government to set compensation rules when a federal member institution faces financial distress.

> **Key Objective**: To ensure that individuals and entities with legitimate interests in a failing financial institution are fairly compensated, while protecting the integrity of the deposit insurance system and maintaining public confidence.

## 🔍 Key Definitions and Concepts

### 1. **Act**
- Refers to the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDICA)*.
- The entire regulatory framework operates within the legal authority of this Act.

---

### 2. **Liquidation Entitlement**
- The amount a shareholder is entitled to receive **in a winding-up** of the institution, **prior to** any payments owed to shareholders with subordinate claims.
- It represents the **priority of payment** in the event of insolvency.

> Example: If a bank fails and is wound up, common shareholders receive their liquidation entitlement before subordinated debt holders.

---

### 3. **Share**
- Defined narrowly to **exclude**:
  - Conversion or exchange privileges that can be converted **at any time** into shares.
  - Options or rights to acquire shares.
- This ensures that only **direct ownership** of shares is considered for compensation.

> Rationale: These instruments are not considered "actual ownership" and may be exercised later, so they are excluded from the compensation pool.

---

### 4. **Subordinated Debt**
- Excludes:
  - Conversion privileges convertible into subordinated debt.
  - Options to acquire subordinated debt.
- Again, to avoid treating contingent or future claims as equivalent to actual debt.

> Purpose: To prevent overcompensation or misclassification of instruments that may not be settled immediately.

---

### 5. **Same Class of Shares or Liabilities**
Two types of financial instruments are of the **same class** if:
- They rank **equally in right of payment** during a winding-up; **and**
- After an order under subsection 39.13(1) of the Act is made, they receive **substantially equivalent treatment** (including in terms of resolution value estimation).

> This ensures consistency in compensation across similar instruments.

---

## 📌 Who Is a "Prescribed Person"?

A prescribed person is someone who **owns or holds** certain shares or liabilities **immediately before** an order under subsection 39.13(1) of the CDICA is made.

### Eligible Entities:
- **Shares** of the federal member institution.
- **Liabilities** that:
  - Are converted into common shares under **subsection 39.2(2.3)** of the Act.
  - Are vested in the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)** under the order.
  - Are not assigned to or assumed by a **bridge institution** or third party (in a winding-up scenario).
  - Are assigned to or assumed by a **corporation described in subsection 10(2)** of the Act (e.g., a new entity created to absorb the institution), **and then liquidated** during a period when **a majority of its shares are held by CDIC**.
  - Are assigned to or assumed by a **bridge institution**, **unless** subsequently assigned to a third party.

> Note: This definition is designed to protect **real, direct stakeholders** who suffer losses due to the failure of the institution.

---

### Exclusions from Being a Prescribed Person

- **No compensation** if:
  - The amounts owed under the liability are **paid in full** after the order is made.
  - The person owns shares or liabilities **solely as an intermediary** (i.e., not as a direct owner).

> Important: Intermediaries (e.g., pension funds, mutual funds) are **excluded** unless acting in a non-fund capacity.

---

### What Is an "Intermediary"?

- A natural person, corporation, trust, partnership, or entity that:
  - Owns or holds shares/liabilities **on behalf of another person** in the ordinary course of business.
  - **Excludes** entities that manage or administer **pension, mutual, investment, or similar funds**.

> Rationale: Funds manage large portfolios and are not individual stakeholders. They are treated differently to avoid systemic distortion.

---

### What Is a "Liability"?

- A **debt of at least $100** owed immediately before the order is made.
- **Excludes**:
  - Debts whose value is **too uncertain** to be proven in a winding-up proceeding.
  - Claims for **monetary loss** arising from:
    - Ownership, purchase, or sale of equity.
    - Rescission or annulment (in Quebec) of equity transactions.
    - Contribution or indemnity claims.

> This ensures only **clear, quantifiable debts** are eligible for compensation.

---

## 💰 Compensation Formula

The amount of compensation is determined using a **formula based on liquidation and resolution values**:

> **Compensation = (Liquidation Value – Resolution Value)**  
> **If the share/liability is converted**, compensation = **estimated losses from conversion**  
> **Otherwise**, compensation = **zero**

### Definitions:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Liquidation Value** | The estimated amount a prescribed person would receive **if** a winding-up order had been made immediately before the actual order. <br> - Estimated **without** any financial assistance from CDIC, the Bank of Canada, or the Government. |
| **Resolution Value** | The total value of: <br> - The original share/liability (if not converted); <br> - Common shares resulting from conversion under 39.2(2.3); <br> - Dividends/interest paid after the order; <br> - Any other cash, securities, or rights received directly or indirectly due to the order or actions taken under it. <br> Includes payments from: CDIC, the institution, liquidator (of the original or new entity), or bridge institution. |

> **Key Principle**: Compensation is **only payable if the resolution value is less than the liquidation value** — otherwise, the holder benefits from the restructuring.

> ⚠️ **No compensation if the result is zero or negative** — meaning no loss occurred.

## ⏱️ Timing and Notice Requirements

### When Does the "Day" Start?
The day for compensation purposes is defined differently depending on the type of instrument:

| Type | Day |
|------|-----|
| Shares or liabilities (a–c) | Earlier of: <br> - Date when notice under 39.2(3) takes effect <br> - Date of winding-up order |
| Liabilities (d) | Date of winding-up order |
| Liabilities (e) | Date of liquidation order for the corporation under 10(2) |
| Liabilities (f) | Date of winding-up order for the bridge institution |

> This ensures consistency in calculating the **timing of loss**.

---

### Notice to Prescribed Persons

Within a **reasonable period** after the above day, the **Corporation must provide**:

- A **notice offering compensation** equal to or estimated as equal to the entitlement.
- OR a notice stating **no offer is being made** (because the person is not entitled).

> The notice must:
- State that an order under 39.13(1) has been made.
- Describe the effects of the order.
- Give the prescribed person **45 days** from the **publication of a summary** in the *Canada Gazette* and on the institution’s website to:
  - Accept or object to the offer.
  - Object to the absence of an offer.

> If **at least 10%** of the same class of shares/liabilities (by ownership or value) objects:
  - An **assessor** must be appointed under section 39.26 of the Act to determine compensation.

> If no objection is made within 45 days:
  - The person **automatically receives** the offered compensation or **no compensation**, and **cannot later challenge** the amount or decision.

---

## 📝 Role of the Assessor

### When is an Assessor Appointed?
- When **10% or more** of the relevant class of shares/liabilities (by ownership or value) **object** to the offer or absence of an offer.

### What Does the Assessor Do?
- Reviews the Corporation’s **reasoning and estimates**.
- Must consider:
  - Whether the Corporation used an **unreasonable estimate** or made a **pervasive, capricious, or erroneous factual finding**.
  - Whether the compensation calculation followed the **correct methodology** (as per section 3).

### Outcome of Assessment
- The assessor issues a **notice
