### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations, 1990**

---

#### **Background and Purpose**

These regulations, officially titled *The Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations, 1990* (C.R.C., c. 661), were introduced to **establish a new, updated quota system** for the marketing of turkey in **interprovincial and export trade** in Canada. They replaced the previous *Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations* and were enacted under the authority of the **Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (FPMAA)** and the **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency Proclamation (C.R.C., c. 647)**.

The primary purpose of the regulations is to:

- Ensure **market stability** and **fair access** to interprovincial and export markets;
- Prevent **overproduction** and **market oversupply**, which could lead to price collapse;
- Implement a **quota-based system** that reflects changes in market dynamics and production levels;
- Provide a structured, transparent, and enforceable framework for allocating marketing rights to turkey producers.

#### **Legal Basis and Authority**

The regulations derive their authority from several key provisions:

1. **Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (FPMAA)**:
   - Section 16(1): Authorizes the Governor in Council to establish a marketing agency (the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency).
   - Subsection 22(3): Grants provincial Commodity Boards the authority to administer and allot quotas on behalf of the Agency for interprovincial and export trade.
   - Paragraph 22(1)(f): Allows the Agency to submit proposed regulations to the National Farm Products Marketing Council (NFPMC) for review and approval.
   - Paragraph 7(1)(d): Enables the adoption of regulations of a class that are necessary for implementing the marketing plan.

2. **Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency Proclamation (C.R.C., c. 647)**:
   - Section 2 of Part II of the schedule: Provides the legal basis for revoking old regulations and introducing new ones when market conditions have changed significantly over a five-year period.
   - Paragraph 4(1)(c) to (h): Outlines factors considered in assessing market changes (e.g., production trends, demand shifts, economic conditions).
   - Subsection 4(2): Confirms that the market for turkeys has changed significantly relative to total Canadian production in the five years prior to the marketing plan’s effective date.

3. **Order in Council P.C. 1990-248 (February 15, 1990)**:
   - Approved the delegation of authority to provincial Commodity Boards to assign federal quotas for interprovincial and export trade.

4. **Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order (C.R.C., c. 648)**:
   - Confirms that the proposed regulations fall under a class eligible for approval by the NFPMC under paragraph 7(1)(d).

#### **Core Regulatory Framework**

##### **1. Replacement of Previous Quota System**
- The **old Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations (C.R.C., c. 661)** were **revoked** and replaced by these 1990 regulations, effective **May 2, 1990**.
- The change was driven by a **significant shift in market demand and supply** over the five years preceding the marketing plan, as assessed under the FPMAA.

##### **2. Quota Assignment Process**
- **Provincial Commodity Boards** (e.g., Ontario Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board, Quebec Fédération des producteurs de volailles du Québec, etc.) are responsible for assigning federal quotas to producers.
- Assignment must follow **equal terms and conditions** as those used for assigning provincial quotas.
- The total amount of turkey authorized for marketing (both interprovincial/export and intraprovincial) **must not exceed** the quantity set out in the schedule for each province.

##### **3. Quota Assignment Rules**
- **All producers must have a federal quota** to market turkey in interprovincial or export trade.
- A producer **cannot exceed** their federal quota during any control period.
- A producer **cannot exceed** their breeder, broiler, hen, or tom allotments during a full control period or any portion of it.
- **Periodic allotments** may be assigned for sub-periods within a control period (e.g., for seasonal sales), and must be allocated in such a way that the total across the control period does not exceed the federal quota.

##### **4. Initial Quota Assignment (May 1990)**
- For the control period starting **May 1, 1990**, and ending **April 30, 1991**, **all producers who had a quota under the previous regulations** are entitled to have their **federal quota preserved**.
- The quota assigned on **May 2, 1990** is **equal to the quota they held on May 1, 1990**.

##### **5. Allotment Allocation**
- Each producer receiving a federal quota must be assigned **one or more of the following allotments**:
  - Breeder
  - Broiler
  - Hen
  - Tom
- The **sum of these allotments must equal the federal quota**.

##### **6. Excess Marketing Penalties**
- If a producer markets **more than their allotted quantity** (either total or periodic):
  - The Commodity Board **may reduce** the producer’s allotment (breeder, broiler, hen, or tom) in the **subsequent control period** by the amount of excess.
- This creates a **penalty mechanism** to discourage over-marketing and maintain quota integrity.

##### **7. Reporting and Transparency**
- Commodity Boards are required to **notify producers promptly** of any periodic allotments.
- Boards must **provide the Agency with timely information** on federal quotas, allotments, and marketing activities as requested.

#### **Exclusions and Limitations**

- **Does not apply to turkey poults** (young turkeys under 10 days old).
- Applies only to **marketing in interprovincial or export trade**.
- Does **not regulate intraprovincial trade** directly, as provincial quotas govern that.

---

#### **Implementation and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**: May 2, 1990.
- **Enforcement Authority**: Provincial Commodity Boards administer the system; the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency oversees compliance and enforces the rules.
- **Review and Oversight**: The National Farm Products Marketing Council approved the regulations on March 28, 1990, confirming their necessity for implementing the marketing plan.

---

#### **Significance and Impact**

1. **Market Stability**:
   - The quota system helps stabilize prices by limiting supply in the interprovincial and export markets.

2. **Fair Distribution**:
   - Ensures that producers across provinces have equitable access to marketing opportunities.

3. **Adaptability to Market Changes**:
   - The system is responsive to shifts in production and demand, as confirmed by the five-year market review.

4. **Provincial Flexibility**:
   - Delegates authority to provincial boards, allowing regional considerations to be factored into quota decisions.

5. **Incentive for Responsible Marketing**:
   - The penalty for exceeding allotments encourages producers to manage their marketing activities carefully.

#### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations, 1990* represent a **modernized, responsive, and enforceable framework** for managing turkey marketing in Canada. By replacing outdated rules with a system that accounts for significant market changes, the regulations promote **market stability, fair competition, and sustainable production**.
