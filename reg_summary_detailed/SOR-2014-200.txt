### Key Definitions and Designations

#### 1. **Designation of Public Office Holders (under paragraph (e) of subsection 2(1) of the Act)**

This section identifies specific individuals or groups who are formally designated as *public office holders* under the Conflict of Interest Act. These individuals are included in the definition of "public office holder" as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Act, specifically under paragraph (e), which covers certain public officials in federal institutions.

The designated individuals include:

- **The Governor and the Deputy Governor** of the **Bank of Canada**, appointed under subsection 6(1) of the *Bank of Canada Act*  
  → These are key monetary policy and financial institution leaders, and their designation ensures they are subject to conflict of interest rules.

- **The Directors** appointed under subsection 23(1) of the *Museums Act*  
  → These individuals oversee the governance and operations of museums in Canada, including the management of public cultural assets and funding.

- **The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)** of the **Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA)**, appointed under section 17 of the *Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse Act*  
  → The CEO leads a federal agency focused on public health and addiction prevention, and is thus included in the scope of public office holders.

- **The President** of the **National Arts Centre (NAC)**, appointed under subsection 6(1) of the *National Arts Centre Act*  
  → The President is responsible for the leadership and operations of a major national arts institution, and is subject to conflict of interest obligations.

- **Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)** appointed under subsection 13(1.1) of the *Pilotage Act*  
  → This refers to individuals who serve as CEOs of pilotage authorities, which manage the regulation and oversight of maritime navigation and pilot services in Canadian ports.

> **Purpose**: These designations ensure that individuals in these specific leadership roles are formally recognized as public office holders under the Conflict of Interest Act, thereby triggering their obligation to avoid conflicts of interest and disclose relevant financial interests.

#### 2. **Designation of Reporting Public Office Holders (under paragraph (f) of subsection 2(1) of the Act)**

This section defines who qualifies as a *reporting public office holder* — a category of public office holders who are required to file annual disclosures under the Conflict of Interest Act.

The criteria are:

- **Part-time public office holders** who:
  - Exercise their official duties and functions on a **part-time basis**, but  
  - Receive an **annual salary and benefits**.

- **Full-time public office holders** who:
  - Exercise their official duties and functions on a **full-time basis**.

> **Note**: The key distinction here is that *both part-time and full-time* individuals who are public office holders and receive compensation (salary or benefits) are considered *reporting public office holders*.

> **Implication**: This means that even if someone performs their duties only part-time (e.g., a part-time director or advisor), if they are formally recognized as a public office holder and receive compensation, they must comply with the disclosure requirements of the Conflict of Interest Act.

### Effective Date

The Order comes into force **30 days after the day on which it is registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
This provides a reasonable transition period for the individuals and institutions involved to become aware of their obligations and to begin compliance with the conflict of interest reporting requirements.

### Purpose and Significance of the Regulation

This Order serves several important functions:

1. **Clarifies Scope of Public Office Holders**  
   It explicitly identifies individuals in key federal institutions who are subject to the Conflict of Interest Act, ensuring that oversight applies to all relevant public officials, even those in specialized or non-traditional roles (e.g., arts and cultural institutions).

2. **Ensures Accountability and Transparency**  
   By designating specific individuals as public office holders and reporting public office holders, the regulation strengthens the accountability framework. These individuals must disclose any financial interests, personal relationships, or potential conflicts that could influence their official decisions.

3. **Supports Consistent Application of Conflict of Interest Rules**  
   The distinction between full-time and part-time roles with compensation ensures that the rules apply broadly across the public service, regardless of work hours.

4. **Promotes Public Trust**  
   Clear designation and mandatory reporting help maintain public confidence in government institutions by demonstrating transparency in how public officials manage their personal and professional interests.

### Conclusion

This regulation is a critical component of the Conflict of Interest Act, providing a clear and legally binding list of individuals who fall under the Act’s conflict of interest provisions. It expands the definition of public office holders to include key leaders in financial, cultural, and health-related institutions, and ensures that both full-time and part-time officials receiving compensation are required to report potential conflicts. By coming into force after a 30-day registration period, it allows for orderly implementation and compliance across federal agencies.

This Order reflects the government’s ongoing commitment to ethical governance, transparency, and accountability in public office.
