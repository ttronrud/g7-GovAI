**Detailed Summary of the St. Anns Bank Marine Protected Area Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The *St. Anns Bank Marine Protected Area Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to designate and regulate marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

These regulations formally establish the **St. Anns Bank Marine Protected Area (MPA)** and define its boundaries, components, permitted activities, and environmental safeguards.

---

### **2. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Marine Protected Area (MPA):**  
  Refers to the specific area of the sea designated under Section 2 of the Oceans Act. It includes:
  - The **seabed**
  - The **subsoil to a depth of five metres**
  - The **water column above the seabed**

This comprehensive definition ensures that both physical and biological elements of the marine environment are protected.

---

### **3. Geographical Coordinates and Boundary Description**
- All geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) in **Schedules 1 and 2** are expressed using the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD83)** reference system, ensuring accuracy and consistency in mapping and navigation.
  
#### **Boundary of the MPA (Schedule 1):**
- The MPA is bounded by a series of **rhumb lines** connecting 10 defined points (numbered 1 to 10), with each point’s coordinates specified in Schedule 1.
- The boundary closes by returning from point 10 back to point 1.

> This creates a polygonal boundary that defines the exact spatial extent of the protected area.

---

### **4. Division into Management Zones (Schedule 2)**
The MPA is subdivided into **four distinct management zones**, each with different activity restrictions and allowances:

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Zone 1** | Bounded by rhumb lines from point 18 → 20 → 2 → 8 → through points 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 → 17 → 16 → 15 → 9 → 13 → 12 → 11 → 14 → 19 → back to point 18. |
| **Zone 2** | Bounded by point 1 → 2 → 20 → 18 → 19 → 10 → back to point 1. |
| **Zone 3** | Bounded by point 14 → 11 → 12 → 13 → back to point 14. |
| **Zone 4** | Bounded by point 8 → 15 → 16 → 17 → back to point 8. |

Each zone has different fishing and activity rules, reflecting a tiered approach to conservation and human use.

---

### **5. Prohibited Activities**
Subject to exceptions, **any activity that disturbs, damages, destroys, or removes**:
- Any living marine organism
- Any part of its habitat  
...is **prohibited** within the MPA.

This is a core principle of marine conservation aimed at preserving biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.

---

### **6. Permitted Activities**
Certain activities are allowed under strict conditions, primarily governed by:
- The **Fisheries Act**
- The **Coastal Fisheries Protection Act**
- Their respective regulations

#### **Fishing Activities:**
- **Non-commercial fishing** authorized under the **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations**.
- **Fishing for seals and related activities** authorized under the **Marine Mammal Regulations** or **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations**.
- **In Zone 2**: Commercial or recreational fishing using:
  - Pots, traps, rod and reel, harpoons, bottom longline, handline, or diving.
- **In Zones 3 and 4**: Commercial or recreational fishing using:
  - Pots, traps, rod and reel, harpoons, bottom longline, or handline.

> *Note:* These restrictions exclude destructive methods such as gill nets in some zones, promoting sustainable and low-impact fishing.

#### **Navigation**
- **Navigation is permitted** in the MPA, including for commercial and recreational vessels, provided it does not interfere with protected species or habitats.

#### **Public Safety and Emergency Activities**
- Activities for **public safety, national defence, national security, law enforcement, or emergency response** are allowed without prior approval.

#### **Approved Activity Plans**
- Any activity included in a plan **approved by the Minister** may be carried out in the MPA.

---

### **7. Scientific, Educational, and Commercial Marine Tourism Activities**
Any individual or organization proposing to conduct the following activities **must submit a detailed activity plan** to the Minister:

#### **Required Information in the Activity Plan:**
1. **Contact details** of the applicant (name, address, phone, email)
2. If submitted by an institution:
   - Name and title of responsible individual, plus contact details
3. **Vessel details**:
   - Name, registration status, registration number, radio call sign
   - Owner, master, and operator contact information
4. **Detailed description**:
   - Purpose, methods, and data collection objectives
5. **Geographic location**:
   - Coordinates of the site and a map showing the activity within the MPA boundary
6. **Proposed dates** and alternative dates
7. **Equipment list**:
   - Description, deployment/retrieval method, anchoring/mooring procedures
8. **Sample collection**:
   - Types, quantities, and handling procedures
9. **Substances to be deposited**:
   - Any substances not authorized under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* (e.g., fuel, chemicals, waste)
   - Quantity and concentration
10. **Environmental impact assessment**:
    - Description of likely adverse effects
    - Measures to monitor, avoid, minimize, or mitigate these effects
11. **Past or anticipated similar activities** in the MPA
12. **Expected outcomes**:
    - Study, report, or product resulting from the activity
    - Anticipated completion date

---

### **8. Minister’s Approval Criteria**
The Minister **must approve** an activity plan **if**:

#### ✅ Scientific Research or Monitoring:
- Does **not destroy habitat** of any living marine organism
- Aims to:
  - Increase knowledge of biodiversity or biological productivity
  - Assist in the management and conservation of the MPA

#### ✅ Educational or Commercial Marine Tourism:
- Increases **public awareness** of the MPA
- Is **not likely to damage, destroy, or remove** any living marine organism or habitat

### **9. Conditions Under Which Approval is DENIED**
Despite the above, the Minister **must not approve** an activity plan if:

1. **Any substance** deposited during the activity is a **deleterious substance** (as defined in subsection 34(1) of the *Fisheries Act*), **unless**:
   - The deposit is explicitly authorized under subsection 36(4) of the *Fisheries Act* (e.g., for essential operations like fueling or maintenance).

2. The **cumulative environmental effects** of the proposed activity — combined with **past and current activities** in the MPA — would:
   - Adversely affect biodiversity or biological productivity
   - Destroy the habitat of any living marine organism

> This ensures that even small activities are evaluated in the context of long-term ecological health.

---

### **10. Timeline for Ministerial Decisions**
- The Minister must make a decision on an activity plan within:
  - **60 days** of receiving the original plan, **or**
  - **60 days** after receiving an amended plan

> This establishes a clear and enforceable timeline for processing applications.

---

### **11. Post-Activity Reporting Requirements**
If an activity plan is approved, the applicant must submit a **post-activity report within 90 days** of the end of the activity, containing:

1. **List of samples** collected (including quantities and locations)
2. **Data collected**, including dates and geographic coordinates of sampling sites
3. **Evaluation of mitigation measures** used to manage environmental impacts
4. **Description of any unanticipated events** that could have caused:
   - Disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal of marine life or habitat

> This ensures accountability, transparency, and continuous monitoring of environmental effects.

---

### **12. Effective Date**
These regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** with the Statutes of Canada.
