**Detailed Summary of the Large Diameter Line Pipe Anti-dumping Duty Remission Order, 2023**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
The regulation is issued under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)) and is based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. It is enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, which is the formal mechanism through which federal legislation is approved and issued in Canada.

This Order is a **remission order**, meaning it provides a legal mechanism to **cancel or reduce anti-dumping duties** that were previously imposed on certain imported goods.

### **2. Scope of the Order: Definition of "Large Diameter Line Pipe"**
For the purposes of this Order, **"large diameter line pipe"** is defined as the subject goods as specified in **Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Reasons** issued by the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)** on **November 4, 2016**, in **Inquiry Number NQ-2016-001**.

This definition is critical because it establishes the precise scope of the goods to which the remission applies. The CITT’s determination in that inquiry likely involved a detailed assessment of technical, commercial, and market-related factors to define what constitutes "large diameter line pipe" — typically referring to steel pipes with a nominal diameter of 10 inches or more, used in oil and gas transmission systems, and subject to anti-dumping duties due to concerns about unfair pricing from foreign producers.

### **3. Eligibility for Remission**
Remission of anti-dumping duties is granted **only** for large diameter line pipe that:

- Was **imported for the purpose of use by or on behalf of** a company listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**; and  
- Was recorded under a specific **transaction number** (designated as a **B3-3 Form**) listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.

> The B3-3 Form is a standard customs transaction form used by importers to record specific import details, including the nature of the transaction, the buyer, the seller, and the product description. This ensures that only verifiable, documented transactions are eligible.

This eligibility criterion ensures that the remission is not broadly applied but is **targeted and traceable** to specific companies and transactions.

### **4. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To qualify for remission, the following **two conditions** must be met:

1. **Timeliness of Claim**:  
   A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** **within two years** of the date the Order comes into force.

   > This two-year window ensures that claims are made promptly and reduces the risk of long-term disputes or loss of evidence. It also aligns with standard administrative practices in trade regulation.

2. **Submission of Required Evidence**:  
   Upon request by the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**, the claimant (the company or entity that imported the pipe) must **file all evidence** necessary for the CBSA to determine whether the claimant is eligible for remission.

   > This evidentiary requirement ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance. The CBSA may request documentation such as:
   - Import records (e.g., B3-3 Form)
   - Purchase contracts
   - Proof of use of the pipe (e.g., in infrastructure or operations)
   - Evidence of the company’s identity and relationship to the listed entity

---

### **5. Effective Date**
The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.  
Registration is the formal process by which a government regulation is officially published and becomes legally effective. The specific registration date is not provided in the text, but it will be published in the official gazette (Canada Gazette) and becomes enforceable upon that date.

### **6. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Targeted Remission** | Only applies to specific companies and transactions, not all imports of large diameter line pipe. |
| **Administrative Oversight** | The CBSA plays a central role in verifying eligibility, ensuring compliance with procedural requirements. |
| **Limited Timeframe** | Claims must be filed within two years — a strict deadline to prevent indefinite claims. |
| **Evidence-Based Process** | Requires documentation to confirm the legitimacy of the claim. |
| **Legal Foundation** | Based on prior CITT findings, ensuring consistency with trade tribunal decisions. |

### **7. Purpose and Rationale**
The purpose of this remission order is likely to:

- **Correct or rectify** a situation where anti-dumping duties were imposed on large diameter line pipe but were **not aligned with actual market conditions or fair trade practices**.
- **Support specific Canadian companies** that may have relied on the imported goods for infrastructure development (e.g., oil and gas pipelines), especially if they were subject to high costs due to the duties.
- **Promote economic fairness** by allowing legitimate importers to recover duties that may have been imposed in error or in a manner inconsistent with the original anti-dumping investigation.

---

### **8. Important Notes**
- The Order does **not** apply to all large diameter line pipe imports — only those linked to companies and transaction numbers in the Schedule.
- It does **not** eliminate anti-dumping duties in general — it only provides a **remission** (a refund or cancellation) for specific cases.
- The Order is **not retroactive** — it only applies to imports that occurred after the Order came into force, and claims must be made within two years of that date.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Large Diameter Line Pipe Anti-dumping Duty Remission Order, 2023** is a targeted, evidence-based, and time-limited administrative measure designed to provide relief to specific Canadian companies that imported large diameter line pipe under anti-dumping duties. It reflects a balance between trade protection and economic fairness, ensuring that legitimate importers are not unduly burdened by duties that may have been applied inconsistently or in error. The regulation underscores the importance of transparency, accountability, and alignment with prior trade tribunal determinations.

**Note on the Numbers at the End**  
The sequence of numbers (e.g., 13060805412437, 17848830485346, etc.) at the end of the document are likely **unique identifiers or internal reference codes** used by the government for tracking, record-keeping, or system processing. They do not have legal or substantive significance in the regulation itself and are not part of the text or meaning of the Order.
