**Detailed Summary of the Rosabel Jeanette Pryce Housing Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Origin**  
The *Rosabel Jeanette Pryce Housing Regulations* are formally issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This action is grounded in specific budgetary allocations (votes) from the federal government’s Appropriation Acts:

- **Vote L51a** in *Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966* (Schedule B)  
- **Vote L51g** in *Appropriation Act No. 2, 1967* (Schedule)  
- **Vote L51a** in *Appropriation Act No. 7, 1967* (Schedule B)

These votes authorize the use of funds for housing assistance to Indigenous individuals, specifically under the broader framework of Indian housing policy. The regulations are thus a legally binding instrument enabling targeted financial support for housing acquisition.

**2. Name and Citation**  
The regulations are officially titled:  
**"The Rosabel Jeanette Pryce Housing Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such in all legal and administrative contexts.

**3. Key Definitions**  
The regulations define two key terms:

- **Condominium unit**:  
  A bounded space within a building that is legally designated or described as a separate unit on a registered condominium or strata lot plan or description.  
  This registration must be under the laws of a province and must be intended for **human habitation**.  
  The term is used to clarify that the housing in question is not a traditional single-family home or a shared dwelling, but rather a privately owned, legally defined unit within a multi-unit building (such as an apartment complex).  
  The definition is consistent with provincial real estate and property law, particularly in jurisdictions like British Columbia.

- **Minister**:  
  Refers to the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (Ministre), who is responsible for administering federal policy and programs related to Indigenous peoples, including housing and financial assistance.

**4. Purpose and Scope of the Loan**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to **enable the Minister to make a loan to Rosabel Jeanette Pryce**, a member of the **Skidegate Band of Indians** in **British Columbia**.  

The loan is intended to assist her in acquiring a **condominium unit located off a reserve**.  

This provision is significant because it reflects a policy of supporting Indigenous individuals in transitioning from reserve-based living to off-reserve housing, which may offer greater access to services, employment, and community integration. However, it also acknowledges the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities in accessing housing outside of reserve lands.

**5. Application of Existing Housing Regulations**  
A critical and legally important provision is that:

> *"The Indian Off-Reserve and Eskimo Re-Establishment Housing Regulations shall apply in respect of any loan made pursuant to section 3 as if the loan were a loan under those Regulations."*

This means that **all the rules, conditions, eligibility criteria, procedural requirements, and administrative provisions** contained in the *Indian Off-Reserve and Eskimo Re-Establishment Housing Regulations* will be directly applicable to this specific loan — even though it is a single, individualized transaction.

In practical terms, this ensures consistency and compliance with established federal housing policy. It includes, for example:

- Eligibility requirements (e.g., membership in a recognized band, financial need, residency status)  
- Documentation and application procedures  
- Terms of repayment (if applicable)  
- Conditions related to housing use, occupancy, and maintenance  
- Oversight and reporting obligations

By applying these existing regulations, the government ensures that the loan is administered in a manner consistent with broader housing programs and safeguards against abuse or non-compliance.

**6. Significance and Implications**  
- **Individualized Support**: The regulations represent a targeted intervention to assist one individual (Rosabel Jeanette Pryce), reflecting a personalized approach to Indigenous housing needs.  
- **Legal Precedent**: The use of a specific named individual in the title of a regulation may indicate a historical or administrative practice of naming individual cases in housing or financial assistance programs, though such cases are rare.  
- **Policy Continuity**: The reliance on existing off-reserve housing regulations ensures that the loan is not created in isolation but is embedded within a structured, accountable, and equitable housing framework.  
- **Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination**: While the loan is federally administered, it supports the broader goal of enabling Indigenous people to live independently off-reserve, which is a step toward greater autonomy and access to mainstream services.

---

**7. Limitations and Context**  
- The regulations are **not a general housing program** but a **specific, one-off loan** for a named individual.  
- The loan is limited to a **condominium unit off a reserve**, not to any type of housing or property.  
- The Skidegate Band of Indians is a recognized First Nation in British Columbia, and the individual must be a member of that band to qualify.  
- The regulations do not specify the amount of the loan, interest rate, repayment schedule, or duration — these details would be found in the accompanying loan agreement or policy documents under the broader housing regulations.

**Conclusion**  
The *Rosabel Jeanette Pryce Housing Regulations* are a targeted, legally valid instrument that authorizes a federal loan to support the housing needs of a specific Indigenous individual. By defining key terms, establishing eligibility through the application of existing federal housing rules, and ensuring compliance with established policy frameworks, the regulations provide a clear, transparent, and accountable pathway for housing assistance off-reserve. This case exemplifies how federal policy can be applied to individual Indigenous persons to promote housing stability, self-reliance, and integration into broader communities.
