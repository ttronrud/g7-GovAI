**Detailed Summary of C.T.C. 1978-11 RAIL: Regulations Governing the Handling of Carloads of Explosives on Railway Company Team or Spur Tracks**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Canadian Transport Commission (Commission)** issued these regulations under the following legislative provisions:

- **Section 295 and 296 of the Railway Act** – Grants the Commission authority to regulate railway operations, including safety standards for handling hazardous materials.
- **Section 46 of the National Transportation Act** – Provides federal authority to establish safety regulations for transportation, including explosives.

These regulations are formally titled:  
**"Handling of Carloads of Explosives on Railway Trackage Regulations"**  
They came into force **six (6) months after the date of publication**, which was **December 21, 1978**.

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in interpretation, the following key terms are defined:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|

### **3. Danger Factors (Critical Risk Indicators)**

The regulations define **danger factors** as four key elements that determine the risk associated with handling explosives at a site:

1. **Maximum Net Weight of Explosives**  
   - The highest total weight of explosives that may be present at a handling site at any one time—whether inside a railcar, outside, or during transfer between vehicles.

2. **Frequency of Loading/Unloading**  
   - The number of times per year, month, or week that explosives will be loaded or unloaded at the site.

3. **Duration of Presence**  
   - The maximum number of hours that any quantity of explosives may remain at the site (in a railcar, vehicle, or during transfer).

4. **Proximity to Occupied Buildings or Public Facilities**  
   - The distance between the handling site and structures where people gather or live, including:
     - Schools, theatres, hospitals, office buildings, department stores
     - Dwellings, apartment houses, open spaces
     - Factories, pump houses, storage tanks, warehouses
     - Electric power stations, power lines
     - Other facilities handling reactive or hazardous materials
     - Nearest fire hydrant or firefighting water source

These factors are used to assess the overall risk level and determine whether a site is suitable for handling explosives.

### **4. Site Selection and Approval Process**

#### **Case 1: Low-Volume Handling (Low Risk)**
If the handling meets the following conditions:
- **No more than one carload of explosives at any one time**, and  
- **No more than six carloads per year**

Then:
- The **railway company and shipper/consignee jointly select** the most suitable handling site based on the danger factors.
- The railway company must:
  1. **Inform the local fire authority** of the proposed site.
  2. **Ensure the shipper/consignee obtains approval** from the **Chief Inspector, Explosives Branch, Department of Energy, Mines and Resources**.
  3. **Notify the Railway Transport Committee** of the selection.

> This process applies only to low-risk operations and does not require formal Committee authorization.

#### **Case 2: High-Volume or High-Risk Handling (High Risk)**
If any of the following conditions apply:
- More than **one carload at a time**, or  
- More than **six carloads per year**

Then:
- A formal **application for authorization** must be submitted to the **Railway Transport Committee** by the railway company on behalf of the shipper or consignee.

This process involves a rigorous review to ensure public safety and compliance with hazard mitigation standards.

---

### **5. Requirements for High-Risk Applications**

Every application under Section 4 must include:

1. **Basic Location Details**:
   - Name of railway company
   - Name of railway subdivision
   - Railway mileage point
   - Name of the nearest hamlet, village, town, or city

2. **Full Disclosure of Danger Factors**  
   - Complete documentation of all four danger factors as defined above.

3. **Proof of Notification to Local Fire Authority**  
   - Evidence that the local fire authority has been informed of the proposed use of the site.

---

### **6. Site Plan Requirements**

Each application must include a **detailed site plan** that:

- Is drawn to a scale of **not less than 200 feet to 1 inch** (i.e., 1 inch = 200 feet).
- Covers the **entire hazard area** for the **maximum quantity of explosives** that will be handled at any one time.
- Clearly shows:
  - Railway track and right-of-way boundaries
  - All relevant distances from the handling site to:
    - Schools, hospitals, theatres, office buildings, public assembly areas
    - Residential structures (dwellings, apartments)
    - Industrial facilities (factories, storage tanks, power stations)
    - Power lines and other hazardous installations
    - Nearest fire hydrant or water source for firefighting

> The plan must be submitted in **duplicate** and must provide **accurate, measurable distances**.

---

### **7. Committee Authorization**

Upon review of the application, the **Railway Transport Committee** may issue a **letter of authority** authorizing the shipper or consignee to handle explosives at the proposed site.

This letter is the formal legal permission required for high-risk operations.

---

### **8. Safety and Operational Requirements (Mandatory Precautions)**

Every railway company must implement and enforce the following safety measures at all handling sites:

#### **a. Prohibition of Open Flames**
- Smoking and the use of welding or any equipment with an open flame are **strictly prohibited**.
- These prohibitions must be clearly communicated via **visible, conspicuous signs**.

#### **b. Access Restrictions**
- **Clear, visible signs** must indicate that access to the handling site is restricted.
- Access must be limited to authorized personnel only.

#### **c. Track Security**
- To prevent accidental contact from other trains:
  - **Locked derails** must be applied to the track, or
  - **Switches must be locked with private padlocks** to prevent cars from being approached from either direction.

#### **d. Secure Car Doors**
- When a consignee breaks the seal during delivery or when loading begins:
  - All car doors must be **securely padlocked** whenever the car is unattended during meal breaks or operational interruptions.

#### **e. Fire Hazard Management**
- The handling site and surrounding area must be kept **free of litter, debris, and other fire hazards**.

#### **f. Firefighting Equipment**
- **Fire extinguishers** must be readily available at the site.
- The total effective rating must be at least **two 10 B:C extinguishers** (or equivalent first aid fire protection).

#### **g. Emergency Evacuation**
- In the event that explosives are **imminently threatened by fire**, the **hazard area must be evacuated immediately**.

#### **h. Containment of Damage**
- Any **damaged packages** or material escaping from explosives must be **removed from railway property without delay**.

#### **i. Incident Reporting**
- Any fire, explosion, or similar incident at a handling site must be **immediately reported** to the railway company by the person in charge of the operation.

### **9. Reporting Obligations to the Committee**

Upon receiving a report of an incident (as per paragraph 1(i)):

1. **Immediate Telephone Notification**  
   - The railway company must **call the Director, Safety and Standards, Railway Transport Committee** (using the number specified by the Committee at the time) **within minutes** of receiving the report.

2. **Written Detailed Report**  
   - Within **30 days** of the incident, the railway company must submit a **comprehensive written report** to the Director, including:
     - Description of the incident
     - Cause (if known)
     - Actions taken
     - Any injuries or damage
     - Recommendations for prevention

This reporting requirement ensures accountability, facilitates investigation, and supports long-term safety improvements.

### **10. Purpose and Intent of the Regulations**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **minimize public risk** associated with handling explosives on railway tracks.
- To ensure that **only safe, well-considered sites** are used for explosive handling.
- To establish **clear, enforceable safety protocols** that protect workers, the public, and infrastructure.
