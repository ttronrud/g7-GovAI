**Regulation Summary: Designation of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Authority as a Designated Airport Authority**

**1. Legal Authority and Source**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 5), specifically pursuant to subsection 2(2) of that Act. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board) to designate certain airport authorities as "designated airport authorities" for the purposes of managing and operating airports under federal jurisdiction.

**2. Key Designation**  
The regulation formally designates the **Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Authority** as a **designated airport authority**. This designation grants the Authority specific legal status and powers under the Act, enabling it to:

- Exercise control over the operations, management, and development of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport;
- Enter into agreements with federal and provincial entities;
- Receive and manage federal funding and resources;
- Make decisions regarding airport infrastructure, safety, and service delivery, as permitted by the Act.

This status is critical because it establishes the Authority as a legally recognized entity with the necessary powers to function independently in the governance and operation of the airport.

**3. Transfer Date**  
The regulation establishes the **transfer date** for the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport as the **day immediately following the closing date** defined in the *Agreement to Transfer* entered into under **Order in Council P.C. 1996-1390**, dated August 28, 1996.

- The Agreement to Transfer was a formal arrangement between the federal government and the provincial government (or relevant parties) to transfer operational control of the airport from the federal government to the newly created airport authority.
- The "closing date" in that agreement is the final date set for the transfer process (e.g., the date when all conditions, obligations, and legal requirements were satisfied).
- The **transfer date** is therefore set as the next calendar day after that closing date, marking the official point at which the Authority assumes full operational and legal responsibility for the airport.

**4. Purpose and Significance**  
This regulation serves several key purposes:

- It legally transfers the management and operational control of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport from the federal government to the newly established Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Authority.
- It ensures continuity and stability in airport operations by clearly defining the transfer date and the legal status of the Authority.
- It enables the Authority to operate with greater autonomy, accountability, and efficiency in managing the airport’s long-term development and service delivery.
- It aligns with broader federal policy objectives of promoting public-private partnerships, regional economic development, and efficient infrastructure management.

**5. Legal and Administrative Context**  
- The transfer was initiated under Order in Council P.C. 1996-1390, which authorized the Agreement to Transfer.
- The designation under subsection 2(2) of the *Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act* is a necessary step to give the Authority legal standing and authority under federal law.
- The regulation is binding and effective upon issuance, and it applies to all matters related to the airport’s operations and governance from the transfer date onward.

---

**In Summary:**  
This regulation formally designates the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Authority as a designated airport authority under federal law and sets the transfer date for the airport’s operational control as the day after the closing date specified in the 1996 Agreement to Transfer. This marks a significant shift in governance, transferring responsibility from the federal government to a dedicated, legally empowered authority, thereby enabling more effective and sustainable airport management.
