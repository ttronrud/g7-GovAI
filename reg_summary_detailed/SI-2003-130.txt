The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2017-11" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 2017/11 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter of the regulation — e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, or transportation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a regulation is listed as "Repealed, SI/2017-11", this means:

1. **Official Status**: The regulation was formally published in the Statutory Instruments (SI) list in 2017 as number 11.
2. **Repeal**: It was later formally revoked or cancelled by a subsequent statutory instrument or legislative amendment. This typically occurs when a regulation is outdated, superseded by a new law, or deemed unnecessary.
3. **Legal Effect**: Once repealed, the regulation no longer has legal force or effect. Any provisions previously contained in it are no longer enforceable.
4. **Public Record**: The repeal is recorded in the official legal database (such as the UK Statutory Instruments database or the legislation.gov.uk website), and the repeal is usually cited in the text of the new instrument that replaces it or in a formal order.

To provide a detailed summary, the full title of the regulation (e.g., *The [Name of Regulation] 2017 (SI 2017/11)*) and its subject matter (such as "Regulation of Air Traffic," "Control of Noise from Construction," or "Standards for Food Hygiene") would be required.

Therefore, based on the information provided:

👉 **Summary**:  
SI/2017/11 has been formally repealed. This means the regulation was previously in force and was later cancelled by legislation or administrative order. As a result, it no longer exists in legal effect. Without the full title or subject matter, a detailed summary of its provisions cannot be provided. For further details, the original regulation's title and content should be accessed via the official UK legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk), where the repeal notice and original text (if available) can be reviewed.

If you can provide the full title or subject of the regulation (e.g., "The Health and Safety at Work (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/11)"), I would be happy to offer a detailed summary of its content prior to repeal.
