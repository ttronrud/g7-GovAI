**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation outlines the official determination by the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the Prime Minister—of key dates and procedural details for a constitutional referendum in Canada, specifically concerning the renewal of the Constitution of Canada based on an agreement reached on August 28, 1992.

---

### **1. Context and Legal Basis**

- The regulation is grounded in the **Referendum Act**, a federal statute that establishes the legal framework for conducting referendums in Canada.
- Under **subsection 3(1)** of the Referendum Act, a **proclamation** has been issued that formally directs the government to seek the opinion of the electors in specific provinces and territories regarding a constitutional issue.
- The question put to the public is:
  > “Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on August 28, 1992?”  
  Voters are asked to respond with either **YES** or **NO**.

This question relates to the **Meech Lake Accord**, which was a constitutional agreement signed on August 28, 1992, aimed at addressing the concerns of provincial governments regarding the recognition of their rights and interests within the Canadian Constitution. The Accord proposed amendments to the Constitution to ensure greater provincial representation and to address issues of constitutional recognition and self-government.

### **2. Key Determinations Made by the Governor General in Council**

The Governor General, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, issues a formal determination under **subsection 6(2)** and **subsection 6(3)** of the Referendum Act, setting two critical dates for the referendum:

#### **a. Date of the Writs of Referendum (Subsection 6(2))**
- The **writs of referendum**—official legal documents that initiate the voting process—are officially **dated September 17, 1992**.
- This date marks the formal beginning of the referendum process. It is the day when the government officially calls for the election of voters to respond to the constitutional question.
- The writs are issued to all eligible electors in the specified provinces and territories, instructing them to participate in the vote.

#### **b. Polling Day (Subsection 6(3))**
- The **polling day**—the official day on which voting occurs—is set for **October 26, 1992**.
- On this day, registered voters in the provinces and territories listed in the proclamation will be able to cast their votes on the constitutional question regarding the renewal of the Constitution based on the August 28, 1992 agreement.

### **3. Jurisdiction and Scope**

The referendum is to be held in the following **provinces and territories**:
- Ontario
- Nova Scotia
- New Brunswick
- Manitoba
- British Columbia
- Prince Edward Island
- Saskatchewan
- Alberta
- Newfoundland
- Yukon Territory
- Northwest Territories

Note: This excludes Quebec, which was not included in the initial referendum on the Meech Lake Accord. The Meech Lake Accord had been rejected by Quebec, and the federal government did not proceed with a referendum in Quebec under this framework.

---

### **4. Purpose and Significance**

- The referendum is designed to **obtain the democratic consent of the Canadian public** on a major constitutional change.
- By asking whether Canadians agree to renew the Constitution based on the August 28, 1992 agreement, the government seeks to determine whether the Meech Lake Accord has sufficient public support to proceed.
- If a majority of voters in the participating provinces and territories vote **YES**, the agreement would be considered constitutionally valid and could move forward.
- If the majority votes **NO**, the agreement would not be adopted, and the constitutional process would likely proceed differently.

---

### **5. Legal and Procedural Implications**

- This determination is **binding under the Referendum Act**, meaning that the government is legally required to follow these dates and procedures.
- The proclamation and the determination serve as the formal legal instruments that initiate and structure the referendum process.
- The process is transparent and democratic, reflecting the principle that constitutional changes require public approval.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally establishes the timeline and scope of a constitutional referendum in Canada, initiated under the Referendum Act. It sets the **writ date** as **September 17, 1992**, and the **polling day** as **October 26, 1992**, to determine whether Canadians agree to renew the Constitution of Canada based on the Meech Lake Accord signed on August 28, 1992. The referendum covers all provinces and territories except Quebec, and its outcome would have significant implications for Canada’s constitutional future. The process reflects a commitment to democratic legitimacy in constitutional reform.
