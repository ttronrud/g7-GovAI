### **Detailed Summary of the Gore Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Gore Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada to ensure the safe operation of Gore Bay Airport by controlling land use and development in its vicinity. These regulations were promulgated on **March 25, 1992**, following a public consultation process, and are designed to protect aviation safety by restricting structures, natural growth, and land use that could interfere with aircraft operations.

## **1. Legal Basis and Publication Process**

- **Authority**: The regulations were made pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister of Transport to issue zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* (March 7 and 14, 1992),
  - Two successive issues of the *Manitoulin Expositor* (April 22 and 29, 1992),
  - Two successive issues of the *Manitoulin Recorder* (March 25 and April 1, 1992).
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

> **Conclusion**: The regulations were developed transparently and with public input, ensuring compliance with democratic and procedural standards.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Gore Bay Airport located in the Townships of Gordon and Barrie, District of Manitoulin, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a datum for all measurements. Its coordinates are: **5,082,304.86 N, 378,338.33 E**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway (runway 11–29), rising at a 1:50 slope (1 meter vertical per 50 meters horizontal), reaching an imaginary horizontal line 2,240 m (runway 11) and 2,095 m (runway 29) from the end. These lines are 44.8 m and 41.9 m above the runway end elevation, respectively. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**. However, if this would place it below 9 meters above ground level, it is capped at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The active runway area (300 m wide, 1,619.57 m long) associated with runway 11–29, centered on the runway’s centerline. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces, extending upward until they intersect the outer surface. |

> These surfaces define the **maximum allowable height** for any structure or natural growth near the airport.

---

## **3. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all land**, including public road allowances, that lies **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**.
- The **exact boundary** of the regulated area is defined in a detailed, coordinate-based description (Part VI of the schedule), encompassing:
  - Land in the **Townships of Gordon and Barrie Island**,
  - Adjacent to **Bayfield Sound** and **Lake Huron**,
  - Including road allowances and natural boundaries such as **Lake Wolsey** and **Bayfield Sound**.

> The boundary is defined by a complex, step-by-step survey path involving:
> - Concessions and lots in Gordon and Barrie Island,
> - Road allowances,
> - High water marks of lakes (Lake Wolsey and Bayfield Sound),
> - A circular arc of **4,000 meters radius** from the Airport Reference Point.

> This ensures that only land within a defined buffer zone is subject to the zoning restrictions.

## **4. Prohibitions and Restrictions**

### **A. Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**
- **No construction or modification** may be carried out on any land within the regulated zone such that the **highest point** of any building, structure, or object exceeds:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> This prevents obstructions that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, or approach paths.

### **B. No Interference with Aviation Communications**
- No person may use or develop land in a way that:
  - Interferes with **radio signals or communications** between aircraft and ground control,
  - Disrupts **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, navigation aids).

> This ensures reliable and safe air traffic management.

### **C. Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes) grows beyond the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister may require** the owner or lessee to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This protects against uncontrolled tree growth that could pose a hazard during flight operations.

### **D. Prohibition of Bird Attractants**
- No part of the regulated land may be used for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** to birds,
  - Or **attractive** to birds.

> This reduces the risk of bird strikes, a major aviation hazard.

## **5. Key Technical and Safety Features**

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **Approach Surfaces (1:50 slope)** | Prevents obstructions during aircraft approaches to the runway. The steeper slope ensures a safe buffer zone for aircraft descending toward the runway. |
| **Outer Surface (45 m above ARP)** | Establishes a general safety boundary for all surrounding land. The cap at 9 m ensures safety even in low-lying areas. |
| **Transitional Surfaces (1:7 slope)** | Connects the runway edges to the outer surface, creating a smooth, gradual transition that avoids abrupt changes in elevation. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | Serves as the origin for all elevation and distance measurements. Its fixed coordinates (5,082,304.86 N, 378,338.33 E) provide a consistent spatial reference. |

> These surfaces are based on **standard aviation safety guidelines** to maintain visual and radio line-of-sight for pilots and air traffic controllers.

---

## **6. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth,
  - Enforce compliance with height and land-use restrictions,
  - Issue notices or penalties if violations occur.

> This gives the government the power to act swiftly and decisively in the event of non-compliance.

---

## **7. Maps and Reference Documents**

The regulations are fully supported by **official zoning plans**:
- **Gore Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. 52-024 86-288 (Sheet 5)** – Defines the **airport reference point**.
- **Gore Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. 52-024 86-228 (Sheets 4–9)** – Defines the **approach surfaces, strip, transitional surfaces, and outer surface**.

> These plans are legally binding and serve as the primary reference for enforcement and compliance.

## **8. Significance and Implications**

### ✅ **Safety Benefits**
- Reduces risk of **visual obstructions** and **bird strikes**.
- Ensures **clear flight paths** for all aircraft using the airport.
- Maintains **communication integrity** between pilots and ground control.

### 🚫 **Development Constraints**
- Limits construction, landscaping, and land use in a 4 km radius around the airport.
- May affect property values or development potential in certain areas.

### 🌿 **Environmental Considerations**
- Encourages responsible land management of natural growth and waste disposal.
- Balances environmental protection with aviation safety.

---

## **Conclusion**

The **Gore Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive, technically precise, and safety-focused framework designed to protect the integrity of a small but vital regional airport. By clearly defining spatial boundaries, height limits, and prohibited activities, the regulations ensure that:

- Aircraft can operate safely and efficiently,
- The surrounding environment is managed responsibly,
- Public and private stakeholders are protected from unnecessary risks.

These regulations remain in force as a key component of Canada’s national aviation safety infrastructure and serve as a model for similar airport zoning efforts across the country.
