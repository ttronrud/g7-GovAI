**Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Zimbabwe) Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 17)**

---

### **Overview and Context**

The *Special Economic Measures (Zimbabwe) Regulations*, made under the *Special Economic Measures Act* (SEMA), are a set of Canadian economic sanctions targeting individuals and entities associated with the Government of Zimbabwe, particularly those involved in human rights abuses, undermining democratic institutions, or supporting military activities that threaten international peace and security.

These regulations were enacted in response to what the Governor in Council deemed a **grave breach of international peace and security** in Zimbabwe — a situation that had led to or was likely to lead to a **serious international crisis**. The measures are designed to isolate certain individuals and organizations through economic restrictions, with the aim of pressuring the Zimbabwean government to improve governance, respect human rights, and restore democratic processes.

> **Note**: As of 2023, these regulations have been **repealed or amended** by *SOR/2023-64, s. 1*, which removes several names from the schedule. This indicates that the original 1992 regulations are no longer in full force, though their structure and principles may inform future economic measures.

---

### **5. Aircraft Restrictions**

- No person may **land in Canada** or **fly over Canada** with an aircraft registered in Zimbabwe — **except** if landing is necessary to **safeguard human life**.

- **Disclose without delay** to the **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**:
  - The existence of property they believe is owned or controlled by a designated person
  - Information about any transaction or proposed transaction involving such property

> This creates a legal obligation to report suspicious financial links.

---

### **9. Immunity for Good-Faith Disclosures**

- No civil or administrative proceedings may be brought against a person who makes a **good-faith disclosure** under Section 8.

> This encourages transparency and protects individuals from liability when reporting suspected violations.

### **11. Challenge to Designation**

- A person who believes they are **not a designated person** may apply in writing to the Minister for a **certificate confirming non-designation**.
- If the Minister finds the person is not a designated person, they must issue the certificate within **15 days** of receipt.

> This provides a legal recourse for individuals who may have been wrongly included.
