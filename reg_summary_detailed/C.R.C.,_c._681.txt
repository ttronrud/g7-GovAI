### **2. Key Definitions**  

The regulation provides clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Barge**:  
  Any barge that is **owned and operated by Her Majesty in right of Canada** in conjunction with the ferry.  
  *Note*: The term "chaland" is used in the original text, which is a synonym for a small, flat-bottomed barge, typically used for transporting goods or people across waterways.

  Any vessel owned and operated by Her Majesty in right of Canada that is **normally operated as a ferry service between Cedar Point and Christian Island**, both located in the Province of Ontario.  
  *Note*: The term "traversier" is used in the original, which refers to a vessel designed to cross water bodies, often used for passenger or cargo transport.

- **Indian**:  
  As defined under the **Indian Act** of Canada. This refers to individuals who are recognized as members of an Indigenous community under federal law, specifically those who are registered as "Indians" under the Act.

### **4. Fee Structure by Category**

The regulation outlines a tiered fee structure based on the type of service and the traveler’s age or vehicle use.

#### **A. Individual Passenger Fees (Return Trip)**

| Age Group | Fee |
|---------|-----|
| Over 16 years of age | [Fee specified in Schedule] |
| Over 4 years of age but not over 16 | [Fee specified in Schedule] |
| 4 years of age and younger | [Fee specified in Schedule] |

> *Note*: The actual fee amounts are not included in the provided text but are detailed in the **Schedule** attached to the regulation. These fees apply to a **return trip** (i.e., one-way to Christian Island and back to Cedar Point).

#### **B. Vehicle Fees (Scheduled Return Trip)**

This applies to vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks) traveling on a scheduled ferry route.

| Service | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| For each vehicle on a scheduled return trip | [Fee specified in Schedule] |

> *Note*: The fee is charged per vehicle, not per passenger. The amount is determined in the schedule and applies to a return journey.

#### **C. Ferry Charter Fees**

Fees apply when someone **charter**s the ferry (i.e., rents it for private or commercial use), either alone or in combination with the barge.

| Service | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **First hour or part thereof** | [Fee specified in Schedule] |
| **Each extra 15 minutes or part thereof** | [Fee specified in Schedule] |

> *Example*: If a charter lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes, the fee would be:  
> - First hour: base fee  
> - Additional 1 hour 45 minutes = 1 hour (1 extra 15-minute unit) + 30 minutes (2 extra 15-minute units) → total of 3 units at the per-15-minute rate.

#### **D. Ferry and Barge Charter Fees**

When a charter includes **both the ferry and the barge**, the fee structure is slightly different:

| Service | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **First 45 minutes or part thereof** | [Fee specified in Schedule] |
| **Each extra 15 minutes or part thereof** | [Fee specified in Schedule] |

> *Example*: A charter lasting 1 hour and 30 minutes:  
> - First 45 minutes: base fee  
> - Remaining 45 minutes = 3 units of 15 minutes → 3 additional fees at the per-15-minute rate.

> *Note*: The time-based structure ensures that longer charters are priced proportionally, with a reduced initial rate (45 minutes instead of 60) to encourage short-term use.

### **5. Key Regulatory Principles and Implications**

- **Fair and Accessible Pricing**:  
  The tiered pricing system ensures affordability for different age groups and types of users (individuals vs. vehicles), while still generating revenue for the government.

- **Indigenous Access and Equity**:  
  Exemptions for Indigenous persons and those conducting business with them reflect a commitment to **Indigenous rights, access, and cultural inclusion** in transportation services.

- **Government Oversight**:  
  The ferry and barge are operated by **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, indicating that this is a federally managed service, likely under the Department of Transport or a related agency.

- **Transparency and Accountability**:  
  All fees are detailed in the **Schedule**, which must be publicly accessible. This ensures clarity for users and compliance with administrative transparency standards.

- **Purpose of the Regulation**:  
  To establish a clear, fair, and equitable system for collecting fees from non-exempt users while maintaining access for Indigenous communities and essential service providers.
