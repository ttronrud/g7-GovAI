The reference "[Repealed, SOR/2008-317, s. 1]" indicates that the regulation in question has been officially repealed by order under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* (SOR), specifically in **SOR/2008-317**, under **section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2008-317**, which is a statutory rule published in the Ontario Gazette on or around April 14, 2008 (the exact date may vary slightly depending on publication).

- **Section 1 of SOR/2008-317**: This section specifically contains the **repeal provision** that removes the previously existing regulation. It typically states something like:
  > "Section [X] of the [Name of the Act or Regulation] is hereby repealed."

- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant.
  - They have been superseded by a new regulation or amendment.
  - They conflict with current legislation.
  - They were found to be ineffective or unnecessarily restrictive.

- **Legal Implications**:
  - Any provisions previously contained in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
  - Entities, individuals, or government bodies that previously relied on the regulation must now follow the current, applicable rules.
  - Legal or administrative actions based on the repealed regulation are generally invalid or unenforceable.

SOR/2008-317 is accessible through the Ontario government’s official legislation database (e.g., the *Legislation and Regulations* portal).

### Example (Hypothetical Context):
If the original regulation had been about licensing of small retail businesses, its repeal would mean that the licensing requirements for such businesses are now governed by a different, current regulation—possibly one that has been updated or replaced due to changes in business policy or administrative efficiency.
