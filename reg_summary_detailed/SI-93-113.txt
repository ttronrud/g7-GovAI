### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**. This reflects the constitutional framework in which the Governor General, as the representative of the Crown, exercises executive authority on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

The designation is made **pursuant to Section 2 of the Translation Bureau Act**, which grants the Governor General the power to appoint or designate individuals to act as Ministers for the purposes of the Act. This provision allows for temporary or functional appointments when the regular Minister of Supply and Services is unavailable or when a specific administrative role is required.

---

**2. Designated Individual**  
The individual designated is the **Minister of Supply and Services**. This is a federal cabinet-level position responsible for overseeing public services, including areas such as government procurement, supply chain management, and the delivery of public services across Canada.

The designation specifically states that the Minister of Supply and Services is to act as the **Minister "for the purposes of that Act"** — meaning the role is limited to administrative and functional responsibilities under the Translation Bureau Act.

---

**3. Role and Function**  
As Minister for the purposes of the Translation Bureau Act, the individual is empowered to:
- Exercise all ministerial authority and responsibilities required by the Act;
- Approve or sign official orders, directives, or funding decisions related to the Translation Bureau;
- Represent the federal government in matters concerning the Translation Bureau’s operations, including policy, funding, and service delivery;
- Ensure compliance with the Act’s mandate, which is to provide official translation services for government documents and communications in both official languages (English and French).

Importantly, this designation is **not a permanent or broad ministerial appointment**, but a **specific, limited function** tied to the Translation Bureau Act.

---

**4. Legal and Constitutional Context**  
- The Governor General in Council acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, reflecting the principle of responsible government in Canada.
- The Translation Bureau Act establishes the legal framework for the operation of the Translation Bureau, a federal agency responsible for providing official language translation services to the government.
- This designation ensures continuity and accountability in the governance of the Translation Bureau, even if the Minister of Supply and Services is temporarily absent or otherwise unable to fulfill duties.

---

**5. Significance and Implications**  
- Ensures that the Translation Bureau continues to operate under clear ministerial oversight.
- Maintains the integrity and functionality of official language services in government.
- Demonstrates the flexibility within Canadian administrative law to assign specific duties without requiring a full ministerial reorganization.
- Reinforces the importance of official language rights under the *Official Languages Act* and the broader federal commitment to bilingualism.

---

**6. Duration and Termination**  
While the regulation does not specify a duration, such designations are typically temporary and remain in effect until:
- The regular Minister of Supply and Services resumes duties;
- A new designation is made by the Governor General in Council;
- The circumstances requiring the interim appointment are resolved.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation is a concise but significant administrative action that ensures the **Translation Bureau Act** remains operational through the appointment of a designated minister. It reflects the practical application of federal statutory authority to maintain continuity in public service delivery, particularly in the area of official language services. The designation is limited in scope and duration, serving a functional purpose within the broader framework of Canadian governance and bilingualism policy.
