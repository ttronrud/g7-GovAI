**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 1**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
This regulation is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 29(1)(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**. It is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This means the order is a formal, legally binding instrument issued at the federal level, authorized by statute and in accordance with established procedures for land use and employee land acquisition in Canadian territories.

The order is officially titled:  
**"Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 1"**  
and serves as a statutory instrument that grants specific land rights to designated employees of the Government of Canada.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this order is to **authorize certain government employees** to acquire **interests in territorial lands** located in the **Northwest Territories (NWT)**. These acquisitions are not for general development or commercial purposes but are specifically intended to support the personal or professional needs of employees—such as housing, remote work, or operational requirements—within the NWT.

The acquisitions are limited in scope and are strictly defined by the land descriptions, intended use, and specific reservations.

### **3. Scope and Applicability**
The Order applies only to:
- **Specific employees** of the Government of Canada,
- **Specific parcels of land** located in the Northwest Territories,
- As described in the **Schedule** attached to the Order (which is not included in the provided text but is referenced as part of the official document).

The rights granted are **limited and conditional**, and do not confer ownership or control over all rights in the land.

  - The right to **work or exploit** such minerals is **excluded** from the assignment.

### **5. Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Limited Government Land Use**: This Order reflects a narrow, targeted use of federal land policy—allowing employees to access land for personal or professional purposes (e.g., housing, operational needs) without broad land development.
- **Mineral Rights Retention**: A consistent and critical feature of the Order is the **explicit reservation of all mineral rights**. This is a standard practice in Canadian territorial land laws, ensuring that:
  - The federal government (or Crown) maintains control over natural resources.
  - Future exploration or extraction activities are not precluded by individual employee land interests.
- **Public Accountability**: The Order is issued through a formal, transparent process involving the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, ensuring alignment with federal land management policies and Indigenous and territorial interests.
- **Compliance with Territorial Lands Act**: The use of paragraph 29(1)(a) demonstrates that the acquisition is within the legal framework allowing for employee land rights under specific conditions.

### **6. Citation and Reference**
- The Order may be cited as:  
  **Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 1**  
- It is a standalone statutory instrument and is referenced by its number and year for legal and administrative purposes.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
This Order is a **targeted, legally sound, and constitutionally compliant** mechanism that allows specific federal employees in the Northwest Territories to acquire or lease land for personal or professional use. However, it does so under strict conditions:
- The land is limited in scope and description,
- The employees do not gain ownership of mineral rights,
- The federal government retains full control over natural resources.

It exemplifies how federal land policy balances the practical needs of government employees with the broader public interest in resource stewardship and territorial governance.

**Note**: While the Order is dated 1994, it remains valid as a legal instrument unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation. Its provisions are still relevant in the context of land use and employee rights in the NWT.
