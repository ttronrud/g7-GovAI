### **Detailed Summary of the Technical Assistance Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 24)**

These regulations, officially titled the **Technical Assistance Regulations**, were introduced by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs and the Treasury Board, under **External Affairs Vote 40 of Appropriation Act No. 2, 1985–86**. They revoked the earlier Technical Assistance Regulations made by Order in Council P.C. 1978-1268 and replaced them with a comprehensive, updated framework governing financial support and benefits provided to individuals participating in technical assistance programs administered by the **Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)**.

The regulations establish clear guidelines for the payment of travel, living, educational, medical, and other related expenses to various categories of personnel involved in international development programs — including **cooperants**, **fellows**, and **members of technical missions** — and define the conditions under which such payments are authorized.

## **1. Key Definitions**

The regulations begin with a series of precise definitions that clarify key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **CIDA** | The Canadian International Development Agency, responsible for administering technical assistance programs. |
| **Common-law partner** | A person who cohabits with an individual in a conjugal relationship for at least one year. This definition is aligned with the **Treasury Board’s Foreign Service Directives** and the 2002 Memorandum of Understanding on the definition of spouse. |
