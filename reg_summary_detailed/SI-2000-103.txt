**Detailed Summary of the Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation (GST) Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to make orders that are in the public interest, particularly when they relate to financial administration and the implementation of self-government agreements with First Nations.

The Order specifically applies to the **Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation (LS/C First Nation)** and is directly tied to their **Self-Government Agreement**, which was signed on **July 21, 1997**, and formally updated on **November 2, 2000**. This agreement established the framework for the First Nation’s autonomy in areas such as taxation, governance, and financial management.

**2. Definitions**

The Order includes two key definitions that apply within its scope:

- **"Agreement"** refers to the *Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation Self-Government Agreement*, as it existed on **November 2, 2000**. This means the Order is based on the final, legally binding version of the agreement after any amendments or clarifications made prior to that date.

- **"Person"** is defined to have the same meaning as in **subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act**. This definition typically includes individuals or entities that are legally recognized as taxpayers under Canadian tax law — such as individuals, corporations, or other legal persons — and ensures consistency in how "person" is interpreted in tax-related contexts.

**3. Purpose and Scope of the Remission**

The core purpose of this Order is to **remit (forgive or refund) certain Goods and Services Tax (GST)** that was paid by eligible persons during a specific period.

- **Tax Remitted**:  
  The Order grants a remission of **GST** paid by a "person" under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.

- **Time Period Covered**:  
  The remission applies to GST paid between **October 1, 1997**, and **October 31, 2000** — a four-year period that coincides with the early years of the Self-Government Agreement.

- **Scope of Remission**:  
  The remission is limited to the **amounts and conditions specified in Sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**. These sections outline the specific circumstances under which the First Nation may be allowed to manage or exempt itself from certain tax obligations, including GST. This ensures that the remission is not arbitrary but is directly linked to the terms agreed upon in the self-government framework.

**4. Key Condition: Exclusion of Refund Under Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**

A critical condition of this remission is that:

> *No refund of the remitted tax shall be payable under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act.*

This means that:
- The remission is **not a general refund** or a re-payment of taxes.
- It is a **specific, pre-authorized exemption** under the self-government agreement.
- The government has **explicitly excluded** any possibility of a refund being processed through the standard refund mechanism in the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act. This prevents duplication or potential conflict between different tax and self-government frameworks.

---

**5. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on **November 2, 2000** — the same date on which the Self-Government Agreement was finalized and officially updated. This timing ensures that the remission is implemented in alignment with the agreement’s formal adoption and legal recognition.

---

**6. Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council asserts that the remission is in the **public interest**. This implies that the decision was made to:
- Support the financial self-sufficiency and autonomy of the Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation,
- Promote equitable treatment under self-government arrangements,
- Encourage the effective implementation of the Self-Government Agreement by reducing financial barriers,
- Recognize the historical and ongoing contributions of the First Nation to the Yukon region.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- This Order is a **key example of federal recognition of Indigenous self-governance** through financial mechanisms.
- It reflects a shift from traditional top-down tax administration to **decentralized, negotiated tax arrangements** between the federal government and First Nations.
- It sets a precedent for future self-government tax remissions or exemptions in other First Nation communities.
- It underscores the importance of **specific, legally binding agreements** in determining tax responsibilities and exemptions.

**Conclusion**

The *Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation (GST) Remission Order* is a targeted, legally grounded financial relief measure that allows the First Nation to recover GST paid between October 1, 1997, and October 31, 2000, under the terms of their Self-Government Agreement. The remission is conditional, limited to specific sections of the agreement, and explicitly excludes any further refund under the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act. By coming into force on November 2, 2000 — the date of the agreement’s finalization — the Order is both timely and legally consistent, reinforcing the principles of self-determination and financial autonomy in Indigenous governance.

This regulation exemplifies how federal policy can support Indigenous self-government through practical, equitable financial arrangements.
