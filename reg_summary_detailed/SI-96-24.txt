The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2017-56" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 56 of 2017 has been formally repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter of the regulation), a detailed summary cannot be provided. Statutory instruments are typically issued under the authority of an Act of Parliament and often deal with specific administrative, regulatory, or operational matters (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, health and safety, or financial regulations).

In this case:

- **"Repealed"** means the regulation is no longer in force.
- **"SI/2017-56"** refers to the 56th Statutory Instrument passed in the year 2017 in the jurisdiction (likely the United Kingdom, given the format of SI numbers).
- The repeal of an SI usually occurs when a new regulation is introduced that supersedes or replaces the previous one, or when it is deemed outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current law.

To provide a detailed summary, we would need the full title of the repealed regulation (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2017 (SI 2017/56)") and its original content. For example, if it had been the "Regulation of Medical Devices (Amendment) Regulations 2017," the summary would detail the provisions it introduced and how they were replaced.

**Conclusion:**  
As currently provided, the only verifiable information is that SI/2017/56 has been repealed. A detailed summary of its content, purpose, or provisions cannot be delivered without the full title or original text of the regulation.

If you can provide the full title or subject of the regulation (e.g., "The Food Hygiene Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/56)"), I would be happy to offer a detailed summary.
