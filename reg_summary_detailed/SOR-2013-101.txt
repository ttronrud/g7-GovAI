**Detailed Summary of the Administrative Monetary Penalties (Consumer Products) Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Administrative Monetary Penalties (Consumer Products) Regulations* are a set of rules issued under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)* by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. These regulations establish the framework for imposing and collecting monetary penalties for violations of consumer product safety standards in Canada.

These regulations provide detailed provisions on:
- The classification of violations (minor, serious, very serious),
- The calculation of penalties based on gravity factors,
- The amount and timing of penalty payments,
- Procedures for compliance agreements, reviews, and appeals,
- Delivery and service requirements for notices and documents,
- Special provisions for non-commercial entities and review decisions.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* (CCPSA), the primary legislation governing consumer product safety in Canada.

2. **Compliance Agreement**: A formal agreement under paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Act that allows a violator to avoid penalties by correcting the violation and meeting specific conditions.

3. **Violation**: A breach of a provision under Section 49 of the CCPSA. This is the central basis for penalty imposition.

### **Classification of Violations Based on Gravity Factors**

Violations are categorized into three levels based on their **total gravity factor**, which determines the severity of the penalty:

| Gravity Level | Total Gravity Factor | Description |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Minor** | 2 | Less severe violations; lower penalties apply. |
| **Serious** | 3 or 4 | Moderate to significant breaches; higher penalties. |
| **Very Serious** | 5 | Severe violations with substantial risk to public health or safety; highest penalties. |

#### **How the Total Gravity Factor is Calculated**

The total gravity factor is the **sum of two components**:

- **Column 2 of Table 1**: Matches the **description of the violation** (e.g., failure to label, improper testing).
- **Column 3 of Table 2**: Matches the **specific provision of the Act** that was violated (e.g., section 21, 23, etc.).

> Example: A violation involving failure to meet labeling requirements under Section 21 (gravity factor = 2) and a failure to conduct safety testing under Section 23 (gravity factor = 3) would result in a total gravity factor of **5**, classifying it as "very serious."

#### **Important Notes on Gravity Factors**
- The **short-form descriptions** used in Table 1 are established by the Minister under paragraph 51(b) of the Act.
- These descriptions are **provided here for convenience only** and **do not form part of the Regulations**.
- They may be **amended by the Minister without requiring amendment to these Regulations**.
- If a **review under Section 35** of the Act leads the review officer to conclude that the violation should have been addressed under a different provision, the gravity factor calculation must be **revised accordingly**.

### **Penalty Amounts**

The penalty amount depends on:
1. The **total gravity factor** of the violation.
2. Whether the violation was committed by:
   - A **non-profit organization** or **for non-commercial purposes** → applies the **lower penalty** (Column 2).
   - Any **other person** (including for-profit businesses or commercial activities) → applies the **higher penalty** (Column 3).

> The penalties are set out in a table corresponding to the gravity factor (e.g., for a gravity factor of 2, the penalties are $500 and $1,000 respectively).

---

### **Complete Satisfaction of Penalty: Lesser Amount**

Under paragraph 52(1)(e) of the Act, a person may pay **half the penalty amount** as "complete satisfaction" if they meet certain conditions.

#### **Conditions to Pay the Lesser Amount (Half the Penalty)**

A person wishing to pay half the penalty must do so **within 15 days** of receiving the notice of violation using one of the following methods:

1. **In person** at the address specified in the notice.
2. **By regular mail** with a postmark no later than 15 days after the notice is issued.
3. **By a mail or courier service** that provides a **document specifying the date of sending** (e.g., tracking receipt), delivered within 15 days.

> This option is available only for **complete satisfaction** of the penalty.

---

### **Full Penalty Payment**

If the person chooses to pay the **full penalty amount**, they must do so within **30 days** of receiving the notice using one of the following methods:

1. **In person**.
2. **By regular mail** with a postmark within 30 days.
3. **By a mail or courier service** with a **delivery date confirmation** within 30 days.

> All payments must be made via:
- A **certified cheque** or **bank draft**.
- Made payable to the **Receiver General for Canada**.
- Sent or delivered to the **address specified in the notice of violation**.

---

### **Compliance Agreement Requests**

A request to enter into a **compliance agreement** (under paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Act) must be submitted in writing within **15 days** of receiving the notice of violation.

#### **Submission Methods**:
1. Delivered in person.
2. Sent by regular mail with a postmark within 15 days.
3. Sent via a mail or courier service with a **document specifying the date of sending** within 15 days.

> A compliance agreement allows the violator to avoid penalties by correcting the violation and complying with corrective actions.

---

### **Double Penalty Payments (e.g., under Section 54(4)(a))**

If a person is liable to pay **twice the penalty amount** (e.g., due to a repeat offense or failure to comply with a notice of default), the payment must be made:

- Within **15 days** of receiving the notice of default (instead of 30 days),
- Using the same methods as for full penalty payments (certified cheque/bank draft),
- In accordance with subsection 5(4) of the Act (which likely includes requirements for documentation and proof of payment).

---

### **Payment After Minister’s Refusal of Compliance Agreement (Section 55(1))**

If the Minister refuses a request for a compliance agreement, the person must pay the penalty amount:

- Within **15 days** of receiving the written notice of refusal,
- Using the same payment methods as above (certified cheque or bank draft),
- In accordance with subsection 5(4).

### **Review Request by the Minister (Section 53(2)(b))**

A person may request a **review by the Minister** of a penalty decision under Section 53(2)(b) of the Act.

#### **Submission Requirements**:
- Must be submitted in writing within **30 days** of receiving the notice.
- Methods:
  1. In person.
  2. By regular mail with postmark within 30 days.
  3. By courier with delivery date confirmation within 30 days.

> This provides a formal appeal process to challenge the penalty decision.

### **Payment After Review Decision (Section 56(3))**

If the Minister’s review results in a **confirmed or corrected penalty amount**, the person must pay the revised amount:

- Within **30 days** of receiving the notice of the decision,
- Using the same payment methods as for full penalties,
- In accordance with subsection 5(4).

> This ensures that any corrected penalty is paid in a timely manner.

These regulations establish rules for how documents (e.g., notices, requests, decisions) must be delivered to individuals or organizations.

#### **For Individuals (not the Minister)**:

### **Effective Date**

These Regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** with the Canada Gazette.

### **Key Policy Implications and Objectives**

1. **Proportionality**: Penalties are tiered based on the severity of the violation (gravity factor), ensuring that penalties are proportionate to the risk to public safety.

2. **Flexibility for Non-Commercial Entities**: Non-profit or non-commercial organizations are treated more leniently, reflecting the lower risk associated with such activities.

3. **Enforcement Efficiency**: Clear timelines and methods for payment and submission ensure accountability and reduce administrative delays.

4. **Appeal and Compliance Pathways**: The inclusion of compliance agreements and review rights provides a pathway for voluntary correction and fair dispute resolution.

5. **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement for delivery confirmation and certified payments enhances transparency and reduces the risk of non-compliance or disputes.

6. **
