### **Detailed Summary of the Asbestos Mines and Mills Release Regulations (1989)**

The **Asbestos Mines and Mills Release Regulations**, established under **section 34(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)*, supersede the previous *Asbestos Mining and Milling National Emission Standards Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 405). These regulations were published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on April 29, 1989, and came into force as a result of a formal revocation and replacement decision by the Governor in Council.

This summary provides a comprehensive, structured analysis of the regulation’s purpose, key definitions, emission standards, monitoring requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and reporting obligations.

## **I. Background and Legal Basis**

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The regulation was enacted pursuant to **subsection 48(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act* (CEPA), which allows the Minister of the Environment to propose new or revised environmental regulations.  
  The Governor in Council (via the Crown) approved the regulation under **subsection 34(1)** of CEPA, after confirming that:
  - The proposed standards do **not conflict** with other federal or provincial environmental laws.
  - The regulation addresses a distinct and significant environmental issue — the release of asbestos fibres into ambient air from mining and milling operations.

- **Policy Objective**:  
  To **limit the emission of hazardous asbestos fibres** into the ambient air from asbestos mines and mills, thereby protecting public health and the environment from exposure to known carcinogenic materials.

- **Decision Process**:  
  The federal government consulted with the **federal-provincial advisory committee** under **section 6** of CEPA, ensuring stakeholder input before finalizing the regulation.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The regulation establishes precise definitions essential to interpreting and enforcing its provisions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Ambient air** | The atmosphere surrounding the Earth, excluding enclosed spaces (e.g., inside buildings or underground shafts). |
| **Asbestos fibre** | A fibre with a length **greater than 5 microns** and a **length-to-breadth ratio of 3:1 or greater**. This definition ensures only the most hazardous, respirable fibres are regulated. |
| **Dry** | Refers to a condition without uncombined water (i.e., not humidified). |
| **Undiluted** | Means the gas sample is not mixed with other gases beyond what is necessary for processing (e.g., no blending with ambient air). |
| **Mine or mill** | Refers to any facility engaged in asbestos mining or processing (crushing, drying, milling, storage, drilling). |
| **Normal cubic centimetre (norm. cm³)** | One cm³ of gas at **25°C** and **760 mmHg pressure** (standard reference conditions). |
| **Normal cubic metre (norm. m³)** | One m³ of gas under the same standard conditions. |
| **Qualified person** | An individual with sufficient **knowledge, training, and experience** to accurately count asbestos fibres in samples. Two independent counts are required per sample. |

These definitions ensure consistency, scientific rigor, and clarity in measurement and compliance.

## **III. Emission Limits**

The core environmental standard sets a **maximum allowable concentration** of asbestos fibres in gases released into ambient air.

### **General Limitation (Section 3(1))**
> The concentration of asbestos fibres in gases released from the following operations **shall not exceed 2 fibres per normal cubic centimetre (norm. cm³)**:

1. **Crushing, drying, or milling operations**  
2. **Dry rock storage**  
3. **Primary dry drilling operations in an open pit**

This limit applies **only to the actual emissions** from these specific processes.

### **Measurement Requirements (Section 3(2)–(6))**

The concentration must be measured under strict conditions to ensure accuracy and consistency:

| Method | Conditions |
|-------|------------|
| **Method S.1** (used for crushing, drying, milling) | - **Three** release measurements<br>- Each measurement must occur during a **minimum 30-minute continuous operational period**<br>- Fibres on each filter counted by **two qualified persons** (one counts odd sectors, one even)<br>- Final concentration = **arithmetic average of three measurements** (each based on average of two counts) |
| **Method S.2** (used for dry rock storage) | - **One** release measurement<br>- Fibres counted by two qualified persons (odd/even sectors)<br>- Final concentration = **arithmetic average of two counts** |
| **Method S.3** (used for primary dry drilling) | - **Three** release measurements<br>- Each during a period of **continuous active drilling**<br>- Counted by two qualified persons<br>- Final concentration = **arithmetic average of three measurements** |

> All measurements must be **dry and undiluted**, conducted under **normal operating conditions**, and in accordance with the **Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing** (EPS-1-AP-75-1 and EPS-1-AP-75-1A), as amended.

## **IV. Exceptions for Equipment Malfunctions or Breakdowns**

Despite the strict emission limits, the regulation includes **limited exceptions** for temporary operational failures:

| Operation | Exception Duration |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Single malfunction or breakdown** | Up to **30 minutes** |
| **Crushing, milling, or dry rock storage** | Up to **1 hour per month** (total) |
| **Drying operations** | Up to **2 hours per month** (total) |

> **Important Notes**:
- The exception applies **only if** the malfunction is due to a failure in **air pollution control equipment** or **process equipment**.
- The operator must **immediately report** the incident and provide detailed information (see Section 5).
- Exceeding the limit during such events is **not a violation** if the incident is properly documented and falls within the allowed timeframes.

---

## **V. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements**

The regulation mandates **regular reporting and sampling** to ensure ongoing compliance and accountability.

### **1. Reporting to the Minister (Section 5)**

The operator must submit reports when requested by the Minister. The types of reports include:

#### **(a) Mine or Mill Release Measurement Report (Schedule I)**  
- Required when the Minister requests information on **operation**.
- Must be submitted **within 60 days** of the request.
- Must cover **samples taken during the 60 days prior to submission**.
- **Submission intervals**:
  - **Six months** for **milling operations**
  - **Twelve months** for **crushing, drying, dry rock storage, and primary dry drilling**
- Intervals begin **three months after the Minister's request**.
- Samples must be collected using the **applicable method** (S.1, S.2, or S.3).
- Can be conducted **in the presence of an enforcement officer** (at Minister’s request).

#### **(b) Malfunction or Breakdown Report (Schedule II)**

## **VI. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of the Environment** has the authority to:
  - Request data, samples, or reports.
  - Inspect facilities.
  - Require sampling in the presence of an enforcement officer.
- Operators are responsible for:
  - Maintaining accurate records.
  - Ensuring equipment is properly maintained.
  - Reporting all malfunctions promptly.
- Failure to comply with reporting obligations or emission limits may result in penalties under CEPA.

## **VII. Purpose and Significance**

This regulation represents a **critical step in environmental protection** by:

1. **Setting a scientifically grounded limit** on asbestos fibre emissions — specifically targeting the most hazardous, respirable fibres.
2. **Establishing clear, measurable, and enforceable standards** for emissions from key industrial processes.
3. **Providing flexibility** for rare, unavoidable equipment failures without compromising public health.
4. **Ensuring transparency and accountability** through mandatory, periodic reporting and independent verification by qualified personnel.
5. **Supporting long-term environmental and public health goals** by reducing exposure to asbestos, a known cause of mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis.
