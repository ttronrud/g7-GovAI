**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Exemption from Restrictions on Investments (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations*

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **paragraphs 396(a)a and (b)a** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCAA).

**Statutory Basis:**  
- **Section 314 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**  
- **S.C. 1991, c. 48** (original enactment of the CCAA)

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation establishes a **specific exemption** from certain investment restrictions that would otherwise apply to cooperative credit associations (CCAs) under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. It removes the application of specific provisions that would normally limit or restrict a CCA’s ability to acquire a substantial investment in another entity.

### Key Provisions and Interpretation:

#### 1. **Exemption from Subsection Application**  
For the purposes of **subparagraph 390(3)(d)(ii)** of the CCAA, the following provisions **do not apply** when determining whether a cooperative credit association (CCA) is permitted to acquire a substantial investment in another entity:

- **Subsections 390(4) to (6)** of the CCAA.

> This means that the usual restrictions—such as those related to the ownership or control of other financial institutions or entities—**do not trigger** when assessing whether a CCA is allowed to make a substantial investment under:
> - Subsection **388(2)** (investment in an entity)
> - Paragraphs **388(3)(b)** or **(c)** (specific types of investments)
> - Subsection **388(4)** (investment in certain financial institutions)
> - Subsections **390(1)** or **(2)** (general investment limitations)

#### 2. **Scope of the Exemption**  
The exemption applies specifically to **determining whether a CCA is permitted to acquire a substantial investment** in another entity. It does **not**:
- Remove all restrictions on investments.
- Allow unlimited or unregulated investments.
- Apply to all types of financial institutions or entities.

Rather, it **exempts** the CCA from the application of the detailed restrictions found in sections 390(4) to (6), which typically impose conditions on the size, nature, or type of investments a CCA can make (e.g., limits on ownership in other credit associations or financial institutions).

This exemption simplifies and streamlines the investment approval process for CCAs in certain cases, allowing them greater flexibility in forming strategic or operational partnerships or investments—provided the investment remains within the scope of the Act and does not violate other regulatory requirements.

#### 3. **Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on the day that **paragraphs 396(a) and (b)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* come into force.

> This date is established by **Section 314 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**, which enacted the amendment to the CCAA.

> **Note:** The regulations were issued on **October 24, 2001**, and are listed in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada, 2001* (SI/2001-102).

### Regulatory Impact and Significance:

- **Enhanced Flexibility for CCAs:**  
  This regulation provides cooperative credit associations with greater operational flexibility in investing in other entities—such as subsidiaries, joint ventures, or affiliated institutions—without being constrained by the usual ownership or control limitations.

- **Alignment with Financial Stability and Consumer Protection Goals:**  
  While allowing more investment freedom, the exemption is contained within the broader regulatory framework of the CCAA, which still ensures that CCAs maintain their cooperative and consumer-focused mission. The restrictions are only waived in specific, well-defined circumstances.

- **Support for Cooperative Growth and Innovation:**  
  The exemption supports the development of cooperative financial models by enabling CCAs to expand their services through strategic investments, potentially improving access to credit and financial services for members.

- **No Automatic Waiver of Other Restrictions:**  
  The exemption is **not a blanket removal** of all investment rules. Other provisions of the Act (e.g., capital adequacy, governance, risk management) still apply. The exemption only removes the specific restrictions in sections 390(4) to (6) in the context of evaluating whether a substantial investment is permissible under subsections 388(2), (3), or (4), or under sections 390(1) or (2).

### Conclusion:

This regulation is a targeted, legally grounded exemption that **removes specific investment restrictions** from the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, allowing CCAs to pursue substantial investments in other entities under certain conditions—without triggering the usual limitations on ownership or control. It reflects a policy intent to support cooperative financial institutions in expanding their service offerings and strengthening their financial resilience, while maintaining oversight and consumer protection standards.
