**Detailed Summary of the Northwest Territories Mining District and Nunavut Mining District Order**

---

### **Regulatory Basis and Authority**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 23(g)a of the Territorial Lands Act** (T.L.A.), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to establish mining districts within the territories of Canada. The regulation formally divides the territorial lands of the **Northwest Territories (NWT)** and **Nunavut** into two distinct mining districts for administrative, regulatory, and resource management purposes.

The legal basis for the Order is found in **S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 144(1), Sch. VII, s. 50(1)** — a statutory provision that authorizes the creation of mining districts to facilitate the regulation of mineral exploration and development.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Provide a clear, legally defined administrative structure for mineral resource management in the Canadian Arctic territories.
- Establish jurisdictional boundaries for mining activities in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
- Enable the federal government (via the Department of Natural Resources or its successor) to regulate, license, and oversee mining operations within these designated districts.
- Support the development of a consistent and transparent framework for mineral rights, environmental assessments, and Indigenous engagement in mining activities.

### **Division of Territorial Lands into Two Mining Districts**

The Order divides the territorial lands of Canada north of the 60th parallel of north latitude into two distinct mining districts:

#### 1. **Northwest Territories Mining District**
- Comprises the area described in **Schedule 1** of the Order.
- Schedule 1 defines the geographic boundaries of the NWT Mining District in precise legal and geographic terms (e.g., based on latitude, longitude, and natural features such as rivers, lakes, or mountain ranges).
- This district includes most of the traditional territory of the Northwest Territories, excluding areas that have been transferred to Nunavut or are otherwise governed under different administrative frameworks.

#### 2. **Nunavut Mining District**
- Comprises the area described in **Schedule 2** of the Order.
- Schedule 2 outlines the boundaries of the Nunavut Mining District, which includes parts of Nunavut and certain adjacent regions north of the 60th parallel.
- This district is designed to reflect the unique geographical and cultural context of Nunavut, ensuring that mining regulations and policies are appropriately tailored to the region.

> **Note**: The boundaries in Schedules 1 and 2 are legally binding and serve as the foundation for all future mining applications, land use planning, and regulatory decisions in these areas.

### **Repeal Clause: Clarification of Excluded Areas**

The Order includes a **repeal clause** that explicitly identifies areas that are **excluded** from the new mining districts and thus fall outside the scope of this Order. These areas are:

#### **Excluded from the Nunavut Mining District:**
- All land **north of the 60th parallel of north latitude** and **west of the boundary described in Schedule I to the Nunavut Act**, **but not within the Yukon Territory**.
  - This means that certain areas in the western part of the Arctic (e.g., parts of the Yukon or northern British Columbia) are excluded from the Nunavut Mining District and may fall under other jurisdictional frameworks.
  - Importantly, this exclusion ensures that the mining district boundaries do not extend into areas already governed by other territorial or provincial laws.

#### **Excluded from the Northwest Territories Mining District:**
- All land **north of the 60th parallel of north latitude** and **east of the western boundary of Nunavut** (as defined in Schedule I to the Nunavut Act), **but not within Quebec or Newfoundland**.
  - This clause ensures that certain eastern Arctic regions (e.g., areas near the eastern edge of Nunavut) are not included in the NWT Mining District, as they are either within or adjacent to Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador.
  - It prevents overlap or ambiguity in jurisdictional boundaries.

#### **Excluded from the Mining Districts (Island Areas):**
- The **islands in Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Ungava Bay** that are **not within Manitoba, Ontario, or Quebec**.
  - These islands (e.g., parts of Baffin Island, the Qikiqtaaluk region, or islands in the eastern Canadian Arctic) are explicitly excluded from both mining districts.
  - This exclusion likely reflects:
    - Provinces' existing jurisdiction over these areas.
    - The fact that these islands are primarily inhabited by Inuit communities and may be subject to different governance, land claims, or Indigenous rights frameworks.
    - The need to avoid overlapping mining regulations with provincial or Indigenous land rights.

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Jurisdictional Clarity**  
   The Order provides legal clarity on where mining activities are permitted and regulated, reducing ambiguity in land use and development planning.

2. **Support for Indigenous Governance**  
   By clearly demarcating areas, the Order enables better coordination with Indigenous governments and communities, particularly in Nunavut, where Inuit self-governance and land claims are central to policy.

3. **Environmental and Cultural Protection**  
   The exclusion of ecologically sensitive or culturally significant areas (such as islands in Hudson Bay or James Bay) helps protect biodiversity and traditional Inuit lands.

4. **Legal Foundation for Future Mining Activity**  
   The defined boundaries serve as the basis for:
   - Issuing mining permits.
   - Conducting environmental assessments.
   - Engaging with Indigenous stakeholders.
   - Applying federal and territorial environmental and land-use laws.

5. **Administrative Efficiency**  
   By separating the NWT and Nunavut into distinct districts, the federal government can tailor policies and regulations to the specific needs, geographies, and socio-political contexts of each region.

### **Conclusion**

The **Northwest Territories Mining District and Nunavut Mining District Order** (S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 144(1), Sch. VII, s. 50(1)) is a foundational regulatory instrument that legally establishes two distinct mining districts in Canada’s Arctic territories. It creates a clear, enforceable boundary system for mineral resource development while respecting existing provincial boundaries, Indigenous land rights, and environmental considerations. The Order reflects a balanced approach to resource development and territorial governance, ensuring that mining activities proceed within a framework that is both legally sound and socially responsible.

This regulation remains in force as a key component of Canada’s land and resource management policy in the Arctic, and its boundaries continue to inform policy decisions related to mining, environmental protection, and Indigenous engagement.
