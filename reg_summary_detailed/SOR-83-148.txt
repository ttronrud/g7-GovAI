**Detailed Summary of the Special Status Order, 1983**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Special Status Order, 1983* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act* (COCD Act), specifically pursuant to **subsection 45(6)** of that Act. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources—to declare certain persons as having a "special status" for the purposes of determining ownership and control in the context of Canadian resource and energy enterprises.

The Order was formally made on **March 1, 1983**, and is cited as *Special Status Order, 1983* (S.C. 1980-81-82, c. 107). It is part of a broader regulatory framework designed to ensure that key energy and resource companies are recognized as having unique roles or characteristics that may affect how ownership and control are assessed under Canadian federal policy, particularly in relation to national interest, strategic importance, or public accountability.

**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **grant a special status** to specific energy and resource-related corporations. This designation serves several key functions:

1. **Exemption from Standard Ownership and Control Rules**: Entities declared to have "special status" may be exempt from the usual application of ownership and control determinations that would otherwise apply under the COCD Act. This allows for more nuanced assessments of control, particularly when the company operates under public or strategic mandates.

2. **Recognition of Public or Strategic Role**: The declaration acknowledges that these companies play a significant role in Canada’s energy infrastructure, economic development, or national resource strategy. Their special status reflects their importance beyond typical private-sector operations.

3. **Facilitation of Policy and Regulatory Oversight**: By formally recognizing these entities as having special status, the federal government can more effectively manage and regulate their activities, especially in areas involving national security, energy supply, or economic development.

4. **Clarity in Determination Processes**: The Order provides clear, legally binding identification of which entities are subject to special treatment in ownership and control determinations, reducing ambiguity in administrative and judicial processes.

**Implications and Context**  
- This Order was enacted during a period of significant energy development and policy reform in Canada (late 1970s to early 1980s), when federal oversight of energy ownership and control was being refined.  
- The declaration of special status helps align these companies with broader national energy policy goals, including energy security, regional development, and public accountability.  
- It may also influence how these entities are treated in cross-border transactions, mergers, or foreign investment scenarios—particularly where ownership thresholds or control assessments are required.  
- The recognition of cooperative and publicly owned entities reflects a growing emphasis on inclusive and community-based energy models in Canada.

---

**Legal Significance**  
By declaring these entities as having "special status," the Order establishes a legal basis for their treatment under the COCD Act that differs from standard private-sector companies. This status may:

- Exclude them from certain ownership thresholds that would otherwise trigger federal scrutiny.  
- Allow for more flexible or tailored assessments of control, especially when the company operates under public mandate or community interest.  
- Provide a basis for judicial or administrative decisions regarding ownership, control, and national interest considerations.

**Conclusion**  
The *Special Status Order, 1983* is a foundational regulatory tool that formally recognizes key Canadian energy and resource corporations as having unique roles in the national energy landscape. By granting them special status under the Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act, the federal government ensures that these entities are appropriately governed, assessed, and integrated into broader policy frameworks related to energy security, economic development, and public interest. The Order remains a reference point in federal energy policy and regulatory practice, particularly in matters involving ownership, control, and strategic investment in the energy sector.

*Note: The COCD Act is primarily used to assess ownership and control in the context of foreign investment or corporate structure, particularly where national security or economic stability is at stake. This Order helps define which entities are exempt or treated differently in such assessments.*
