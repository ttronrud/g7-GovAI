## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Allocation Method Order (2015) – Softwood Lumber Products**

### 📌 **Purpose of the Regulation**
This Order establishes a **transparent, fair, and data-driven method** for allocating monthly export quotas for **softwood lumber products** from **Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan** to the United States.

## 📚 **Core Definitions (Critical for Understanding the Rules)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Exported** | As defined in section 6.4 of the EIPA |
| **Softwood Lumber Products** | Products listed in **item 5104 of Group 5** of the Export Control List (e.g., dimensional lumber, plywood, etc.) |
| **Primary Producer** | A person who produces softwood lumber products from softwood sawlogs. In Quebec, includes those producing Quebec softwood lumber products. |
| **Primary Producer’s Products** | Products produced by a primary producer that are **not remanufactured** in Canada. |
| **Remanufacturer** | A person who remanufactures softwood lumber products (as defined in s.13(1) of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006*). |
| **Remanufacturer’s Products** | Products remanufactured by a remanufacturer and **not further remanufactured** in Canada. |
| **Manitoba / Ontario / Saskatchewan / Quebec Quantity** | The monthly export quota allowed for each province. |
| **Reference Period** | A 36-month period ending on **October 31** of the year **before** the year in which the allocation applies. Example: For 2015 allocations, reference period = January 1, 2011 – October 31, 2014. |

## 📌 **Key Allocation Principles**

### 1. **Relinquishment of Export Allocations**
- A primary producer or remanufacturer may **give up** its export allocation for a given year by **notifying the Minister in writing no later than 21 days before the year begins**.
- This allows companies to voluntarily exit the export market if they choose.

> ⚠️ *Relinquishment removes their share from the pool of available allocations.*

---

### 2. **Transfers of Export Allocations**
A primary producer or remanufacturer may **transfer** part of its monthly export allocation to another entity **only if**:
- The transferred volume includes a **corresponding volume of actual products**, or
- The total volume transferred (including non-product portions) does **not exceed 15%** of the original allocation.

> ✅ This ensures that transfers do not artificially inflate allocations without real product backing.

---

## 📊 **Allocation Methods by Province**

---

### ✅ **Ontario Quantity Allocation**

#### Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Ontario Quantity}}{\text{Total Export Volume (Ontario, excluding relinquished)}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s Export Volume (Ontario)}
\]

- Based on **historical export volume** from Ontario.
- Applies only to primary producers and remanufacturers.

#### Remaining Allocation:
- After initial allocation, the **remainder** is distributed **in order of application receipt**.
- Each applicant receives the amount they request **until the remainder is fully allocated**.
- Applicants must **exhaust their initial allocation** before applying for the remainder.

> 🔁 *This ensures fairness and prevents applicants from gaming the system.*

---

### ✅ **Quebec Quantity Allocation**

Quebec has **two distinct allocation pathways**, depending on the applicant’s history and type:

---

#### A. **For Remanufacturers**
- Allocation is based on **historic export volume** from Quebec.
- Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Quebec Quantity}}{\text{Total Export Volume (Quebec, excluding relinquished)}} \right) \times \text{Remanufacturer’s Export Volume}
\]

> ⚠️ **Minimum Threshold Requirement**:
- The **sum of allocations to all remanufacturers** must be **at least 7.5%** of the total Quebec quantity.
- If not met, a **reserve pool** is created to make up the difference.

---

#### B. **For Primary Producers**
Two possible allocation bases:

1. **Based on Historic Export Volume**  
   Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Primary Producer’s Export Volume (Quebec)}}{\text{Total Export Volume (Primary Producers, based on export volume)}} \right) \times \text{Quebec Quantity}
\]

2. **Based on Historic Production Volume**  
   Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Primary Producer’s Production Volume (Quebec)}}{\text{Total Production Volume (Primary Producers, based on production)}} \right) \times \text{Reserve Pool}
\]

> ⚖️ **Key Rules**:
- A primary producer **must choose one** of the two bases.
- **Maximum Allocation** under the production-based formula: **No more than 40%** of the producer’s average monthly production over a 36-month period (starting January 1 of the 4th year before the allocation year).
- Production data comes from **Quebec Government records**, provided with the producer’s consent.

---

#### 🔍 Reserve Pool (Section 9)
- Created when remanufacturer allocations fall short of the **7.5% minimum**.
- Formula:
\[
\text{Reserve Pool} = \text{Required Additional Volume to Reach 7.5\%}
\]
- This pool is then allocated to primary producers based on **production volume**.

> 📌 **Residual Non-Allocated Quantity** (Section 11)
- After allocating to primary producers, any leftover in the reserve pool is:
\[
\text{Residual} = \text{Reserve Pool} - \text{Total Allocated to Primary Producers}
\]
- This residual is **not distributed** and remains unallocated.

---

#### 🔄 Allocation Based on Historic Export Volume (Primary Producers)
- Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Producer’s Export Volume}}{\text{Total Export Volume (Primary Producers, based on export volume)}} \right) \times \text{Quebec Quantity}
\]

> ✅ This applies only if the producer has a history of exporting to the U.S. from Quebec.

---

### ✅ **Manitoba Quantity Allocation**

- Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Manitoba Quantity}}{\text{Total Export Volume (Manitoba, excluding relinquished)}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s Export Volume}
\]

- **Remaining allocation** distributed in order of application receipt.
- Applicants must **exhaust initial allocation** before applying for remainder.

> 📝 Same structure as Ontario: **proportional to past exports**, then **first-come, first-served** for remainder.

---

### ✅ **Saskatchewan Quantity Allocation**

- Formula:
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Saskatchewan Quantity}}{\text{Total Export Volume (Saskatchewan, excluding relinquished)}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s Export Volume}
\]

- **Remaining allocation** distributed in order of application receipt.
- Applicants must **exhaust initial allocation** before applying for remainder.

> 📝 Identical structure to Manitoba and Ontario.

## 📌 Key Provisions & Implications

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reference Period (36 months)** | Ensures allocations are based on **long-term trends**, not short-term fluctuations. |
| **Historical Data Use** | Relies on **past export and production volumes** to ensure fairness and predictability. |
| **Relinquishment Option** | Allows companies to exit the export market voluntarily, promoting flexibility. |
| **Transfer Rules (15% cap)** | Prevents abuse of allocation systems through artificial transfers. |
| **7.5% Minimum for Remanufacturers** | Ensures **remanufacturers** are not excluded from the market; protects smaller players. |
