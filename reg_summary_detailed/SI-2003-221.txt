**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Control over the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, specifically **paragraph 2(a)** of that Act. This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the power to transfer administrative control and supervision of certain public service entities or functions between different heads of government institutions.

**2. Parties Involved:**  
- **Transferring Party:** The **President of the Treasury Board** (a key figure in the federal government responsible for overseeing the operations and management of the public service).  
- **Receiving Party:** The **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** (a senior official who serves as the principal advisor to the Governor General and oversees certain high-level government functions, including those related to public service governance).  

**3. Subject of Transfer:**  
The transfer concerns the **Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMA)** — a statutory body established to manage and oversee human resources functions within the federal public service. This includes areas such as recruitment, compensation, performance management, training, and workforce planning across federal departments.

**4. Nature of the Transfer:**  
The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of the PSHRMA from the President of the Treasury Board to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada. This means that the latter will now have the authority to:  
- Set policy direction for human resources management in the public service;  
- Oversee the agency’s operations and strategic planning;  
- Approve major decisions related to staffing, workforce development, and human resource strategy;  
- Serve as the presiding officer and chief steward of the agency.

**5. Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. All administrative, policy, and operational responsibilities of the PSHRMA are assumed by the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada from that date onward.

**6. Significance and Implications:**  
- This transfer reflects a broader restructuring of the federal public service to enhance strategic oversight of human resources.  
- It centralizes human resources governance under a higher-level, more strategic leadership structure, aligning HR management more closely with the overall priorities of the federal government.  
- The move strengthens the role of the Queen’s Privy Council as a central body for managing key public service functions, reinforcing its position as a key policy and governance institution.  
- It may also signal a shift toward more integrated and coordinated public service management, reducing silos between departments and centralizing HR policy development.

**7. Legal and Procedural Context:**  
The regulation is formal and binding, issued through a standard constitutional and administrative process. The Governor General in Council acts on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, indicating that the decision is part of a government-wide policy initiative rather than an ad hoc or unilateral action.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within Canada’s federal public service. By transferring control of the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency from the Treasury Board to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, the government established a more centralized, strategic, and accountable framework for managing federal human resources. This change supports greater coherence in workforce policy and aligns HR management more closely with the broader governance and leadership structure of the federal government, effective December 12, 2003.
