### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation designates specific countries and military service agencies as eligible entities for the application of **Tariff Item No. 9810.00.00** under the Canadian *Customs Tariff*.  

Tariff item **9810.00.00** generally refers to **"Other aircraft, not elsewhere specified or included"**, but in this context, the designation is likely applied to **specific types of aircraft or aircraft-related equipment** used by designated countries or military agencies—particularly in the context of **aircraft training, military operations, or government use**—and the regulation establishes a framework for **tariff treatment or exemptions** for such items.

The key purpose of this Order is to **exclude or provide special treatment** for certain aircraft or aircraft components originating from or operated by the listed countries and military agencies, thereby **facilitating trade or reducing tariffs** under specific conditions—possibly to support defense cooperation, international military training, or diplomatic relations.

### **Designated Countries**

The following **22 countries** are designated for the purposes of tariff item 9810.00.00:

- Australia  
- Belgium  
- Denmark

### **Designated Military Service Agencies**

The following **five military or government agencies** are specifically designated for the purposes of tariff item 9810.00.00:

1. **German Air Force Tactical Training Command, Goose Bay, Labrador, Newfoundland**  
   – A German military unit involved in tactical training operations at Goose Bay, a major military installation in Canada.

2. **Post Exchanges – AC & W Sites authorized by the Minister of National Revenue**  
   – Refers to authorized post exchange facilities (commonly used by military personnel) that are approved by the Minister of National Revenue. These may involve the importation of supplies or equipment for military personnel, potentially under special tariff treatment.

3. **Royal Air Force Detachment, Goose Bay, Labrador, Newfoundland**  
   – A UK-based military detachment operating in Canada, involved in training or operational missions.

4. **United States Military Services Agencies at Goose Bay Airport, Labrador, Newfoundland**  
   – U.S. military units stationed at Goose Bay Airport, which is a key U.S.-Canada military training and logistics site.

5. **United States Property Accountability Office, Headquarters ADC Detachment No. 1, Ottawa, Ontario**  
   – A U.S. government agency responsible for property accountability and logistics, operating under the U.S. Army’s ADC (Army Defense Command) structure in Ottawa.

These agencies are recognized as **eligible users or operators** of aircraft or aircraft-related goods under tariff item 9810.00.00. This designation likely allows for **duty-free importation or preferential tariff treatment** of aircraft, spare parts, training equipment, or support systems used by these agencies in Canada.

---

### **Legal and Procedural Context**

- The Order is issued under **paragraph 132(1)(g)** of the *Customs Tariff*, which provides the authority to designate countries or agencies for special tariff treatment.
- The designation is **not automatic**; it requires formal government recommendation by the Minister of Finance and formal approval by the Governor General in Council.
- The regulation is **binding and enforceable** under Canadian customs law.
- It applies specifically to **tariff item 9810.00.00**, which is typically used for aircraft not otherwise classified—so the designation likely applies to aircraft used in **military training, defense, or official government operations**.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Trade Facilitation**:  
   Enables smoother importation of military aircraft or related equipment from designated countries and agencies without facing full customs duties.

2. **Defense and Diplomacy**:  
   Supports Canada’s defense cooperation with allies (e.g., U.S., U.K., Germany) through joint training and operations at shared facilities like Goose Bay.

3. **Operational Efficiency**:  
   Allows military units operating in Canada to import necessary aircraft or training tools under simplified customs procedures.

4. **Exemption from Duties**:  
   Likely results in **zero or reduced tariff obligations** on aircraft or parts used by the designated military agencies or from the listed countries, promoting operational readiness.

5. **Geographic Focus**:  
   The concentration on **Goose Bay, Labrador** and **Ottawa** highlights Canada’s strategic military partnerships and the importance of these locations in North American defense cooperation.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a formal framework under Canadian customs law to provide **special tariff treatment** for aircraft and related equipment originating from **22 designated countries** and operated by **five specific military service agencies**. It enhances international military collaboration, streamlines logistics for allied forces, and supports Canada’s defense and training objectives through simplified customs procedures. The Order came into force on **January 1, 1998**, and remains a key instrument in Canada’s international defense and trade policy.  

**Note:** While the regulation is dated 1997 and effective in 1998, its provisions may still be relevant today in the context of ongoing defense cooperation and international trade in defense-related goods.
