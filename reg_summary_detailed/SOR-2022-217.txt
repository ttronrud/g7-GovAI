**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Threehorn Wartyback (Obliquaria reflexa) Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
October 17, 2022  
**Effective Date:** The day on which the Order is registered (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette)

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Applicability**

This regulation is issued under **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and regulate the critical habitat of listed wildlife species.

- **Applicable Species:** The *Threehorn Wartyback* (*Obliquaria reflexa*), a marine invertebrate species classified as **threatened** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to SARA.
- **Legal Requirement:** Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of this species, meaning that the designation and protection of its critical habitat are legally mandated under the Act.

---

### **2. Background and Justification**

The regulation is grounded in several key factual and procedural elements:

#### a. **Threatened Status and Recovery Strategy**
- The *Threehorn Wartyback* is officially recognized as a **threatened species** under SARA.
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this species has been developed and is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**.
- This recovery strategy includes a detailed description of the **critical habitat** necessary for the survival and recovery of the species.

#### b. **Critical Habitat Designation**
- The critical habitat for *Obliquaria reflexa* has been formally identified and is now legally recognized through this Order.
- The specific geographic areas designated in the Order are based on the scientific findings from the recovery strategy and are now legally protected under SARA.

#### c. **No Conflict with Prohibited Zones**
- The Minister confirms that **no portion** of the critical habitat specified in this Order falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA.
- This provision prohibits the use or development of critical habitat in areas that are **protected under other federal or provincial legislation**, such as certain Indigenous reserves or protected areas. The absence of overlap ensures that this Order does not conflict with existing protections.

#### d. **Indigenous Consultation and Compliance**
- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has determined that the proposed critical habitat designation **may affect lands set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation (band)**.
- In accordance with **subsection 58(7)c** of SARA, the Minister has **consulted** with:
  - The **Minister of Indigenous Services**, and
  - The **specific Indigenous band** whose lands may be affected.
- This consultation is a required procedural step under SARA to ensure that Indigenous rights, interests, and traditional uses are respected and considered in the designation process.

---

### **3. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Formally designate** the specific geographic areas that constitute the **critical habitat** of the *Threehorn Wartyback (Obliquaria reflexa)*.
- Provide **legal protection** to these areas under SARA, ensuring that they are not disturbed, degraded, or developed in ways that would harm the species’ survival or recovery.
- Support the implementation of the species’ recovery strategy by identifying and protecting the essential environmental conditions required for the species to thrive.

---

### **4. Legal Consequences and Enforcement**

- Once registered in the *Canada Gazette*, the Order becomes legally binding.
- Any activity that would **adversely affect** the designated critical habitat (e.g., construction, mining, pollution, or habitat alteration) is prohibited unless authorized under a permit or exception under SARA.
- The designation strengthens the legal framework for species recovery and contributes to Canada’s biodiversity conservation goals.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a formal, legally sound step in the conservation of the *Threehorn Wartyback*, a threatened marine species. It ensures that the specific environmental conditions essential for its survival are protected through a transparent, science-based, and Indigenous-informed process. By designating its critical habitat and complying with all procedural and legal requirements of SARA—including consultation with Indigenous communities—the Order advances both ecological protection and the principles of equity and partnership in environmental governance.

This action reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the full implementation of the *Species at Risk Act* in a manner that respects Indigenous rights and ecological integrity.
