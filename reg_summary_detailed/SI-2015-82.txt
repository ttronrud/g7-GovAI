## 🔧 **Major Amendments to the Convention**

The protocol introduces **significant changes** across several articles. Below is a **structured breakdown** of each major amendment with explanations.

---

### 1. **Article 3 – Definition of Key Terms**

#### ✅ Changes:
- **New Definition of "Person"**  
  → Replaces the old definition to include:
  - Individuals
  - Trusts
  - Companies
  - Partnerships
  - Any other body of persons  
  *(Expands the scope to cover modern legal entities, especially trusts and partnerships, which are common in cross-border investments.)*

- **Definition of "Competent Authority"**  
  → Clarifies who has authority to administer the convention:
  - **Canada**: Minister of National Revenue or their authorized representative  
  - **UK**: Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or their authorized representative  
  *(Improves administrative clarity and coordination between tax authorities.)*

- **New Subparagraph: "International Traffic"**  
  → Defines international traffic as:
  > "any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State."  
  *(Introduces a new concept to distinguish between intra- and inter-state transport operations, important for determining where profits from carriage are taxed.)*

### 2. **Article 4 – Definition of "Resident"**

#### ✅ Revised Definition:
> "Resident of a Contracting State means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to taxation therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management, place of incorporation or any other criterion of a similar nature. This term also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of that State, subdivision or local authority. But this term does not include any person who is liable to tax in that Contracting State in respect only of income from sources therein."

#### 🔍 Key Implications:
- Broadens the definition of "resident" to include entities like municipalities and government agencies.
- Explicitly **excludes persons taxed only on income from sources within the country** — preventing double taxation on passive income from domestic sources.
- Provides a more precise framework for determining residency, especially for individuals and entities with complex structures.

### 3. **Article 7 – Profits from Permanent Establishments (PEs)**

#### ✅ Major Revisions:
- **Replaces the original Article 7** with a more detailed and fairer approach to allocating profits.

#### Key Provisions:
- Profits are taxable **only in the state where the enterprise is headquartered**, **unless** it operates through a permanent establishment (PE) in the other country.
- The profits attributable to the PE are determined using the **"arm’s length" and "economic substance" test**:
  > "the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise."

- **Double taxation elimination clause**:
  > If one country taxes profits attributable to a PE, the other country must make an appropriate adjustment to avoid double taxation.

- **Exception for income dealt with separately**:
  > Where income is covered under other Articles (e.g., royalties, interest), those Articles remain unaffected.

#### 🔍 Implications:
- Enhances fairness in profit allocation.
- Introduces a robust methodology based on **function, risk, and asset use** — aligning with OECD standards.
- Strengthens the ability of tax authorities to assess and adjust profits without over-taxing businesses.

### 4. **Article 8 – Carriage of Passengers/Goods by Ship or Aircraft**

#### ✅ New Rule:
> Profits from carriage by a ship or aircraft **may be taxed in the other Contracting State** if:
> - The passengers or goods were taken on board **at a place in the other State** and discharged **in that other State**.
> - **Exception**: If all or substantially all of the passengers or goods were taken on board **outside** that other State.

#### 🔍 Implications:
- Allows the **destination country** to tax profits from international transport when the journey begins in its territory.
- Prevents tax avoidance by companies that route goods/passengers through one country to avoid taxation.
- Provides clarity in cases involving **international shipping or aviation routes**.

---

### 5. **Article 9 – Time Limits for Profit Adjustments**

#### ✅ Replaces Paragraphs 3 and 4:
> A Contracting State **shall not make a primary adjustment** to profits after:
> - The expiry of domestic time limits; **or**
> - Eight years from the end of the taxable year in which the profits would have been attributed to the enterprise **but for the PE condition**.

> **Exception**: Applies only in cases of **fraud, wilful default, or careless/deliberate behavior**.

#### 🔍 Implications:
- Sets a **clear time limit (8 years)** for tax adjustments, promoting certainty and reducing disputes.
- Prevents indefinite tax challenges and ensures stability in cross-border tax planning.
- Protects legitimate business operations from retrospective tax claims.

### 6. **Article 10 – Dividends from Pension Plans (New Exception)**

#### ✅ New Paragraphs Added:
> Dividends arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by an organization that:
> 1. Is constituted and operated **exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more recognized pension plans**;
> 2. Is the **beneficial owner** of the shares;
> 3. Holds shares as an investment and is generally **exempt from tax** in the other State;
> 4. Owns **no more than 10% of capital or voting power** in the paying company;
> 5. Each recognized pension plan provides benefits **primarily to individuals who are residents** of the other State.

→ These dividends are **exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State**.

#### 🔍 Definitions:
- **Recognized Pension Plan**:
  - **Canada**: A retirement or employee benefits plan under Article 5 of the *Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act*.
  - **UK**: A pension scheme (excluding social security) registered under Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004, including pension funds or unit trusts where unit holders are exclusively pension schemes.
  - Any other plan **agreed by competent authorities**.

#### 🔍 Implications:
- **Protects pension funds** from double taxation.
- Encourages cross-border investment in pension infrastructure.
- Supports the **long-term stability of retirement systems** in both countries.

### 7. **Article 11 – Interest on Loans and Debts**

#### ✅ Key Changes:
- Interest paid to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that country.
- **However**, if the beneficial owner is a resident of the other country:
