The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly cited as "[Repealed, SOR/2012-24, s. 10]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 10 to the Statutory Rules Order 2012 (SOR/2012-24)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  This means the regulation no longer exists in force and is no longer applicable or enforceable under current law.

- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in **SOR/2012-24**, which was **June 1, 2012** (as per standard publication timelines for statutory rules in Canada). The specific section (section 10) of that order formally removed the regulation from the legal framework.

- **Legal Context**:  
  SOR/2012-24 (Statutory Rules Order 2012, No. 24) is a government order issued by the Canadian federal government to update or modernize the regulatory framework. In this case, section 10 of that order specifically identifies the repeal of a prior regulation — likely one related to **federal environmental, health, safety, or occupational standards**, though the exact subject matter of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed for several reasons, including:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation no longer serves a current purpose),
  - Inconsistency with newer legislation,
  - Duplication with other rules,
  - Improved regulatory frameworks or legislative amendments,
  - Streamlining of the regulatory system.

- **Implications of Repeal**:  
  Any legal or operational requirement previously derived from this regulation is now **void**. Entities (e.g., businesses, government agencies, or individuals) that were previously subject to its provisions must now comply with **current, surviving regulations** that have replaced or superseded it.

- **Where to Find the Original Regulation**:  
  The original regulation would have been published in the **Canada Gazette** or the **Regulations and Orders (SOR)** database. However, since it has been repealed, it is no longer active and is typically archived or cross-referenced in legal databases like:
  - [CanLII](https://www.canlii.org)
  - [Government of Canada – Regulations and Orders](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-statistics-regulations.html)

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in your query — identified by repeated citations of "[Repealed, SOR/2012-24, s. 10]" — **does not currently exist**. It was officially **repealed on or around June 1, 2012**, as part of a broader update to the regulatory framework. Without the original text of the regulation, the specific subject (e.g., workplace safety, environmental protection, etc.) cannot be definitively identified, but the repeal confirms that the rule is no longer in force.

👉 **Recommendation**: To determine the original subject of the repealed regulation, consult the full text of **SOR/2012-24** in the official Canadian government publications or legal databases. Section 10 of that order will list the specific regulation being repealed, along with its title and number.
