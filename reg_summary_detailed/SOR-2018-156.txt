### **Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Lake Chubsucker (Erimyzon sucetta) Order**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Context**

This regulation is issued under **Section 58 of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)**, which empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate and manage the **critical habitat** of endangered species in Canada. The Order specifically applies to the **Lake Chubsucker (*Erimyzon sucetta*)**, a fish species listed as **endangered** in **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA**.

Key legal provisions invoked in this Order include:

- **Section 58(1)**: Requires that critical habitat be protected and managed to support the survival and recovery of the species.
- **Section 58(2)**: Excludes certain areas from critical habitat designation if they are located in **protected areas** such as national parks or wildlife areas.
- **Section 58(4)**: Authorizes the Minister to make orders designating critical habitat.
- **Section 58(5)**: Requires consultation with relevant federal agencies when an order may affect protected lands or Indigenous reserves.
- **Section 58(7)**: Mandates consultation with the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (IAND)** and **affected Indigenous bands** when the proposed order would impact lands set aside for band use.

---

#### **2. Background and Rationale**

- The **recovery strategy** for the Lake Chubsucker, which identifies its **critical habitat**, has been formally registered in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**.
- A portion of this critical habitat lies within **Point Pelee National Park** and the **Big Creek, Long Point, and St. Clair National Wildlife Areas** — all of which are protected under federal legislation.
- Under **Section 58(2)b** of SARA, any critical habitat located within a **federally designated protected area** must be **excluded** from the order.
- Therefore, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) has excluded the portion of the Lake Chubsucker’s critical habitat located within these protected areas, as required by law.

Additionally, the MFO conducted consultations with:
- The **Minister of the Environment (via Parks Canada)**, due to the overlap with national parks and wildlife areas.
- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (IAND)** and **relevant First Nations bands**, because the Order may affect lands reserved for Indigenous communities.

These consultations ensured that Indigenous rights, traditional uses, and community interests were respected and considered.

#### **3. Scope of the Critical Habitat Designation**

Despite the exclusion of certain protected areas, the Order designates the **remaining critical habitat** of the Lake Chubsucker, which is defined as the **specific areas and conditions essential for the species’ survival and recovery**.

The designated critical habitat includes the following **geographic areas**:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Old Ausable Channel, Ontario** | The entire channel from its mouth (latitude 43°18′35.560″ N, longitude 81°45′47.797″ W) to its end at Grand Bend (latitude 43°13′57.309″ N, longitude 81°52′37.392″ W), as shown in Map 1 of the schedule. |
| **L Lake, Ontario** | All contiguous waters and wetlands of L Lake, including the northern and western tips (bisected by Outer Drive) and seasonal wetlands to the north of the lake, within the area specified in Table 1 of the schedule (Map 2). |
| **Rondeau Bay, Ontario** | Contiguous waters and wetlands within the area defined in Table 1 of the schedule (Map 3). |
| **Long Point Bay, Ontario** | Contiguous waters and wetlands of Long Point Bay, including ponds along the spit forming the southern boundary of the bay, within the area in Table 1 (Map 4), **but excluding** the portion located within the **Long Point National Wildlife Area**. |
| **Lyons Creek, Ontario** | All contiguous waters and wetlands from the Welland Canal (latitude 42°58′29.038″ N, longitude 79°13′12.175″ W) to Montrose Road (latitude 43°00′19.797″ N, longitude 79°07′25.073″ W), as illustrated in Map 5. |

> ⚠️ **Important Exclusion**: The critical habitat **within the Long Point National Wildlife Area** is explicitly excluded, as it falls under Section 58(2)b of SARA.

#### **4. Key Features and Attributes of Critical Habitat**

The critical habitat is not just a geographic area — it includes specific **biological and environmental features** essential for the Lake Chubsucker’s survival. These are outlined in **Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 of the schedule** and include:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Shallow water (0–2 m)** | The species requires shallow water environments, typically in bays, marshes, and lower reaches of tributaries. |
| **Abundant submerged aquatic vegetation** | Dense growth of aquatic plants (e.g., eelgrass, pondweed) provides shelter, food, and spawning grounds. |
| **Water temperatures of ~20°C from April to June** | This temperature range supports breeding and early life stages during spring and early summer. |
| **Calm and shallow water (0–2 m)** | Calm conditions reduce predation risk and allow for effective movement and feeding. |
| **Abundant aquatic vegetation** | Reinforces habitat structure and supports invertebrate food sources. |
| **Substrates of sand, silt, clay, organic debris** | These substrates are ideal for spawning and larval development. |
| **Low turbidity** | Clear water allows for better light penetration, supporting plant growth and visibility for the fish. |

These features are **essential for successful reproduction, feeding, and juvenile survival** of the Lake Chubsucker.

#### **5. Purpose and Significance of the Order**

This Order serves several key purposes:

- **Legal Protection**: It formally identifies and protects the areas essential for the recovery of the Lake Chubsucker.
- **Ecological Integrity**: By preserving the specific water quality, vegetation, and physical conditions, it supports the long-term viability of the species.
- **Compliance with SARA**: It ensures compliance with federal environmental protection obligations under SARA, including consultation with Indigenous communities and protected areas.
- **Recovery Support**: The designation helps guide land-use planning, development approvals, and conservation efforts to avoid or mitigate harm to critical habitat.

---

#### **6. Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Government of Canada.
- It is enforceable under the authority of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
- Any activity that may degrade or destroy the designated critical habitat (e.g., construction, pollution, dredging) may be subject to regulatory review or restriction under SARA and related environmental laws.
- The designation supports the broader **recovery strategy** for the Lake Chubsucker, which includes habitat restoration, monitoring, and research.

---

#### **7. Indigenous and Community Considerations**

- The Order reflects a commitment to **Indigenous engagement**, as required by Section 58(7) of SARA.
- Consultations with the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** and **affected First Nations** ensured that Indigenous rights, traditional knowledge, and land-use practices were respected.
- The exclusion of protected areas and the careful delineation of habitat boundaries aim to balance conservation with Indigenous land use and stewardship.

### **Conclusion**

This **Critical Habitat of the Lake Chubsucker (Erimyzon sucetta) Order** is a legally binding, science-based designation that:

- Identifies and protects the specific, ecologically essential areas where the Lake Chubsucker thrives.
- Excludes areas within protected federal lands (e.g., national parks and wildlife areas) as required by law.
- Includes key habitat features such as shallow, calm, vegetated waters with suitable substrates and temperatures.
- Is developed through transparent, inclusive consultation with federal agencies and Indigenous communities.

By safeguarding these areas, the Order plays a vital role in the **long-term recovery and survival** of this endangered fish species in Canada.
