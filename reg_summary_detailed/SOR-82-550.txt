**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Films and Video Tapes Certification Fees Order (SI/82-104, 1982)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Films and Video Tapes Certification Fees Order* (SI/82-104, 1982), issued on May 28, 1982, by the Minister of Communications under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act** and **Order in Council P.C. 1982-1394**, establishes a regulatory framework for the fees that private-sector producers must pay when seeking certification services related to Canadian films and video tapes. These services include advance rulings, provisional approvals, or formal certificates issued by the Canadian government to determine eligibility for tax benefits under the Income Tax Regulations.

This Order is part of Canada’s broader effort to support domestic film and video production through tax incentives, while ensuring fiscal accountability and transparency in the certification process.

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

1. **Certification Service**  
   Refers to any service provided by the government — such as an advance ruling, provisional approval, or official certificate — regarding the certification of a film or video tape for tax treatment under the Income Tax Regulations.

2. **Feature Production**  
   A motion picture film or video tape with a running time of **75 minutes or more**. This category is typically associated with major studio productions.

3. **Short Production**  
   A motion picture film or video tape with a running time of **less than 75 minutes**. These are often independent or shorter-form productions.

4. **Film or Tape**  
   A film or video tape referred to in **subsection 1104(2) of the Income Tax Regulations**. This includes both traditional motion pictures and video tapes eligible for certification under the tax regime.

5. **Film or Tape Production Budget**  
   The total financial contribution made by:
   - A **private-sector producer** to a film or tape they produce individually;  
   - **Canadian producers** to a co-production between Canada and another country, as defined by a bilateral agreement; or  
   - **Private-sector participants** to a co-production involving public-sector involvement.  
   This budget is the basis for calculating certification fees.

6. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of Communications**, who has the authority to administer and regulate the certification process.

7. **Review of a Certification Service**  
   A formal review initiated by the Minister when there is a written indication that the certification may be denied. This process allows producers to appeal or request reconsideration of their eligibility.

### **Fee Structure**

#### **1. Standard Certification Fee (Initial Application)**

- **Fee Amount**:  
  The fee payable by a private-sector applicant for a certification service is **one thousandth (1/1000) of the film or tape production budget**.

- **Minimum and Maximum Limits**:  
  The fee cannot be less than **$25** or more than **$500**.  
  This cap ensures that even very large productions are not subject to excessively high fees, while small productions are not unduly burdened.

> Example:  
> If a private producer has a production budget of $1 million, the certification fee would be:  
> $1,000,000 × (1/1000) = **$1,000** — but this exceeds the maximum of $500.  
> Therefore, the actual fee would be **$500**.

> If the budget is $50,000:  
> $50,000 × (1/1000) = $50 — which is above the minimum of $25, so the fee is **$50**.

Thus, the fee is **proportional to the production budget**, but **clamped between $25 and $500**.

#### **2. Review Fee (Appeal or Reconsideration)**

When a private-sector producer requests a **review of a certification service** (i.e., when the Minister intends to deny certification), the fee is tiered based on production type:

- **Short Production** (less than 75 minutes):  
  Fee = **$500**

- **Feature Production** (75 minutes or more):  
  Fee = **$1,500**

> These fees are **not based on production budget** and are fixed, regardless of the size of the project. This reflects the administrative and regulatory complexity involved in reviewing a denial.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **To Generate Revenue**  
   The fees provide a source of government revenue from private film and video production activities, which are eligible for tax incentives under the Income Tax Regulations.

2. **To Ensure Fair and Transparent Fee Application**  
   By linking the fee to the production budget (with clear caps), the Order prevents excessive charges while maintaining a fair relationship between the government and private producers.

3. **To Support Canadian Content**  
   Certification services help determine whether a film or video is eligible for tax benefits, which encourages investment in Canadian-made content.

4. **To Facilitate Administrative Efficiency**  
   The tiered review fee structure allows the government to manage administrative costs associated with reviewing certification denials, especially for larger feature films.

### **Application and Scope**

- Applies only to **private-sector producers**.
- Does **not apply** to government-owned or public-sector productions.
- Applies to **all films and video tapes** eligible under the Income Tax Regulations (e.g., those meeting the definition in subsection 1104(2)).
- Applies to both **co-productions** (with foreign countries or public-sector partners), provided the production budget is calculated accordingly.

---

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is authorized under:
- **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Minister to make regulations setting fees for services provided by the government.
- **Order in Council P.C. 1982-1394**, which provides the enabling authority for the Minister to issue specific fee regulations in the area of film and video certification.

### **Conclusion**

The *Canadian Films and Video Tapes Certification Fees Order* establishes a clear, equitable, and transparent fee structure for private-sector producers seeking government certification of Canadian films and video tapes. By linking fees to production budgets with reasonable caps, and introducing tiered review fees based on production scale, the Order balances fiscal responsibility with support for Canadian creative industries. It remains a foundational regulatory instrument in Canada’s film and media policy framework, particularly in relation to tax incentives and content development.

> **Note**: While this Order is dated 1982, it may still be in force or referenced in current policy, though modern film policy has evolved with digital media, streaming, and broader tax incentives. Its principles (e.g., budget-based fees, tiered review costs) may have influenced later regulations.
