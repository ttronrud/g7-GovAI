**Detailed Summary of the *Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Resource Revenue Fund Regulations* (S.C. 1987, c. 3)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Resource Revenue Fund Regulations* (S.C. 1987, c. 3) are a set of administrative rules established under the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act"). These regulations prescribe the **timing, method, and conditions** for:

1. **Crediting** amounts into the **Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Resource Revenue Fund** (the "Revenue Fund") by the Federal Minister (Minister of Natural Resources);
2. **Disbursing** (paying) those credited amounts to **Her Majesty in right of Newfoundland**.

The purpose of these regulations is to ensure a clear, transparent, and timely mechanism for collecting and distributing revenues generated from offshore petroleum activities in Newfoundland and Labrador, in accordance with the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* — the enabling legislation that establishes the framework for offshore petroleum revenue sharing.
- **Working day**: A day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday. This standard is used to determine timelines for processing and payments.

---

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Initial Crediting (One-Time Payment Upon Coming Into Force)**

- Within **10 working days** of the date these regulations come into force, the Federal Minister must credit the Revenue Fund with an amount equal to the **aggregate** of:
  - Amounts assessed or reassessed or received during the period from **April 4, 1987**, to the **last day of the second month before the regulations come into force**, under:
    - Subparagraph **214(2)(a)(ii)** of the Act (likely related to royalties or resource-based payments);
    - Subparagraph **214(2)(a)(iv)** of the Act (likely related to production or development charges).

> This initial credit ensures that the fund is seeded with revenues from the early phase of offshore operations, establishing a baseline for future fund operations.

---

#### **2. Monthly Crediting (Ongoing Monthly Payments)**

- On or within **10 working days after the end of each month**, the Federal Minister must credit the Revenue Fund with an amount equal to the aggregate of:
  - Amounts assessed, reassessed, or received during that month under:
    - Subparagraph **214(2)(a)(ii)**;
    - Subparagraph **214(2)(a)(iv)**.

> This provision ensures a regular, monthly inflow of revenue from offshore petroleum operations, reflecting ongoing production and activity.

---

#### **3. Credit for "Production" Revenues (Monthly, Two-Day Window)**

- Within **two working days after the 10th day of each month**, the Federal Minister must credit the Revenue Fund with an amount equal to the aggregate of:
  - Amounts under **subparagraph 214(2)(a)(i)** of the Act — likely representing **production royalties** or **resource rents** paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund during the **previous month**.

> This rule captures revenues tied directly to production volumes, with a strict deadline to ensure prompt fund replenishment.

---

#### **4. Credit from Board Deposits (Upon Receipt of Notice)**

- Within **two working days after receiving a notice from the Board** (the Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board) stating the details of a deposit made under **subsection 99(2)** of the Act, the Federal Minister must credit the Revenue Fund with:
  - The aggregate of amounts under **subparagraph 214(2)(a)(iii)** — likely representing **taxes or fees collected by the Board** from offshore operators.

> This mechanism ensures that revenues collected by the Board (e.g., through licensing or environmental fees) are promptly transferred to the fund, providing a responsive and accountable process.

---

#### **5. Payment of Credited Amounts to Her Majesty in Right of Newfoundland**

- **Within the last working day of each month** in which the Federal Minister credits the fund under **Section 3** (monthly credits based on paragraphs 214(2)(a)(ii) and (iv)), the Minister must **pay out** the credited amount from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** to **Her Majesty in right of Newfoundland**.

> This ensures that Newfoundland receives its share of offshore revenues on a monthly basis, with the payment tied to the end of the month.

- **Within three working days** after any credit under **Section 4 or 5** (i.e., the credit under subparagraph 214(2)(a)(i) or 214(2)(a)(iii)), the Minister must make a **disbursement** of the same amount to Her Majesty in right of Newfoundland.

> This establishes a **faster payment timeline** for certain types of revenue (especially production royalties and Board-collected fees), ensuring timely transfer of funds to the provincial government.

| **Federal Oversight** | The Federal Minister is responsible for both crediting and disbursing, ensuring alignment with federal policy and financial controls. |
| **Provincial Benefit** | Payments to "Her Majesty in right of Newfoundland" mean the revenues ultimately benefit the provincial government, reinforcing the principle of equitable resource sharing. |
| **Legal Basis** | The regulations are enacted under subsection 214(2) and paragraph 216(b) of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act, which authorize the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board to make such rules. |

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

These regulations serve several key policy objectives:

1. **Equitable Resource Sharing**: They ensure that Newfoundland and Labrador receives a fair share of the economic benefits from offshore petroleum development, consistent with the Atlantic Accord framework.
2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Clear timelines and defined sources of revenue enhance public trust and financial oversight.
3. **Fiscal Stability**: By establishing predictable monthly inflows and outflows, the regulations support stable provincial budgets.
4. **Operational Efficiency**: The rules streamline the flow of funds between federal and provincial levels, reducing administrative delays.

### **Conclusion**

The *Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Resource Revenue Fund Regulations* provide a **structured, timely, and accountable mechanism** for transferring offshore petroleum revenues from the federal government to the provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador. By specifying precise timelines for crediting and disbursing funds based on different types of revenue (royalties, production charges, and Board-collected fees), the regulations ensure that Newfoundland receives its fair share of the benefits derived from offshore oil and gas development.

These rules remain a foundational component of the economic framework established by the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord, supporting sustainable development and fiscal equity in the region.
