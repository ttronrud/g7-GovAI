**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Fresh Grape Information (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations, 1978**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The Ontario Fresh Grape Growers’ Marketing Board (the "Board") issued these regulations on **March 28, 1978**, under the authority of the *Ontario Fresh Grape Order*. These regulations **revoked the previous Ontario Fresh Grape Information (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations made on January 26, 1977 (SOR/77-113)** and replaced them with a new, updated set of rules governing the collection and reporting of information related to the **interprovincial and export marketing of fresh grapes produced in Ontario**.

The primary objective of these regulations is to ensure **transparency, traceability, and accurate market data** in the movement and sale of Ontario-grown fresh grapes outside the province or internationally. This data supports pricing, market analysis, and equitable distribution among growers, shippers, dealers, and other stakeholders in the grape marketing chain.

- **Applies to persons and property located within the Province of Ontario**.
