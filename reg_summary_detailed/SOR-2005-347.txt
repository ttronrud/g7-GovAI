**Detailed Summary of the Public Service Official Languages Appointment Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Service Official Languages Appointment Regulations* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12 and 13) were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Public Service Commission, under **Section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act**. These regulations provide specific rules governing the appointment of public servants to **bilingual positions** in the Canadian public service, particularly in relation to official language proficiency and the circumstances under which individuals may be appointed despite not meeting language requirements.

The regulations are directly linked to the *Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order* (referred to as "the Order"), which outlines the conditions under which certain employees may be excluded from bilingual positions due to insufficient official language proficiency.

---

### **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

- **"Order"**: Refers to the *Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order*. All terms used in these regulations have the same meaning as in that Order unless otherwise specified.

---

### **1. Exclusion of Leave Periods from Bilingual Agreements**

> *"For the purposes of these Regulations, any period of leave of more than 60 consecutive days is not included in computing the two-year period referred to in any agreement to become bilingual or any extension of that period under section 7."*

- **Purpose**: To prevent disruptions caused by extended leave from affecting an employee’s timeline for achieving official language proficiency.
- **Impact**: If an employee takes more than 60 consecutive days off (e.g., maternity leave, medical leave, study), those days are **not counted** when determining whether they meet the two-year deadline to become proficient in the required official language.
- **Rationale**: Ensures fairness by recognizing that long-term absences are not a barrier to language acquisition and do not penalize individuals who are otherwise committed to becoming bilingual.

---

### **2. Non-Imperative Appointment to Bilingual Positions**

> *"A person excluded under section 3, 4 or 5 of the Order may be appointed on a non-imperative basis to a bilingual position if the appointment would be on the basis of merit except that the person does not meet the qualifications of the position with respect to official language proficiency."*

- **Definition of "non-imperative"**: The appointment is made based on merit, but the individual does **not** meet the required language proficiency standard for the position.
- **Context**: This allows for flexibility in hiring individuals who are otherwise qualified for a role but lack the necessary language skills at the time of appointment.
- **Implication**: Such appointments are not mandatory — they are conditional and temporary, with the expectation that the employee will eventually meet language requirements.

---

### **3. Mandatory Language Training for Non-Imperative Appointments**

> *"If a person is appointed on a non-imperative basis to a bilingual position after the person enters into an agreement to become bilingual, the deputy head must ensure that the person is provided with the language training that is necessary for the person to attain the level of official language proficiency required for the position within the two-year period referred to in the agreement to become bilingual."*

- **Mandatory Requirement**: The **deputy head** (a senior public service leader) is responsible for ensuring that all such employees receive **appropriate language training** to reach the required proficiency level within the two-year timeframe of their bilingual agreement.
- **Training Must Be Tailored**: The training must be sufficient and relevant to the specific language and job demands.
- **Goal**: To ensure that individuals who are hired without full language proficiency are given a clear, structured path to meet the required standards.

### **4. Consequences of Failing to Achieve Language Proficiency**

> *"If a person who accepts a non-imperative appointment to a bilingual position after entering into an agreement to become bilingual does not meet the level of official language proficiency required for the position during the two-year period referred to in the agreement, the deputy head must, within two months after the end of that period, appoint or deploy the person on an indeterminate basis to a position that is one for which the person meets the essential qualifications referred to in paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Act and that is of a similar level and salary as the bilingual position."*

- **Failure Outcome**: If the employee fails to meet language proficiency by the end of the two-year period, they must be **reassigned**.
- **Nature of Reassignment**:
  - Must be **on an indeterminate basis** (i.e., not a fixed-term or temporary assignment).
  - The new position must:
    - Match the employee’s **essential qualifications** (as defined in paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Public Service Employment Act).
    - Be of **similar level and salary** to the original bilingual role.
- **Purpose**: To maintain fairness and ensure that employees who fail to meet language standards are not left without employment, while also protecting the integrity of bilingual positions.

---

### **5. Applicability of Previous Agreements in Subsequent Appointments**

> *"If, during the two-year period referred to in a person’s agreement to become bilingual, the person accepts, after entering into a new agreement to become bilingual, any other non-imperative appointment to a bilingual position requiring the same or a lower level of official language proficiency, sections 4 and 5 apply in respect of that subsequent appointment as if the references in those sections to the two-year period referred to in the agreement to become bilingual were references to the two-year period referred to in the first agreement."*

- **Key Provision**: If an employee takes a **second non-imperative appointment** to a bilingual role during the initial two-year period (after signing a first agreement), the rules regarding language proficiency and reassignment apply **as if the two-year period were based on the first agreement**.
- **Interpretation**:
  - The employee is not given a fresh two-year window for each new appointment.
  - The original two-year timeline remains in force, and failure to meet proficiency within that window triggers the same consequences (reassignment).
- **Rationale**: Prevents employees from exploiting multiple appointments to avoid accountability for language proficiency.

### **6. Extension of the Two-Year Bilingual Agreement Period**

> *"For the purposes of sections 4 to 6, the Commission must extend the two-year period referred to in an agreement to become bilingual for one or more additional periods — of not more than two years in total — that the person is likely to need to attain the required level of language proficiency, if the person is not able to attain the required level of language proficiency within the two-year period referred to in the agreement because of:"*
>
> - Exceptional operational requirements that were not foreseeable at the time of the appointment;
> - Exceptional personal circumstances that were not foreseeable at the time of the appointment;
> - A physical, mental or learning impairment that hinders the learning of the other official language at the required level of proficiency; or
> - The inability to obtain language training at public expense.

- **Eligibility for Extension**:
  - Extensions are **only available** when the individual faces **unforeseen, legitimate barriers** to achieving language proficiency.
  - The total extension cannot exceed **two years** across all extensions.
- **Conditions for Approval**:
  - The barrier must be **unforeseeable** at the time of appointment.
  - The extension must be justified and approved by the **Public Service Commission**.
- **Examples**:
  - A medical condition (e.g., dyslexia, hearing loss) that affects language learning.
  - A sudden family emergency (e.g., death of a close family member).
  - A major operational change in the workplace that makes language training impractical.
  - The employee cannot access language training due to financial or logistical constraints (e.g., no public funding available).
- **Impact**: Provides **flexibility and equity**, recognizing that some individuals face significant challenges beyond their control.

### **7. Effective Date and Repeal**

> *"These Regulations come into force on the day on which section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act, chapter 22 of the Statutes of Canada, 2003, comes into force."*

- The regulations are **not immediately effective**; they activate only when **Section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act** takes effect.
- This ensures alignment with broader modernization efforts in the public service.

> *[Note: Regulations in force December 31, 2005, see SI/2005-122.]*

- Indicates that these regulations were **in effect as of December 31, 2005**, and may have been updated or superseded by subsequent amendments or statutory instruments.
