### **Regulatory Summary**

**Title:** Order Regarding Inclusion of Specific Lands in a Sale under the Territorial Lands Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which grants the government the authority to designate certain land parcels for sale, including those adjacent to water bodies.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Land in Question – Proximity to the Mackenzie River:**  
   Any portion of the lands described in the **schedule attached to this order** that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)** of the **Mackenzie River** in the **Northwest Territories** shall be **included in the sale** of the said lands.

   - **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM):** This is a defined geographical boundary used in land law to distinguish between land and water, typically representing the highest water level reached under normal conditions (not during floods or extreme weather). Land within this 100-foot zone is considered to be in a high-risk or riparian area and may be subject to specific management or sale rules.
   - The inclusion of this area in the sale implies that the government is preparing to sell or transfer ownership of these riparian lands, likely to generate revenue or for infrastructure development, and that such lands are now subject to the terms of the sale.

2. **Specific Land Reference – Lot 166, Village of Fort Simpson:**  
   The **entire area of Lot 166** in the **Village of Fort Simpson**, Northwest Territories, is specifically identified and included in the sale.  
   - This lot is formally defined by a **plan of survey of record number 56150**, which is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** held at Ottawa.
   - A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in **Yellowknife**, under reference number **613**.

   This ensures that the boundaries of the lot are officially documented and legally recognized, providing clarity for title transfer, legal disputes, and future land use planning.

### **Purpose and Implications**

- **Land Sale Context:** This regulation is part of a broader process to sell government-owned land, likely to support infrastructure projects, revenue generation, or land use planning in the Northwest Territories.
- **Riparian Land Inclusion:** By including lands within 100 feet of the Mackenzie River, the government is acknowledging the river’s significance and potentially preparing for environmental, economic, or community-based land use decisions.
- **Legal Clarity:** The reference to a specific survey plan and land registration record ensures that the boundaries of the affected land are legally defined and accessible to stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, landowners, and regulatory bodies.

---

### **Relevant Legal and Administrative Notes**

- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** provided the recommendation, indicating that Indigenous rights, land use, and northern development interests may have been considered in this decision.
- The **Governor General in Council** acts as the formal authority to issue such orders, reflecting the federal government’s role in land administration in the territories.
- The **Territorial Lands Act** provides the legal framework for land sales, including provisions for riparian zones and public land disposition.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates certain lands—specifically, all portions within 100 feet of the Mackenzie River’s Ordinary High Water Mark as described in the schedule—and the entire Lot 166 in Fort Simpson—as part of a government land sale. It is grounded in statutory authority and supported by official survey records, ensuring legal transparency and enforceability. The order reflects both administrative and environmental considerations in land management within the Northwest Territories.
