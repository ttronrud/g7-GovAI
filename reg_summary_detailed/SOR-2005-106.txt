**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Suspending the Application of Concessions on Imports of Certain Products Originating in the United States  

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act* (specifically subsections 13(1) and (13)(3)), by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister for International Trade. This means the decision was made at the federal level in Canada, following consultation and policy direction from the Minister responsible for international trade.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **suspend certain trade concessions** (such as preferential tariff treatment) that Canada normally grants to imports of specific goods originating in the United States. This suspension is implemented through the imposition of a **15% ad valorem surtax** on these goods, effectively increasing their duty burden during a defined period.

### Scope of the Suspended Concessions

The Order applies specifically to **U.S. goods** classified under the following tariff item numbers in the *List of Tariff Provisions* (as set out in the schedule to the *Customs Tariff*):

- **0103.10.00** – Certain types of raw or processed animal products (e.g., meat or meat products)
- **0103.91.00** – Certain meat and meat products (e.g., unprocessed or semi-processed)
- **0103.92.00** – Meat and meat products (e.g., processed or preserved)
- **0301.10.00** – Certain types of processed or manufactured meat products
- **0303.79.00** – Meat and meat products (e.g., processed or canned)
- **0307.10.10** – Certain meat and meat products (e.g., processed)
- **0307.10.20** – Similar processed meat products
- **2402.20.00** – Certain types of processed meat or meat products (e.g., canned or preserved)

> These classifications are based on the **Harmonized System (HS) codes** used in international trade. The determination of origin (i.e., whether a product is "originating in the United States") is governed by sections 1 and 2 of the *Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations*.

### Exclusions

The Order **does not apply** to:
- **U.S. goods that are in transit to Canada as of May 1, 2005**.  
  This means that goods that were already in Canada or en route on that date are exempt from the surtax and the suspension of concessions.

### Financial Impact – Surtax Imposed

- A **15% ad valorem surtax** is imposed on the value of the U.S. goods imported during the period of the Order.
- The surtax is applied **on top of any existing duties** and is calculated based on the **value for duty** as defined under sections 45 to 55 of the *Customs Act*.
- This surtax effectively **partially suspends the rights and privileges** that would normally be granted to U.S. goods under Canada’s Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff regime.

> In essence, this means that goods from the U.S. in these specific categories will be subject to higher import costs, which could affect pricing, competitiveness, and trade flows between Canada and the U.S.

### Duration and Effective Date

- **Effective Date:** The Order comes into force on **May 1, 2005**.
- **Duration:** It remains in effect for a period of **12 months**, ending on **April 30, 2006**.
- The suspension is **time-limited** and does not extend beyond this date.

### Key Implications

1. **Trade Policy Tool:** This regulation reflects a temporary trade policy action, likely used to address concerns related to trade imbalances, unfair competition, or specific market distortions involving U.S. imports in these product categories.

2. **Geographic and Product Specificity:** The measure is narrowly targeted—only certain tariff lines and only goods from the U.S. are affected.

3. **Non-Recourse to U.S. Goods in Transit:** The exclusion of goods already in transit on May 1, 2005, suggests that the policy is designed to impact **new imports** during the period, not goods already in Canada.

4. **Temporary Nature:** The 12-month duration indicates this is not a permanent trade barrier but a short-term intervention.

5. **Legal Basis:** The use of WTO implementation provisions shows that Canada is acting within the framework of international trade obligations, ensuring that such measures are justified and consistent with WTO rules.

### Contextual Background (Inferred)

This regulation may have been introduced in response to:
- Concerns about the competitiveness of U.S. meat and meat products in the Canadian market.
- Allegations of dumping or unfair trade practices.
- A need to protect domestic producers or ensure fair market access.
- Political or diplomatic considerations related to U.S.-Canada trade relations.

It may also reflect broader trade policy adjustments during the early 2000s, when Canada was actively managing trade relationships with major trading partners.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation temporarily suspends preferential tariff treatment for specific U.S. meat and meat product imports by imposing a 15% surtax on those goods entering Canada from May 1, 2005, to April 30, 2006. It applies only to goods classified under specific tariff headings and excludes goods in transit on the start date. The measure is a targeted, time-limited trade policy tool designed to protect domestic interests in specific sectors while operating within Canada’s international trade obligations.
