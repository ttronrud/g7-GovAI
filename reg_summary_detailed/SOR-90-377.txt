The Governor in Council, after being satisfied that Canada Post Systems Management Limited (CP-SML) is legally and operationally authorized to undertake the transaction, has approved the acquisition of shares in a foreign entity. This determination was made on the recommendation of the Honourable Harvie Andre (a senior government official, likely a minister or senior advisor) and the Treasury Board, which is responsible for overseeing financial and administrative decisions involving public funds.
