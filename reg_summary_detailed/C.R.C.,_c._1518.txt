**Detailed Summary of the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* (COGLR) are a comprehensive set of rules governing the administration, leasing, exploration, development, and surveying of Canada’s oil and gas lands—commonly referred to as **Canada lands**. These regulations define key terms, establish procedures for exploration and development, regulate land surveying and monumentation, and outline the responsibilities of various stakeholders including the federal government, lessees, permittees, and surveyors.

These regulations apply only to Canada lands under the control, management, and administration of the federal government, specifically through the **Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR)** or, in certain northern territories, the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**.

## **Key Definitions and Terminology**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Allowable Expenditure** | Refers to costs specified in Section 43, typically related to exploration and development activities that are eligible for reimbursement or financial support. |
| **Arbitrator** | A designated official under Section 97 to resolve disputes between parties (e.g., lessees and the Crown) regarding land use or interpretation of regulations. |
| **Bond** | A financial guarantee issued by or on behalf of the Government of Canada to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations (e.g., reclamation, environmental protection). |
| **Canada Lands** | Includes: <br> - Territorial lands under the *Territorial Lands Act*; <br> - Public lands with no disposition provision in law (i.e., unassigned public lands); <br> - Land under water (submerged areas). |
| **Chief** | The administrator of the Canada Oil and Gas Lands Administration. Serves as the central authority for land management decisions. |
| **Commercial Quantity** | Output of oil or gas from a well that, in the Chief’s judgment, justifies drilling another well in the same area. Evaluation considers production volume, drilling costs, and economics. |
| **Crown Reserve Lands** | Canada lands where no interest has been granted under these regulations. Includes submerged areas listed in Schedule IV. |
| **Department** | <br> - In regions covered by Schedule VI (northern territories), the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND); <br> - Elsewhere, the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR). |
| **Development Structure** | Any facility used for drilling, production, gathering, storage, processing, transmission, or handling of oil/gas (e.g., platforms, pipelines, processing plants). |
| **Development Well** | A well drilled under an order from the Chief or located adjacent to existing producible wells with a high probability of accessing the same reservoir. |
| **Exploration Agreement** | A legally binding agreement between the Minister or a designated person and an entity for exploration activities. |
| **Exploratory Well** | Any well that is not a development well. |
| **Exploratory Work** | Includes test drilling, geological surveys, geophysical studies, aerial mapping, bulldozing, and construction of roads or airstrips required for exploration. |
| **Extraction Plant** | Equipment or facilities (not wells) used to extract oil or associated substances (e.g., bitumen, oil shale) from surface or subsurface deposits. |
| **Gas** | Natural gas and all associated minerals or constituents (solid, liquid, or gaseous), excluding oil. |
| **Holder** | The person(s) registered as the legal owner of an interest (e.g., lease, agreement) granted under these regulations. |
| **Interest** | Includes exploration agreements and other rights granted under the regulations. |
| **Legal Survey** | A formal survey conducted in accordance with the *Canada Lands Surveys Act*, approved by the Surveyor General. |
| **Lessee** | A person holding an oil and gas lease. |
| **Licence** | An exploratory licence issued under Section 24. |
| **Licensee** | A person holding a licence. |
| **Minister** | <br> - In Schedule VI areas: Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development; <br> - Elsewhere: Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. |
| **Monument** | Any physical marker (post, stake, mound, trench, etc.) used to define boundaries or mark well locations, as per a legally approved survey. |
| **Offshore** | A drill site located in a water-covered area of Canada lands. |
| **Oil** | <br> - Crude petroleum and hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead; <br> - Hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, bitumen, oil shale, or similar deposits; <br> - Excludes coal and gas. |
| **Oil and Gas Lease** | A lease granted under Sections 54 or 57. |
| **Oil Conservation Engineer** | An officer of the Department or a designated individual responsible for evaluating well completion, production, and environmental compliance. |
| **Permit** | An exploratory permit issued under Sections 30 or 32 (before August 3, 1977), and may be renewed under Section 40. |
| **Permittee** | A person holding a permit. |
| **Petro-Canada Limited** | A federally established corporation established under the *Petro-Canada Limited Act*. |
| **Significant Discovery** | A discovery of oil or gas that justifies drilling additional wells beyond the initial well. |
| **Special Renewal Permit** | A permit granted under Sections 116 or 117 to extend exploration rights under specific conditions. |
| **Surveyor General** | The official designated under the *Canada Lands Surveys Act* to oversee and approve legal surveys. |
| **Target Area** | *Repealed* by SOR/80-590, Section 1. No longer applicable. |
| **Well** | Any opening in the ground made by drilling, boring, or other means, intended for searching or extracting oil/gas, injecting fluids, or reaching depths of at least 500 feet. |

## **Well Status and Lifecycle**

The regulations define specific legal statuses for wells:

- **Abandoned**: A well is deemed abandoned when all required cement plugs (as per *Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations*) are set and approved by the **Oil Conservation Engineer**.
- **Completed**: A well is completed when it is first placed into **steady or intermittent production** and appears capable of sustaining production according to the Oil Conservation Engineer’s assessment.
- **Suspended**: A well is suspended when operations are halted in a manner approved by the Oil Conservation Engineer, but it is not abandoned or completed.
- **Commercial Exploitation Begins**: Commercial exploitation begins when the **Minister**, after considering economic conditions, determines that a market exists to match the well’s or extraction plant’s productive capacity.

## **Grid System and Land Division**

To manage Canada lands systematically, the regulations establish a **grid-based land division system**:

### **1. Grid Areas**
Grid areas are defined by latitude and longitude boundaries based on geographic zones:

| Zone | East-West Boundaries | North-South Boundaries |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **South of 70°N** | Meridians: 50°00′00″, 50°15′00″, 50°30′00″ (extendable) | Parallels: 40°00′00″, 40°10′00″, 40°20′00″ (extendable) |
| **North of 70°N** | Meridians: 50°00′00″, 50°30′00″, 51°00′00″ (extendable) | Parallels: 70°00′00″, 70°10′00″, 70°20′00″ (extendable) |

**Subdivisions by Latitude Bands:**
- **40°–60°N & 70°–75°N**:  
  - North-South boundary: North edge of sections 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95  
  - East-West boundary: West edge of sections 41–50  
- **60°–68°N & 75°–78°N**:  
  - North-South boundary: North edge of sections 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75  
  - East-West boundary: West edge of sections 31–40  
- **68°–70°N & 78°–85°N**:  
  - North-South boundary: North edge of sections 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55  
  - East-West boundary: West edge of sections 21–30  

Each grid area is uniquely identified by the **latitude and longitude of its northeast corner**.

### **2. Sections**
Each grid area is subdivided into **sections**:

- **East-West spacing**:
  - 40°–60°N or 70°–75°N: Every 1/10th
