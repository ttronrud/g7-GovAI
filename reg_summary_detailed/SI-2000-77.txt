**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument Title:**  
*Order Respecting the Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Lands in the Northwest Territories (Dogrib Settlement Agreement, North Slave Region, N.W.T.)*

---

### **Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of land in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer)** to facilitate the implementation of the **Dogrib Settlement Agreement**. This agreement is a historic Indigenous land rights and self-governance arrangement between the Government of Canada and the Dogrib (Dene) people, recognizing their traditional rights and interests in the region.

By withdrawing these lands from disposal, the government ensures that the lands are not subject to commercial development or mineral rights transactions during the settlement period, thereby protecting the Dogrib people’s interests and enabling a fair, culturally appropriate resolution of their land claims.

---

### **Key Provisions:**

#### **1. Withdrawal of Lands from Disposal**  
- The lands specified in **Schedules 1 and 2** are officially withdrawn from disposal.  
- The withdrawal period begins on the **date the Order is made** and ends on **August 31, 2005**.  
- This means that during this period, the Government of the Northwest Territories **cannot sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of** these lands through public land markets or administrative processes.

#### **2. Exceptions to the Withdrawal (Section 2 – Exclusions)**  
Despite the general withdrawal, the Order explicitly **does not apply** to the following activities or rights:

- **Substances or materials under the Territorial Quarrying Regulations** – Quarrying operations are exempt.
- **Surface interests** in the lands listed in Schedule 1 – Surface rights (e.g., rights to use the land surface) are not affected.
  
> *Note: This means that while mineral rights may be restricted, surface use rights (such as for roads, pipelines, or access) can still be managed under existing laws.*

#### **3. Specific Exemptions for Existing Rights and Permits**  
The Order also includes a detailed list of **existing rights and activities** that are **not affected** by the withdrawal. These include:

- **Prospecting permits granted before the Order was made**: A claimant who obtained a prospecting permit prior to the Order’s enactment may still locate a claim on the withdrawn land.
- **Previously recorded claims**: Claims that were already recorded or located before the Order’s date are not affected.
- **Leases granted under the Canada Mining Regulations**: Leases issued to holders of recorded claims (where the lease covers part of the claim) are exempt.
- **Significant discovery licences**: Issuances of such licences to holders of exploration licences issued before the Order date are exempt if the licence covers the same area.
- **Production licences**: Production licences issued to holders of exploration or significant discovery licences (issued before the Order) are exempt if they cover the same area.
- **Surface leases**: Surface leases granted to holders of recorded claims or interests (under mining or petroleum laws) to allow exercise of rights under those claims or interests are exempt.
- **Renewals of interests**: Renewals of existing mineral or petroleum interests are exempt.

> *These exclusions ensure that ongoing, legitimate, and pre-existing operations or rights are not disrupted by the withdrawal, preserving continuity in industry and Indigenous engagement.*

### **Repeal Clause – Historical Land Records**  
The Order includes a **repeal provision** that formally removes certain outdated land records from official custody:

- **All parcels of land** shown in **hatched red** on specific **National Topographic Series (NTS) maps** (numbered 85J, 85K, 85N, 86B, and 86C), labeled “LAND WITHDRAWAL” and dated 00/05/08, are **repealed** from the official land records.
- These parcels were previously marked in the records of the **Head of Lands Transactions**, Land, Water and Forest Management Division, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (now part of the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada).
- Copies of these maps are also held in the **Land Administration Office in Yellowknife**.

Additionally:
- **All parcels shown in red (outlined)** but **not hatched** on the following NTS maps (85J, 85K, 85M, 85N, 85O, 86A, 86B, 86C, 86D, 86E, and 86F), labeled “LAND WITHDRAWAL” and dated 00/05/08, are **also removed from official records**.

> *This indicates a formal update and correction of outdated land records, ensuring that only current, accurate land status is maintained in government databases.*

### **Significance and Implications:**

1. **Land Rights and Indigenous Self-Determination**:  
   This Order is a key step in fulfilling the **Dogrib Settlement Agreement**, which recognizes the Dene people’s traditional title, rights, and interests in the North Slave Region. The withdrawal ensures that the land is not opened to commercial exploitation during the negotiation and implementation phase.

2. **Temporal Limitation (August 31, 2005)**:  
   The withdrawal is time-limited. After August 31, 2005, the lands may again be subject to disposal, unless further agreements or legislative changes extend or modify the withdrawal.

3. **Legal Clarity and Continuity**:  
   By clearly defining exceptions, the Order avoids unintended disruption to existing mining or exploration activities. It protects legitimate, pre-existing rights and ensures legal certainty for industry and Indigenous stakeholders.

4. **Administrative and Record-Keeping Reform**:  
   The repeal of outdated records ensures that government land databases reflect current legal status and prevents confusion or misrepresentation in land administration.

### **Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a **legally binding instrument** that establishes a temporary, targeted withdrawal of certain lands in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories from disposal. Its purpose is to support the **Dogrib Settlement Agreement** by preserving Indigenous land rights and ensuring that the settlement process proceeds without interference from commercial land transactions. It balances Indigenous rights with the need for legal continuity in existing industry activities and maintains accurate land records through administrative updates.
