### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

This regulation is issued under two primary legislative frameworks:

#### **a. Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CERA) – Section 8**
- **Section 8** of the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) the authority to designate a Minister as the "Minister" responsible for the operation and governance of the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER).
- This designation is essential because the CER is a federal agency established to regulate energy markets (such as electricity, natural gas, and oil), and it requires a designated minister to oversee its operations, provide policy direction, and ensure accountability to Parliament.

#### **b. Financial Administration Act (FAA) – Paragraph (c.1)b of Section 2**
- The *Financial Administration Act* defines the term **"appropriate Minister"** in relation to the use of public funds and financial oversight of federal institutions.
- Paragraph (c.1)b specifically provides that a Minister may be designated as the "appropriate Minister" with respect to a federal agency or body when they are responsible for that agency’s operations or policy direction.
- This designation ensures that the Minister of Natural Resources has the legal authority to approve expenditures, manage financial accountability, and provide oversight for the Canadian Energy Regulator under the FAA.

### **2. Key Designations Made**

#### **a. Designation as "Minister" under the Canadian Energy Regulator Act**
- The **Minister of Natural Resources** is officially designated as the **Minister for the purposes of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act**.
- This means:
  - The Minister has formal responsibility for the strategic direction, policy development, and administrative oversight of the Canadian Energy Regulator.
  - The Minister serves as the principal point of contact between the CER and the federal government.
  - The Minister is responsible for ensuring the CER operates in accordance with the Act and fulfills its mandate, including regulatory oversight, licensing, and market integrity.

#### **b. Designation as "Appropriate Minister" under the Financial Administration Act**
- The **Minister of Natural Resources** is designated as the **appropriate Minister with respect to the Canadian Energy Regulator** under the *Financial Administration Act*.
- This designation:
  - Grants the Minister the authority to approve the use of public funds by the CER.
  - Enables the Minister to provide financial oversight and ensure that the CER's expenditures are consistent with federal fiscal policies and accountability standards.
  - Ensures compliance with the government’s financial governance framework, including budgetary controls and audit requirements.

### **3. Historical Context and Legislative References**

- **S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 10**: This is the **current statutory enactment** that formally establishes the designation. It reflects a recent update or confirmation of the ministerial responsibility, possibly in response to structural changes in energy governance or administrative reorganization.
- **S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 69(2)**: This earlier provision established the general principle that the Minister of Natural Resources could be designated as the responsible Minister for the CER. It provides the foundational legal basis for such designations.
- **R.S., c. F-11**: Refers to the *Regulations of the Financial Administration Act*, which implement the financial oversight provisions and define how "appropriate Minister" designations are applied in practice.

### **4. Purpose and Objectives of the Regulation**

The primary objectives of this regulation are:

1. **Clarity of Responsibility**: To clearly assign the Minister of Natural Resources as the lead federal minister accountable for the Canadian Energy Regulator.
2. **Effective Governance**: To ensure that the CER operates under clear ministerial leadership, with policy coherence and accountability.
3. **Financial Accountability**: To ensure that the CER’s financial activities are subject to the oversight of the appropriate Minister under federal financial administration rules.
4. **Legal Continuity**: To maintain consistency in ministerial designation despite changes in government or ministerial appointments.

---

### **5. Implications and Practical Effects**

- **Policy Direction**: The Minister of Natural Resources sets the regulatory priorities and policy framework for the CER, influencing decisions on market rules, licensing, and environmental standards.
- **Budget Approval**: The Minister has the authority to approve the CER’s annual budget and financial plans, ensuring alignment with broader government priorities.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination**: The designation facilitates coordination between the Department of Natural Resources and other departments (e.g., Environment and Climate Change, Transport) on cross-cutting energy issues.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The designation supports transparency by clearly identifying who is responsible for the CER’s operations and financial performance.

---

### **6. Jurisdiction and Scope**

- The designation applies specifically to:
  - The **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)**.
  - Activities related to **energy regulation** under the CERA, including electricity, natural gas, and oil markets.
- It does **not** extend to other regulatory bodies (e.g., the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission or the Canadian Transportation Agency), which have separate ministerial designations.

---

### **7. Review and Potential Changes**

- This designation is **not permanent** and may be reviewed or modified by the Governor General in Council upon recommendation of the Prime Minister, especially if:
  - There is a change in government or cabinet structure.
  - The energy regulatory landscape evolves (e.g., new energy technologies or market developments).
  - A different minister is better suited to oversee energy regulation (e.g., a Minister of Energy or Climate Change).

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally assigns the **Minister of Natural Resources** as both the **Minister responsible for the Canadian Energy Regulator** under the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* and as the **appropriate Minister** under the *Financial Administration Act*. It ensures that the CER operates under clear, accountable, and legally grounded ministerial leadership, with both policy and financial oversight. The regulation builds upon earlier legislative foundations and reflects the government’s commitment to effective and transparent energy regulation in Canada.

---

**Note**: While the regulation is technically correct, it is important to note that the **Minister of Natural Resources** has been succeeded in recent years by the **Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry** or the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, depending on the government. The designation may be subject to administrative or ministerial realignment in practice. Always verify current ministerial responsibilities in the most recent government announcements.
