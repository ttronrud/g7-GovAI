**Title:** Designation of the Minister of Supply and Services as the Appropriate Minister for the Queens Quay West Land Corporation

**Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. Specifically, it draws upon two key provisions of the Act:

1. **Paragraph (d) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act** – This provision allows for the designation of a Minister as the "appropriate Minister" for a particular entity or purpose, typically to ensure proper oversight and accountability in financial administration.

2. **Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in subsection 83(1) of the Financial Administration Act** – This clause applies in the context of financial management and reporting requirements related to Crown corporations. It provides the legal basis for designating a Minister to oversee financial matters involving a Crown corporation.

**Action Taken:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) has officially **designated the Minister of Supply and Services** as the **appropriate Minister** with respect to the **Queens Quay West Land Corporation (QQWLC)**.

**Purpose of the Designation:**  
This designation establishes the Minister of Supply and Services as the responsible official under the Financial Administration Act for all financial administration, reporting, oversight, and compliance matters related to the Queens Quay West Land Corporation. This includes:

- Ensuring the corporation adheres to financial accountability standards;

- Providing oversight in accordance with federal financial management rules;
- Acting as the point of contact between the corporation and the federal government for financial and administrative purposes.

**Context and Significance:**  
The Queens Quay West Land Corporation is a Crown corporation established to manage land and property located along Queens Quay in Toronto.

**Governance Implication:**  
By designating the Minister of Supply and Services as the appropriate Minister, the federal government assigns a specific ministerial responsibility to oversee the financial health and compliance of the corporation. This strengthens the connection between the corporation and the federal government’s financial oversight framework and may also facilitate coordination with other departments, such as those involved in infrastructure, land use, or public service delivery.

**Legal Basis:**  
The designation is valid and enforceable under the Financial Administration Act, specifically:
- Section 2 (definition of "appropriate Minister");
- Subsection 83(1), subparagraph (a)(ii) (which applies to Crown corporations).

**Effective Date:**  
While not explicitly stated in the text, such designations are generally effective upon issuance and are considered to take immediate effect.
