### **Regulation Summary: Authorization to Prescribe Fees for Certification Services of Canadian Films and Videotapes**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under the authority of:
- **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**  
  This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Communications and the Treasury Board) to authorize the Minister of Communications to prescribe fees for certain government services.

#### **2. Scope of the Authorization**
The Minister of Communications is authorized to issue **regulatory orders** (i.e., fee schedules) that establish fees to be paid by **private sector entities** for specific services related to the certification of Canadian films and videotapes.

These services fall into two distinct categories:

---

#### **Category 1: Certification of Films/Videotapes with Principal Photography or Taping Commencing on or After January 1, 1982**

- **Eligibility Criteria**:  
  The film or videotape must have had its **principal photography or taping** (i.e., the main filming or recording phase) begin on or after **January 1, 1982**.

- **Services Covered**:  
  Fees are to be prescribed for services provided in connection with the **certification** of such productions.

- **Purpose of Certification**:  
  This certification is likely intended to confirm that the film or videotape meets Canadian content requirements (such as Canadian ownership, production, or creative contribution), which may be relevant for eligibility for government funding, tax incentives, or broadcasting rights.

- **Fee Implication**:  
  Private sector parties (e.g., production companies, distributors, or service providers) must pay fees when seeking certification for films or videos that began production on or after January 1, 1982.

---

#### **Category 2: Review Services for Applications for Advance Rulings, Provisional Approvals, or Denials of Certificates**

- **Eligibility Criteria**:  
  The film or videotape must have had its principal photography or taping commence **at any time after May 25, 1976**.

- **Services Covered**:  
  Fees are to be prescribed for services related to the **review of applications** for:
  - **Advance rulings** (pre-approval of a certification decision),
  - **Provisional approvals** (temporary certification pending final review), or
  - **Certificates intended to be denied** (i.e., applications where the Minister intends to reject certification).

- **Purpose of Review Services**:  
  This provision allows the Minister to assess whether a film or video qualifies for certification (or whether it should be denied), and it includes the administrative and evaluative work performed during this review process.

- **Fee Implication**:  
  Private sector applicants must pay fees when their application for an advance ruling, provisional approval, or a certificate that is being considered for denial is reviewed by the Minister’s office.

#### **3. Key Features of the Regulation**

- **Private Sector Application**:  
  The fees apply specifically to **private sector entities**, not to government agencies or public institutions.

- **Prescriptive Power**:  
  The Minister of Communications is empowered to **prescribe the exact amount and structure of fees** through a formal order, which may be updated or modified over time.

- **Historical Milestones**:  
  The two date thresholds (January 1, 1982, and May 25, 1976) reflect the evolution of Canadian content policy and the timing of regulatory frameworks related to film and video certification.

- **Regulatory Flexibility**:  
  The use of "prescribe" allows the Minister to tailor fees to current market conditions, administrative costs, and policy objectives.

---

#### **4. Policy and Economic Rationale**

- **Revenue Generation**:  
  The fees provide a source of revenue for the government to fund the administration of certification processes.

- **Cost Recovery**:  
  The fees help cover the administrative, evaluative, and compliance costs associated with reviewing film and video applications.

- **Encouraging Compliance**:  
  By making certification services financially accessible (and transparent), the regulation supports the development of a consistent and accountable Canadian content ecosystem.

- **Support for Canadian Industry**:  
  Certification helps ensure that Canadian content is recognized and supported in broadcasting, distribution, and funding programs.

---

#### **5. Implications for Industry Participants**

- Production companies, distributors, and other private parties involved in Canadian film or video production must:
  - Be aware of the applicable fee schedules based on the production date.
  - Pay fees when submitting applications for certification or when seeking review of a certification decision.
  - Ensure compliance with the fee structure as prescribed by the Minister in subsequent orders.

- The regulation may influence production planning and budgeting, particularly for projects beginning production after 1976 or 1982.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation authorizes the Minister of Communications to establish and adjust fees for private sector entities seeking certification of Canadian films and videotapes. It applies to two key periods:
1. All productions beginning on or after **January 1, 1982**, for standard certification services.
2. All productions beginning after **May 25, 1976**, when applications are being reviewed for advance rulings, provisional approvals, or denials.

The regulation ensures transparency, cost recovery, and administrative efficiency in the certification process, supporting Canada’s national content policy and the growth of its film and video industries.
