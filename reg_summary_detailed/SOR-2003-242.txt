---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Bank Act (Canada)**, specifically through the following provisions:

- **Paragraph 474(b)a** – Allows for exemptions from approval requirements for certain banking activities.
- **Paragraph 522.23(b)b** – Pertains to foreign banks and their associated entities, particularly regarding acquisitions and control.
- **Paragraph 936(b)c** – Relates to bank holding companies and their investments in affiliated entities.
- **Section 978c of the Bank Act** – Provides a general framework for exemptions from regulatory approval in specific circumstances involving intragroup transactions.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **exempt certain investments by banks, foreign banks, or bank holding companies in intragroup service entities** from the requirement of prior regulatory approval — provided that the services provided by these entities are **limited to serving the bank or its group members**.

This exemption facilitates operational efficiency and internal coordination within financial groups by allowing banks to establish or expand service subsidiaries (such as IT, legal, accounting, or administrative services) that support the group’s operations without needing to go through lengthy and costly regulatory review processes.

### **Key Provisions and Exemptions**

#### 1. **Exemption under Subsections 468(5) and (6) of the Bank Act**
- **Applies to:** A bank’s acquisition of control of, or an increase in a substantial investment in, an entity that falls under **paragraph 468(4)(c)** of the Bank Act.
- **Condition for exemption:** The entity’s financial intermediary activities — those that expose it to **material market or credit risk** — must be **limited to providing services exclusively to the bank or members of the bank’s group**.
- **What this means:** If the entity only provides non-interest-bearing, operational, or administrative services (e.g., payroll, legal, IT, human resources) to the parent bank or its affiliates, and does not engage in traditional financial intermediation (like lending, deposit-taking, or trading), then the acquisition or investment is exempt from approval under subsections 468(5) and (6).

> ⚠️ *Note:* This exemption does not apply if the entity engages in financial activities that carry market or credit risk outside the group.

#### 2. **Exemption under Paragraph 522.22(1)(b) of the Bank Act**
- **Applies to:** A foreign bank or an entity associated with a foreign bank acquiring control of another entity.
- **Condition for exemption:** The financial intermediary activities of the controlled entity that expose it to **material market or credit risk** must be **limited to providing services exclusively to the foreign bank or its group members**.
- **Implication:** This allows foreign banks to establish or acquire service entities within their own group (e.g., in Canada or elsewhere) without needing approval from Canadian regulators, as long as those entities do not perform financial intermediation that could pose systemic or credit risks to external parties.

> 🌍 *Relevance:* This supports cross-border banking operations and allows foreign banks to integrate internal service functions efficiently without triggering Canadian regulatory scrutiny.

#### 3. **Exemption under Subsections 930(5) and (6) of the Bank Act**
- **Applies to:** A bank holding company’s acquisition of control of, or increase in a substantial investment in, an entity falling under **paragraph 930(4)(c)** of the Bank Act.
- **Condition for exemption:** The financial intermediary activities of the entity that expose it to **material market or credit risk** must be **limited to providing services exclusively to the bank holding company or its group members**.
- **Scope:** This extends the exemption to **bank holding companies** — entities that own multiple banks — enabling them to acquire or invest in service entities that support their group without regulatory approval.

> 💼 *Example:* A bank holding company may acquire a software development firm that only serves its internal banks and does not offer services to the public or third parties.

### **Definition of "Financial Intermediary Activities"**

The regulation hinges on the concept of **financial intermediary activities** — those that involve taking deposits, making loans, trading securities, or engaging in other activities that expose the entity to **market or credit risk**.

- If such activities are **restricted to internal group use**, they are considered non-risky and do not constitute financial intermediation in the traditional sense.
- Any service that involves **external exposure** (e.g., lending to non-group customers, accepting public deposits, trading in financial instruments for third parties) would fall outside the scope of this exemption.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures immediate applicability upon publication, allowing banks and bank holding companies to begin operating under the new exemption without delay.

### **Regulatory Significance and Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Operational Flexibility** | Banks can create or acquire internal service entities (e.g., IT, compliance, legal) without regulatory hurdles. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Reduces administrative and compliance costs associated with regulatory approvals. |
| **Risk Management** | Encourages risk containment by limiting exposure to external market or credit risk. |
| **Group Integration** | Promotes better coordination and efficiency within banking groups. |
| **Systemic Risk Consideration** | The requirement that services be "exclusively for the group" helps ensure that the financial system is not exposed to unintended risks from internal service providers. |

---

### **Legal and Policy Background**

This regulation reflects a broader regulatory philosophy in Canada’s banking framework: **promoting efficiency and stability through targeted exemptions**, especially when internal operations do not pose systemic risks.

It aligns with international practices where financial groups are allowed to operate efficiently through internal service providers, as long as such activities are non-financial and non-risk-exposed to external parties.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Exemption from Approval for Certain Investments in Intragroup Service Entities (Bank Act) Regulations** provides a clear, risk-based exemption from regulatory approval for banks, foreign banks, and bank holding companies when they invest in or acquire control of service entities that:

- Provide services **exclusively to the bank or its group**; and  
- Do **not engage in financial intermediary activities** that expose them to material market or credit risk.

This regulation streamlines internal governance, enhances operational efficiency, and supports the stability of the financial system by ensuring that only non-risky, group-specific services are exempt from approval.
