> ⚠️ **Exclusion**: Railways that do **not** relate to passenger services are governed by different provisions (see Schedule 2).

### 🔹 **4. What Constitutes Adequate Third Party Liability Insurance Coverage?**

Coverage is considered **adequate** if all of the following conditions are met:

#### ✅ 1. **Sufficient Financial Protection**
There must be sufficient insurance (or self-insurance) to cover:
- Third-party bodily injury or death (including passengers)
- Third-party property damage (excluding cargo)
- Named perils pollution

#### ✅ 2. **Full Disclosure to the Agency**
The applicant must provide a **written confirmation** to the Agency that:
- They have fully disclosed to the insurer the **nature and extent** of the proposed construction or operation of the railway
- Any associated third-party liability risks

#### ✅ 3. **Full Disclosure to the Agency of Self-Insurance Details**
The applicant must disclose to the Agency:
- The **amount of self-insured retention (SIR)**
- The **third-party liability risks** associated with the proposed railway project

> 💡 This ensures transparency and allows the Agency to assess whether the applicant can realistically bear these risks.

### 🔹 **5. How the Agency Assesses Adequacy of Insurance**

The Agency evaluates whether coverage is adequate by:

#### 🔍 **For All Applicants (Construction or Passenger Rail Operations):**
The Agency examines the **risks associated with the railway project**, including:
- Passenger ridership
- Passenger and freight train miles
- Volume of railway traffic
- Class and volume of **dangerous goods transported**
- Types of **population areas served**
- Number of **level crossings**
- Train speed
- Crew training standards
- Method of train control (e.g., automatic signaling)
- Overall **safety record** of the applicant

> These factors help determine the likelihood and severity of potential incidents that could result in third-party claims.

#### 🔍 **For Self-Insurance Cases Only:**
The Agency assesses the **financial capability** of the applicant to sustain the level of self-insurance based on:
- The **three most recent annual financial reports** filed with the Agency under **section 344 of the Railway Act** (as it existed before the 1996 amendments), or
- If those reports are unavailable: **audited financial statements** for the three most recent fiscal years
- If neither is available: **other financial information** that demonstrates financial stability and ability to meet self-insurance obligations

> 📌 This ensures that self-insurance is not used as a substitute for adequate risk management in financially unstable organizations.
