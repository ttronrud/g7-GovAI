Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers and Amalgamation of Departments**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under the authority of:
- **Paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*  
- **Paragraph 2(b)** of the same Act

This means the transfer and amalgamation of departments are not arbitrary but are grounded in a specific legislative framework designed to reorganize the federal public service and streamline government operations.

---

#### **2. Key Actions Taken**

##### **A. Transfer of Control and Supervision**
- The **control and supervision** of certain portions of the *Department of the Secretary of State* are being **transferred to the Department of Communications**.
- Specifically, these portions are those referenced in:
  - **Clauses (a)(i)(A) to (C)** of **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1489**, dated June 25, 1993
  - **S.I. 93-143**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, page 3235*

> This means that specific functions or units within the former Department of the Secretary of State (which was a broad, overarching department) are now placed under the administrative oversight of the Department of Communications.

##### **B. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**
- All powers, duties, and functions of the **Secretary of State of Canada** under any Act of Parliament are being transferred to the **Minister of Communications**, **except** for those specifically excluded in:
  - **Paragraph (b)** of **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1901**, dated November 4, 1993
  - **S.I. 93-201**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, page 3996*

> This is a broad transfer of authority, meaning the Minister of Communications now assumes responsibility for the Secretary of State’s statutory responsibilities—**except** for those functions explicitly retained elsewhere (e.g., specific responsibilities related to certain policy areas or administrative functions).

##### **C. Transfer of Powers from the Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship**
- All powers, duties, and functions of the **Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship** under any Act of Parliament are being transferred to the **Minister of Communications**, **except**:
  - The powers, duties, and functions relating to **citizenship**, which were previously transferred to the Secretary of State of Canada under **subparagraph (a)(iv)** of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1901.

> This indicates a **partial transfer**—the Minister of Communications takes over most of the multiculturalism and citizenship-related responsibilities, **excluding citizenship**, which remains under the Secretary of State.

---

#### **3. Amalgamation of Departments**
- Pursuant to **paragraph 2(b)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, the following departments are being **amalgamated**:
  - The **Department of Communications**
  - The **Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship**

> These two departments are now combined under:
- A **single Minister of Communications**
- A **Deputy Minister of Communications** who will oversee the combined department

This reflects a major structural reform aimed at reducing bureaucratic duplication, improving coordination, and enhancing efficiency in government operations.

---

#### **4. Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**
While not explicitly stated in the text, the underlying goals of this regulation are likely:
- **Streamlining government operations** by consolidating overlapping responsibilities
- **Improving interdepartmental coordination**, especially between communications and multicultural policy
- **Enhancing accountability** by placing related functions under a single ministerial umbrella
- **Reflecting evolving policy priorities**, such as the growing importance of communications infrastructure and cultural diversity in a modern, interconnected society

---

#### **5. Important Exclusions**
- **Citizenship functions** remain with the **Secretary of State of Canada** (not transferred to the Minister of Communications)
- Certain functions within the Department of the Secretary of State are **excluded** from the transfer (as specified in paragraph (b) of Order P.C. 1993-1901)

> These exclusions ensure that critical functions—particularly those involving national identity, immigration, and citizenship—are preserved under the appropriate ministerial and legal framework.

---

#### **6. Legal and Administrative Impact**
- The transfer is **not a mere reorganization** but a formal delegation of **statutory powers and duties**.
- The **Minister of Communications** now holds expanded authority, including responsibilities previously held by two separate ministers.
- The **Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship** ceases to exist as a standalone entity and becomes a component of the Department of Communications.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant **restructuring of the Canadian federal public service** in the early 1990s. It:
- Transfers key functions from the Secretary of State to the Minister of Communications
- Amalgamates the Department of Communications and the Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship
- Preserves critical functions—especially those related to citizenship—under the Secretary of State
- Establishes a more centralized, efficient, and coherent structure for managing communications and multicultural policy

It reflects a broader trend in Canadian government reform during the 1990s toward **minimizing departmental duplication**, **enhancing ministerial accountability**, and **aligning government structures with evolving societal needs**.
