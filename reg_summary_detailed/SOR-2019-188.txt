### **Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under **Section 58 of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)***, which establishes a legal framework for identifying, protecting, and managing the **critical habitat** of designated wildlife species at risk. The Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) Boreal population is classified as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**.

The recovery strategy for this species, which includes a detailed map and description of its **critical habitat**, has been officially registered in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**—a public database maintained by the Government of Canada to ensure transparency and accessibility of species-at-risk information.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

#### 1. **Exclusion of Certain Areas from Critical Habitat Designation**
Under **Section 58(2)** of SARA, certain types of land are automatically excluded from being designated as critical habitat. These exclusions include:

- **Indian Reserves** (lands set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation under the *Indian Act*);
- **Lands under the authority of Parks Canada Agency** (i.e., national parks, protected areas, and other lands managed by Parks Canada);
- **Lands in the Yukon** under the administration of the **Commissioner of the Yukon**;
- **Lands in the Northwest Territories** under the administration of the **Commissioner of the Northwest Territories**.

> This means that even though these areas may contain essential habitat features for the caribou, they are not subject to the critical habitat designation rules because they are managed by other federal institutions or under Indigenous or territorial jurisdiction.

#### 2. **Application of Section 58(1) – Scope of the Order**
Section 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Woodland Caribou Boreal population **except** for the areas excluded under Section 58(2). Therefore, this Order designates the **remaining portions** of the critical habitat that are not in the above-mentioned categories as legally protected under SARA.

This ensures that only those areas not under the direct administrative control of Parks Canada, the Yukon, or the Northwest Territories—nor on Indian reserves—are subject to the legal protections and management obligations associated with critical habitat.

#### 3. **Consultation Requirement (Section 58(5) and 58(9))**
- The **Minister of the Environment** (who also serves as the Minister responsible for Parks Canada) is required, under **Section 58(5)**, to consult with **all other competent federal ministers** before issuing a critical habitat order.
- The Minister has conducted such consultations with relevant federal departments and agencies, particularly those with jurisdiction over lands where the critical habitat may overlap (e.g., Indigenous Services Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and other agencies).
- This consultation process ensures that the order does not impose undue impacts on other federal responsibilities or land uses.

#### 4. **Legal Authority**
The Minister of the Environment issues this Order **pursuant to Sections 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA:
- **Section 58(4)**: Grants the Minister the authority to make orders defining the critical habitat.
- **Section 58(5)**: Requires consultation with other federal ministers and mandates that the order be made only after such consultation.

### **Purpose and Significance**

This Order serves several key purposes:

1. **Conservation Protection**: It formally identifies and legally protects the essential areas required for the survival and recovery of the Woodland Caribou Boreal population.
2. **Jurisdictional Clarity**: It clearly delineates which lands are subject to critical habitat regulations and which are exempt due to existing federal or Indigenous land management responsibilities.
3. **Inter-Governmental Coordination**: By requiring consultation with other federal ministers, it promotes collaboration and avoids conflicts between environmental protection goals and other government mandates (e.g., land use, Indigenous rights, tourism, infrastructure development).
4. **Compliance with SARA Requirements**: It ensures full compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements of SARA, particularly regarding transparency, public access, and inter-ministerial consultation.

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Statutes of Canada (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette). This ensures immediate legal effect once the regulation is officially recognized.

### **Implications for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Implications |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Environmental Agencies** | Must avoid activities that degrade or destroy the designated critical habitat. |
| **Parks Canada** | Is not required to regulate the critical habitat on lands under its authority—this is outside the scope of the Order. |
| **Indigenous Communities** | Land within reserves is excluded; however, Indigenous rights and interests in those areas remain protected under other legislation (e.g., *Indian Act*, *Crown-Indigenous Relations*). |
| **Provincial and Territorial Governments** | May need to coordinate with federal agencies on land-use planning, especially in areas where critical habitat overlaps with provincial lands. |
| **Developers & Industry** | Any proposed projects (e.g., roads, logging, mining) that may affect the designated critical habitat must undergo environmental assessments and obtain permits under SARA and other relevant laws. |

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* that formally designates the critical habitat of the Woodland Caribou Boreal population—excluding areas under the jurisdiction of Parks Canada, Indigenous reserves, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories. It reflects a balanced approach to species conservation, recognizing both ecological needs and the complex web of federal land management responsibilities. The requirement for inter-ministerial consultation ensures that the order is both scientifically sound and politically and administratively feasible.

By protecting the remaining areas of critical habitat, the Order supports the long-term recovery of this threatened species and strengthens Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation.
