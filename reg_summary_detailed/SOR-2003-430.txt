**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under **paragraph 36(1)(b) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General to make regulations concerning the transfer of functions, responsibilities, or personnel within the Public Service, particularly when such transfers are related to the operation of agencies or branches.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **transfer specific portions of the Operations Branch of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** to a new administrative or operational structure. Specifically, it pertains to the **passenger and initial import inspection services** conducted at **airports and other Canadian border points**, excluding import service centres.

**Scope of the Transfer:**

- The transfer applies to **portions of the Operations Branch** of the CFIA.
- These portions are responsible for delivering **passenger inspection services** and **initial import inspection services**.
- The services are provided at **airports and other Canadian border points** (e.g., seaports, land border crossings).
- **Exclusions**: Import service centres are explicitly excluded from this transfer.

**Applicability of Public Service Employment Act Provisions:**

Subsections **37.3(1) and (37.3(2)) of the Public Service Employment Act** apply to all individuals who are **employed or engaged** in the Public Service within the CFIA and who work in the transferred portions of the Operations Branch.

These subsections govern:
- The **rights, duties, and conditions of employment** of public servants.
- The **protection of employees’ status**, including job security, terms of employment, and entitlements, during and after the transfer.
- Ensuring that the transfer does not result in unfair treatment or adverse impacts on employees' employment rights.

This means that employees in the transferred functions will be subject to the same employment standards, protections, and procedures as other public servants under the PSEA.

**Effective Date:**

The regulation comes into force on **December 12, 2003**. All provisions, including the application of the Public Service Employment Act, take effect from this date.

**Implications:**

- The transfer reflects a **restructuring of border inspection responsibilities** within the CFIA, likely to improve efficiency, streamline operations, or align with broader border management goals.
- It ensures that employees involved in these services are protected under the Public Service Employment Act, preserving their employment rights during the transition.
- The exclusion of import service centres indicates that the transfer is focused on **air and land border entry points**, where passenger and initial import inspections are conducted, rather than centralized import processing facilities.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally transfers certain operational responsibilities within the CFIA’s Operations Branch—specifically those related to passenger and initial import inspections at airports and non-centre border points—to a new administrative framework. It ensures that all affected employees are covered under the Public Service Employment Act, safeguarding their employment rights and conditions. The regulation is effective as of December 12, 2003, and represents a structural adjustment within Canada’s food and border inspection system.
