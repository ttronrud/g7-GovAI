**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Policy Research Initiative  

**Governing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  

**Legal Basis:**  
Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)  

**Key Provision:**  
Effective **June 1, 2006**, the control and supervision of the **Policy Research Initiative (PRI)**—a component of the federal public administration within the **Privy Council Office (PCO)**—is transferred from the Privy Council Office to the **Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (HRSD)**.

**Background and Context:**  
The Privy Council Office is a central institution in the Canadian federal government responsible for supporting the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. It oversees key administrative and policy functions, including the coordination of government operations, the management of official communications, and the provision of policy advice.

The Policy Research Initiative (PRI) is a unit within the PCO that conducts research and analysis to support government decision-making. It produces evidence-based policy studies, evaluates the effectiveness of public programs, and provides recommendations to Cabinet and senior ministers. Prior to this transfer, the PRI operated under the administrative oversight of the Privy Council Office.

**Nature of the Transfer:**  
This regulation constitutes a formal reorganization of federal public service responsibilities. Specifically, it involves:

- A **transfer of administrative control and supervision** of the Policy Research Initiative from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.  
- The transfer does **not** involve the physical relocation or staffing changes, but rather a shift in **governance, policy direction, and operational oversight**.  
- The PRI continues to carry out its core mandate—conducting research and policy analysis—but now operates under the authority and strategic direction of HRSD.

---

**Rationale and Implications:**  
The transfer reflects a broader government initiative to restructure and streamline public service functions, aligning policy research activities more closely with human resource and skills development priorities. The Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, responsible for workforce planning, training, and talent development, is positioned to better integrate research findings into human capital strategies.

Key implications include:

- Enhanced alignment between policy research and workforce development goals.  
- Potential for improved coordination between research outputs and the design of public service programs.  
- A shift in the institutional culture of policy research, with greater emphasis on practical, skills-based outcomes.  
- The PRI may now be expected to produce research with a stronger focus on workforce needs, training, and skills development.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal public service. By transferring the Policy Research Initiative from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, the government sought to strengthen the integration of policy research with workforce development initiatives. The move underscores a strategic shift toward evidence-based human resource planning and aligns with broader goals of improving the effectiveness and responsiveness of public services.
