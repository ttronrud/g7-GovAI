The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-187, s. 17]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or replaced) by **Schedule 17 of the Statutory Rules of 2016 (SOR/2016-187)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repealing Instrument**: Schedule 17 of the Statutory Rules of 2016 (SOR/2016-187) specifically includes **section 17**, which lists the provisions being repealed.
- **Purpose of the Original Regulation (inferred)**: Although the original content of the regulation is not provided, the repeated reference to "s. 17" suggests that the regulation likely dealt with a specific area of law—possibly related to licensing, compliance, or administrative procedures—common in provincial or federal regulatory frameworks (e.g., in Ontario or another jurisdiction where SORs are used).
