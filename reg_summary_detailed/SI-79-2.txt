The primary objective is to:
- Support the competitiveness of Canadian air carriers operating internationally.
- Encourage investment in aircraft maintenance, safety, and operational efficiency by reducing the cost of essential components and supplies.
- Align tax incentives with actual international service usage, ensuring that tax relief is proportional to the extent of international operations.

### 🔹 **Key Definitions (in English and French)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Aircraft parts and equipment** | Includes components such as engines, avionics, structural parts, and safety equipment (e.g., life vests, fire extinguishers) intended for incorporation into an aircraft or engine. |
| **Available ton miles** | Revenue miles (miles flown for which revenue is earned) multiplied by the payload capacity (in tons) of the aircraft. Measures total operational capacity used in commercial service. |
| **Commissary and passenger convenience item** | Items used for food and drink preparation or passenger comfort (e.g., seating cushions, in-flight entertainment, beverages). |
| **Eligible carrier** | A Canadian-incorporated commercial air carrier licensed by the **Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)** to provide **international air services** to the public. |
| **Fleet** | All qualifying aircraft owned or leased by an eligible carrier that have been used in commercial air service at any time. |
| **International flight** | Any flight that does **not** originate and terminate in Canada (i.e., flights with at least one foreign stop). |
| **International usage percentage** | The ratio of available ton miles flown on **international flights** during a calendar year to the **total available ton miles** flown by the fleet during that year. This is the key metric determining tax remission. |
| **Materials** | Components or substances intended for incorporation into an aircraft or engine (e.g., composite materials, wiring, seals). |
| **Payload capacity** | Maximum take-off weight (as per Transport Canada) minus the aircraft’s actual weight and fuel load at flight start. |
| **Qualifying aircraft** | Fixed-wing aircraft with a **maximum take-off weight on wheels exceeding 75,000 pounds** (approximately 34 metric tons). |
| **Revenue miles** | Miles flown in connection with passenger or cargo transport for which the carrier receives payment. |
| **Year** | A calendar year (January 1 to December 31). |

### 🔹 **Scope of Tax Remission**

Two types of remission are granted:

#### 1. **Remission of Customs Duties on Aircraft Parts & Equipment**
- Applies to **aircraft parts and equipment** purchased in Canada or imported into Canada **on or after January 1, 1975**.
- The remission covers a **portion** of the customs duty payable under the **Customs Tariff**.
- The **percentage of remission** is equal to the **international usage percentage** of the carrier’s fleet for the calendar year in which the goods were purchased or imported.

> ✅ Example: If a carrier's fleet flew 60% of its available ton miles internationally in 1976, then 60% of the customs duty on eligible parts/equipment purchased in 1976 will be remitted.

#### 2. **Remission of Customs, Sales, and Excise Taxes on Materials & Commissary Items**
- Applies to **materials** (for aircraft/engine integration) and **commissary/passenger convenience items** (e.g., food, drinks, seating items).
- Remission covers:
  - Customs duty
  - Sales tax
  - Excise tax
  - All under the **Customs Tariff** and the **Excise Tax Act**
- Again, the **remission percentage equals the international usage percentage** of the fleet for the relevant year.

> ⚠️ Note: This remission applies only to goods used in **qualifying aircraft** providing commercial air service.

### 🔹 **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for remission, the following **conditions must be met**:

1. **Application Requirement**  
   - The eligible carrier must submit a formal application to the **Deputy Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise)**.
   - The application must be submitted **not later than four years after the end of the year** in which the goods were purchased or imported.

2. **Declaration of Compliance**  
   - The application must include a **certification** that:
     - The goods were **purchased in Canada** or **imported into Canada** by the carrier.
     - The goods were **used in qualifying aircraft** to provide **commercial air service**.

> ❌ Failure to meet either condition results in denial of remission.

### 🔹 **Key Features & Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Usage-Based Remission** | Tax relief is directly tied to the proportion of international operations. Carriers with higher international usage receive greater tax relief. This incentivizes international service expansion. |
| **Start Date (January 1, 1975)** | The remission only applies to goods purchased or imported from that date onward. This ensures the policy is applied to modernized, post-1975 operations. |
| **Proportional Relief** | No full remission; only a percentage (equal to international usage) is granted. Prevents abuse and ensures fairness. |
| **Excludes Domestic Use** | Goods used solely in domestic flights are not eligible. The policy targets international service. |
| **Fleet-Based Calculation** | The international usage percentage is calculated based on the entire fleet — not individual aircraft — ensuring a holistic view of operations. |
| **Time Limit for Application** | Four-year deadline ensures timely processing and compliance, reducing administrative burden. |

### 🔹 **Policy Rationale & Economic Impact**

- **Supports Canadian Airline Competitiveness**: Reduces operating costs for carriers engaged in international routes, improving their ability to compete globally.
- **Encourages Investment in Maintenance & Safety**: By lowering the cost of parts and equipment, the policy promotes better aircraft maintenance and safety standards.
- **Aligns Tax Policy with Operational Reality**: Ensures that tax incentives reflect actual international service activity, avoiding over-reliance on domestic operations.
- **Promotes Efficiency**: Encourages carriers to optimize their fleets for international routes, potentially increasing route diversity and service quality.

### 🔹 **Relevance to Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-----------|---------|
| **Canadian Air Carriers** | Direct financial benefit through reduced tax costs on essential parts and supplies. |
| **Government (Minister of National Revenue)** | Maintains fiscal discipline while supporting strategic sectors (aviation). |
| **Aviation Industry** | Enhances competitiveness and operational sustainability. |
| **Taxpayers** | No direct impact; the remission is a targeted benefit to specific commercial operations. |

### 🔹 **Historical Context**
- The original **Aircraft (Combined Services) Remission Order (P.C. 1970-356)** was broad and applied to both domestic and international services.
- This revised order **narrows the scope** to focus exclusively on **international commercial air service**, reflecting changes in Canada’s aviation strategy and international market dynamics.
- The 1971 amendment (SOR/71-50) likely clarified administrative procedures and definitions.

### 🔹 **Conclusion**

The **Aircraft (International Service) Remission Order** is a targeted, usage-based tax incentive designed to support Canadian commercial air carriers in their international operations. By linking remission to the actual international usage of a fleet, it ensures that financial benefits are aligned with real-world service patterns. It provides measurable cost savings for eligible carriers while maintaining fiscal accountability and administrative oversight through clear eligibility criteria and time-bound application requirements.

This regulation represents a pragmatic approach to balancing national fiscal policy with the operational realities of the aviation sector.
