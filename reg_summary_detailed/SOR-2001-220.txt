**Detailed Summary of the Nunavut Archaeological and Palaeontological Sites Regulations (S.C. 1993, c. 28)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Nunavut Archaeological and Palaeontological Sites Regulations* were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, under subsection 51(1) of the *Nunavut Act*. These regulations came into force on **June 15, 2001**, and establish a comprehensive legal framework for the protection, management, and research of archaeological and palaeontological sites in Nunavut.

The regulations are designed to balance scientific research and cultural heritage preservation with the rights and interests of Inuit communities, particularly in relation to land ownership, traditional knowledge, and cultural stewardship. They are grounded in the **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA)**, signed on May 25, 1993, which recognizes Inuit land rights and establishes shared responsibilities for managing cultural and natural heritage.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Archaeological Artifact** | Any tangible evidence of human activity older than 50 years, where there is no unbroken chain of possession or regular pattern of use. Includes Denesuline archaeological specimens as defined in section 40.4.9 of the NLCA. |
| **Archaeological Site** | A location where an archaeological artifact is found. |
| **Palaeontological Site** | A location where a fossil is found. |
| **Fossil** | Hardened or preserved remains of organisms or vegetation, including natural casts, tracks, coprolites, plant remains, shells, exoskeletons, eggs, teeth, and bones. |
| **Class 1 Permit** | Allows surveying and documentation of sites without altering or disturbing them. |
| **Class 2 Permit** | Allows surveying, excavation, removal of artifacts or fossils, and other disturbances to sites. |
| **Designated Agency** | As defined in section 33.1.1 of the NLCA — typically the Department of Culture, Heritage and Recreation or a similar body. |

## **Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands and waters in Nunavut**, **except**:
- Areas within the boundaries of a **national park** under the *Canada National Parks Act*;
- Lands designated as **national historic sites of Canada** under section 42 of that Act.

This means that while the rules cover most of Nunavut, protected areas under federal park legislation are exempt from these specific permitting requirements.

## **Prohibition on Possession and Sale (Effective June 15, 2001)**

**No person may possess or sell:**
- An **archaeological artifact** removed from an archaeological site **on or after June 15, 2001**;
- A **fossil** removed from a palaeontological site **on or after June 15, 2001**.

> **Exception:** The prohibition does **not** apply to:
> - Individuals or organizations receiving artifacts/fossils under **section 15 or 16** of the NLCA;
> - Persons or organizations possessing artifacts/fossils under a valid **agreement** with a party referenced in paragraph (a);
> - The **holder of a Class 2 permit**, during the permit term and for **three months after expiry**.

This ensures that legitimate research and cultural stewardship activities are not disrupted by the prohibition.
