### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Authority of the Governor General in Council**  
   The regulation is issued by the Governor General in Council, which is the formal mechanism through which the federal government (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) exercises executive power. This means the decision is not made unilaterally by the Prime Minister but is formally approved and executed under constitutional and statutory authority.

2. **Basis of the Transfer**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)a** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This paragraph grants the government the power to reassign functions, departments, or units within the public service, including the transfer of control and supervision of administrative units, when such a transfer serves public interest or improves administrative efficiency and policy coherence.

3. **Transfer of Function**  
   The specific unit being transferred is the **LGBTQ2 Secretariat**, which is a component within the **Department of Canadian Heritage**.  
   - The **LGBTQ2 Secretariat** historically provided strategic policy advice, coordination, and support for LGBTQ2 (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Two-Spirit) issues within federal government operations.  
   - This includes oversight of federal initiatives, reporting to ministers, and coordination with other departments on LGBTQ2-related policies and programs.

4. **Destination Department**  
   The control and supervision of the LGBTQ2 Secretariat are being transferred to the **Department for Women and Gender Equality** (formerly known as the Department of Women and Gender Equality and Inclusion).  
   - This reflects a broader governmental strategy to integrate gender-based equity and inclusion into policy development and delivery.  
   - The Department for Women and Gender Equality is responsible for advancing gender equality, addressing systemic discrimination, and promoting the rights and well-being of women, girls, and gender-diverse individuals across Canada.

5. **Nature of the Transfer**  
   The transfer involves **control and supervision**, not just administrative delegation. This means:
   - The Department for Women and Gender Equality will now be responsible for the day-to-day management, staffing, budgeting, and operational oversight of the LGBTQ2 Secretariat.
   - The Secretariat will continue to operate as a policy and coordination unit, but now under the leadership and mandate of the Department for Women and Gender Equality.

6. **Policy and Strategic Implications**  
   - The move strengthens the integration of LGBTQ2 issues within broader gender equality frameworks.  
   - It ensures that LGBTQ2 rights and inclusion are not treated as a standalone or isolated issue but are embedded within the larger context of gender equity and social inclusion.  
   - It may also improve policy coherence and resource allocation by aligning LGBTQ2 programming with existing gender equality priorities.

7. **Effective Date and Implementation**  
   While not explicitly stated in the regulation, such transfers are typically effective upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and implementation through internal government directives. The effective date would generally follow the publication date in the official gazette.
