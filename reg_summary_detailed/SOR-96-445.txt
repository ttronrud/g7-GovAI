Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the *Employment Insurance (Fishing) Regulations*, S.C. 1996, c. 23, as approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Human Resources Development under section 153 of the *Employment Insurance Act*.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Employment Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, S.C. 1996, c. 23**

These regulations establish a **specialized framework** for determining **insurable earnings, employer status, benefit eligibility, and benefit periods** for **fishers** under the *Employment Insurance Act (EIA)*. The regulations recognize the unique nature of fishing as a seasonal, often informal, and crew-based occupation where traditional employment relationships do not always apply.

---

### 🔍 1. **Purpose of the Regulations**
To ensure that fishers — who operate under non-traditional employment models — are properly covered under the Employment Insurance (EI) system by:
- Defining key terms relevant to fishing operations,
- Determining who is considered an "employer" in fishing contexts,
- Establishing how insurable earnings are calculated,
- Setting rules for benefit eligibility and benefit period duration,
- Ensuring fair and consistent application of EI rules in a sector with unique economic and operational characteristics.

### 📚 2. **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Employment Insurance Act*. |
| **Buyer** | A person who purchases a catch (raw or processed) for resale, not for personal consumption (food, feed, bait). |
| **Catch** | Any natural product or by-product from the sea or other bodies of water caught by a crew. Includes fresh fish, cured fish, Irish moss, kelp, whales. **Excludes** fish scales and seals. |
| **Crew** | A group of fishers who jointly make a catch. For a single fisher, it refers to that individual. |
| **Cured Fish** | Salted groundfish, smoked herring, pickled mackerel, cod oil, cod livers, etc. |
| **Employer** | A person legally responsible for the fisher’s employment, as defined below. |
| **Fishers** | Self-employed individuals engaged in fishing or incidental work related to fishing (e.g., loading, repairing gear, curing fish), including those involved in constructing fishing vessels. |
| **Fishing Gear** | Specialized equipment used exclusively in making a catch (excludes hand tools or clothing). |
| **Fresh Fish** | Fish that has not been cured. |
| **Major Attachment Claimant** | A claimant with **$3,760 or more** of insurable earnings as a fisher during the qualifying period. |

### 🏢 3. **Determining Employer Status (Critical to EI Coverage)**

This section defines who is considered the **employer** of a fisher — a key factor in determining eligibility for EI benefits and premium obligations.

#### 📌 General Rule:
> **If a catch is delivered to a buyer or their agent**, the **buyer is considered the employer** of all fishers in the crew who share in the proceeds.

#### 📌 Alternative Scenarios:
| Scenario | Employer Status |
|--------|----------------|
| **Catch delivered to a non-buyer (e.g., a buyer’s agent)** and proceeds paid to the **head fisher** | The **head fisher** becomes the employer of the other crew members. |
| **Catch delivered to a non-member agent** | The **agent** becomes the employer of all crew members. |
| **Common agent acting for both crew and buyer** | - If agent is a crew member → agent is employer of others.<br>- If agent is not a crew member → agent is employer of all crew members. |

#### ⚠️ Important Exclusion:
> An employer engaged in **shore-based incidental work** (e.g., maintenance, storage) is **not** considered part of the crew and thus not an employer of the fishers.

#### 💡 Right of Recovery:
> An agent who acts as employer may **recover from the buyer** the employer’s EI premiums paid on their behalf.

### 📊 4. **Insurable Earnings Calculation**

This section governs how much a fisher earns for EI purposes — crucial for determining benefit eligibility.

#### ✅ General Rule:
> **Earnings = Amount received from sale of catch**, after:
> - Deducting the value of any portion of the catch **not caught** by the crew,
> - Deducting **25% of the gross value** of the catch (if the fisher owns or leases the vessel or employs others),
> - Deducting **wages and shares** of other crew members.

#### 📝 Key Provisions:
- **Value of uncaught portion** is set by the **head fisher** or, if agent is employer, by the agent.
- If a fishing trip overlaps with the qualifying period, earnings are **allocated equally across each day** of the trip.
- Earnings **before the first Sunday of the qualifying period** are **not counted**.
- If records are inadequate, the **Department of National Revenue (DNR)** must estimate earnings using:
  - Estimated number of catches,
  - Number of crew members,
  - Gross returns from sales.
- Estimated earnings **cannot exceed gross returns** from all catches during the period.

#### ❌ Exclusions from Earnings:
- Deductions for lay-off or separation (unless specified),
- Payments to non-insured fishers,
- Earnings where records are adequate.

#### 🚨 Special Provision:
> On first inspection, if the employer:
> - Has not had prior record requests,
> - Agrees to maintain adequate records,
> - Agrees to pay any assessed premiums immediately,
> - Acts in good faith,
> Then the DNR may establish earnings based on **oral or written information** and apply EI rules accordingly.

### 📅 5. **Benefit Periods & Qualifying Periods**

The regulations define **when and how long** a fisher can receive EI benefits.

#### 📌 Two Main Benefit Periods (Based on Claim Timing):

| Claim Window | Qualifying Period |
|------------|-------------------|
| **October 1 to June 15 (next year)** | Begins on the latest of:<br>• Sunday in week of March 1 before claim<br>• Sunday of last benefit period<br>• Sunday of 31st week before claim<br>Ends on Saturday before claim week. |
| **April 1 to December 15 (next year)** | Begins on the latest of:<br>• Sunday in week of September 1 before claim<br>• Sunday of last benefit period<br>• Sunday of 31st week before claim<br>Ends on Saturday before claim week. |

> ⚠️ **Note:** These qualifying periods are **not extendable** under subsections 8(2)–(4) of the Act.

#### ✅ To Qualify for a Benefit Period:
- Must **not qualify under section 7** of the EIA (e.g., not eligible due to other reasons),
- Must have accumulated **at least the amount of insurable earnings** required under the **unemployment rate schedule** for the region where they reside.

> [Note: Section 8(4) and (9) were repealed by SOR/2016-206, s.13 — this summary reflects the current version.]

### 📈 6. **Extension of Benefit Periods**

Benefit periods may be extended under specific circumstances to ensure full payment of benefits.

| Extension Reason | Duration |
|------------------|---------|
| **Special benefits under sections 21, 22, 23, 23.1, 23.2, 23.3** | +1 week per week of entitlement; max **52 weeks** |
| **Child hospitalization** during benefit period | Extended by number of hospitalization weeks |
| **Deferral of parental leave or return to duty** | Extended by weeks of deferral or return |
| **Insufficient payment under subsection 12(3)(a), (c), (d), (e), (f)** | Extended so benefits reach the maximum allowed (only if total max > 50 weeks) |
| **Insufficient payment under 12(3)(b)** (with max under 12(3)(b)(ii)) | Extended by **26 weeks** to reach maximum |

> All extensions are subject to **maximums** set in subsections 17 and 18 of the Act.

---

### 📂 7. **Recordkeeping Requirements**

- Employers must maintain **separate records** for fishers from those for other insured persons.
- Records must include:
  - Name, address, and Social Insurance Number (SIN) of each crew member,
  - Each member’s **share of proceeds** from the sale of the catch,
  - Dates of premium payments,
  - Insurable earnings,
  - Details of the catch (e.g., date, location, value).

> Failure to maintain adequate records results in **estimation** of earnings at **5% of estimated earnings**.
