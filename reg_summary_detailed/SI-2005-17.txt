The reference "[Repealed, SI/2016-19]" indicates that the regulation in question has been officially repealed by a statutory instrument (SI) issued in 2016, specifically SI 2016/19.

However, **no specific regulation is named or described** in your query. Therefore, a detailed summary cannot be provided without knowing the actual name or subject matter of the regulation that was repealed by SI 2016/19.

To clarify:

- **"SI/2016-19"** refers to the Statutory Instrument 2016 No. 19, which is a piece of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (or a jurisdiction that uses SI numbering).
- The notation **"[Repealed, SI/2016-19]"** means that the regulation previously listed or cited was formally repealed (cancelled or replaced) by this instrument.
- The repeal typically occurs when a law is outdated, superseded by a new regulation, or no longer needed.

### What a Repeal Means:
When a regulation is repealed:
- It is no longer legally enforceable.
- Its provisions are removed from the legal framework.
- Any obligations, duties, or requirements it imposed are replaced or otherwise addressed by newer legislation.
- The repeal is usually accompanied by a notice in the official government publication (e.g., the Statutory Instruments (SI) list) and may be accompanied by a summary of the reasons for repeal (e.g., consolidation, modernization, or redundancy).

### Example (Illustrative):
If the repealed regulation was "The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1998," and it was repealed by SI 2016/19, the summary would include:
- The full title of the repealed regulation.
- The date of repeal.
- The reason for repeal (e.g., "to consolidate powers under the Local Government Act 2003").
- The relevant statutory authority (e.g., the Minister of Housing and Local Government).
- A note that the provisions have been replaced by new or amended legislation.

### Conclusion:
Without the **name or subject** of the specific regulation being repealed, a detailed summary cannot be completed. To proceed, please provide:
- The full title of the regulation (e.g., "The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Amendment) Regulations 2015").
- Or, a description of the area of law (e.g., health, transport, environmental, education).

Once that information is available, I can provide a detailed summary of the regulation, including its purpose, key provisions, and the context of its repeal by SI 2016/19.
