**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1996, No. 2**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Territorial Lands Act* of the Northwest Territories. Specifically, it is made pursuant to **paragraph 29(1)(a)** of that Act, which allows the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development—to authorize government employees to acquire an interest in territorial lands.  

This Order is formally titled:  
**"The Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1996, No. 2."**

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize a specific employee of the Government of Canada** to acquire a legal interest in a parcel of land located in the Northwest Territories. This authorization is granted under the framework of the Territorial Lands Act, enabling government employees to hold land interests for official or operational purposes.

---

**3. Authorized Employee and Land Description**  
The Order specifically authorizes **Mavis Rachel Michaud**, who holds the position of **Manager in the Department of Human Resources Development**, to acquire an interest in a parcel of land.  

**Location Details:**  
- The land is situated near **kilometre 510 of the Mackenzie Highway**, which is designated as **N.W.T. Highway No. 1**.  
- Geographic coordinates:  
  - Latitude: **61°59′27″ North**  
  - Longitude: **121°54′61″ West**  
- Legal description:  
  - **Quad number**: 95 H/13  
  - The parcel is clearly outlined in **red on a sketch plan** (file number: **33-1-12**) held in the **Land Management Division** of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in Ottawa.

---

**4. Nature of the Acquisition**  
The Order authorizes **lease** of the land, not outright ownership. The lease is intended for **traditional use**, specifically for the purpose of housing a **traditional use cabin**.  

This reflects a recognition of Indigenous and cultural practices, where land is used for cultural, spiritual, or traditional activities—particularly in the context of remote communities like Fort Simpson.

---

**5. Exceptions and Reservations**  
The lease includes specific **exceptions and reservations**, meaning certain rights and interests are excluded from the leasehold:  
- **All mines and minerals**, including:  
  - Solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons (such as oil, gas, or natural gas)  
  - Any other mineral resources  
- The government **reserves the right to work** these mineral resources.  

This means that while Mavis Michaud is granted a lease for traditional use, the Crown (Government of Canada) retains full rights to explore, develop, and extract minerals from the land. This is a common legal structure to balance cultural land use with resource development interests.

---

**6. Significance and Context**  
- This Order is part of a broader framework that allows government employees to access land for operational, administrative, or cultural purposes.  
- The inclusion of a **traditional use cabin** underscores the importance of Indigenous cultural practices and community-based land use, particularly in remote areas like Fort Simpson.  
- The reservation of mineral rights highlights the federal government’s ongoing role in managing natural resources in the Northwest Territories, even when land is leased for cultural or traditional purposes.

---

**7. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The Order is binding and enforceable under the Territorial Lands Act.  
- It is subject to the oversight of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and requires formal government approval.  
- The lease is tied to a specific administrative record (file 33-1-12), ensuring transparency and traceability.  
- The land is not subject to private ownership but is held under a government lease arrangement with defined terms and conditions.

**Conclusion**  
The *Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1996, No. 2* authorizes Mavis Rachel Michaud, a government employee, to lease a parcel of land in the Northwest Territories for traditional use, specifically for a traditional use cabin. The lease is limited in scope and includes a critical reservation of all mineral rights, including hydrocarbons, which remain under the control of the Government of Canada. This Order reflects a balance between supporting Indigenous cultural practices and preserving the Crown’s sovereign rights to natural resources in the territory.
