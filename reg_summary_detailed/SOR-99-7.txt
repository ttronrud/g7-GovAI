The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal of specific sections of a regulation** under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*, specifically:

- **SOR/2016-137, s. 77** — repeated multiple times  
- **SOR/2004-315, s. 26**  
- **SOR/2000-102, s. 29**  
- **SOR/2001-2, s. 17**

However, **no actual regulation content is present** in the text. Instead, the repeated entries are **repeal notices**, indicating that certain provisions of prior regulations have been officially canceled or removed from force.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Content**
The text is a list of **repeal notices**, not a summary of an active regulation. Each line indicates that a specific section of a previous regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by a subsequent statutory rule.

For example:
- `Repealed, SOR/2016-137, s. 77` means that **Section 77 of the regulation published on SOR/2016-137** has been repealed.
- Similarly, `Repealed, SOR/2004-315, s. 26` means **Section 26 of the regulation published on SOR/2004-315** has been repealed.

These repeals were enacted under the authority of the **Regulations in Council** process in Ontario, where the government can amend or remove existing rules.

#### 2. **Key Repealed Sections and Their Regulatory Context**
Although the original regulation text is not included, these repeals likely relate to **environmental, safety, or administrative regulations**—common domains for such statutory rules. Based on the dates and common regulatory frameworks, these may pertain to:

- **Environmental protection** (e.g., air or water quality standards)
- **Occupational health and safety** (e.g., workplace safety rules)
- **Provincial licensing or permitting** (e.g., for construction, hazardous materials, or emissions)

Note: Without access to the full text of the original regulations (e.g., the *Ontario Environmental Protection Act* or related regulations), the **specific subject matter of the repealed sections cannot be definitively identified**.

#### 3. **Legal and Administrative Significance**
- **Repeal means removal of legal effect**: Any rule, requirement, or obligation previously set out in those sections is no longer enforceable.
- **Legal clarity**: Repeals help streamline regulations by removing outdated, redundant, or obsolete provisions.
- **Regulatory modernization**: The repeal of multiple sections in a single order (e.g., SOR/2016-137) suggests a broader reform or consolidation effort in the regulatory framework.

#### 4. **Why Multiple Repeals?**
The repetition of `SOR/2016-137, s. 77` appears 24 times, suggesting:
- A **typographical or formatting error** in the original document (possibly from a database or legislative database export).
- A **misinterpretation or misrepresentation** of the original regulation’s structure.
- A **systematic listing** of multiple provisions that were repealed under the same rule, but incorrectly repeated.

The other repeals (e.g., SOR/2000-102, s. 29) are from earlier years, indicating that **a cumulative repeal order** was used to remove several outdated or superseded sections over time.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
> **There is no active regulation being summarized here.**  
> The provided text is a **list of repeals**, not a regulation itself.  
> It indicates that **multiple sections of prior Ontario regulations have been officially canceled** through the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*, particularly under **SOR/2016-137**, and to a lesser extent under earlier rules.

### Final Summary (Concise):

The text does **not contain a regulation**; it is a **list of repeals** showing that various sections of former Ontario regulations—particularly under SOR/2016-137, s. 77, and others—have been **officially removed from legal effect**. These repeals reflect regulatory updates to eliminate outdated or redundant provisions. Without the original regulation text, the **specific content or purpose** of the repealed sections cannot be determined. The repeated entries likely stem from a data formatting issue or error.

✅ **Status**: Repealed (no current legal effect)  
✅ **Purpose**: Regulatory modernization and simplification  
❌ **No active regulation content** is present in the provided text.
