The regulation you provided, though labeled as **repealed** (SOR/2003-276, s. 2 and s. 4), was originally designed to clarify and expand the interpretation of "full-time attendance" for a child of a judge under the *Judges Act*, and to establish specific rules regarding the **payment of death duties out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund** when an annuity is paid to a survivor or child of a judge. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the content, even though the regulation is now **repealed** — this summary reflects what the regulation *did* provide in effect prior to its repeal.

## 🎓 **Section 1: Full-Time Attendance for a Child of a Judge**

This section defines what constitutes **"full-time attendance"** at a school or university for a child of a judge, particularly in cases involving **scholastic vacations** or **illness-related absences**.

### ✅ Full-Time Attendance in the Context of Scholastic Vacations
A child of a judge is considered to be in **full-time attendance substantially without interruption** during a scholastic vacation **if**:
- Immediately after the vacation, the child **begins or resumes** full-time attendance at a school, college, university, or other educational institution (of an educational, professional, vocational, or technical nature).
- The absence due to vacation is not otherwise interrupted.

> **Exception**: If the child cannot resume attendance due to **illness or other physical, mental, or emotional conditions**, then:
> - The child is still considered to have been in full-time attendance **if they begin or resume attendance at any time during the academic year immediately following the vacation**.
> - Or, if they resume attendance in the **next academic year**, this is also sufficient.

### ✅ Full-Time Attendance During Illness or Other Conditions
A child is considered to be in **full-time attendance substantially without interruption** during an absence due to illness or personal condition **if**:
- Immediately after the absence, the child **begins or resumes** full-time attendance **in the same academic year** or in the **next academic year**.

> **Exception**: If the illness begins **after the academic year has already started**, and the child is unable to resume full-time attendance due to health reasons:
> - The child is **still considered to have been in full-time attendance** until the **end of that academic year**, despite paragraph (2)(b) of the Act.

### ✅ Death of a Child During Absence
If a child of a judge **dies** while absent due to illness or other conditions:
- **If death occurs during the academic year in which the absence began**:
  - The child is considered to have been in full-time attendance **until the date of death**.
- **If death occurs after the end of that academic year**:
  - The child is considered to have been in full-time attendance **until the end of that academic year**.

> This ensures that the child's absence is not treated as a break in attendance for the purpose of eligibility or benefits under the Judges Act.

### ✅ Child Ceases to Be a "Child" Under the Act
When a child of a judge **ceases to be legally considered a child** (as defined in paragraph 47(1)(b) of the *Judges Act*), and is absent due to illness or vacation:
- If the child **resumes full-time attendance**:
  - **During the same academic year** or the **next academic year** (in case of illness), or
  - **Immediately after the vacation** (in case of scholastic vacation),
  - Then the child is still considered to have been in full-time attendance **until the time they ceased to be a child**.

> This protects the child’s status and ensures continuity of eligibility for benefits even as they transition into adulthood.

## 💰 **Section 2: Payment of Death Duties Out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund**

This section addresses how **death duties** (i.e., estate, legacy, succession, or inheritance taxes) payable by a survivor or child of a judge **may be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund** — a government fund — to preserve the financial support of the survivor or child.

### ✅ Eligibility for Application
- A **survivor or child** may apply **in writing** to the **Minister of Justice** for payment of **part or all** of the death duties attributable to the annuity they receive under the Judges Act.

> The application must be made on behalf of or by the survivor or child.

---

### ✅ Authority of the Minister of Finance
- The **Minister of Finance** may, **at the request of the Minister of Justice**, issue a direction to **pay death duties out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund** for the survivor or child.
- This payment is only allowed **if** the death duties are attributable to the annuity.

---

### ✅ Limitation on Amount Payable
The **maximum amount** that can be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund is calculated as follows:

> **Maximum amount payable** =  
> (Value of the annuity paid to the survivor or child)  
> ÷  
> (Value of the property subject to death duties)  
> ×  
> (Total death duties payable on that property)

> This means the amount paid is **proportional** to the value of the annuity relative to the value of the estate or property.

> The "value of the property" used is the **final value** used in determining the death duties.

### ✅ How the Annuity is Reduced (to fund the death duty payment)

When the Minister of Finance issues a direction to pay death duties from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the **annuity payments** to the survivor or child are **reduced**.

#### 🔹 Reduction Method:
- The reduction is either:
  1. **For a specific term** requested by or on behalf of the survivor or child, **or**
  2. **For the entire duration** of the annuity, **if no term is requested**.

#### 🔹 Formula for Reduction:
> **Amount of reduction per month** =  
> (Total death duties payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund)  
> ÷  
> (Value of an annuity of $1 per annum, payable monthly)

> This value is adjusted based on:
- The **term of the annuity** (requested or default term).
- The **age of the survivor or child** at the time the death duties are paid.

---

#### 🔹 Calculation Rules by Case:

| Case | Interest Rate | Life Expectancy Consideration |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **Annuity payable to a survivor** | 4% per annum | Life expectancy **is taken into account** using the **"Ultimate Table"** from the *Mortality of Annuitants 1900–1920* (published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland, 1924). |
| **Annuity payable to a child** | 4% per annum | **Life expectancy is NOT taken into account** |

> The "Ultimate Table" provides actuarial mortality data to estimate the expected lifespan of annuitants, which is used to calculate the present value of future annuity payments.

> The reduction is applied **monthly**, and the total reduction is spread over the term of the annuity (either the requested term or the full term).

## ⚠️ Key Notes and Implications

1. **Repealed Status**:
   - This regulation was **officially repealed** by **SOR/2003-276, section 2 and section 4**.
   - It is no longer in force as of the date of repeal.
   - Any current interpretation of "full-time attendance" or death duty payments for children of judges must now be derived from **current versions of the Judges Act** and **related administrative policies**, not this repealed regulation.

2. **Purpose**:
   - The regulation was designed to:
     - Protect children of judges from being penalized for temporary absences due to illness or vacation.
     - Provide financial relief to survivors or children by allowing death duties to be paid from public funds, reducing the financial burden on the family.
     - Ensure that annuity payments are adjusted in a fair and actuarially sound manner.

3. **Actuarial Basis**:
   - The use of the 1924 mortality table reflects a **historical and conservative approach** to life expectancy calculations. It may not reflect modern demographic trends, which could lead to outdated or less accurate projections.

4. **Practical Impact**:
   - A judge’s child who is absent due to illness or vacation is not considered to have "failed" to attend school.
   - If a child dies during such an absence, the annuity is treated as if the child had been in full-time attendance.
   - Death duties are not fully borne by the survivor/child — a portion can be offset by public funds, but this comes at the cost of **reduced annuity payments**.
