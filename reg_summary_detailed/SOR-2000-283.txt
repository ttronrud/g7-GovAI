### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg and Chick Orderly Marketing Regulations**

---

#### **Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations were established under the **Farm Products Agencies Act** (now repealed) and implemented by the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency (CBHEMA)**, which was created by the *Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation* (SOR/87-40). The agency was authorized to implement a marketing plan to ensure orderly and stable interprovincial trade in broiler hatching eggs and chicks.

Key legislative provisions include:
- **Section 16(1)(b)** of the Farm Products Agencies Act: Empowers the Governor in Council to establish a marketing agency.
- **Section 7(1)(d)**: Allows regulations of a class to be made if approved by the National Farm Products Council (NFPC).
- **Section 2 of the Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order**: Confirms that these regulations fall within a class subject to NFPC approval.
- **Paragraph 22(1)(f)**: Grants the agency authority to make such regulations upon approval by the NFPC.

The proposed regulations were submitted to the NFPC, which approved them due to their necessity in implementing the agency’s marketing plan. As a result, the agency officially enacted these regulations on **June 30, 2000**.

> **Note**: These regulations were **repealed in 2013** (SOR/2013-255, s. 1) and further updated in 2016 (SOR/2016-292, s. 1), meaning they are **no longer in force** as of the date of repeal. This summary reflects their historical content and structure as they existed at the time of enactment.

## **Core Objectives of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations was to:
- Regulate the **interprovincial marketing** of broiler hatching eggs and chicks from **non-signatory provinces** into **signatory provinces**.
- Prevent market oversaturation and price volatility.
- Ensure fair access to markets through a **quota system** based on historical market data and production efficiency.
- Promote **orderly marketing** by limiting the volume of eggs and chicks that can be traded between provinces.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Producer** | A person engaged in producing broiler hatching eggs in a non-signatory province. |
| **Hatchery Operator** | A person who incubates broiler hatching eggs into chicks. |
| **Dealer** | A person (not a producer or hatchery operator) involved in interprovincial marketing of broiler hatching eggs or chicks from non-signatory provinces into signatory provinces. |
| **Signatory Province** | A province that has agreed to participate in the orderly marketing system. |
| **Non-Signatory Province** | A province not participating in the system; producers in these provinces may export to signatory provinces under regulated conditions. |
| **Qualifying Period** | Timeframes used to assess historical marketing activity:<br>• Broiler hatching eggs: November 27, 1985 – November 26, 1986<br>• Chicks: August 1, 1988 – July 31, 1989 |
| **Hatchability** | The percentage of saleable chicks obtained from incubating eggs, as published annually by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food in the *Hatchery Review*. |
| **Orderly Marketing Quota** | The maximum number of broiler hatching eggs or chicks a producer, dealer, or hatchery operator is allowed to market into a signatory province during a calendar year. |

## **Main Provisions and Requirements**

---

### **Section 1: Mandatory Quota Requirement**

**No person may engage in interprovincial marketing** of broiler hatching eggs or chicks from a non-signatory province into a signatory province **unless**:
1. They hold an **orderly marketing quota** for that signatory province; and  
2. They market **no more than the amount** of eggs or chicks specified in their quota.

> This ensures that trade is limited and predictable, preventing market flooding.

---

### **Section 2: Exceptions to Quota Rule**

Certain situations are exempt from the quota requirement:

1. **Marketing within a non-signatory province** (i.e., trade between non-signatory provinces).
2. **Chick return mechanism**: If a hatchery operator in the signatory province returns **96% of the chicks** (equivalent to 96% of the number of eggs marketed) to the producer in the province of origin or to the original dealer/hatchery operator.
3. **Authorization by the Agency**: A producer, dealer, or hatchery operator may apply and receive **specific authorization** to market a designated quantity of eggs.
4. **Marketing under a prescribed contract**: The trade must occur under a contract that:
   - Specifies the number of eggs to be marketed;
   - Specifies the number of chicks to be returned to the province of origin;
   - Includes compliance with all applicable Agency rules and regulations.

> These exceptions allow flexibility in certain supply chains while maintaining overall market stability.

### **Section 3: Application Process for Authorization**

To apply for an authorization to market eggs:
- The application must be in a **form provided by the Agency**.
- Must be **completed and signed** by the applicant.
- Must include:
  - Number of eggs to be marketed;
  - Number of chicks to be returned;
  - Pricing details;
- Must be accompanied by **invoices, sales receipts, or other documentation** showing the applicant’s egg marketing activity in the **prior year**.
- Must be filed with the Agency:
  - For the year 2000: **by September 1, 2000**;
  - For subsequent years: **by October 1 of the year before the year sought**.

> The Agency may grant authorization **if the applicant meets all requirements**.

> **Authorization expires on December 31** of the year it is issued.

---

### **Section 4: Application for Orderly Marketing Quota**

To obtain an **orderly marketing quota** (a formal annual allocation):
- Applicants must:
  - Apply for a **license** under the *Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg and Chick Licensing Regulations*;
  - Apply for the quota **no later than September 30** of the year preceding the year in which the quota applies.

> For applicants **without prior quotas**, the application must include:
- Evidence (invoices, receipts) of egg or chick production and interprovincial marketing during the **qualifying period**.

> The applicant must make their **books and records available** for inspection to verify accuracy.

---

### **Section 5: Quota Allocation Formula**

The orderly marketing quota is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Quota} = \left( \frac{P}{Q} \right) \times R
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = Percentage change in the total number of broiler hatching eggs and chicks subject to limits in the signatory province, from the year the province first became a signatory to the year the quota applies.
- \( Q \) = Number of broiler hatching eggs and chicks marketed by the applicant during the qualifying period into that signatory province.
- \( R \) = The total number of eggs and chicks subject to limits in the signatory province at the time of the quota calculation.

> The quota is expressed in **number of broiler hatching eggs**.

> For **chicks**, the number of eggs in the quota is converted to chicks using the **hatchability rate** of the province of origin in the **prior year**:
\[
\text{Number of chicks} = (\text{Number of eggs}) \times (\text{Hatchability rate})
\]

> Example: If the quota is 10,000 eggs and hatchability is 92%, then 9,200 chicks are equivalent.

---

### **Section 6: Quota Expiry and Restrictions**

- An orderly marketing quota **expires on December 31** of the year it is allotted.
- **No person may sell, give as security, lease, or assign** an orderly marketing quota.
- If a producer, dealer, or hatchery operator **ceases business**, the Agency may **re-allot** the quota to another party under appropriate terms and conditions to maintain market stability.

---

### **Section 7: Penalties for Exceeding Quota**

If a person markets **more than their allocated quota** in a year:
- The Agency will **reduce** their quota for the **following year**.
- The reduction is applied in a manner and to an extent necessary to maintain orderly marketing.

> This serves as a deterrent against over-trading and ensures long-term market balance.

---

### **Section 8: Suspension or Cancellation of Licenses**

If a license issued under the *Licensing Regulations* is **suspended or cancelled**, the associated orderly marketing quota is **automatically suspended or cancelled**.

---

### **Section 9: Allotment to New Entrants**

The Agency may allocate orderly marketing quotas to individuals or entities in non-signatory provinces who:
1. Did **not market** eggs or chicks during the qualifying period; and  
2. Have a **market increase** in the signatory province; and  
3. The Agency has assigned a specific number of eggs or chicks
