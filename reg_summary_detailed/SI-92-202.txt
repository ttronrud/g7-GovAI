**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Importations by Certain Processing Service Companies (GST) Remission Order**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation, officially titled the *Importations by Certain Processing Service Companies (GST) Remission Order*, was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance under **subsection 23(2)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. The primary objective is to provide **tax remission** (i.e., relief from excise tax liability) to specific Canadian processing companies for certain goods and materials imported for processing and subsequently exported.

The policy is grounded in the public interest, particularly in supporting industries engaged in **imported goods processing and re-export**, which often involve significant capital investment and operational complexity. By remitting excise tax on qualifying imports, the government aims to reduce the financial burden on these processors and encourage export-oriented manufacturing activities that contribute to Canada’s trade balance and industrial competitiveness.

### **Legal Basis**

- **Statutory Authority**: Subsection 23(2) of the *Financial Administration Act* grants the Governor General in Council the power to make orders related to the remission of taxes under the *Excise Tax Act* when it is deemed in the public interest.
- **Applicable Tax Provisions**: The remission applies specifically to **Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which governs the excise tax on goods and materials used in processing and manufacturing.

### **Title and Citation**

- **Order Title**: *Importations by Certain Processing Service Companies (GST) Remission Order*
- **Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Process" (in respect of goods)**  
   This term is broadly defined to include:
   - Assembly  
   - Manufacture  
   - Modification  
   - Production  
   - Packaging  
   - Repackaging  
   - Repair  
   *(French: "traitement")*

2. **"Processor"**  
   Refers to one of the following designated companies:
   - A.R.D. Industries Ltd.  
   - Automotive Technologies Inc.  
   - Dart Machine Ltd.  
   - Tube-Mac Installations Ltd.  
   - U.H.V. Instruments Ltd.  
   *(French: "importateur")*

### **Scope of Remission**

The Order grants **remission of excise tax** (specifically under Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act) to each processor in the following two categories:

#### **1. Imported Goods Processed and Exported**
Remission applies to:
- Goods imported into Canada that are **processed** (as defined above) and then **exported without being used in Canada**.
- Goods that are **used, wrought into, or attached** to other goods during processing, provided those resulting products are also exported without being used in Canada.

> *Example*: A component imported from abroad is assembled into a finished product in Canada and then exported. The excise tax on the imported component is remitted if the final product is exported and not used domestically.

#### **2. Imported Materials Consumed in Processing**
Remission applies to:
- Imported **materials** (excluding fuel, lubricants, or plant/equipment) that are **directly consumed** in the processing of goods that are then exported without being used in Canada.

> *Example*: Metal parts imported for use in manufacturing a mechanical component, which is then exported, qualify for remission.

---

### **Conditions for Remission (Section 3)**

To qualify for tax remission, the processor must meet **three strict conditions**:

1. **No Proprietary Interest During Processing Period**  
   From the moment the goods or materials are imported until the final export of the processed products, the processor must **not have any proprietary interest** (such as ownership, control, or right of use) in the imported goods, materials, or the resulting products.

   > *Purpose*: Prevents situations where the processor benefits financially from the imported inputs (e.g., by retaining ownership or using them domestically), which would undermine the intent of the remission.

2. **Export Must Occur Within Six Months of Customs Accounting**  
   The exportation of the processed goods or products must occur **within six months** of the date the goods or materials are **accounted for under section 32 of the Customs Act**.

   > *Section 32 of the Customs Act* governs the recording and accounting of goods entering or leaving Canada. This deadline ensures timely exportation and limits the window for holding goods in Canada.

3. **No Claim of Input Tax Credit**  
   The processor **must not claim an input tax credit** under Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* for the excise tax that is being remitted.

   > *Purpose*: Prevents double recovery of tax. The remission is intended to relieve the processor of tax liability, not to allow them to claim a credit on the same tax.

### **Effective Dates by Processor**

The Order is not effective immediately for all processors. It applies only to importations occurring within specific timeframes:

| Processor | Effective Period |
|---------|------------------|
| **Automotive Technologies Inc.** and **U.H.V. Instruments Ltd.** | After **July 3, 1991**, and before **October 1, 1992** |
| **Tube-Mac Installations Ltd.**, **A.R.D. Industries Ltd.**, and **Dart Machine Ltd.** | After **August 14, 1991**, and before **October 1, 1992** |

> *Note*: The end date of **October 1, 1992** is consistent across all entities, indicating a temporary, time-limited application of the remission.

### **Key Implications and Objectives**

1. **Support for Export-Oriented Processing**  
   Encourages Canadian companies to engage in value-added processing of imported materials and components, thereby promoting manufacturing and export activities.

2. **Reduction of Tax Burden**  
   Removes the excise tax liability on inputs used in processing that are exported, reducing operational costs for these specialized firms.

3. **Alignment with Trade and Industry Needs**  
   Targets specific industries (e.g., automotive, machinery, instrumentation) where imported parts are commonly processed and re-exported, supporting niche but critical sectors.

4. **Prevention of Tax Abuse**  
   The conditions (especially no proprietary interest and input tax credit restriction) ensure that the remission is used appropriately and not exploited for tax avoidance or profit retention.

5. **Temporary Nature**  
   The limited time frame (1991–1992) suggests this was a **one-time policy measure** to support specific industries during a transitional period, rather than a permanent framework.

### **Conclusion**

The *Importations by Certain Processing Service Companies (GST) Remission Order* is a targeted, temporary tax relief measure designed to support specific Canadian processing companies involved in importing raw materials or components, processing them in Canada, and re-exporting the final products. It provides remission of excise tax under Division III of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*, subject to strict conditions to ensure the tax relief is used only in legitimate, export-oriented processing activities.

This regulation reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and economic support, aiming to promote industrial competitiveness while maintaining compliance with tax and customs principles.

**Note**: This Order is no longer in force as it was issued in 1991 and expired in 1992. It may serve as a historical precedent for future tax remission policies in the processing and export sector. Modern equivalents may now exist under different legislative frameworks, such as the *Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) regulations*.
