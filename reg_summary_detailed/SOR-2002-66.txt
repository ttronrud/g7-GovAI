**Detailed Summary of the CCFTA Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the *CCFTA Remission Order*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**. It establishes a mechanism for the **remission (refund) of customs duties** for certain goods imported into Canada during a specific period, based on a change in tariff treatment due to the implementation of the **Canada–Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)**.

The Order is effective upon registration and applies to goods imported between **January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002**.

---

### **Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Goods"** are defined as those items that:
  - Would have been eligible for the **Chile Tariff rate of duty** as of **December 31, 1997**, had they been imported on that date; and
  - Are **no longer eligible** for that rate if imported on or after **January 1, 2002**.

> This means the goods were subject to a preferential tariff (Chile rate) under the old regime (prior to the CCFTA implementation) but, due to the transition, are now subject to higher duties under the standard tariff system after January 1, 2002.

---

### **Purpose of the Remission**

The Order grants a **customs duty remission** (i.e., a refund of overpaid duties) for goods imported during the period **January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2002**, under the following conditions:

> **Remission amount =**  
> (Customs duty payable under the **Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN)** or **General Preferential Tariff (GPT)** rate as of January 1, 2002)  
> **minus**  
> (Customs duty that would have been payable under the **Chile Tariff rate** as of January 1, 2002)

This effectively refunds the difference between:
- The higher duty rate that applied after January 1, 2002 (MFN or GPT), and
- The lower, preferential Chile Tariff rate that would have applied had the goods been imported before that date.

> The remission compensates importers for the **duty increase** caused by the transition from the old Chilean preferential tariff to the new, more standard tariff regime.

### **Conditions for Remission**

1. **Claim Deadline**:  
   A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within four years** of the date the goods were imported.

2. **Eligibility Requirement**:  
   The goods must have been imported during the specified period (January 1, 2002 – December 31, 2002).

3. **Tariff Basis**:  
   The duty rates used in the calculation are based on the **Customs Tariff and its regulations as they existed on January 1, 2002**. This ensures consistency and fairness in determining the historical tariff treatment.

---

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is authorized under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which permits the government to make regulations to provide for remission of duties in cases where there is a change in tariff treatment due to trade agreements or policy adjustments.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government body (e.g., the Registrar of Regulations).

---

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Supports Trade Transition**: This Order was a critical measure to ease the transition for Canadian importers who had previously benefited from the Chile Tariff rate under pre-CCFTA arrangements. It prevents a sudden and disproportionate increase in duty costs when the CCFTA came into effect.
  
- **Promotes Trade Stability**: By refunding the difference in duties, the government supports continued trade with Chile and encourages compliance with the new free trade framework without penalizing businesses that were previously benefiting from preferential treatment.

- **Time-Bound Relief**: The four-year claim window ensures that claims are made promptly, reducing administrative burden and ensuring accountability.

---

### **Limitations and Notes**

- The remission applies **only to goods that would have qualified for the Chile Tariff rate as of December 31, 1997**. Goods that did not meet this criterion are not eligible.
- The remission is **not a general refund** of all duties but is specifically tied to the **difference between the Chile Tariff rate and the MFN/GPT rate** as of January 1, 2002.
- The Order does not apply to goods imported after December 31, 2002, nor does it extend beyond the defined period.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CCFTA Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)* is a targeted, time-limited, and legally grounded policy designed to **mitigate the financial impact of tariff changes** on Canadian importers of goods from Chile during the transition period from 2002. It reflects a balance between implementing trade agreements and ensuring fairness in duty obligations, particularly for businesses that relied on preferential treatment under the pre-CCFTA regime.

This Order serves as a key component of Canada’s implementation of the CCFTA, helping to ensure a smooth and equitable transition for affected industries.
