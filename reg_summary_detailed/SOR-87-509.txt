### **Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Fishery Regulations (as of 1985, repealed in 2023)**

---

#### **Background and Legal Basis**
The Manitoba Fishery Regulations (C.R.C., c. 843) were **revoked and replaced** by a new set of regulations issued under **section 34 of the Fisheries Act**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries. This action was formalized by **Statutory Commission 1985, c. 31, s. 3**, and the new regulations came into force as a modernized framework for managing and conserving fish resources in Manitoba.

> **Important Note**: These regulations have been **fully repealed** by **SOR/2023-28, s. 2**, meaning they are **no longer in force** as of the date of repeal. This summary is provided for historical and regulatory context, not as current law.
