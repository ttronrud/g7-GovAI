## **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation implements and clarifies the provisions of the **Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act (the "Act")**, specifically outlining the **criteria, time limits, interest calculations, and circumstances** under which prompt payment is required and enforced in federal construction projects. It establishes a framework to ensure timely payments to contractors and subcontractors, reduce payment delays, and provide a mechanism for dispute resolution.

The regulation was made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**, under **section 23 of the Act**.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Eligibility of Provinces for Designation Under Section 6(1) of the Act**

A province may be designated under **subsection 6(1)** of the Act if it has enacted its own laws that meet **five key criteria**, which are considered "reasonably similar" to those set out in the federal Act and these Regulations:

| Criterion | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a)** Submission of a "proper invoice" | The province must require the submission of an invoice that is reasonably similar to the "proper invoice" defined in the Act. This ensures that payment claims are clear, accurate, and properly documented. |
| **(b)** Timely payment through subcontracting chain | The province must require payment from the principal contractor to the subcontractor, and then to each lower level of the subcontracting chain, within time limits that are **reasonably similar** to those in the federal Act. This promotes a consistent and predictable payment timeline. |
| **(c)** Written notice of non-payment | In the event of non-payment, the province must require the provision of a written notice of non-payment that is **reasonably similar** to the notice specified in the Act. This ensures transparency and provides contractors with formal notice of payment default. |
| **(d)** Adjudication process for payment disputes | If a dispute arises over payment, the province must have an **adjudication process** that operates within time limits **reasonably similar** to those in the *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work (Dispute Resolution)* Regulations. This enables prompt resolution of disputes without resorting to lengthy legal processes. |
| **(e)** Binding nature of adjudication decisions | Decisions made under the adjudication process must be **binding on the parties involved**, unless: <br> - The parties reach a written agreement, or <br> - The decision is set aside by a court order or arbitral award. |

> **Purpose**: This provision allows provinces with well-developed, comparable payment and dispute resolution frameworks to be recognized as "designated" under federal law, thereby enabling federal contractors to rely on provincial laws to ensure prompt payments.

### **2. Exclusions from Time Limit Calculations**

Time limits specified in **sections 9 to 11 of the Act** (which govern payment deadlines) **do not include** the following days or periods:

- **Holidays as defined in subsection 35(1) of the Interpretation Act**  
  → Includes statutory holidays such as New Year’s Day, Christmas, etc., as legally defined.

- **Saturdays**  
  → Payment deadlines are not extended on Saturdays.

- **The nine-day period beginning on December 24 and ending on January 1**  
  → This is a **specific exclusion** covering the Christmas holiday period (e.g., Christmas Eve through New Year’s Day). This is a common practice to account for the holiday season.

- **Construction holidays recognized by any provincial government**  
  → Provinces may designate specific days (e.g., local holidays or public holidays) as "construction holidays" that are not counted in payment timelines. This allows flexibility based on regional practices.

> **Note**: These exclusions are **excluded from the computation of time** — meaning that if a deadline falls on a Saturday or during the December 24–January 1 period, the time limit is not extended. The count is only made on weekdays and holidays defined under the Act.

### **3. Interest on Late Payments**

Under **subsection 14(2) of the Act**, interest is awarded when a contractor is not paid by the due date.

#### **Interest Calculation Rules**:
- Interest is **simple interest**.
- The rate is:  
  **Average Bank Rate + 3% per year**  
  → This means the interest rate is the **average of the Bank of Canada’s bank rates** for the month **before** the month in which interest is being calculated, **plus 3 percentage points**.

#### **Definition of Key Terms**:
- **Average Bank Rate**:  
  → The **simple arithmetic mean** of the bank rates established by the Bank of Canada during the month **immediately preceding** the month for which interest is being calculated.

- **Bank Rate**:  
  → The rate of interest established periodically by the Bank of Canada as the **minimum rate** at which the Bank of Canada makes short-term advances to members of the **Canadian Payments Association**.

> **Example**:  
> If interest is being calculated for a payment due in January 2025, the average bank rate for December 2024 is used, and interest is calculated at (Average Bank Rate in Dec 2024) + 3%.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that interest is both fair and inflation-adjusted, reflecting current financial market conditions.

### **4. Circumstances Under Which an Adjudicator Is Not Required to Determine a Dispute**

An adjudicator is **not required** to determine a dispute in the following situations:

1. **Dispute has been consolidated** with another dispute, and a **different adjudicator** has been appointed to handle the consolidated case.  
   → Avoids duplication and ensures efficient handling of multiple claims.

2. **The adjudicator’s appointment is revoked by mutual agreement of all parties**.  
   → Parties may agree to terminate the adjudicator’s role if they believe it is not in their interest.

3. **The adjudicator has a conflict of interest**.  
   → Ensures impartiality and integrity of the adjudication process.

4. **The Adjudicator Authority determines, to its satisfaction, that the adjudicator is no longer able to adjudicate**.  
   → May include issues such as physical or mental incapacity, bias, or lack of expertise.

> **Purpose**: These provisions protect the integrity of the adjudication process while allowing flexibility in exceptional or complex cases.

### **5. Coming into Force**

- The regulations **come into force on the day that section 387 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2019, No. 1, chapter 29 of the Statutes of Canada, 2019, comes into force**.  
  → This is typically the date of enactment of the Act (e.g., a specific date in 2019 or 2020).

- **If the regulations are registered later**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> **Note**: As of **December 9, 2023**, these regulations were in force (confirmed by SI/2023-77).

## **Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Prompt Payment** | Ensures contractors and subcontractors receive timely payments, improving cash flow and project stability. |
| **Enhance Transparency and Accountability** | Clear definitions of invoices, notices, and dispute processes reduce ambiguity. |
| **Support Provincial Cooperation** | Recognizes and supports provinces with strong payment frameworks, encouraging harmonization across jurisdictions. |
| **Ensure Fair Compensation** | Interest at a rate above the average bank rate (plus 3%) compensates for financial loss due to delay. |
| **Streamline Dispute Resolution** | Adjudication provides a fast, binding alternative to litigation, reducing project delays. |

## **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **comprehensive, enforceable, and consistent framework** for prompt payment in federal construction projects. It:

- Establishes clear criteria for provincial recognition,
- Defines how time limits are calculated (with specific exclusions),
- Sets a fair and market-linked interest rate for late payments,
- Ensures fair and efficient dispute resolution through adjudication,
- And includes safeguards to protect the integrity of the adjudication process.

By aligning provincial practices with federal standards, the regulation strengthens the financial health of the construction sector and supports timely, transparent, and equitable project delivery across Canada.

✅ **Final Note**: These regulations are part of a broader effort by the federal government to **improve contractor payment practices**, reduce delays, and support economic stability in the construction industry. They are particularly important for large-scale infrastructure projects where payment delays can have cascading financial effects.
