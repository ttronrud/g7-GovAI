**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, in accordance with **Section 89* of the National Energy Board Act**. This section empowers the federal government to designate certain substances as "oil products" and to exempt specific types of oil from certain provisions of the Act.

**Legal Context and Status:**

- The regulation was originally enacted as **Section 31 of S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 116**, which is the *National Energy Board Act*.
- It was **repealed** by **SOR/2020-52, section 1**, meaning that this regulation is **no longer in force** as of the date of repeal (January 1, 2020).
- The repeal reflects a broader legislative modernization and consolidation of energy regulation, as the National Energy Board (NEB) was replaced by the **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)** in 2018 under the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CERA)*.

**Key Provisions of the Regulation (Prior to Repeal):**

1. **Designation of Substances as Oil Products:**
   - The following two substances were officially designated as **oil products**:
     - **Methanol**
     - **Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)**

   This designation was significant because, under the National Energy Board Act, only certain substances were subject to regulation as "oil products," which typically triggered obligations related to reporting, transportation, storage, and environmental protection.

2. **Exemption from Part 9 of the National Energy Board Act:**
   - Methanol and MTBE were **exempt from the operation of Part 9** of the *National Energy Board Act*.
   - Part 9 generally contains provisions related to the **regulation of oil products**, including:
     - Licensing and permitting requirements
     - Reporting obligations
     - Transportation and handling standards
     - Environmental safeguards
     - Compliance with specific safety and quality standards

   By exempting methanol and MTBE from Part 9, the regulation effectively **relieved these substances from many of the regulatory burdens** typically applied to conventional oil products.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- The designation and exemption were likely intended to:
  - Recognize the **distinct chemical and industrial nature** of methanol and MTBE, which are not traditional hydrocarbon-based oil products.
  - Facilitate their use in **alternative fuel applications**, such as gasoline additives or industrial solvents, without being subject to the same regulatory framework as petroleum-based fuels.
  - Support **energy diversification** and innovation in fuel technologies, particularly in the context of cleaner-burning alternatives to conventional gasoline.

**Repeal and Current Status:**

- The regulation was **repealed on January 1, 2020**, under **SOR/2020-52, section 1**, as part of a broader reform of Canada’s energy regulatory framework.
- With the repeal, the **designations and exemptions related to methanol and MTBE no longer apply** under the former National Energy Board Act.
- The current regulatory regime for such substances is governed by the **Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CERA)**, which may have different provisions regarding classification, exemptions, and oversight.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation historically provided a legal framework to classify methanol and MTBE as oil products while exempting them from certain regulatory obligations under the National Energy Board Act. However, due to the **repeal in 2020**, the regulation is **no longer in effect**. Its legacy lies in reflecting an early effort to adapt energy regulation to include non-traditional fuels and to balance regulatory oversight with industry innovation. Any current regulatory treatment of methanol or MTBE would now fall under the **Canadian Energy Regulator Act** and its associated rules, which may differ in scope and application from the original provisions.
