**Detailed Summary of the Loan of Defence Materiel to Canadian Contractors Order**

**Title:**  
*Loan of Defence Materiel to Canadian Contractors Order*

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation establishes a legal framework enabling the Canadian government to lend defence materiel to Canadian defence contractors.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authorization of the Minister of National Defence:**  
   The Minister of National Defence is granted the authority to approve and facilitate the lending of defence materiel. This power is exercised **upon the request of the Minister of Supply and Services**, indicating a collaborative and coordinated approach between the two key departments involved in defence procurement and supply.

2. **Purpose of the Loan:**  
   The defence materiel may only be lent for the specific purpose of **assisting Canadian defence contractors in producing military equipment** to meet **foreign government purchase orders**. This ensures that the use of the materiel is directly tied to international defence contracts and not diverted to domestic or non-strategic uses.

3. **Condition of Non-Defence Requirement:**  
   A critical condition for the loan is that the defence materiel **must not otherwise be required for defence purposes**. This means the materiel must not be essential for Canada’s own military operations, training, or national security needs. This safeguards the integrity of Canada’s defence readiness by ensuring that critical equipment is not diverted from essential defence functions.

4. **Recall Clause:**  
   A key safeguard is that the lent materiel must be **subject to recall at any time if required for defence purposes**. This provision ensures that in the event of a national emergency, defence needs, or operational requirement, the materiel can be immediately returned to government control. This maintains the Crown’s ultimate authority over defence assets.

5. **Administrative Responsibility:**  
   The **Department of Supply and Services** is designated as the administrative body responsible for managing the loans. It has the authority to:
   - Determine the terms and conditions of each loan,
   - Monitor the use of the materiel,
   - Ensure compliance with all conditions of the loan,
   - Oversee the delivery, use, and return of materiel.

   The Minister of Supply and Services has discretion in setting these terms, allowing flexibility to address the specific needs of contractors and the nature of the foreign orders.

6. **Cost to the Crown:**  
   The loans are **made without cost to the Crown**. This means the government does not bear any financial expense in providing the materiel. The benefit to the Crown is strategic—supporting Canadian industry and international competitiveness—without direct financial outlay.

**Implications and Objectives:**

- **Support for Canadian Industry:** Enables Canadian defence contractors to meet international demands, enhancing their competitiveness and sustainability in global markets.
- **Economic and Strategic Benefits:** Strengthens Canada’s defence industrial base, fosters technology transfer, and supports jobs in the defence sector.
- **Risk Management:** The recall condition and non-defence requirement ensure that national defence priorities are not compromised.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The administrative oversight by the Department of Supply and Services ensures that the use of materiel is properly monitored and accountable.

**Limitations and Boundaries:**

- The use of materiel is strictly limited to fulfilling foreign purchase orders.
- No materiel may be lent if it is already required for domestic defence operations.
- The government retains full control and the right to recall the materiel at any time.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Loan of Defence Materiel to Canadian Contractors Order* is a targeted and strategic regulatory tool designed to support Canadian defence industry participation in international defence markets. It balances the economic benefits of enabling foreign contract fulfillment with the imperative of preserving national defence readiness. By ensuring that materiel is only lent when not needed for defence purposes and with a clear recall mechanism, the regulation protects national security while promoting Canadian industrial capability.
