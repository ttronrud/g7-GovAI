### **Overview**

The *Port Authorities Management Regulations* (S.C. 1998, c. 10) are a set of administrative rules made under the authority of the **Canada Marine Act**, specifically pursuant to subsection 27(1). These regulations establish the governance, operational procedures, record-keeping obligations, financial responsibilities, and liability frameworks for **port authorities** in Canada — entities that manage and operate ports, harbours, or related infrastructure.

The regulations apply to all port authorities established under the Canada Marine Act, including those continuing, being deemed incorporated, or newly incorporated as port authorities. They aim to ensure transparency, accountability, and sound governance while balancing flexibility in operations with legal and financial safeguards.
