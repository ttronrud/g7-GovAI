### **2. Background and Rationale**

The proclamation is rooted in several key historical, moral, and national considerations:

#### **a. Service in Afghanistan (2001–2014)**
- Canadians, both in uniform and in support roles across government departments, served in Afghanistan from **2001 to 2014**.
- The mission was part of Canada’s international effort to combat terrorism and stabilize the region.
- The proclamation acknowledges the **honour, courage, and loyalty** demonstrated by members of the **Her Majesty’s Canadian Armed Forces (CMF)** during this period.

#### **b. End of the Mission**
- **March 31, 2014**, marked the official end of Canada’s military mission in Afghanistan.
- This closure provided a meaningful moment to reflect on the contributions of service members and their families.

#### **c. National and Community Support**
- The proclamation recognizes the **critical role of families and communities** across Canada in supporting service members during their deployment.
- It emphasizes the **ongoing sacrifices** made by families and civilians, who endure emotional, financial, and logistical challenges while their loved ones serve abroad.

#### **d. Recognition of Sacrifice**
- The proclamation explicitly honors those who have made the **ultimate sacrifice** for Canada’s freedom and security.
- It serves as a formal expression of national gratitude and remembrance for all who served — including those who lost their lives.

#### **e. Legislative Basis**
- The proclamation is grounded in **Order in Council P.C. 2014-281**, issued on March 17, 2014, which authorized the Governor in Council to issue the proclamation.
- This demonstrates that the decision was made through formal government process and not unilateral action.
