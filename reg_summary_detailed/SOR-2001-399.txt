**Detailed Summary of the Manner of Calculation (Foreign Banks) Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The *Manner of Calculation (Foreign Banks) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **section 978a of the Bank Act**.  
- **Statutory Reference**: S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183; S.C. 1991, c. 46  
- These regulations provide the **prescribed method for calculating the proportion of certain financial activities** carried out by foreign banks or other financial entities in Canada or abroad, as required by the Bank Act.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary purpose is to establish a **clear, consistent, and objective formula** for determining:
- The **portion of activities** (e.g., banking, investment, insurance) that a financial entity engages in that are considered "particular activities" under various sections of the Bank Act.
- Whether such activities are conducted **in Canada**, **outside Canada**, or **in general** (for Canadian entities).
- This calculation is essential for regulatory oversight, particularly in relation to **prudential supervision, capital requirements, and reporting obligations** for foreign banks and other financial entities operating in Canada.

---

### **3. Key Definitions and Reference to the Bank Act**

#### a. **Act**  
- Refers to the *Bank Act* (Loi sur la Banque), the primary legislation governing the financial system in Canada.

#### b. **Total Assets**  
- Defined as in **subsection 508(5)** of the Bank Act.  
- Represents the full value of a financial institution’s assets, including loans, investments, and other holdings.

#### c. **Total Revenue**  
- Defined as in **subsection 508(5)** of the Bank Act.  
- Represents the total income generated by the entity from its operations (e.g., interest, fees, commissions).

> These definitions ensure consistency with the broader financial reporting framework in the Bank Act.

### **4. Core Formula for Determining the "Portion of Activities"**

The regulations apply a **common formula** across multiple contexts to determine the **proportion of activities** (called "particular activities") that an entity engages in. The formula is:

> **Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)**

Where:
- **B** = the part of total assets attributable to the particular activities  
- **C** = total assets of the entity  
- **D** = the part of total revenue derived from the particular activities  
- **E** = total revenue of the entity  

This formula ensures that **the portion is not determined solely by revenue**, but also considers **asset exposure**—a more comprehensive measure of operational involvement in specific financial activities.

> This dual criterion (assets and revenue) prevents manipulation and ensures that entities with significant asset-based exposure in a particular activity are properly classified.

### **5. Application of the Formula Across Different Contexts**

#### **(A) For Financial Services Entities (Section 507(1) of the Bank Act)**  
- Applies to determine the **portion of activities** (e.g., banking, trust, investment, insurance) that a financial entity engages in.
- Formula:  
  > Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)  
  Where:
  - B = assets related to particular activities  
  - C = total assets  
  - D = revenue from particular activities  
  - E = total revenue  

> Used to assess whether an entity qualifies as a financial services entity under the Act.

---

#### **(B) For Foreign Banks/Entities – Business in Canada (Paragraph 522.05(a))**  
- Determines the **portion of business conducted in Canada** that consists of particular activities.
- Formula:  
  > Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)  
  Where:
  - B = assets from particular activities **in Canada**  
  - C = total assets **in Canada**  
  - D = revenue from particular activities **in Canada**  
  - E = total revenue **in Canada**

> This allows regulators to assess how much of a foreign bank’s Canadian operations are tied to regulated financial services.

---

#### **(C) For Foreign Banks/Entities – Business Outside Canada (Paragraph 522.05(b))**  
- Determines the **portion of business conducted outside Canada** that consists of particular activities.
- Formula:  
  > Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)  
  Where:
  - B = assets from particular activities **outside Canada**  
  - C = total assets **outside Canada**  
  - D = revenue from particular activities **outside Canada**  
  - E = total revenue **outside Canada**

> Used to assess the scope and nature of foreign operations outside Canada, particularly for regulatory compliance and risk assessment.

---

#### **(D) For Canadian Entities – Activities Engaged In (Paragraphs 522.09(1)(b) and (2)(b))**  
- Applies to Canadian financial institutions to determine the **portion of activities** they conduct.
- Formula:  
  > Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)  
  Where:
  - B = assets from particular activities  
  - C = total assets  
  - D = revenue from particular activities  
  - E = total revenue  

> Ensures consistent application of activity thresholds for Canadian entities.

---

#### **(E) For Foreign Banks/Entities – Business in Canada (Paragraph 522.19(1)(a))**  
- Identical in structure to 522.05(a):  
  > Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)  
  Where:
  - B = assets from particular activities **in Canada**  
  - C = total assets **in Canada**  
  - D = revenue from particular activities **in Canada**  
  - E = total revenue **in Canada**

> Likely intended to provide redundancy or clarification in different regulatory contexts.

---

#### **(F) For Foreign Banks/Entities – Business Outside Canada (Paragraph 522.19(1)(b))**  
- Identical in structure to 522.05(b):  
  > Portion = greater of (B/C) and (D/E)  
  Where:
  - B = assets from particular activities **outside Canada**  
  - C = total assets **outside Canada**  
  - D = revenue from particular activities **outside Canada**  
  - E = total revenue **outside Canada**

> Reinforces consistency in assessing foreign operations.

---

### **6. Regulatory Impact and Practical Implications**

- **Transparency and Objectivity**: The formula provides a transparent, mathematically sound basis for determining activity proportions, reducing subjectivity in classification.
- **Risk-Based Supervision**: By considering both **assets** and **revenue**, regulators can better assess the risk profile of financial activities, especially in cross-border operations.
- **Compliance and Reporting**: Entities must now calculate these proportions annually or as required for regulatory reporting, particularly under:
  - Capital adequacy rules
  - Supervisory reviews
  - Anti-money laundering and consumer protection frameworks
- **Cross-Border Application**: The rules apply to **foreign banks** and **other financial entities**, ensuring that non-Canadian institutions are held to the same standards when operating in Canada.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **section 978 of the Bank Act** comes into force.
- Section 978 was enacted by **section 183 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act**, Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001.
- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2001 (as noted in SI/2001-102)

> This means the regulations were implemented on **October 24, 2001**, aligning with broader reforms in financial regulation and consumer protection.
