**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on Small Retransmission Systems (Copyright Act, 1988)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation, made under **subsection 70.64(2)** of the *Copyright Act* and approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** and the **Minister of Communications**, defines what constitutes a **"small retransmission system"** for the purposes of **subsection 70.64(1)** of the *Copyright Act*. 

The primary objective is to establish a legal framework that distinguishes **small-scale retransmission systems** from larger ones in order to determine whether such systems are subject to specific copyright licensing requirements under Canadian law. Specifically, this regulation helps clarify when a retransmission system qualifies as a "small" system — meaning one that retransmits signals to **no more than 2,000 premises** within a defined service area — thereby potentially exempting it from certain licensing obligations that apply to larger systems.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2005-147, section 2**, and is no longer in force. It was superseded by updated legislation and regulations, particularly following the evolution of the Canadian broadcasting and digital media landscape.

### **Key Definitions**

#### 1. **Premises**
Refers to any of the following:
- A **dwelling**, including:
  - A single-unit residence (e.g., a detached house or townhome)
  - A single unit within a multi-unit building (e.g., an apartment in a condominium)
- A **room** in a commercial or institutional building (e.g., office space, hospital room)

> This definition ensures that individual residential or functional units are counted as separate premises for determining system size.

#### 2. **Service Area**
Defined as:
> "An area in which premises served in accordance with the laws and regulations of Canada by a retransmission system are located."

This is essentially the geographic region covered by a retransmission system’s signal — the zone where its service reaches end-users.

> Example: A cable system serving homes in a specific neighborhood or city district constitutes a service area.

### **Definition of a "Small Retransmission System"**

#### **Core Requirement (Section 3(1))**
A **small retransmission system** is:
- A **cable retransmission system**, or
- A **terrestrial retransmission system** using **Hertzian waves** (i.e., radio/TV broadcast signals via terrestrial transmission)

…that retransmits a signal (with or without a fee) to **not more than 2,000 premises** within the **same service area**.

> This is the central threshold for determining whether a system qualifies as "small" under copyright law.

---

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **Section 3(2): Aggregation of Systems in the Same Unit**
If a **cable retransmission system** is part of a larger unit that includes one or more other cable systems, then:
- The total number of premises served by the entire unit is considered for the purpose of determining whether the system is "small".
- That is, the number of premises served by the **group** of systems is aggregated.

> Example: If a property owner operates two cable systems (System A and System B) on the same premises, and together they serve 1,800 homes, the total is treated as 1,800 — well below the 2,000 threshold — so both systems would qualify as part of a "small" system.

> This provision allows for consolidation of systems operated under common ownership or control, which may reduce administrative burdens or licensing costs.

#### **Section 3(2) – Conditions for Being in the Same Unit**
A cable system is considered part of the same unit as one or more others **if**:
1. They are **owned or directly or indirectly controlled** by the same person or group of persons.
2. Their service areas are each **less than 5 km apart** from at least one other system in the group.
3. When combined, their service areas would form a **series of contiguous service areas** — either linear or non-linear — *except* for the 5 km distance barrier.

> This ensures that systems that are geographically adjacent and under common control are treated as a single entity for licensing purposes.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**: This rule **does not apply** to cable retransmission systems that were already included in a unit as of **December 31, 1993**.

> This likely preserves existing legal status and avoids retroactive changes to older systems.

#### **Section 3(3): Exclusion of Master Antenna Systems**
A **master antenna system (MAS)** — a type of cable system that collects signals from multiple broadcast sources and distributes them to homes — is **excluded** from being considered a "small retransmission system" **if**:
- It is located within the service area of **another cable retransmission system** that serves **more than 2,000 premises**.

> This means: if a master antenna system is feeding into a larger cable network that serves over 2,000 homes, it is **not** treated as a "small" system, even if it serves fewer than 2,000 homes.

> Purpose: To prevent the misuse of "small system" status to circumvent copyright licensing requirements when a larger system is already in operation.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Licensing Threshold** | Systems serving ≤2,000 premises may be exempt from certain copyright licensing obligations under the Copyright Act. |
| **System Aggregation** | Multiple systems under one owner or control can be treated as a single unit, simplifying compliance. |
| **Geographic Proximity** | Systems must be within 5 km of each other to be grouped — ensuring that only physically connected systems are combined. |
| **Historical Exemptions** | Pre-1994 systems are protected from reclassification under this rule, maintaining stability in older infrastructure. |
| **Exclusion of MAS** | Prevents "small" status from being used to avoid liability when a larger system is already operating in the same area. |

### **Repeal and Current Status**

- This regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2005-147, section 2**, effective in 2005.
- It has been **replaced** by more modern, comprehensive rules governing copyright in broadcasting and retransmission, particularly under the **Copyright Act** as amended and interpreted in the context of digital media, satellite, and internet-based services.
- The current framework for determining whether a retransmission system is "small" is likely governed by updated regulations and court interpretations, especially in light of developments in cable, satellite, and IPTV technologies.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation historically provided a clear, legally binding definition of what constitutes a **small retransmission system** under Canadian copyright law, with specific rules for:
- Counting premises,
- Aggregating systems under common ownership,
- Defining geographic proximity,
- Excluding master antenna systems in certain contexts.

While **no longer in force**, it played a key role in shaping early Canadian copyright policy for cable and terrestrial retransmission systems, particularly in balancing the rights of broadcasters with the needs of smaller, local service providers.

> 📌 **Key Takeaway**: The regulation established a **2,000-premise threshold** for small systems, with important exceptions and aggregation rules to account for ownership and geography — all aimed at ensuring fair copyright licensing while allowing flexibility for small-scale operators.
