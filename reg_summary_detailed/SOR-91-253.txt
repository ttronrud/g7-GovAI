Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the regulation titled **"Cold Lake Airport Zoning Regulations"**, as published under the *Aeronautics Act* in 1990.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Cold Lake Airport Zoning Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**
- **Authority**: The regulation is made under **subsection 5.5(1)** and **paragraph 5.4(2)(b)** of the *Aeronautics Act*.
- **Procedural Compliance**: 
  - A public notice was published in two successive issues of a local newspaper and in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 31 and April 7, 1990**.
  - Interested parties were given a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** to the Minister of National Defence.
- **Objective**: To **prevent land adjacent to or near Cold Lake Airport** from being used or developed in a way that could compromise the **safety of aircraft operations** during takeoff, landing, or approach.

### **2. Name and Citation**
- **Title**: *Cold Lake Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Citation**: *R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1*

### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Cold Lake Airport, located in the vicinity of Grand Centre, Alberta. |
| **Airport Zoning Reference Point (AZRP)** | A fixed point on the centerline of runway 03–21 at the threshold of runway 21. This point is used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport's landing surface, including the runway, designed for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Each strip is 300 meters wide (150 m on each side of the runway centerline) and has a specified length. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip to protect aircraft during approach. It has two distinct slopes: a steeper initial slope (1:60), followed by a gentler slope (1:50) extending 15,000 meters horizontally. The surface rises to a horizontal line 291.0–291.4 meters above the strip end elevation. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane (1:7 slope) extending outward from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surfaces, connecting to the outer surface. It ensures a smooth transition between adjacent strips. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the AZRP (539 m above sea level)**. It defines the outer boundary of the regulated zone. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: The elevation of the AZRP is **539 meters above sea level**. All elevations referenced in the regulation are measured relative to this point.

### **4. Scope of Application**
- Applies to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Cold Lake Airport**, including **public road allowances**.
- The outer limits of these lands are precisely defined in **Part VII of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are **formally part of the airport** are not subject to these zoning restrictions.

---

### **5. Prohibited Development (Height Restrictions)**
No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures) on regulated land where the **highest point exceeds** any of the following surfaces:
  - The **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - The **transitional surface**

- **Natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, hills) on regulated land must **not exceed** the elevation of any of the above surfaces.

> ✅ This ensures that no obstruction — man-made or natural — interferes with aircraft visibility or flight paths during critical phases of flight.

---

### **6. Restrictions to Minimize Bird Hazards**
To reduce the risk of bird strikes (a major aviation hazard), the regulation prohibits:
- Use of land as a **sanitary landfill**
- **Food garbage disposal site**
- **Sewage lagoon**
- **Open water-storage reservoir**

> 🚨 These sites attract birds and increase the risk of bird collisions with aircraft, especially during takeoff and landing.

---

### **7. Description of Runway Strips**
The airport has three main runways, each with a defined strip:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **03–21** | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 2,680.0 m |
| **12R–30L** | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 3,959.6 m |
| **12L–30R** | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 3,959.6 m |

> These strip descriptions are based on the **Department of Public Works Zoning Plan No. E.1898**, dated **February 5, 1986**.

---

### **8. Approach Surfaces (Detailed)**
Each runway end has a dedicated approach surface with a specific profile:

- **Initial Slope**: 1:60 (1 meter vertical rise per 60 meters horizontal)
- **Secondary Slope**: 1:50 (1 meter vertical rise per 50 meters horizontal)
- Extends **15,000 meters horizontally** from the runway end
- Outer ends of the horizontal line are **2,400 meters** from the runway centerline
- Vertical height of the final horizontal line:
  - Runway 03: **291.2 m** above strip end elevation
  - Runway 21: **291.0 m**
  - Runway 12L & 12R: **291.0 m**
  - Runway 30L & 30R: **291.4 m**

> These surfaces ensure that aircraft have a clear view of the runway during approach, especially in poor visibility or adverse weather.

---

### **9. Transitional Surfaces**
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surfaces.
- Slope at **1:7** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend upward and outward until they meet:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The transitional surface of an **adjacent strip**

> This ensures a **smooth, continuous buffer zone** between adjacent runways, preventing obstructions from interfering with aircraft navigating between runways.

---

### **10. Outer Surface**
- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the AZRP** (i.e., 539 m + 45 m = **584 meters above sea level**).
- Serves as the **outer boundary** of the regulated zone.
- Defined in **Part V of the Schedule** and illustrated on the **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1898**.

---

### **11. Geographical Boundaries (Outer Limits of Regulated Lands)**
The outer limits of the regulated lands are defined by a **precise, detailed survey description** in **Part VII of the Schedule**. This boundary includes:

- A complex chain of directions and distances involving:
  - Township and Range coordinates (e.g., Township 62, Range 3, West of 4th Meridian)
  - Section boundaries (e.g., section 34, section 27)
  - Road allowances (public roads)
  - Specific survey posts (e.g., R1O B.C., R3)
  - Land lots and plans (e.g., Plan 8020035, Plan 7922686)

> This boundary ensures that only lands **within a defined perimeter** around the airport are subject to zoning restrictions.

---

### **12. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The regulation is **binding on all landowners and occupiers** within the defined area.
- Violations could result in:
  - Orders to remove structures or vegetation
  - Fines or penalties under the *Aeronautics Act*
  - Legal action by the Minister of National Defence

---

### **13. Regulatory Context and Significance**
- This regulation is part of a broader **aviation safety framework** designed to protect aircraft operations from ground-level hazards.
- It reflects the **importance of flight safety** in remote or high-use airports like Cold Lake, which serves both military and civilian aviation.
- The detailed geometric definitions (approach surfaces, transitional surfaces) show a **scientific and engineering-based approach** to aviation safety.

---

## 📌 Summary in Plain Language

The **Cold Lake Airport Zoning Regulations** establish strict rules for land use around Cold Lake Airport to **ensure flight safety**. 

- No buildings, trees, or structures can rise above certain **imaginary planes** (approach, transitional, and outer surfaces) that extend from the runways.
- These surfaces are designed so that aircraft can safely approach and land without being blocked by terrain or obstructions.
- Land use is restricted to prevent **bird hazards** (e.g., no landfills, garbage sites, or ponds).
- The boundaries of the regulated zone are clearly defined using precise survey coordinates.
- The rules apply to all
