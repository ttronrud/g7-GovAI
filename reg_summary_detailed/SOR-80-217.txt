## 💰 **Charges and Fees for Garbage Collection & Disposal**

Charges are based on **volume, type of property, and usage**. The following formulas apply:

---

### ✅ **General Formula (for most lots)**  
For owners of lots in parks with garbage collection services:

> **Charge = (Lot Volume Value) × (Total Operating & Maintenance Cost / Total Volume Value)**

Where:
- **Lot Volume Value** = sum of volume values of units on the lot × (months of occupancy / 12)
- **Total Operating & Maintenance Cost** = annual cost of collecting and disposing of garbage in the park
- **Total Volume Value** = sum of all lot volume values in the park

> 💡 This is a **volume-based fee**, ensuring that users pay according to their actual garbage output.

---

### ✅ **Prince Albert National Park (Specific Rules)**

#### 1. **Outside Central Business District (CBD)**
> **Charge = (Number of units on lot) × (Cost per unit of garbage) × (Total number of units in service area)**

Where:
- Cost per unit = total cost to collect/dispose of one unit of garbage
- Total number of units = total units in the
