## **Section 1: Transfer of Control and Supervision from DCIRNA to DIS**

The following units or branches within the **Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs (DCIRNA)** are transferred to the **Department of Indigenous Services (DIS)**, including full control and supervision:

| Unit/Branch | Key Functions and Responsibilities |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|

> **Purpose of Transfer**:  
> This consolidation aims to **centralize Indigenous-specific programming, data, and policy development** under the DIS, which has a broader mandate to deliver services to Indigenous peoples. By transferring these units, the federal government seeks to improve coordination, reduce duplication, and ensure that services are more responsive to Indigenous needs.

## **Section 2: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations to the Minister of Indigenous Services**

The **Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations** is transferred the **powers, duties, and functions** related to the **National Indigenous Economic Development Board (NIEDB)**.

> **What is the National Indigenous Economic Development Board?**  
> The NIEDB is a federal advisory body established to promote and support Indigenous economic development across Canada. It advises the government on strategies, policies, and initiatives that foster Indigenous-led economic growth, including business development, entrepreneurship, and investment opportunities.

> **Key Implications of the Transfer**:  
> - The Minister of Indigenous Services now has **direct authority over the governance, operations, and strategic direction** of the NIEDB.  
> - This shift reflects a broader policy direction to **embed economic development more fully within the Indigenous Services portfolio**, recognizing that economic self-determination is central to Indigenous well-being.  
> - The Minister of Indigenous Services will now be responsible for ensuring that the NIEDB’s work aligns with the government’s overall Indigenous services strategy and priorities.

## **Section 3: Transfer of Control from DIS to DCIRNA**

A **reverse transfer** occurs:  
The **Human Resources Planning, Performance Measurement and Systems Unit** within the **Department of Indigenous Services (DIS)** is transferred to the **Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs (DCIRNA)**.

> **Key Functions of the Unit**:  
> - Develops human resource strategies for Indigenous services.  
> - Conducts performance measurement and system evaluations of DIS programs.  
> - Manages HR systems, workforce planning, and performance data across Indigenous programs.

> **Rationale for Transfer**:  
> This transfer is intended to **strengthen the strategic oversight of human resources and performance management** within the broader framework of Crown-Indigenous relations. By placing HR planning and performance systems under DCIRNA, the government ensures that human capital strategies are aligned with the unique dynamics of Indigenous governance, land rights, and self-determination.  
> It also supports a more integrated approach to Indigenous governance and service delivery by ensuring that human resource planning reflects the cultural, historical, and political realities of Indigenous communities.

## **Key Objectives and Strategic Rationale Behind the Regulation**

1. **Improved Service Delivery**  
   - Consolidating functions under DIS enables more focused, coordinated, and culturally appropriate service delivery to Indigenous peoples.

2. **Enhanced Accountability and Performance**  
   - Centralizing performance measurement and evaluation (e.g., under the Evaluation Directorate) allows for more rigorous monitoring and accountability of Indigenous programs.

3. **Strengthening Indigenous Economic Development**  
   - Placing the NIEDB under the Minister of Indigenous Services reinforces the government’s commitment to Indigenous economic sovereignty and self-reliance.

4. **Better Data and Evidence-Based Policy**  
   - Transferring research and statistics functions ensures that policy decisions are informed by accurate, up-to-date data on Indigenous populations.

5. **Cultural and Institutional Alignment**  
   - The reorganization reflects a shift from a "relations" model (focused on legal and treaty-based interactions) to a "services" model (focused on community well-being and self-determination).

6. **Efficiency and Redundancy Reduction**  
   - Eliminates overlapping responsibilities and streamlines operations across departments.

## **Implementation Timeline and Effective Date**

- **Effective Date:** July 22, 2019  
- All transferred units, functions, and responsibilities are to be operationalized by this date.  
- Transition planning, staff reallocation, and training are required to ensure continuity of service and effective integration.

## **Significance and Broader Context**

This regulation is part of a larger federal initiative to **modernize and restructure Indigenous services** in response to:

- Calls from Indigenous leaders for greater self-determination  
- Recommendations from the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)** and the **First Nations, Inuit and Métis (FNIM) Councils**  
- The need to address systemic inequities in access to services, economic opportunities, and governance  

It also reflects Canada’s evolving approach to **Indigenous self-governance**, where Indigenous peoples are increasingly seen as partners in shaping policies and programs—rather than passive recipients of services.

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant structural shift in the federal government’s approach to Indigenous affairs. By transferring key operational, strategic, and administrative functions between the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs and the Department of Indigenous Services, the government aims to:

- Create a more **cohesive, responsive, and accountable** system of Indigenous services  
- Prioritize **Indigenous economic development and self-determination**  
- Strengthen **data, research, and performance management**  
- Improve **cultural relevance and community engagement**  

While the reorganization enhances strategic focus, it also requires ongoing monitoring and consultation with Indigenous communities to ensure that it remains equitable, respectful, and effective in meeting Indigenous needs.
