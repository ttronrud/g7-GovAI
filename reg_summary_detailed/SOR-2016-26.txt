## 🚨 **Risk Assessment and Financial Recommendation – Subsection 27.1(1) of the Act**

### When the Board Can Recommend:
- If the Board is satisfied that the **estimated total of losses, damages, costs, and expenses** (excluding non-use value losses) for which the applicant may be liable under:
  - Paragraphs 26(1)(b) or (2)(b) of COGOA  
    (i.e., environmental damage, spills, emissions, etc.)
- Is **less than** the amount required under:
  - Paragraph 26(2.2)(a) or (d) of COGOA  
    (i.e., the standard financial guarantee threshold)

### What the Recommendation Must Include:

1. **Estimated total of losses, damages, costs, and expenses**  
   → A detailed, risk-based calculation of potential liabilities.

2. **Recommended amount**  
   → Must be **lower than** the standard threshold specified in 26(2.2)(a) or (d).

3. **Summary of reasons for the recommendation**  
   → Explains why the risk is low (e.g., low probability of spill, minimal environmental exposure, robust safety measures).

4. **Summary of relevant applicant information**  
   → Includes data provided by the applicant (e.g., safety records, past performance, mitigation plans).

5. **Any additional information requested by the Minister**  
   → Ensures transparency and ministerial oversight.

### Additional Flexibility:
