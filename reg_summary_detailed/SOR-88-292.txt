**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Cattle Order**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Prince Edward Island Cattle Order* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* of Prince Edward Island. Specifically, it is made pursuant to **Section 2** of that Act, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture) to establish rules governing the marketing of agricultural products, including cattle, in interprovincial and export markets.

This Order is formally cited as the **Prince Edward Island Cattle Order** and serves as a statutory framework to regulate the marketing of cattle produced in Prince Edward Island (PEI) when such cattle are sold outside the province or exported.

**Key Definitions in the Order**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Prince Edward Island* (in French: *Loi*). This foundational legislation provides the legal basis for regulating the marketing of agricultural products, including cattle, and enables the establishment of commodity groups to manage pricing, levies, and market activities.

2. **"Cattle"**  
   Defined as *finished cattle produced in Prince Edward Island that are sold for slaughter*. This excludes live cattle being raised for breeding or other non-slaughter purposes. The definition focuses on animals that are ready for processing and intended for meat production.

3. **"Commodity Group"**  
   Refers to the **Prince Edward Island Cattlemen’s Association Inc.** (known in French as *groupement de producteurs*). This organization is designated as the authorized body to manage and regulate the marketing of PEI cattle in interprovincial and export markets.

**Core Regulatory Powers Granted to the Commodity Group**

The Order grants the Prince Edward Island Cattlemen’s Association (the Commodity Group) specific powers to regulate the marketing of cattle in two key areas:

### 1. **Regulation of Interprovincial and Export Trade**
The Commodity Group is authorized to regulate how cattle produced in PEI are marketed outside the province and internationally. This includes setting standards, pricing mechanisms, and market access protocols to ensure fair and orderly trade.

### 2. **Exercise of Powers Comparable to Local Marketing Authority**
With respect to persons and property located within Prince Edward Island, the Commodity Group may exercise **all or any powers** that it currently holds under the *Natural Products Marketing Act* in relation to the **local marketing of cattle**. This means that the powers granted to the group in domestic markets (such as pricing, sales, and quality control) can be extended to interprovincial and export transactions, ensuring consistency and fairness across all market channels.

**Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**

The Commodity Group is empowered to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of cattle** within PEI.
- These levies or charges must be established by **order** (a formal, legally binding decision).
- The Group may **classify** producers or marketers into different groups (e.g., by farm size, type of operation, or production volume).
- It may then **set different levies or charges** for each group, based on their characteristics and contribution to the industry.

This classification system allows for equitable and differentiated cost-sharing among producers, ensuring that larger or more active participants may contribute more, while smaller producers are not unfairly burdened.

---

**Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (funds set aside for future use, such as during market downturns or price volatility)
- **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of cattle (e.g., due to market fluctuations, disease, or poor demand)
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers  
  This ensures that producers who may have experienced poor sales in a given period can be compensated, or that those with better sales results contribute to support others. This mechanism helps stabilize income and reduce economic risk across the industry.

The Commodity Group has discretion over **when and for how long** these equalization or adjustment programs are implemented, based on market conditions and financial assessments.

**Purpose and Objectives of the Order**

The overarching goals of the Prince Edward Island Cattle Order are:

- To ensure **fair and orderly marketing** of PEI cattle in interprovincial and export markets.
- To provide **economic stability** for producers by managing market risks and creating financial buffers.
- To promote **collaborative decision-making** through a representative industry body (the Cattlemen’s Association).
- To support the **long-term viability** of the cattle industry in PEI by enabling coordinated pricing, risk-sharing, and market access.

---

**Legal and Practical Implications**

- The Order operates under the broader framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act*, which emphasizes producer cooperation, market stability, and government support for agriculture.
- It reflects a common agricultural practice in Canada where commodity groups are empowered to manage marketing and financial aspects of production to protect farmers from market volatility.
- The levy system is designed to be both **flexible and equitable**, allowing adaptation to changing market dynamics and producer needs.
- The Commodity Group is accountable to the public and subject to oversight, as such powers are granted under a legislative framework that requires transparency and justification.

**Conclusion**

The *Prince Edward Island Cattle Order* establishes a structured and legally sound mechanism for the regulation of cattle marketing beyond the province. By empowering the Prince Edward Island Cattlemen’s Association to set levies, manage financial reserves, and equalize income among producers, the Order strengthens the resilience of the local cattle industry in the face of interprovincial and international market challenges. It ensures that producers are protected from price volatility, that market practices are fair, and that industry-wide goals are met through cooperative governance.

This Order is a key component of PEI’s agricultural policy, promoting both economic sustainability and equitable outcomes for cattle producers.
