### **Detailed Summary of the Stratford Municipal Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in a local newspaper (Stratford Beacon Herald) to provide public notice and an opportunity for comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt proposed zoning regulations after public consultation.

The proposed regulations were:
- Published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **June 24 and July 1, 1995**.
- Published in two successive issues of the *Stratford Beacon Herald* on **June 28 and 29, 1995**.

This ensured a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations to the Minister of Transport before final adoption.

#### **2. Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Stratford Municipal Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1; S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10

These regulations define the spatial and height restrictions applicable to land adjacent to and near the Stratford Municipal Airport.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Stratford Municipal Airport located in the Township of North Easthope, County of Perth, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point used as a vertical datum for measuring elevations. Its coordinates are UTM: N 4,806,823.84 and E 505,321.24. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runways (05-23 and 17-35) to protect aircraft during landing. Defined by slope ratios and horizontal distances. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the ARP elevation, except where it would be less than 9 meters above ground—then it is set at 9 meters. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area (runway and approach zones) for each runway direction. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strips and approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 367.7 meters above sea level.

---

#### **4. Applicable Land Area**

The regulations apply to **all land**, including public road allowances, that lies **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, as precisely described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

The outer boundary of the regulated zone is defined by a detailed, step-by-step geometric description across multiple lots and concessions in the Townships of Ellice and North Easthope and the City of Stratford, County of Perth.

This boundary ensures that only land within a defined perimeter is subject to the height and development restrictions.

---

#### **5. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Development)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land,
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> These surfaces act as "height limits" to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations.

---

#### **6. Prohibitions on Interference with Aeronautics**

No owner or lessee may:
- Use or develop any part of regulated land in a way that causes:
  - Interference with **aircraft signals or communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems), or  
  - Interference with **aeronautical service facilities** (e.g., control towers, lighting, emergency services).

This includes both man-made structures and natural growth.

---

#### **7. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces:
- The **Minister of Transport** may issue a directive requiring the **removal of excess growth**.
- This ensures that natural features do not become hazards to flight operations.

---

#### **8. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at the **southwesterly end of runway 05-23**.
- UTM Coordinates:  
  - Start: N 4,806,218.75, E 504,852.60 (threshold of runway 05)  
  - Move northeasterly 762.94 m along centerline of runway 05-23  
  - Then northwesterly 64.94 m perpendicular → final point:  
    **N 4,806,823.84, E 505,321.24**

##### **B. Approach Surfaces (4 planes, one per runway end)**

| Runway | Slope Ratio | Horizontal Distance from End | Height of Top Line | Distance from Centerline |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 05 (approach) | 1:40 (1m up / 40m out) | 3,000 m | 75 m above end elevation | 525 m from center |
| 23 (approach) | 1:40 | 1,776 m | 44.4 m above end elevation | 341.4 m from center |
| 17 (approach) | 1:30 | 1,350 m | 45 m above end elevation | 180 m from center |
| 35 (approach) | 1:30 | 1,311 m | 43.7 m above end elevation | 176.1 m from center |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during landing by preventing obstructions within critical approach zones.

##### **C. Outer Surface**
- A flat plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 367.7 m + 45 m = 412.7 m above sea level).
- **Exception**: Where this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground, it is set at **9 meters above ground level** to avoid impractical enforcement.

##### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**
| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|------|--------|
| 05-23 | 150 m (75 m on each side) | 1,646.11 m |
| 17-35 | 90 m (45 m on each side) | 1,095 m |

These define the active areas where aircraft take off and land.

##### **E. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strips and approach surfaces**.
- Extend upward until they meet:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - Another transitional surface of an adjacent runway.
- **Elevation rules**:
  - Between thresholds: Lower edge elevation = elevation of nearest point on centerline.
  - Between threshold and end of strip: Lower edge elevation = elevation of threshold.

> These surfaces ensure smooth transitions between runway zones and approach zones, preventing abrupt height changes that could affect aircraft navigation.

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of **excess natural growth**.
  - Enforce compliance with height and interference rules.
- Violations may result in legal action or administrative penalties, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in the text.

---

#### **10. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure Flight Safety**  
   Prevent visual and physical obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

2. **Maintain Communication and Navigation Integrity**  
   Prevent interference with radio, radar, and other aeronautical communication systems.

3. **Preserve Airport Functionality**  
   Protect the operational efficiency of the airport by maintaining clear zones around runways and approach paths.

4. **Provide Predictable Zoning**  
   Define clear boundaries and height limits so that land use planning is transparent and consistent.

---

#### **11. Significance and Impact**

- These regulations establish a **formal, legally binding zoning framework** for land use around the Stratford Municipal Airport.
- They reflect international standards for airport proximity zones, particularly in terms of:
  - Approach surface slopes (1:40 or 1:30)
  - Outer surface height (45 m above ARP)
  - Transitional surfaces (1:7 slope)
- The detailed geometric descriptions ensure precision in enforcement and compliance.
