**Detailed Summary of the Criminal Proceedings Rules of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (Effective July 1, 2018)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Criminal Proceedings Rules of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador*, effective **July 1, 2018**, replace the former *Newfoundland Trial Division of the Supreme Court Rules Respecting Pre-Trial Conferences* (Can. Reg. SI/86-80). These rules were enacted under two provisions of the *Criminal Code*:

- **Subsection 482(1)** – for repealing the old rules and adopting new ones.
- **Subsection 482.1(1)** – for introducing a new rule (Rule 10) specifically related to case management.

These rules govern the procedural framework for **criminal proceedings** in the **General Division of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador**, with the primary objective of ensuring **fairness, efficiency, simplicity, and timely resolution** of cases while preserving the accused’s right to a fair and timely trial.
