**Detailed Summary of the *Disclosure of Charges (Retail Associations) Regulations***

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Disclosure of Charges (Retail Associations) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCAA)**:

- **Section 385.09a** – Relates to disclosure obligations of retail associations regarding charges.
- **Section 385.28a** – Supports transparency in financial services provided by retail associations.
- **Section 463b** – Empowers the government to regulate disclosure of fees and charges to ensure consumer transparency.

These regulations were originally enacted in:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 313 and s. 339** (amendments to the CCAA)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 48** (original framework)

The purpose of these regulations is to **enhance financial transparency** by requiring retail credit associations (such as co-operative banks or credit unions) to clearly disclose all charges associated with deposit accounts and related services to their customers and the public.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Controlled Access Automated Teller Machine (ATM)**  
   - An ATM located either:
     - In a branch or point of service of a retail association, or  
     - In an enclosed area adjacent to such a location.  
   - Access is **controlled by a system** that restricts entry to authorized users (e.g., via PIN, card, or authentication).  
   - This definition ensures that only users with proper access can use these machines, and thus, disclosures must be tailored accordingly.

2. **Point of Service (POS)**  
   - A physical location where the public can access services and open or initiate the opening of **personal deposit accounts** (e.g., savings or checking accounts).  
   - Examples include branches, kiosks, or community service centers operated by the retail association.
