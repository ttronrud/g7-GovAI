Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation titled:

---

### **Regulations Respecting Employment Related to Mines at the Donkin Coal Block**  
*Made under the Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act*  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 2007, c. 33*  
*Effective Date: Upon registration*

---

## **1. Purpose and Context**
These regulations were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**, under **subsections 13(1) and (3)** of the *Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act*.  
The primary objective is to **establish a special employment framework** for workers involved in mining operations at the **Donkin coal block** in Nova Scotia. This framework provides a **limited exemption** from certain provisions of federal labour standards, while still ensuring that key provincial labour and health and safety laws apply.

This regulation is part of a broader policy to **support the development of the Donkin coal project**, which is a significant mining initiative in Nova Scotia, by creating a tailored regulatory environment that balances worker protections with operational feasibility.

---

## **2. Key Definitions and Interpretation**

### **"Nova Scotia laws"**
- Refers to all **Acts and regulations of Nova Scotia**, as listed in **Schedule 1**, as amended from time to time.
- Includes **regulations made under any of these Acts** after the coming into force of these Regulations, **unless otherwise specified**.
- This ensures that the current body of provincial labour and employment law remains relevant and applicable.

### **Application of the Nova Scotia Interpretation Act**
- The *Nova Scotia Interpretation Act (R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 235)* applies to the interpretation of "Nova Scotia laws".
- The **adaptations** to interpretation rules are detailed in **Schedule 2** of these regulations.
- This ensures consistency in how laws are interpreted in the context of mining employment at Donkin.

---

## **3. Exemption from Federal Labour Code**

### **Excluded Provisions**
The employment in or in connection with the operation of a mine that is **wholly or partly located at the Donkin coal block** is **excluded from the application** of:
- **Parts I, II, and III of the Canada Labour Code**.

#### What does this mean?
- Workers at the Donkin coal block are **not subject to federal labour standards** such as:
  - Minimum wage
  - Working hours (e.g., overtime limits)
  - Leave entitlements (e.g., parental, vacation, or maternity leave)
  - Hours of work or rest periods
  - Employment equity provisions (under federal law)

> This exemption is **specific** and only applies to the **Donkin coal block** and **mining operations** directly related to it.

#### Important Note:
- This exemption **does not** apply to all mining activities in Nova Scotia. It is **limited in scope** and geographically restricted to the Donkin coal block.

---

## **4. Application of Provincial Labour and Safety Laws**

Despite the exemption from the *Canada Labour Code*, the following **provincial laws and regulations** **do apply** to employment at the Donkin coal block:

| Provincial Law / Regulation | Status |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| **Labour Standards Code (R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 246)** and its regulations | Applies **except** clauses 7(b), (ba), and (bb) |
| **Occupational Health and Safety Act (S.N.S. 1996, c. 7)** and its regulations | Applies fully |
| **Occupational Health Regulations (N.S. Reg. 112/76)** | Applies **except Section 10** |

### Explanation:
- The **Labour Standards Code** governs core employment rights such as minimum wage, working hours, and leave. However, **specific clauses (7(b), (ba), and (bb)) are excluded**, likely due to operational or sector-specific considerations.
- The **Occupational Health and Safety Act** remains fully applicable — meaning employers must comply with all health and safety standards for mining operations.
- The **Occupational Health Regulations** apply **except for Section 10**, which may relate to specific health-related duties or reporting requirements that are being temporarily waived or adapted for mining operations.

> This reflects a **pragmatic balance**: allowing flexibility in labour standards while maintaining strong health and safety oversight.

---

## **5. Reference to Human Rights Law**

### Subsections 59A(2) and 59G(3)
- A reference to the **Human Rights Act (R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 214)** in these subsections is **read as a reference to the Canadian Human Rights Act**.
- This means that **provincial human rights protections** (such as those under the Human Rights Act) are **replaced or harmonized** with **federal human rights standards** in the context of these regulations.

> This ensures **consistency with federal human rights law** in cases of discrimination, especially in employment contexts involving protected attributes (e.g., race, gender, disability).

---

## **6. Leave Entitlements**

### Clause 60A(a)
- Employees are entitled to **leave upon the death of a common-law partner**.
- The definition of "common-law partner" is taken from **Clause 60E(1)(a)** of the Labour Standards Code.
- This provides **protection for employees' personal and family life**, even in the context of a mining operation where federal labour standards are otherwise excluded.

> This is a **significant inclusion** — it ensures that employees still have access to important leave rights, even under the exemption from the Canada Labour Code.

---

## **7. Jurisdiction and Applicability**

### Who the Regulations Apply To:
- **Her Majesty in right of the Province of Nova Scotia**
- **Employees of Her Majesty** (i.e., employees working for the provincial government or in operations under provincial jurisdiction)

> This ensures that the regulations are binding on both public and private entities operating at the Donkin coal block.

---

## **8. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette* or officially published.

> This provides immediate effect upon formal adoption, enabling prompt implementation of the new framework.

---

## **9. Summary Table: Key Provisions**

| Provision | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Federal Labour Code Exemption** | Parts I, II, III of the Canada Labour Code do **not apply** to employment at the Donkin coal block. |
| **Provincial Laws Apply** | Labour Standards Code, Occupational Health and Safety Act, and Occupational Health Regulations **apply**, with specific exclusions (e.g., clauses 7(b), (ba), (bb); Section 10 of OH Regulations). |
| **Human Rights Reference** | References to the Human Rights Act are interpreted as referring to the **Canadian Human Rights Act**. |
| **Leave Rights** | Employees are entitled to leave upon the death of a **common-law partner**, as defined in Clause 60E(1)(a). |
| **Interpretation** | Governed by the *Nova Scotia Interpretation Act*, with adaptations in Schedule 2. |

## **10. Implications and Significance**

- **Protected rights** under provincial law (e.g., common-law partner leave, health and safety).
- Must still be aware of **human rights protections** under federal law.

### For the Donkin Coal Project:
- Provides a **legally compliant and operationally viable framework** for mining development.
- Supports economic growth and job creation in a high-risk sector (mining) by reducing regulatory burdens while preserving essential worker protections.

---

## **11. Limitations and Exceptions**

- The exemption is **geographically and operationally limited** to the **Donkin coal block**.
- Does **not extend** to other mining projects or non-mining employment.
- Excludes only **specific clauses** of the Labour Standards Code and **Section 10** of the Occupational Health Regulations — indicating targeted, not blanket, exemptions.

---

## **Conclusion**

These regulations represent a **targeted, sector-specific regulatory approach** to mining employment in Nova Scotia. They allow for **operational flexibility** in a high-risk, capital-intensive industry by exempting the Donkin coal block from federal labour standards, while **retaining essential provincial protections** in health and safety and key leave entitlements. This balance supports economic development and project viability while upholding fundamental worker rights where they remain relevant.

---

✅ **Key Takeaway**:  
*Workers at the Donkin coal block are not covered by federal labour standards, but are still protected under key provincial laws — especially in health and safety and personal leave — making this a balanced, practical, and legally sound regulatory framework.*
