## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties**

### 📌 **Overview**
This regulation establishes the procedures, requirements, and exceptions for **accounting for imported goods** and **paying duties** under the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1986, c. 1). It was introduced following a public consultation period, where a draft version was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on March 29, 1986, allowing stakeholders to submit written representations to the Minister of National Revenue.

The regulation came into force upon the coming into effect of specific sections of the *Customs Act*, including sections 32, 33, 35, 88, 89, 92, and paragraphs 164(1)(d), (i), and (j), as well as section 166.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This regulation has been **repealed or amended over time** (e.g., SOR/2001-197, SOR/2005-210, SOR/2006-152, SOR/2011-208, SOR/2018-121, SOR/2024-41). Many key terms and provisions have been removed or replaced. The current version reflects a **historical snapshot** of customs accounting rules from the late 1980s to early 2020s, and should not be interpreted as current law without checking the most recent version.
