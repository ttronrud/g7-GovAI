**Detailed Summary of the Gatineau Region Wood Producers’ Levy (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**

- **Governing Statute**: This Order is issued under **Section 4 of the Quebec Wood Order, 1983**, which empowers the *Gatineau Region Wood Producers’ Board* (the "Board") to establish and collect levies on wood producers engaged in interprovincial and export trade.
- **Legal Basis**: The Order was made by **Order in Council P.C. 1983-2885**, dated September 22, 1983, and is formally published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on July 20, 1988 (SOR/83-713, p. 3444).
- **Title of the Order**: *Gatineau Region Wood Producers’ Levy (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order*.

---

### **2. Scope and Definitions**

#### **Key Definitions**:
- **Board**: Refers to the *Gatineau Region Wood Producers’ Board*, responsible for administering and collecting the levy.
- **Producer**: A person involved in either the **production or marketing** of wood. This broad definition ensures that both those who grow or harvest wood and those who sell or distribute it are subject to the levy.
- **Wood**: Specifically defined as wood produced in the **Gatineau Valley regional municipality** in Quebec, **excluding** the following municipalities:
  - Denholm
  - Dorion
  - Low
  - Kazabazua  
  → This limits the scope of the levy to wood originating from the core Gatineau Valley area, excluding certain adjacent townships.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that only wood from designated geographic areas is subject to the levy, promoting regional accountability and fair taxation.

### **3. Levy Rates (General Administration Levy)**

A producer must pay a general administration levy based on the **unit of measurement** used to sell or market the wood. The rates vary depending on the unit:

| **Unit of Measurement** | **Levy Rate** |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Tonnes (metric)        | $0.56 per tonne |
| Apparent cubic metres  | $0.35 per apparent cubic metre |
| Solid cubic metres     | $0.53 per solid cubic metre |
| Cords (128 ft³)        | $1.27 per cord |
| Cords (160 ft³)        | $1.59 per cord |
| Cords (192 ft³)        | $1.90 per cord |
| Cords (224 ft³)        | $2.22 per cord |
| Cords (256 ft³)        | $2.54 per cord |
| Cubic feet             | $1.50 per 100 cubic feet |
| Board measure (1,000 board feet) | $2.54 per 1,000 board feet |
| Short tons (US)        | $0.50 per short ton |
| Units of 1,000 pounds  | $0.25 per unit |
| Firewood units (4 ft × 8 ft × 16 in) | $0.42 per unit |
| Sold by the piece      | **4.6% of the sale price to the mill** |

> **Note**: The piece-based levy is a **percentage of the mill sale price**, which makes it directly tied to market value and provides a revenue mechanism proportional to output volume.

> **Purpose of Varying Rates**: To accommodate different types of wood products and traditional units of trade (e.g., firewood, lumber, logs), ensuring the levy is practical and applicable across diverse markets.

### **4. Payment Requirements**

- **General Rule**:  
  A producer must pay the applicable levy to the Board **within 30 days** after the marketing of the wood in interprovincial or export trade.

- **Payment Location**:  
  All levies must be paid to the **Board’s headquarters in Maniwaki, Quebec**.

> **Objective**: Ensures timely collection and administrative accountability.

---

### **5. Deduction by the Board**

- If the **Board itself markets** the wood on behalf of a producer in interprovincial or export trade, it may **deduct the applicable levy directly** from any payment made to the producer.

> **Implication**: This streamlines the collection process when the Board acts as a marketer, reducing the burden on producers and ensuring the levy is collected without requiring separate action.

---

### **6. Deduction by Third Parties (Marketers)**

If a producer fails to pay the levy:
- **Any person who markets the producer’s wood** (e.g., a wholesaler, exporter, or distributor) must:
  1. **Deduct the levy** from any payment made to the producer; and  
  2. **Pay the full amount of the levy to the Board within 30 days** of the marketing event, along with an **accounting of the payment**.

> **Key Enforcement Mechanism**: This provision creates a **financial obligation on intermediaries** to ensure the levy is collected even if the producer is non-compliant. It acts as a deterrent against evasion.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that the levy is collected regardless of whether the producer pays directly or indirectly through third-party sales.

---

### **7. Key Provisions and Enforcement**

- **No exemptions** are stated in this Order for producers who fail to pay, except through the mechanisms described above.
- The Board has **enforcement authority** over both direct and indirect marketing channels.
- The 30-day deadline applies to both the **initial payment** and the **reporting of deductions** by third parties.
- The requirement to provide an **accounting** ensures transparency and auditability.

### **8. Purpose and Rationale**

This Order serves several key regulatory and economic functions:

1. **Revenue Generation**:  
   Provides a stable source of revenue for the Board to fund administrative and regulatory activities related to wood trade.

2. **Fair Distribution of Costs**:  
   The levy is designed to be proportional to the volume and type of wood traded, ensuring that larger volumes or higher-value products contribute more.

3. **Support for Regional Economic Development**:  
   By taxing interprovincial and export sales, the Board helps maintain sustainable forestry practices and supports local industry development in the Gatineau Valley.

4. **Enforcement and Compliance**:  
   The dual mechanism of direct payment and third-party deduction ensures compliance even in cases where producers may be negligent or uncooperative.

5. **Geographic Specificity**:  
   Excluding certain municipalities ensures that the levy targets only wood from the core Gatineau Valley region, preventing overreach and administrative inefficiency.

---

### **9. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excluded Areas**: Wood from Denholm, Dorion, Low, and Kazabazua is **not subject** to this levy.
- **No Mention of Domestic Trade**: The levy applies **only to interprovincial and export trade**, not to domestic sales within Quebec.
- **No Tax on Production Alone**: The levy applies only to **marketing** (i.e., selling or distributing), not to the actual harvesting or production of wood.

---

### **10. Conclusion**

The *Gatineau Region Wood Producers’ Levy (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* is a targeted, flexible, and enforceable regulatory instrument designed to:

- Generate revenue for regional wood industry administration,
- Ensure equitable cost-sharing among producers based on volume and measurement units,
- Promote compliance through both direct and indirect enforcement mechanisms,
- Maintain geographic specificity and relevance to the Gatineau Valley region.

It reflects a practical approach to regulating forest product trade, balancing administrative feasibility with economic fairness and regional accountability.

---

**In essence**: This Order establishes a comprehensive, unit-based levy system that applies to wood marketed outside Quebec or exported, with strong enforcement tools to ensure collection—even when producers fail to pay directly. It remains a foundational piece of regional forestry regulation in Quebec.
