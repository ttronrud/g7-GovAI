**Detailed Summary of the Australia and New Zealand Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**
These regulations, made under the authority of the *Customs Tariff Act* (specifically subsection 16(2)), establish the rules determining whether goods from **Australia** or **New Zealand** qualify for preferential tariff treatment when imported into **Canada**. The regulations define what constitutes "origin" for the purposes of eligibility for the Australia Tariff or the New Zealand Tariff, which allows for reduced or preferential customs duties under Canada’s trade agreements.

The regulations came into force on **January 1, 1998**, and were enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Definition of Origin for Australia**
Goods originate in **Australia** if:
- **At least 50% of the cost of production** of the goods is incurred by the **industry of Australia or Canada (or both)**, and  
- The goods were **finished in Australia** in the form in which they are imported into Canada.

> *Note:* The 50% threshold applies to the cost of production, not value-added components. This means that the production process must have a significant portion of its costs attributable to Australian or Canadian industries.

#### **2. Definition of Origin for New Zealand**
Goods originate in **New Zealand** if:
- **At least 50% of the cost of production** of the goods is incurred by the **industry of New Zealand or Canada (or both)**, and  
- The goods were **finished in New Zealand** in the form in which they are imported into Canada.

> *Note:* Similar to Australia, the 50% rule applies to production costs, and the final manufacturing must occur in New Zealand.

### **Exclusions from the Cost of Production (for determining origin)**

When calculating the "cost of production" for the purpose of assessing whether the 50% threshold is met, the following costs **shall not be included**:

1. **Cost of outside packing and related transportation expenses**  
   - Only packing required for transportation is excluded.  
   - Excluded: Packing necessary for transport (e.g., crates, containers).  
   - **Included**: Ordinary consumer packaging (e.g., retail wrapping).

2. **Gross profit of the manufacturer or exporter**  
   - Profits earned by the manufacturer or exporter are not part of the cost of production.

3. **Profit or remuneration of traders, brokers, or other parties dealing in finished goods**  
   - Any profit made by intermediaries (e.g., distributors, brokers) in the finished product stage is excluded.

4. **Royalties**  
   - Payments made for the use of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trademarks) are not included.

5. **Customs or excise duties or taxes paid or payable on imported materials**  
   - Duties levied on raw materials or components brought into the country of origin are excluded from the cost of production.

6. **Carriage, insurance, and other charges from place of production to port of shipment**  
   - Transportation costs from the manufacturing site to the port of export are excluded.

7. **Any other costs incurred or to be incurred after the completion of manufacturing**  
   - Post-manufacturing expenses (e.g., advertising, marketing, distribution, retail costs) are excluded.

> *Purpose:* These exclusions ensure that the cost of production reflects only the direct, in-country manufacturing expenses, avoiding distortion due to downstream or indirect costs.

### **Shipping Requirements for Tariff Eligibility**

- **Australia Tariff Eligibility**:  
  Goods are only entitled to the Australia Tariff if they are **shipped directly to Canada**, with or without transhipment, from **Australia**.

- **New Zealand Tariff Eligibility**:  
  Goods are only entitled to the New Zealand Tariff if they are **shipped directly to Canada**, with or without transhipment, from **New Zealand**.

> *Note:* Transshipment (i.e., goods being moved through a third country en route to Canada) is allowed, as long as the final destination is Canada and the goods originate from Australia or New Zealand. However, the goods must not be re-exported or processed in a third country in a way that would negate their origin.

### **Key Implications and Practical Applications**

- **Manufacturing Location Matters**: The goods must be **finished** in Australia or New Zealand, not just produced in part.  
- **Cost-Based Origin Rule**: The 50% threshold is based on **cost**, not value or value-added, making it a cost-based rule of origin.  
- **Exclusion of Post-Manufacturing Costs**: This prevents inflated costs from being used to claim origin, ensuring that only genuine production costs are considered.  
- **Direct Shipping Requirement**: The requirement for direct shipment to Canada (with or without transhipment) ensures that goods are not routed through third countries to avoid origin rules. This helps prevent fraud or misuse of preferential tariffs.

### **Repeal Clause**
The regulations contain a **repeal clause**, indicating that these rules were temporary or transitional. They were not intended to be permanent, and their specific application may have been superseded by later legislation or updated trade agreements.

---

### **Conclusion**

These regulations provide a clear, rule-based framework for determining whether goods from Australia or New Zealand qualify for preferential tariff treatment under Canadian trade policy. By focusing on **cost of production** (with specific exclusions), **final manufacturing location**, and **direct shipment to Canada**, the rules ensure that only genuinely origin-based goods receive preferential treatment.

The regulations were designed to:
- Promote fair trade by ensuring that only goods produced in or substantially processed in Australia or New Zealand qualify,
- Prevent manipulation of origin through indirect or post-manufacturing costs,
- Maintain the integrity of Canada’s trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand.

They were in effect from **January 1, 1998**, and reflect Canada’s commitment to regional trade preferences during the early 1990s as part of broader free trade arrangements.

**Note**: These rules may have been superseded by more recent trade agreements or updated origin rules under the Canada-Australia or Canada-New Zealand Free Trade Agreements (e.g., under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or other bilateral arrangements). Always verify current rules with updated trade legislation.
