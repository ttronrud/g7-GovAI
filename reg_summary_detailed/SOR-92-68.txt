**Detailed Summary of the Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

The **Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the **Aeronautics Act of Canada**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed zoning regulations be publicly published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in a local newspaper (in this case, *News/North*) to allow for public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt and promulgate the final zoning regulations after a reasonable opportunity for public input.

This regulation was developed following a **public notice period**:
- Published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** on **March 9 and 16, 1991**.
- Published in **two successive issues of News/North** on **June 24 and July 1, 1991**.

This ensured that interested parties—including residents, developers, aviation stakeholders, and environmental groups—had sufficient time to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport before the final regulations were enacted.

### **2. Title and Citation**

The regulations are officially titled:  
**Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations**  
They may be cited as such and form part of the legal framework governing land use around the airport.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several critical terms used to describe the spatial and structural boundaries around the airport:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Coral Harbour Airport, located in the vicinity of Coral Harbour, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the ground used as a reference for measuring elevations and distances. It is located on the centerline of runway 155T–335T, **762 meters from the threshold of runway 335T**. Its elevation is **56 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. These surfaces ensure that aircraft can safely approach the runway without obstruction. Each approach surface has a **1:40 slope** (1 meter rise per 40 meters horizontal distance), rising to an imaginary horizontal line: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Distance from runway end | 3,000 meters horizontally |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Outer ends of the line | 525 meters from the runway centerline |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Elevation of the horizontal line | 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 56 m + 45 m = 101 m above sea level). However, **if this elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent ground-level obstructions. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, specifically the **1,644-meter-long, 150-meter-wide** rectangular zone associated with runway 155T–335T. It is centered on the runway and extends 75 meters on each side of the centerline. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. It rises at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontal distance) and extends upward and outward until it intersects with the outer surface. This ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including **public road allowances**. The exact boundaries of these lands are defined in **Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulation.

The boundary of the outer limits of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**. This creates a large, circular zone within which land use restrictions are enforced.

---

### **5. Key Prohibition – Height Restrictions**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures) **on any land subject to these regulations** if the **highest point** of that structure exceeds any of the following surfaces:

- The **approach surfaces**
- The **outer surface**
- The **transitional surfaces**

This restriction is designed to:
- Prevent visual and physical interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.
- Ensure safe flight operations by maintaining unobstructed visibility and clear flight paths.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Even small structures (e.g., towers, antennas, windbreaks, or trees) must comply with these height limits. Any structure exceeding the defined surfaces would require special approval from the Minister of Transport.

---

### **6. Reference to Zoning Plan**

The regulation is based on **Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730**, dated **June 16, 1989**, which provides the foundational design and layout of the airport and its surrounding zones. All spatial descriptions (runway dimensions, approach surfaces, outer surface elevation, transitional surfaces, and boundary radius) are derived from this plan.

---

### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Safety**: To ensure safe aircraft operations by preventing obstructions to flight paths.
2. **Visibility**: To maintain clear lines of sight for pilots during approach and departure.
3. **Consistency**: To provide a standardized, legally binding framework for land use around the airport.
4. **Public Participation**: To reflect public input through the mandatory publication process.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Any violation may result in penalties or orders to remove or modify structures.
- Compliance is required for all new construction, modifications, or expansions on regulated lands.

### **9. Summary Table of Key Parameters**

| Feature | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Airport Location | Coral Harbour, Northwest Territories |
| Airport Reference Point (ARP) | 762 m from threshold of runway 335T; 56 m above sea level |
| Runway Strip | 1,644 m long × 150 m wide (75 m on each side) |
| Approach Surface Slope | 1:40 (1 m rise per 40 m horizontal) |
| Approach Surface Height | 75 m above runway end elevation |
| Approach Surface Distance | 3,000 m from runway end; 525 m from centerline |
| Outer Surface Elevation | 45 m above ARP (i.e., 101 m above sea level); capped at 9 m above ground if lower |
| Transitional Surface Slope | 1:7 (1 m rise per 7 m horizontal) |
| Boundary Radius | 4,000 m from ARP (circular boundary) |

### **Conclusion**

The **Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based, and safety-oriented framework for land use around a remote Arctic airport. By defining precise geometric and elevation boundaries—through approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and an outer surface—the regulations protect critical flight corridors from physical obstructions. The process of public notice and comment ensures transparency and accountability, aligning with Canadian regulatory best practices in aviation safety and land use planning.

These regulations remain a critical tool for balancing aviation safety with community development in a remote, environmentally sensitive region like the Northwest Territories.
