### What Does "Repealed" Mean?
When a regulation is repealed:
- It is officially **removed from force** and **no longer applies**.
- It is **no longer enforceable** by government agencies.

Section 1 of this supplement specifically **revokes or cancels** certain prior regulations. While the exact regulation being repealed is not named in your input, the repeated citation suggests that the regulation in question was one of several affected by this repeal.

### Key Takeaway:
There is **no active or currently applicable regulation** under the cited reference. The regulation was **formally canceled** on April 19, 2017, by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. Therefore, it **does not currently exist** in Canadian regulatory law.
