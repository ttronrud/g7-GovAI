**Detailed Summary of the Award Regulations (S.C. 1995, c. 18, s. 73)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Award Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Veterans Affairs, under **section 91** of the *Pension Act*. These regulations govern the process for applicants seeking an award under the *Pension Act*, particularly in relation to claims involving pension benefits, such as those related to service, disability, or other veteran entitlements.

The regulations ensure transparency, fairness, and due process in the evaluation and review of applications for awards. They are designed to protect the rights of applicants and promote accountability in decisions made by the Minister of Veterans Affairs.

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### **1. Citation and Definitions**
- The regulations are officially cited as the **Award Regulations**.
- "**Act**" refers to the *Pension Act*, which provides the legal framework for veterans’ pensions and related benefits.

---

#### **2. Applicant Obligations**
An applicant seeking an award must provide the Minister with:
- **Documentation** necessary to support their claim (e.g., medical records, service records, employment history).
- **Information on domestic status** (e.g., marital status, cohabitation, dependents), which may affect eligibility for certain benefits.
- **Any other relevant information** that supports the claim.
- A ** sworn affidavit or statutory declaration** confirming the truthfulness of all information provided.

> *Note:* The provision regarding the requirement for an affidavit was previously repealed by SOR/99-231, section 2. This means that while the requirement to provide truthful information remains, the formal affidavit requirement is no longer mandated in current versions of the regulations.

---

#### **3. Reasons for Ministerial Decisions**
- Every decision made by the Minister regarding an award under the *Pension Act* must include **clear and detailed reasons** explaining why the decision was made.
- This ensures transparency and allows applicants to understand the basis of the outcome, which supports accountability and appeals processes.

---

#### **4. Review Requests Under Section 82 of the Act**
- If an applicant requests a **review of a prior decision** under section 82 of the *Pension Act*, they must submit **new evidence** that forms the basis of the appeal.
- This evidence must be directly relevant to the grounds for the review and must not simply reiterate previously submitted information.

> *Purpose:* Prevents frivolous or repetitive appeals and ensures that reviews are based on new, material information.

---

#### **5. Minister’s Actions After Review**
- If the Minister confirms, amends, or rescinds a decision following a review:
  - The applicant must be **notified in writing**.
  - The applicant must be provided with **clear reasons** for the Minister’s revised decision.

> *This ensures procedural fairness and allows applicants to understand how their case has changed.*

---

#### **6. Notice and Opportunity to Respond**
- Before confirming, amending, or rescinding a decision (under section 82), or before canceling and recovering any pension payment (under section 83):
  - The Minister must:
    1. **Inform the applicant or pensioner** of all facts and allegations known to the Minister.
    2. **Provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond** to those facts or allegations.

> *Purpose:* Ensures due process and protects applicants from decisions based on undisclosed or unchallenged information.

---

#### **7. Written Notification of Decisions**
- The Minister must send a **written notice** of any decision made under the *Pension Act* to the applicant.
- In the case of an **unfavourable decision**, the notice must include:
  - The applicant’s **right to request a review** of the decision under section 82 of the Act.
  - The applicant’s **right to appeal** the decision to the **Veterans Review and Appeal Board** under section 84 of the Act.
  - The applicant’s **right to be represented during the appeal**, either:
    - **Free of charge** by:
      - The **Bureau of Pensions Advocates**, or
      - A **service bureau of a veterans’ organization**.
    - Or, **at the applicant’s own expense**, by any other representative of their choice.

> *Significance:* This provision promotes access to justice and ensures that applicants, especially those who may be vulnerable or unfamiliar with administrative procedures, have meaningful support during appeals.
