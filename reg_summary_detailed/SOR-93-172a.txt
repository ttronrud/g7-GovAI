**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Department of External Affairs Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993"**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, officially titled the *Department of External Affairs Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993*, establishes a temporary exemption from the general provisions of the **Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** for certain temporary appointments within the **Department of External Affairs** (now known as Global Affairs Canada) during a specific time period.

The purpose of the regulation is to allow short-term, non-permanent employment of individuals in designated groups and categories—specifically those working for periods of less than three months, with a total of less than six months in any 12-month period—without being subject to the full scope of employment protections and requirements under the Public Service Employment Act.

---

### **Key Background and Justification**

1. **Exemption Determination**  
   The Public Service Commission (PSC) concluded that it would **not be practicable nor in the best interests of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to temporary employees in certain roles during the period from **April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**.

2. **Reason for Exemption**  
   The exemption is justified because:
   - The roles involved are **short-term and temporary**.
   - The total duration of employment for any individual across all assignments does not exceed **six months in any consecutive 12-month period**.
   - These positions are primarily in **support functions** and do not require long-term commitment or formal employment terms.

3. **Groups Affected**  
   The exemption applies specifically to the following employee groups within the Department of External Affairs:
   - **Clerical and Regulatory Group** (Administrative Support Category)
   - **Secretarial, Stenographic, Typing Group** (Administrative Support Category)
   - **Administrative Services Group** (Administrative and Foreign Service Category)
   - **Social Science Support Group** (Technical Category)

   These roles typically involve clerical, administrative, and technical support functions that are often filled on a project basis or for specific events.

4. **Time Period**  
   The exemption is **limited to the period from April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**. It does not extend beyond this date and is not intended as a permanent or general policy.

### **Legal Basis**

The regulation is enacted under two specific subsections of the **Public Service Employment Act**:

- **Subsection 41(1)**: Provides authority for the Public Service Commission to **exclude persons from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act** when it is not practicable or in the public interest.
- **Subsection 37(1)**: Grants the authority to the Governor in Council (on recommendation) to **make regulations** governing the employment of such persons in specified categories and timeframes.

The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendations of:
- The Secretary of State of Canada, and
- The Public Service Commission,

has approved both the **exclusion** and the **regulations** governing these temporary appointments.

### **Core Provisions of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Exclusion from Public Service Employment Act**
- All individuals appointed **on or after April 1, 1993**, for one or more specified periods of **less than three months each**, and with a **total of less than six months in any consecutive 12-month period**, are **excluded from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act**.
- This means these individuals are **not covered** by standard employment rights, conditions, protections, or procedures such as:
  - Fixed-term contracts
  - Job security provisions
  - Promotion or advancement rights
  - Collective bargaining rights
  - Statutory leave entitlements
  - Disciplinary or grievance procedures

> ⚠️ *Important Note:* This exclusion applies only to the specified roles and time frame. It does not apply to permanent or long-term appointments.

#### 2. **Regulations for Employment**
- The regulation establishes **specific rules** governing how such temporary appointments are to be made and managed during the 1993 period.
- These rules cover:
  - Eligibility criteria for appointment
  - Duration limits (e.g., no single assignment over 2 months; total under 6 months per 12 months)
  - Conditions of employment (e.g., no entitlement to benefits, no right to permanent status)
  - Reporting and record-keeping requirements
  - Oversight responsibilities of the Department of External Affairs

#### 3. **Definition of "Persons"**
- In this regulation, the term **"persons"** refers to individuals who are **not employed under the Public Service Employment Act**.
- This clarifies that the exemption applies only to temporary, non-permanent staff, not to permanent civil servants.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Rationale**

The PSC determined that applying the full Public Service Employment Act to short-term, project-based staff would:
- Be **operationally impractical** (e.g., excessive administrative burden, complex contract management)
- **Undermine efficiency** in a department that frequently requires flexible staffing for temporary tasks
- **Disrupt operational continuity** during a period of high demand or transitional work

Thus, the exemption supports **flexibility, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness** in managing temporary support roles.

---

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

- This regulation demonstrates how the Public Service Commission can **adapt federal employment rules** to meet practical needs in specific circumstances.
- It reflects a **temporary, targeted policy** rather than a broad reform.
- It sets a precedent for future temporary employment arrangements in public service departments, particularly in support and technical roles.
- It highlights the balance between **employee rights** and **government operational flexibility**.

---

### **Citation and Enforcement**

- The Order may be cited as:  
  **Department of External Affairs Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993**
- It is enforceable by the Department of External Affairs and subject to oversight by the Public Service Commission and the Secretary of State.
- Any violation of the specified terms (e.g., exceeding the 6-month limit or misclassifying an assignment) may result in administrative review or disciplinary action.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **temporary, narrowly tailored exemption** that allows the Department of External Affairs to hire temporary staff in specific support roles without being bound by the comprehensive employment protections of the Public Service Employment Act. It was approved due to practical and administrative necessity during a defined period in 1993 and serves as a model for managing short-term, flexible staffing in government departments.

While it removes certain employee protections, it also enables greater operational agility in responding to changing demands—particularly in administrative and technical support functions—without overburdening the public service system.

---

**Final Note**: This order is **not a general policy** and is **time-limited and role-specific**. It does not apply to permanent staff, other departments, or future periods beyond December 31, 1993. Any extension or similar exemption would require new legislative or regulatory action.
