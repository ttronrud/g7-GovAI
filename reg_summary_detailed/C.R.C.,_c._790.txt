**Detailed Summary of the *Settlers’ Effects Acquired with Blocked Currencies Remission Order***

---

### **Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled:  
**"Settlers’ Effects Acquired with Blocked Currencies Remission Order"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a specific legislative instrument under Canadian customs and excise law to provide relief from import duties for certain personal effects brought into Canada by individuals who emigrated from countries with capital transfer restrictions.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Duties**  
   Refers to all import duties as defined in **Section 2 of the Customs Act**, which includes:
   - Customs duties
   - Excise taxes
   - Other applicable charges related to the importation of goods

   Specifically, this Order addresses **duties imposed under Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which governs taxes on certain personal property imported into Canada.

2. **Goods**  
   Defined as **household and personal effects** imported by a settler for the settler’s personal use — not for business, manufacturing, or as contractor’s equipment.  
   This includes items like furniture, clothing, appliances, and other personal belongings.

3. **Settler**  
   A person who:
   - Enters Canada **with the intention of establishing a permanent residence** for a period of **at least 12 months**.
   - Is **not** included in this category if they enter Canada for any of the following reasons:
     - Employment for a period **not exceeding 36 months**
     - Studying at an educational institution
     - Performing **preclearance activities** on behalf of the U.S. Government under the **Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance** (signed March 16, 2015)

   → Thus, the Order applies only to individuals who are **new immigrants establishing long-term residence**, not temporary visitors or students.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., waive or forgive) import duties** on household and personal effects imported by a settler under specific conditions involving **capital transfer restrictions** in the settler’s country of origin.

---

### **Conditions for Duty Remission**

Duty remission is granted **only if both of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Origin of Emigration from a Country with Capital Restrictions**  
   The settler must have emigrated from a country that:
   - Applies **restrictions on the transfer of capital (such as money, funds, or assets)** from emigrants to Canada.
   - These restrictions are typically imposed to prevent capital flight or maintain economic stability.

   Examples might include countries where:
   - Emigrants are prohibited from sending funds directly to Canada
   - Funds held abroad are frozen or require special authorization to be transferred

2. **Goods Purchased with Funds on Deposit in the Country of Origin**  
   The goods must have been:
   - Purchased **by the settler or on the settler’s behalf**
   - Using **funds that were on deposit in the country of origin** at the time of emigration
   - These funds were **on the settler’s personal credit** (i.e., in the settler’s name or account)

   → The key point is that the purchase was financed by funds that were legally available to the settler at the time of leaving the country.

---

### **Conditions for the Remission to Be Effective**

The duty remission is **conditional** on the settler:

- **Retaining the goods for personal use for at least 12 months** after importation into Canada.

#### **What Happens If the Goods Are Sold or Disposed Of Within 12 Months?**

If the settler sells, disposes of, or otherwise transfers ownership of the goods **within 12 months** of importation, the following applies:

- **Duties become immediately due and payable**.
- The amount owed is the **lesser of two amounts**:
  1. The duties that **would have been payable** on importation **if this Order had not been in effect** (i.e., the original duty amount based on the goods’ value and classification)
  2. The duties payable on the **appraised value of the goods at the time of sale or disposal**

> This ensures that the settler cannot benefit from the remission and then profit from selling the goods without paying the full duty.

### **Key Implications and Objectives**

| Aspect | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Supports Immigration and Settlement** | Helps new immigrants who face financial barriers due to capital controls in their home countries by allowing them to bring personal effects without incurring heavy import duties. |
| **Protects Against Abuse** | The 12-month retention requirement prevents misuse of the remission by selling goods quickly for profit. |
| **Enforces Fairness** | The rule ensures that the remission is not used to avoid duties on goods that are later sold — maintaining fairness in the customs system. |
| **Targets Specific Circumstances** | Only applies to goods purchased with pre-existing funds in the country of origin, not to goods bought with funds from Canada or other sources. |

---

### **Legal and Practical Significance**

- This Order operates as a **customs relief measure** under the authority of the Government of Canada to promote equitable treatment of immigrants facing financial and administrative barriers.
- It reflects Canada’s recognition of **economic realities faced by emigrants** from countries with strict capital controls.
- It is a **non-refundable, time-bound benefit** — once the 12-month retention period expires or the goods are sold, the duty obligation resumes.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Settlers’ Effects Acquired with Blocked Currencies Remission Order* provides a targeted and conditional exemption from import duties for household and personal effects brought into Canada by new immigrants who:
- Emigrated from a country with capital transfer restrictions
- Purchased the goods with funds on deposit in that country at the time of emigration

The remission is **not automatic** and is **strictly conditional** on:
- The settler retaining the goods for at least 12 months
- No sale or disposal within that period, unless duties are immediately reinstated at the lesser of the original duty or the duty based on the appraised value at sale.

This regulation balances humanitarian support for immigrants with the need to maintain integrity and fairness in Canada’s customs and excise systems.

✅ **Bottom Line**:  
This Order helps new immigrants bring personal effects into Canada without paying import duties — but only if they keep those items for at least 12 months. If they sell them early, they must pay duties immediately, ensuring the benefit is not exploited.
