**Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2016-4 (January 13, 2016):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2016-4, which had previously established a specific ministerial designation or procedure related to the administration of the Public Service Employment Act.  
   - This repeal effectively removes the prior provisions that may have designated a different individual or body as the minister responsible for the purposes of section 23 of the Act.  
   - The repeal is significant because it eliminates outdated or superseded administrative arrangements, ensuring that the current legal framework reflects current ministerial responsibilities.

2. **Designation of the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada as the Minister for the Purposes of Section 23 of the Public Service Employment Act:**  
   The regulation designates the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** as the **minister** for the purposes of **Section 23** of the *Public Service Employment Act*.  
   - This designation is not a change in the ordinary ministerial structure of government, but a specific legal assignment under the Act to fulfill procedural and administrative functions related to public service employment matters.  
   - Section 23 of the Public Service Employment Act typically deals with the appointment of individuals to public service roles, including the authority to act in certain administrative capacities when a specific minister is required.  
   - By designating the President of the Privy Council, the regulation ensures continuity and clarity in the administrative responsibility for matters under section 23, even in the absence of a traditional ministerial appointment in that role.

3. **Legal and Practical Implications:**  
   - The President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada is a senior constitutional figure, traditionally serving as the head of the government’s executive council and often acting as a ceremonial or administrative representative of the Crown.  
   - This designation reflects a formal recognition of the President’s role in the governance of public service employment matters, particularly in times when a specific ministerial office may be vacant or when the responsibilities are exercised in a broader, cross-ministerial or constitutional capacity.  
   - It enhances legal certainty and ensures that the public service employment framework has a clear point of reference for administrative actions under section 23, even if no individual minister is formally assigned to that function.

4. **Effective Date and Scope:**  
   - The regulation is effective immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette.  
   - It applies to all matters governed by section 23 of the *Public Service Employment Act*, particularly those involving appointments, transfers, or administrative decisions within the public service.  
   - The designation is not a permanent or permanent office but a functional designation for specific legal purposes under the Act.

5. **Purpose and Rationale:**  
   - The repeal of P.C. 2016-4 was likely due to the obsolescence or incompatibility of the prior order with current governance structures or the need to simplify administrative procedures.  
   - The designation of the President of the Privy Council provides a stable, constitutionally recognized authority to act in the ministerial capacity under section 23, ensuring that public service employment matters are not stalled due to a lack of designated ministerial responsibility.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation streamlines and modernizes the administrative framework for public service employment by:  
- Removing an outdated order (P.C. 2016-4),  
- Designating a constitutionally recognized figure—the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada—as the minister for the purposes of section 23 of the *Public Service Employment Act*.  

This ensures legal clarity, continuity, and constitutional coherence in the management of public service appointments and employment processes, particularly in the absence of a specific ministerial assignment.
