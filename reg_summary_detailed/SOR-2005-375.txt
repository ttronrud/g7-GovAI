## **1. Scope and Applicability**

These regulations apply to **organizations listed in Schedule I or IV to the Financial Administration Act**.  
This means they govern probationary periods and termination notice periods for employees working in designated federal government departments and agencies that fall under these financial administration schedules.

## **2. Probationary Periods**

### **General Rule:**
The probationary period for a class of employees (as defined in column 1 of the schedule) is specified in **column 2** of the corresponding schedule item under the *Public Service Employment Act*, specifically in paragraph 61(1)(a).

### **Exclusions from the Probationary Period:**
The probationary period **does not include** the following periods:
- **Leave without pay** (any duration)
- **Full-time language training** (regardless of length)
- **Leave with pay exceeding 30 consecutive days**
- **Periods during which a seasonal employee is not required to perform duties** due to the seasonal nature of the work

> ⚠️ *Important:* These exclusions ensure that employees are not penalized for taking legitimate, temporary absences or undergoing mandatory training, and that seasonal workers are not unfairly subjected to probation for periods when they are not actively working.

### **Special Provision for Employees with Disabilities:**
For employees who are **disabled and require job accommodations**, the probationary period **begins on the day the necessary accommodation is implemented**.  
This recognizes the importance of accessibility and fairness in employment, ensuring that employees with disabilities are not disadvantaged in the early stages of employment due to the timing of accommodation implementation.

### **Apprenticeship and Professional Training Program Employees:**

## **4. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act, 2003** (S.C. 2003, c. 22) comes into force.

## **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clarity and Consistency** | Provides clear, standardized probation and notice periods across eligible organizations, reducing ambiguity in employment practices. |
| **Fairness and Equity** | Excludes legitimate absences (e.g., training, leave) and accounts for seasonal work, ensuring employees are not unfairly judged during probation. |
| **Support for Inclusion** | Recognizes the needs of employees with disabilities by aligning the start of probation with accommodation implementation. |
| **Gradual Transition to Full Employment** | The tiered notice period (2 weeks for less than 1 year, 1 month for longer) reflects the expectation that longer-serving employees are more established and thus entitled to greater notice. |
| **Alignment with Modernization Goals** | Supports the broader goals of the Public Service Modernization Act by promoting transparency, accountability, and employee stability. |

## **Conclusion**

These regulations establish a **clear, fair, and equitable framework** for probationary and termination notice periods in federal public service employment. By defining specific durations, excluding certain types of leave, and recognizing special circumstances (such as disability), the regulations promote **employee well-being, organizational fairness, and compliance with public service standards**. They also support the modernization and professionalization of federal employment practices.

> ✅ **Key Takeaway:**

Notice periods are based on tenure and training status, with longer service entitling employees to more notice. This regulation enhances both employee rights and administrative consistency in federal employment.
