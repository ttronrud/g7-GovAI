**Detailed Summary of the Marketing Authorization for Gluten-Free Oats and Foods Containing Gluten-Free Oats**

---

### **Regulatory Background**
This Marketing Authorization was issued by the **Minister of Health** on **May 15, 2015**, under **sections 30.2a and 30.3a of the Food and Drugs Act** (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 416; R.S., c. F-27). It provides specific exemptions from certain labeling and ingredient disclosure requirements for **oats and foods containing oats** that are certified as **gluten-free**, based on strict contamination and processing standards.

The authorization is designed to support the needs of individuals with **coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity**, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten (typically defined as less than 20 parts per million, or p.p.m.).

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Gluten**  
   - Defined broadly to include:
     - Any gluten protein derived from the grain of any of the following cereals:
       - Barley  
       - Oats  
       - Rye  
       - Triticale  
       - Wheat  
     - Or from a **hybridized strain** created from at least one of these cereals.  
   - Also includes **modified gluten proteins**, such as gluten protein fractions, derived from any of the above sources.  
   - This definition ensures that even genetically altered or hybridized forms of these grains are considered sources of gluten.

2. **p.p.m. (parts per million by weight)**  
   - A unit of measurement used to quantify the concentration of gluten in food.  
   - A food product is considered to contain "less than 20 p.p.m." of gluten if the gluten content is below this threshold.

### **Exemption Conditions (Section 2)**

A food that is **oats or contains oats** is **exempt from specific labeling requirements** under the **Food and Drug Regulations** if it meets **all of the following conditions**:

#### **1. Oats Must Be Specially Produced and Processed to Avoid Gluten Contamination**
The oats must be:
- **Specially produced and processed** in a manner designed to:
  - **Avoid contamination** by gluten from barley, rye, triticale, wheat, or any hybridized strain derived from one of these cereals.
- OR
- **Specially processed** in a manner designed to **limit or reduce** the amount of gluten from those sources.

> In both cases, the final product must **not contain more than 20 p.p.m.** of gluten from those cereals or hybridized strains.

#### **2. The Food Must Contain Only Gluten-Free Oats**
- The food may contain **no oats other than those that meet the above gluten-free criteria**.
- Any oats used must be compliant with the defined processing and contamination standards.

#### **3. The Food Must Not Contain Excess Gluten**
- The food must **not contain more than 20 p.p.m. of gluten** from:
  - Barley, rye, triticale, wheat, or any hybridized strain derived from one of those cereals.
- It must also **not contain any added gluten** from these sources.

#### **4. Labeling Must Clearly State Gluten-Free Status**
- All representations about oats on the **label** and in **advertisements** must:
  - Clearly indicate that the oats are **gluten-free**.
  - Avoid ambiguous or misleading claims.

### **Exemptions from Specific Regulatory Requirements**

Foods that meet the above conditions are exempt from two key provisions of the **Food and Drug Regulations**:

#### **Exemption from Section B.01.010.1 and Subparagraph B.01.010.3(1)(b)(ii)**  
- This provision normally requires food manufacturers to **disclose the source of gluten** in the product.
- This exemption means that **no source of gluten from oats** needs to be listed or disclosed on the label for such foods.
- This simplifies labeling for consumers who are sensitive to gluten and ensures that the only gluten present is from a source that is already controlled and below the 20 p.p.m. threshold.

#### **Exemption from Subsection B.01.010(2)**  
- This provision normally requires that **oats be listed by name** in the ingredient list (e.g., "oats" or "oat flour").
- This exemption allows foods containing only gluten-free oats to **not be required to list oats by name** in the ingredient list.
- This removes unnecessary labeling complexity while still ensuring consumer awareness of the product’s composition.

---

### **Effective Date**
- This Marketing Authorization **comes into force on the day it is registered** with Health Canada.
- As of May 15, 2015, it became legally enforceable for all relevant food products.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

This regulation:
- Recognizes the **special processing capabilities** of certain oat producers to produce gluten-free oats.
- Provides **clarity and consistency** in labeling for products that are safe for people with coeliac disease.
- Balances **consumer protection** with **industry practicality** by allowing simplified labeling when strict gluten controls are in place.
- Supports the **availability and accessibility** of gluten-free products, particularly those containing oats, which are naturally more difficult to process without cross-contamination.

### **Implications for Industry and Consumers**

| Stakeholder | Key Implication |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Food Manufacturers** | Can produce and market oat-based products without needing to disclose the source of gluten from oats, provided the oats meet the 20 p.p.m. standard and are processed to avoid contamination. |
| **Retailers and Distributors** | Can label such products as "gluten-free" with confidence, knowing the regulatory exemption applies. |
| **Consumers (especially with coeliac disease)** | Can safely consume oat-containing foods that are clearly labeled as gluten-free, knowing that the product contains less than 20 p.p.m. gluten. |
| **Regulatory Authorities** | Can enforce compliance with the 20 p.p.m. standard and require proof of processing controls and testing. |

### **Conclusion**

This Marketing Authorization is a targeted and scientifically grounded regulatory measure that enables the safe and accessible market entry of **gluten-free oat-based foods**. By setting a clear standard of **less than 20 p.p.m. gluten** and requiring **specific processing controls**, it ensures that products labeled as gluten-free are genuinely safe for individuals with gluten sensitivities. At the same time, it simplifies labeling requirements, reducing consumer confusion and burden while maintaining rigorous safety standards.

It reflects Health Canada’s commitment to **protecting public health** and supporting **innovation in food safety**, particularly in the growing gluten-free market.
