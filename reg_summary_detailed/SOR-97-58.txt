The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2012-18, s. 3]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Regulation SOR/2012-18, section 3**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed**. This means it is no longer in force and has been formally removed from the legal framework.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2012-18, section 3**, which is a statutory rule published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (SOR) on January 18, 2012.
- **Purpose of the Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because the original regulation was outdated, redundant, superseded by newer legislation, or no longer applicable to current legal or administrative needs.
- **Legal Implication**: Any reference to this regulation in legal documents, policies, or operations is now considered invalid. Entities or individuals relying on it would need to consult current, active regulations for compliance or guidance.
- **No Content Provided**: Since the regulation itself is not included in your query, and only the repealing notice is provided, there is no detailed text or provisions to summarize (such as definitions, requirements, penalties, or scope).

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced is **no longer valid** and has been **officially removed** by SOR/2012-18, section 3. As such, it does not currently exist in force and should not be used as a source of legal authority. For accurate and up-to-date information, one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulation, possibly through the Government of Canada’s official publications or legislation database (e.g., [canada.ca/laws](https://www.canada.ca/en/legislation.html)).

If you have the original regulation’s title or subject matter (e.g., related to licensing, environmental standards, or workplace safety), I can help identify which legislation replaced it or provide further context.
