**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** and the **Treasury Board**, establishes a legal framework for the **Minister of Transport** to enter into agreements related to the provision of **electronic maintenance services** in specific circumstances. It is grounded in two key statutes:

1. **Section 3 of the Aeronautics Act** – Authorizes the Minister of Transport to enter into agreements with private companies and external parties for electronic maintenance services.
2. **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act** – Grants the Minister the power to prescribe fees or charges for services provided under these agreements, subject to certain conditions.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objectives are:

- To enable the **Department of Transport** to provide or support **electronic maintenance services** in two distinct contexts:
  1. **At or near Department of Transport facilities** – Involves agreements with **private transportation companies** whose facilities are adjacent or in close proximity to government infrastructure.
  2. **In remote areas of Canada** – Where the Department of Transport is the **only source of telecommunications and electronic maintenance expertise**, and no other qualified private providers are available.

This ensures continuity of critical maintenance operations, especially in geographically isolated regions where access to specialized technical support is limited.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Authorization to Enter Agreements**
The Minister of Transport is authorized to:
- Enter into **agreements with private companies** (transportation firms) operating near or at Department of Transport facilities for the provision of **electronic maintenance services**.
- Enter into **agreements with parties outside the Government of Canada** in **remote areas** of Canada where the Department is the sole provider of such expertise.

These agreements are intended to ensure that essential electronic systems (e.g., aircraft avionics, telecommunications infrastructure) remain operational and maintained safely and efficiently.

#### 2. **Prescription of Fees and Charges**
Under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, the Minister has the authority to **prescribe fees or charges** for services provided under the agreements, **subject to the terms and conditions** outlined in the attached schedule.

The fees are not fixed but are to be **determined and adjusted periodically** based on specific cost components and administrative rates.

### **Fee Structure (as Determined by the Minister)**

The fees and charges are structured as follows:

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Labour Rate** | Set at the **appropriate salary rate** established in the **effective collective agreement** between the **Treasury Board** and the **International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (I.B.E.W.) Local 2228**. This ensures alignment with industry standards and labor agreements. |
| **Effective Fringe Benefits, Isolated Post, and Cost of Living Allowances** | These are applied to the base salary rate to reflect the full compensation package, including benefits such as health insurance, retirement contributions, and allowances for remote or isolated work locations (e.g., cost of living in northern or rural areas). |
| **Vehicle Operation Costs** | Charged at the **effective rate per mile**, as set by the Minister of Transport through a prior Order in Council. This covers fuel, maintenance, and vehicle-related expenses. |
| **Parts Supply** | Parts will be supplied at **cost plus shipping** — meaning the supplier is reimbursed for the actual cost of parts plus reasonable shipping expenses. This ensures cost transparency and prevents profit margins. |
| **Overhead Rate** | All fees and charges described above are subject to an **effective Overhead Rate**, also established by the Minister via Order in Council. This covers administrative, supervisory, and general operating expenses associated with delivering the services. |

> **Note**: The Overhead Rate is a critical component, ensuring that the Department can cover operational costs without overburdening service providers or underfunding its own operations.

### **Obligations and Review Requirements**

- **Annual Review Requirement**:  
  Every agreement entered into under this Order must be **reviewed by the Minister of Transport one year after its execution**, and **annually thereafter on the anniversary date**. This ensures ongoing assessment of the agreement’s effectiveness, cost efficiency, and relevance to current operational needs.

- **Flexibility Clause**:  
  Each agreement must include a **provision allowing the Minister to revise fees or charges at any time** by issuing a new Order in Council. This ensures that the fees remain aligned with:
  - Inflation
  - Changes in labor or operational costs
  - Market conditions
  - Technological developments

This flexibility is essential for maintaining fiscal responsibility and service quality over time.

---

### **Governance and Accountability**

- The regulation is issued as an **Order in Council**, which means it is a formal, legally binding instrument approved by the Governor General on the advice of the federal Cabinet (specifically the Minister of Transport and Treasury Board).
- The fees are not arbitrary; they are based on **transparent, standardized, and publicly accessible benchmarks** (e.g., I.B.E.W. wage rates, per-mile rates, cost-plus pricing).
- The use of **collective bargaining agreements** (e.g., I.B.E.W. Local 2228) ensures fair labor practices and alignment with union-recognized standards.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Operational Continuity**: Ensures that electronic systems in both urban and remote locations remain functional and safe, particularly in aviation and transportation infrastructure.
- **Cost Control**: Provides a structured, transparent, and accountable pricing model based on real-world operating costs.
- **Fairness and Equity**: Uses established labor standards and cost-based pricing to ensure fairness between government and private parties.
- **Scalability and Adaptability**: The annual review and fee adjustment provisions allow the system to adapt to changing economic and technological conditions.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **clear, lawful, and flexible mechanism** for the Department of Transport to access electronic maintenance services in key operational environments — both near government facilities and in remote, underserved regions. By basing fees on industry-recognized labor standards, cost-plus principles, and an effective overhead rate, and by mandating regular review and adjustment, the regulation ensures that services remain **cost-effective, equitable, and sustainable** over the long term.

It balances the need for **technical expertise**, **financial accountability**, and **operational resilience**, particularly in areas where government infrastructure is the sole provider of critical technical support.
