## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Respecting Concentrations of Lead and Phosphorus in Gasoline**

### 📌 **Regulatory Context and Background**

- **Legal Authority**:  
  These regulations were enacted under **section 47 and subsection 87(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)*, 1999.  
  The original *Lead-Free Gasoline Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 408) and *Leaded Gasoline Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 409) were **revoked** and replaced by these new regulations on July 15, 1989.

- **Policy Rationale**:  
  The Governor in Council determined that **exceeding the prescribed concentrations of lead and phosphorus in gasoline** would result in a **significant contribution to air pollution** when burned in engines under ordinary use. This finding was based on environmental and public health concerns related to toxic emissions.

- **Objective**:  
  To **limit the levels of lead and phosphorus** in gasoline sold, produced, or imported into Canada, thereby reducing harmful emissions and protecting human health and the environment.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-110, section 7**, which means it is **no longer in force** as of the date of that order. However, this summary provides a historical and analytical overview of what the regulation originally entailed.

## 📚 **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

### 1. **Maximum Allowed Concentrations**

| Substance | Maximum Concentration |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Lead** | **5 mg/L** (milligrams of lead per litre of gasoline) |
| **Phosphorus** | **1.3 mg/L** |

- These limits apply to **gasoline produced, imported, or sold in Canada**.
- The standards are strictly enforced to prevent environmental and health risks from lead and phosphorus emissions during combustion.

---

### 2. **Measurement Methods**

To ensure accuracy and consistency in compliance:

- **Lead concentration** must be measured using the **National Standard of Canada (CAN/CGSB-3.0 No. 19.5-2011)**:
  - Method: Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy
  - Purpose: Accurately determines lead content in automotive gasoline.

- **Phosphorus concentration** must be measured using the **ASTM International standard (ASTM D3231-13)**:
  - Standard Test Method for Phosphorus in Gasoline
  - Purpose: Ensures reliable and standardized detection of phosphorus levels.

> These methods are subject to periodic amendments and must be applied as updated.

### 3. **Scope and Exclusions**

#### ✅ Applies To:
- Gasoline used in **automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles** operating on highways.
- Gasoline **produced, imported, or sold** in Canada.

#### ❌ Does NOT Apply To:
- **Gasoline for aircraft use** – excluded entirely.
- **Gasoline used in competition vehicles** – with specific exceptions:
  - The regulations **do not apply** to gasoline used in **competition vehicles or boats**.
  - However, **special record-keeping requirements** apply to leaded gasoline used in such vehicles (see below).

> 🔍 *Definition: "Competition vehicle" = a vehicle or boat used exclusively for competition (e.g., racing), excluding those used on highways or for recreational purposes.*

---

### 4. **Recordkeeping Requirements (Applicable to Leaded Gasoline in Competition Vehicles)**

This section applies **only** to **leaded gasoline sold or used in competition vehicles**.

#### Required Records Must Include:
1. **Brand name** of the gasoline.
2. **Octane rating** and the **test method** used to determine it.
3. **Average lead concentration** (in mg/L) on an annual basis.
4. **Name and address** of:
   - The **distributor or reseller**, if the gasoline was sold for resale or distribution; **or**
   - The **track or event location** where the gasoline was used, if sold at a specific event or venue.
5. **Total quantity** of leaded gasoline sold to:
   - Specific entities (e.g., race teams, suppliers), or
   - Specific locations (e.g., racetracks, events).

#### Submission and Retention:
- Records must be submitted **annually** to the Minister of the Environment **on or before March 31** of the year following the year in which the gasoline was produced, sold, or imported.
- Records must be **retained in Canada for five years** from the date they are created.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This recordkeeping requirement was **repealed by SOR/2017-110, section 9**, meaning it is no longer enforceable.

---

### 5. **Electronic vs. Paper Submission**

- **Preferred method**: Submission must be **electronic**, in a **form and format specified by the Minister**.
- The record must bear the **electronic signature** of an authorized official.

- **Exception**: If:
  - The Minister has not specified an electronic format, **or**
  - It is **impractical** to submit electronically due to circumstances beyond the sender’s control (e.g., technical failure, lack of access),
  then the record may be submitted **on paper**, signed by an authorized official.

- **If no format is specified**, the paper record may be in any acceptable form.

---

### 6. **Definition of "Authorized Official"**

An authorized official is defined as:
- For a **corporation**: an officer authorized to act on its behalf.
- For **any other person or entity**: the person themselves, or someone authorized to act on their behalf.

> This ensures accountability and legal responsibility for compliance.

## 🚨 Key Environmental and Public Health Rationale

- **Lead** is a **neurotoxin** that can cause irreversible damage to the brain and nervous system, especially in children. It also contributes to cardiovascular disease and developmental delays.
- **Phosphorus** in gasoline can contribute to **engine wear** and **emissions of particulate matter** and other pollutants when burned.
- By setting strict limits, the regulation aims to:
  - Reduce air pollution.
  - Improve public health outcomes.
  - Protect ecosystems from contamination.

## 📅 Historical Timeline and Current Status

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **July 15, 1989** | Regulations published in *Canada Gazette, Part I* |
| **2008** | Section 4 (lead) and Section 5 (phosphorus) were **repealed** by SOR/2008-126 |
| **2017** | Entire regulation **fully repealed** by **SOR/2017-110, section 7** |

> ✅ **Conclusion**:  
> These regulations are **no longer in effect**. The Canadian government has moved beyond leaded gasoline in regular consumer fuel and has fully transitioned to **unleaded gasoline** as of the early 2000s. The repeal reflects broader environmental policy shifts and the success of previous lead reduction efforts.

## 🏁 Summary in One Paragraph

The regulation, originally issued in 1989 under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, established strict limits on lead (5 mg/L) and phosphorus (1.3 mg/L) in gasoline sold in Canada. It mandated compliance through standardized testing methods (CAN/CGSB-3.0 and ASTM D3231-13) and required recordkeeping for leaded gasoline used in competition vehicles. However, due to evolving environmental policies and the widespread phase-out of leaded gasoline, the regulation was **repealed in 2017** (SOR/2017-110, s. 7), and its provisions are no longer enforceable. The regulation marked a critical step in Canada’s effort to reduce toxic emissions and protect public health, but its legacy is now part of a broader history of environmental regulation.

## 📚 Additional Notes

- **Repeal of Related Terms**:
  - "Primary supplier", "race-sanctioning body", "unleaded gasoline", and "import" were either repealed or redefined, indicating that the regulatory framework evolved over time.
- **Modern Context**: Today, Canada has fully transitioned to **unleaded gasoline** for all consumer vehicles. The only remaining use of leaded gasoline is in niche, regulated applications (e.g., some specialty engines or historical preservation), which are not covered under this regulation.

## 🔚 Final Assessment

This regulation represents a **historically significant environmental policy** aimed at reducing lead and phosphorus emissions. While it is now **repealed**, it played a vital role in Canada’s environmental protection strategy during the late 20th century. Its provisions reflect a strong commitment to public health and environmental stewardship, and its legacy continues in current fuel standards and emission control policies.
