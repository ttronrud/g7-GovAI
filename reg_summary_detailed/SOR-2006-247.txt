The statement "[Repealed by operation of law, 2011, c. 25, s. 39]" indicates that a particular regulation or statute was officially abolished or canceled by legal action, without the need for a formal legislative act or repeal bill. Here is a detailed breakdown and summary of what this means:

1. **Repealed by Operation of Law**:  
   This phrase means that the regulation or statute was automatically invalidated or removed from legal effect due to a legal principle or mechanism—such as a change in the legal framework, a constitutional provision, or a judicial ruling—rather than through a deliberate decision by a legislature or parliament. In other words, the repeal was not the result of a passed law, but rather a consequence of legal or statutory evolution.

2. **Year: 2011**:  
   The repeal occurred in the year 2011, indicating the timeframe during which the legal change took effect.

3. **Chapter 25, Section 39 (c. 25, s. 39)**:  
   This refers to a specific section within a legislative act or statute titled "Chapter 25" of the laws passed in 2011. In Canadian legal terminology, "c. 25" typically refers to a bill or act numbered 25 in the current legislative session (e.g., an Act of Parliament or provincial legislature). Section 39 of that act contains the provision that formally repeals the referenced regulation or statute.

4. **Legal Effect**:  
   Once a regulation is repealed by operation of law, it is no longer enforceable, legally binding, or applicable. Any actions or decisions based on the repealed regulation are no longer valid under current law. The repeal effectively removes the regulation from the legal framework, and any references to it in other statutes or administrative rules must be updated accordingly.

5. **Context and Implications**:  
   - The repeal may have been prompted by changes in policy, administrative efficiency, redundancy, or a broader legal reform.  
   - It may reflect a consolidation of laws, where overlapping or outdated provisions are removed to simplify the legal system.  
   - It may also be the result of a constitutional or statutory amendment that renders certain provisions obsolete or inconsistent with current legal standards.

6. **Importance for Legal and Administrative Use**:  
   Legal professionals, government agencies, and courts must be aware of such repeals when interpreting or applying laws. Relying on a repealed regulation could lead to legal errors or invalid decisions.

7. **No Further Reference**:  
   Since the regulation has been repealed, it is no longer cited in current legal databases, administrative guidelines, or judicial decisions. Its content is effectively removed from the active legal record.

**Conclusion**:  
The statement "[Repealed by operation of law, 2011, c. 25, s. 39]" means that a specific regulation was legally abolished in 2011 through a provision in Chapter 25, Section 39 of a legislative act. The repeal was not initiated by a separate legislative act but by legal necessity or mechanism, rendering the regulation inoperative and no longer enforceable. This change reflects a legal evolution and must be considered when reviewing current laws or administrative practices. Any prior reliance on the regulation is now invalid.
