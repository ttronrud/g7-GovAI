### **Purpose and Context of the Proclamation**

This proclamation serves as the official government notice under Canadian law that the **Canada-United Kingdom Civil and Commercial Judgments Convention** (commonly referred to as the "Judgments Convention") comes into force on **January 1, 1987**.

The Convention establishes a framework for the **reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments** between Canada and the United Kingdom. This means that:

- A civil or commercial judgment rendered in Canada can be recognized and enforced in the United Kingdom, provided it meets certain legal and procedural criteria.
- Similarly, a judgment issued in the United Kingdom can be recognized and enforced in Canada under the same conditions.

This reciprocal arrangement aims to:
- Promote legal certainty and efficiency in cross-border disputes.
- Reduce the need for costly and time-consuming litigation in foreign jurisdictions.
- Facilitate international trade and commerce by enabling parties to enforce judgments without having to go through lengthy domestic legal processes.

### **Key Provisions and Implications of the Convention (as established by the Proclamation)**

1. **Effective Date:**  
   The Convention officially enters into force on **January 1, 1987**, as declared in this Proclamation. This date marks the beginning of the legal mechanism for mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments between Canada and the UK.

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   The Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet of Canada) is empowered under Section 5 of the *Canada-United Kingdom Civil and Commercial Judgments Convention Act, 1984* to issue a proclamation announcing the entry into force of the Convention.

   - Be final and not subject to appeal.
   - Have been rendered by a court with competent jurisdiction.
   - Not be contrary to public policy or fundamental principles of justice in either country.
   - Be enforceable under the domestic laws of the receiving country.
