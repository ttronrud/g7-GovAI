### **Detailed Summary of the Esquimalt Graving Dock Regulations (2018 Version – Replacing the 1984 Regulations)**

This regulation, issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Works and the Treasury Board**, serves to **revoke the outdated Esquimalt Graving Dock Regulations, 1984 (P.C. 1984-2169)** and replace them with updated, more comprehensive, and safety-focused rules governing the **management, operation, and use of the Esquimalt Graving Dock in British Columbia**.

The new regulations were enacted under **sections 24, 28, and 29 of the Public Works Act**, and are designed to ensure **safety, efficiency, environmental protection, financial accountability, and proper use** of the government-owned dry dock facility. The regulations have since been **repealed in full in 2009 (SOR/2009-324, s. 2)**, indicating that they are **no longer in force** as of that date — which raises a critical point of clarification below.
