**Detailed Summary of the Restraint Systems and Booster Seats for Motor Vehicles Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *Restraint Systems and Booster Seats for Motor Vehicles Regulations* are issued under the authority of the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* (CCPSA), specifically pursuant to **Section 37** of that Act. This section empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health) to make regulations that establish safety standards for consumer products, including motor vehicle restraint systems and booster seats.

**Regulatory Purpose:**

The primary objective of these regulations is to ensure the safety of children and other occupants in motor vehicles by establishing minimum performance and safety requirements for restraint systems and booster seats. These standards aim to reduce the risk of injury or death in the event of a vehicle crash by ensuring that all such products meet rigorous safety benchmarks.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Applicability of the Regulations:**
   - The regulations apply to **restraint systems and booster seats for motor vehicles** as described in **Column 1** of the accompanying table (which is not included in the provided text but would typically list specific types of products such as rear-facing infant seats, forward-facing child seats, booster seats, etc.).
   - Each product type must comply with the specific safety requirements outlined in the corresponding **part of the *Motor Vehicle Restraint Systems and Booster Seats Safety Regulations***, as referenced in **Column 2** of the table.

2. **Safety Requirements:**
   - The specific safety standards (e.g., crash testing, strength requirements, installation procedures, material standards, and performance criteria) are detailed in the relevant parts of the *Motor Vehicle Restraint Systems and Booster Seats Safety Regulations*. These parts typically cover:
     - Seat belt performance (e.g., strength, load distribution, anchoring)
     - Booster seat design and structural integrity
     - Child restraint system compatibility with vehicle seating
     - Protection against ejection, side impact, and frontal collisions
     - Proper positioning and fit for different age and size groups
     - Labeling and instructions for safe use

3. **Compliance and Enforcement:**
   - Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of these products are required to ensure that all products sold in Canada meet the specified safety standards.
   - The regulations establish a framework for product certification and compliance, which may involve third-party testing and certification processes overseen by the Canadian Consumer Product Safety Agency (CPSCA).

4. **Repeal Clause:**
   - The text includes a note stating "[Repeal]" — this indicates that the regulations being described may be superseded or replaced by a newer version. However, the current version referenced (S.C. 2010, c. 21) is a historical or transitional document. It is important to note that while this regulation was originally enacted in 2010, it may have been amended or replaced by more recent legislation to reflect updated safety science and technological developments.

5. **Coming into Force:**
   - These regulations come into force on the **day of registration** with the Canada Gazette. This means they become legally enforceable immediately upon publication, ensuring timely implementation of safety standards for consumer products.

**Legal Context and Significance:**

- These regulations are part of a broader Canadian effort to protect public health and safety by regulating the design, manufacture, and distribution of consumer products that pose potential risks during vehicle use.
- They align with international safety standards (such as those from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe or the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and reflect best practices in child safety and crashworthiness.

**Conclusion:**

The *Restraint Systems and Booster Seats for Motor Vehicles Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish mandatory safety requirements for child restraint systems and booster seats sold in Canada. By linking specific product types to corresponding safety standards, the regulations ensure that all such products are designed and tested to protect occupants in the event of a crash. While the regulation was enacted in 2010 and may have been superseded or updated, its foundational principles remain relevant in the ongoing effort to promote vehicle occupant safety, particularly for children.

**Note:** For current compliance, stakeholders should consult the most up-to-date version of the *Motor Vehicle Restraint Systems and Booster Seats Safety Regulations* as published by Health Canada and the Canadian Consumer Product Safety Agency (CPSCA).
