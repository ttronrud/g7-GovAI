**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation is a formal transfer of certain powers, duties, and functions between two federal Canadian ministers—specifically, from the **Minister of Employment and Immigration** to the **Minister of Labour**—under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

This transfer was initiated through an **Order in Council** (P.C. 1993-1488), issued on **June 25, 1993**, which originally transferred all powers, duties, and functions of the **Minister of Labour** under any Act of Parliament to the **Minister of Employment and Immigration**. This reorganization was part of broader public service restructuring aimed at streamlining responsibilities and improving administrative efficiency.

Now, in a subsequent action, the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**, is **reversing** this transfer by returning specific powers, duties, and functions to the **Minister of Labour**.

### **Scope of the Transfer**

The Governor General in Council hereby transfers the following **specific legislative authorities and responsibilities** from the **Minister of Employment and Immigration** back to the **Minister of Labour**:

1. **Canada Labour Code**  
   – All powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Employment and Immigration under this comprehensive labor law, which governs workplace standards, employment rights, safety, and conditions across Canada.

2. **Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety Act**  
   – Authority over occupational health and safety standards, including the operation, funding, and oversight of the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), which provides guidance and support to employers and workers on health and safety practices.

3. **Section 16 of the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act**  
   – Responsibility for collecting and managing returns related to labor union activities and corporate labor practices, including reporting requirements for union membership and financial disclosures.

4. **Department of Labour Act**  
   – *Except for sections 2 and 5*  
   – All other provisions of this Act are transferred. The Department of Labour Act historically dealt with labor standards, worker protections, and the administration of labor-related programs. The exclusion of sections 2 and 5 indicates that certain foundational or procedural provisions (likely related to definition of "department" or administrative authority) remain with the Minister of Employment and Immigration.

5. **Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act**  
   – Authority to regulate wage and hour standards, including minimum wage, working hours, and overtime provisions, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, construction, and service industries.

6. **Government Employees Compensation Act**  
   – Powers to administer compensation schemes for government employees who suffer work-related injuries or illnesses.

7. **Paragraphs 28(2)(d) and 43(2)(a) of the Hazardous Materials Information Review Act**  
   – Authority to regulate the handling, disclosure, and reporting of hazardous materials information, particularly in relation to worker safety and exposure. These specific provisions relate to the obligation of employers to provide information on hazardous substances to employees.

8. **An Act respecting the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited (Chapter 62 of the Statutes of Canada, 1947)**  
   – Powers related to labor and employment matters specific to this historically significant mining company. This includes oversight of labor relations, working conditions, and dispute resolution within the company.

9. **Merchant Seamen Compensation Act**  
   – Authority over compensation and benefits for seafarers injured or disabled as a result of work, including claims processing and administrative oversight.

10. **Section 9 of the Non-smokers’ Health Act**  
   – Responsibility for enforcing regulations related to smoking in workplaces, including the requirement for employers to implement smoking bans and provide information to employees about health risks.

11. **Part II of the Status of the Artist Act**  
   – Powers related to the protection of artists’ rights, including employment conditions, working hours, and benefits for artists employed in the public or private sector.

12. **Wages Liability Act**  
   – Authority to determine and enforce liability for unpaid wages, including the power to investigate wage arrears and impose penalties on employers who fail to pay.

13. **West Coast Ports Operations Act, 1994**  
   – Powers to oversee labor relations, working conditions, and dispute resolution in the port and maritime operations sector on the West Coast of Canada.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

This transfer reflects a **strategic realignment** of federal labor responsibilities. The reassignment of these functions to the **Minister of Labour** is intended to:

- Strengthen the Minister of Labour’s role in **labor policy, workplace standards, and worker protection**.
- Improve **policy coherence and administrative oversight** by consolidating labor-related responsibilities under a single ministerial portfolio.
- Enhance **accountability and responsiveness** in areas such as occupational health and safety, wage standards, and employee compensation.
- Address the **distinct nature** of the transferred statutes—many of which are directly related to labor standards, worker safety, and employment rights—making them more appropriately managed under a labor-focused ministry.

---

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- The transfer is **formal and binding**, issued under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which allows for the reassignment of ministerial responsibilities between departments.
- The transfer is **not retroactive**; it applies to all matters arising after the date of the Order in Council.
- The transfer does **not affect** the Minister of Employment and Immigration’s responsibilities in areas such as immigration, refugee status, and employment equity, which remain within their jurisdiction.
- The exclusion of specific sections (e.g., sections 2 and 5 of the Department of Labour Act) indicates a **deliberate limitation** to preserve certain administrative or procedural functions.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant **restructuring of federal labor governance** in Canada. By returning key labor-related powers and functions to the **Minister of Labour**, the government reaffirms the central role of labor policy in shaping workplace conditions, protecting workers’ rights, and ensuring fair and safe working environments. The transfer strengthens the Minister of Labour’s mandate and aligns the administrative structure with the practical needs of labor law enforcement and workplace regulation.
