The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-124, section 19**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or revoked).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-124**, which is a **Supplemental Order of Regulations** issued in **2016**.
- **Repealing Provision**: Section 19 of that order specifically identifies the regulation being repealed.
- **Implication**: Since the regulation is no longer in force, it is **no longer applicable** or enforceable under current law. Any legal or administrative obligations previously derived from it have been removed.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed to:
  - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions.
  - Simplify the regulatory framework.
  - Align with updated legislation or policy goals.
  - Correct errors or inconsistencies.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest that the regulation was referenced multiple times in a document or list, likely due to formatting or indexing issues.
- The absence of the actual text of the regulation means that **no substantive content** (such as definitions, requirements, penalties, or scope) can be summarized.
- Without knowing the original name or subject matter of the regulation (e.g., related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or financial services), it is not possible to determine its former function or impact.

### Conclusion:
The provided information indicates that **a specific regulation has been formally repealed by section 19 of SOR/2016-124**. However, **no detailed content or context of the original regulation is available**, and thus, a detailed summary of its provisions, scope, or purpose cannot be provided. The only factual summary is that it is **no longer in effect** due to repeal.

To obtain a meaningful summary of the regulation’s former content, access to the original regulation (prior to repeal) would be required—this is not available in the current input.
