The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2007-86, s. 205]"

This indicates that a specific provision of a regulatory instrument (likely a statute or regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 205 of the Statutory Rules of 2007**, published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (SOR/2007-86).

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Status**: The regulation or section in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2007-86**, which is a statutory instrument (a type of regulation or order made under authority of an act of Parliament) issued in 2007.
- **Section Number**: The specific section repealed is **Section 205** of that instrument.
- **Nature of the Provision**: While the original content of the section is not provided, the repetition of the same repeal notice suggests that multiple provisions or subsections were affected by the repeal. However, without the original text of the regulation, the exact content, purpose, or scope of the repealed section(s) cannot be determined.
- **Legal Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, rules, or requirements previously established by Section 205 of SOR/2007-86 are now **void and no longer applicable**. Entities or individuals relying on that section would need to refer to current, active regulations or legislation.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not contain the actual regulation** being repealed — only a repeated notice of its repeal. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself is **not possible** due to the absence of its original text. The only factual information available is that:

> A section (Section 205) of the regulation published in SOR/2007-86 has been officially repealed by the same instrument, meaning it is no longer valid or enforceable under Canadian law.

To obtain the original content or purpose of the repealed section, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2007-86, specifically Section 205, which is now obsolete and removed from the current legal framework.

**Recommendation**: For accurate historical or legal analysis, consult the *Canada Gazette*, Part I, or the official legislative database such as [canada.gazette.gc.ca](https://www.canada.gazette.gc.ca) or the [Parliament of Canada's legislative database](https://www.acts.parl.gc.ca).
