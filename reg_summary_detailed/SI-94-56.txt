**1. Authority and Legal Basis:**

- The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, which is the formal mechanism by which federal government decisions are made on the advice of the Cabinet and the relevant ministers.
- The authority is derived specifically from **paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision grants the Minister of Finance (or, in this case, the Minister of Transport, as delegated) the power to "prescribe charges" for certain services when such charges are necessary to cover the costs of providing those services.
- The key point is that the power to set charges is not absolute but is exercised **on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board**, ensuring a balance between fiscal responsibility and operational needs.

**2. Scope of the Regulation:**

- The regulation authorizes the **Minister of Transport** to issue **orders (regulations)** that establish **specific charges** for the use of **ship/shore communications services** provided by **Coast Guard Radio Stations**.
- These services typically involve:
  - Radio communication between ships and coastal stations (e.g., for safety, navigation, distress alerts, and maritime coordination).
  - Services that support maritime safety, security, and environmental protection.
- The charges apply to **users of these services**, which may include:
  - Commercial shipping companies
  - Government vessels
  - Private vessels (depending on the nature of the service and user category)

---

**3. Purpose and Rationale:**

- The primary purpose is to **ensure financial sustainability** of Coast Guard radio operations.
- The Coast Guard Radio Stations provide critical, often essential, communications infrastructure for maritime safety and emergency response. These services may involve:
  - 24/7 monitoring
  - Maintenance of radio equipment
  - Staffing and operational costs
  - Security and emergency response capabilities
- By allowing the Minister to prescribe charges, the government ensures that the **costs of providing these services are appropriately recovered**, without relying solely on general taxation or government subsidies.

---

**4. Key Features of the Authorization:**

- **Flexibility**: The Minister of Transport is empowered to prescribe charges **by order**, allowing for adjustments based on:
  - Changes in operational costs
  - Service usage patterns
  - Technological upgrades
  - Regulatory or policy shifts
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The charges must be established in a manner consistent with public accountability and transparency, as required under the Financial Administration Act.
- **Public Interest**: The services are vital to maritime safety, so any charges must be reasonable, justified, and not discriminatory.

---

**5. Implementation and Oversight:**

- The Minister of Transport is responsible for:
  - Drafting and issuing the specific charges via a formal **regulatory order**.
  - Ensuring that the charges are clearly communicated to users.
  - Justifying the charges in terms of cost recovery and service necessity.
- The **Treasury Board** provides oversight, ensuring that the charges are within the bounds of financial accountability and public interest.
- The regulation is part of **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6**, which is a section of the **Maritime Safety and Security Act** (or a related enabling statute), and reflects a broader legislative framework for managing maritime communications infrastructure.

---

**6. Implications:**

- **For Users**: Vessels and maritime operators must now pay for the use of Coast Guard radio services, which may affect operational costs.
- **For the Coast Guard**: Provides a reliable revenue stream to maintain and upgrade communication systems.
- **For the Public**: Supports safer, more efficient maritime operations and emergency response capabilities.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a legal and administrative framework that enables the Canadian government to **recover operational costs** for essential ship/shore communication services provided by Coast Guard Radio Stations. It is a practical measure to ensure the long-term viability of maritime safety infrastructure, while operating within the constraints of financial accountability and public service obligations. The power to set charges is exercised through a formal, transparent, and accountable process involving the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board.
