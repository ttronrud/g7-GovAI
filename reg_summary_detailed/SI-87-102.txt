**Detailed Summary of the "Goods Imported for Certification Remission Order"**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**
This regulation, known as the **Goods Imported for Certification Remission Order**, was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on **July 1, 1986**, under the authority granted by **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. It was recommended by the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **promote efficiency and compliance in product certification processes** by allowing a **remission (exemption)** of certain taxes for goods imported into Canada specifically for testing or examination by an accredited organization.

The Order is formally cited as:  
**S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 170, s. 4**  
and is commonly referred to as the **Goods Imported for Certification Remission Order**.

---

### **Key Definitions**
- **Accredited Organization**:  
  An organization that has been officially **accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC)** to certify that goods meet specific standards. These organizations are recognized for their competence, impartiality, and adherence to national standards in testing and evaluation.

This definition ensures that only reputable, certified bodies can claim the tax remission, thereby maintaining quality control and regulatory integrity.

### **Scope of the Remission**
The Order grants a **full remission (exemption)** of the following taxes and duties for goods imported into Canada:

1. **Customs duties** under **Section 21 of the Customs Tariff**  
2. **Sales and excise taxes** imposed under:
   - **Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**
   - **Any other part of the Excise Tax Act** (i.e., broader excise tax provisions)

**Applicable Goods**:  
Goods that are imported **solely for the purpose of testing or examination** to obtain certification from an accredited organization.

> This means the goods must not be intended for commercial sale, resale, or distribution. Their sole purpose must be to undergo inspection, analysis, or evaluation to verify compliance with standards.

---

### **Conditions for Remission**
To qualify for the remission, the following **four conditions must be met**:

1. **Timely Application**  
   An application for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date the goods were imported.

   > This creates a strict deadline to ensure accountability and timely processing. Failure to apply within this window will result in the loss of eligibility.

2. **Import Date Requirement**  
   The goods must be imported **on or after July 1, 1986**, by or on behalf of an **accredited organization**.

   > This establishes a clear policy date, aligning the remission with a specific regulatory initiative launched in 1986 to modernize certification practices and reduce unnecessary tax burdens on legitimate testing activities.

3. **Non-Commercial Use and Disposition**  
   The goods must:
   - Be **neither sold nor given** to any person outside the accredited organization;
   - Be **used exclusively** for testing or examination by the accredited organization;
   - Upon completion of testing/examination, the goods must either:
     - Be **exported** out of Canada, or  
     - Be **destroyed** by or on behalf of the importer.

   > This condition ensures that the goods do not enter the commercial market or become part of a distribution chain, protecting the integrity of the tax exemption.

4. **Supporting Evidence**  
   The applicant must provide **such other evidence as is necessary** to demonstrate entitlement to the remission.

   > This includes documentation such as:
     - Import declarations
     - Certificates of accreditation from the Standards Council of Canada
     - Test reports or examination records
     - Proof of the accredited organization’s involvement
     - Records showing no commercial sale or transfer

   > The Minister retains discretion to verify the authenticity and sufficiency of this evidence.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Rationale**
The regulation was introduced to:
- **Support Canada’s certification system** by reducing the financial burden on legitimate testing and evaluation activities;
- Encourage **product safety, quality, and compliance** through independent, accredited testing;
- Promote **international trade competitiveness** by allowing Canadian manufacturers and importers to verify product standards without incurring unnecessary tax costs;
- Align with the broader goals of the **Standards Council of Canada** to ensure consistent, reliable, and trustworthy certification across industries.

By exempting taxes on goods used solely for certification, the government enables accredited organizations to operate efficiently and supports innovation and quality assurance in sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, food safety, and environmental compliance.

---

### **Key Limitations and Exclusions**
- The remission **does not apply** to goods imported for commercial purposes.
- The goods must be **used exclusively** for testing or certification — any commercial use disqualifies them.
- The exemption is **not retroactive**; only goods imported on or after July 1, 1986, qualify.
- The **two-year application window** is non-negotiable — failure to meet it results in ineligibility.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for:
  - Receiving and reviewing applications;
  - Verifying compliance with the conditions;
  - Determining whether remission is granted or denied.
- The Minister may request additional information or documentation to assess eligibility.
- The Order operates under the general framework of the **Financial Administration Act**, which allows for the use of fiscal policy to support public interest objectives.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Goods Imported for Certification Remission Order** is a targeted fiscal relief measure designed to support Canada’s certification infrastructure. It provides a clear, structured pathway for accredited organizations to import goods for testing without facing the full burden of customs and excise taxes — provided that the goods are used solely for certification and meet all specified conditions.

This regulation reflects a balance between **fiscal responsibility** and **public interest**, promoting quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and the efficiency of Canada’s product certification system.

---

**In essence**:  
> *Imported goods used solely for testing by accredited Canadian organizations (on or after July 1, 1986) are exempt from customs duties and excise taxes — provided the goods are not sold, are returned or destroyed after testing, and an application is filed within two years of import.*
