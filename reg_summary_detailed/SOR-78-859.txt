**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order (SOR/67-263)**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**
This regulation, officially titled the *Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order*, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (Ontario). It serves to **revoke an earlier Order in Council (P.C. 1967-1029)** dated May 25, 1967, which had previously established marketing regulations for asparagus in Ontario.

The purpose of this new Order is to **replace the outdated 1967 regulation** with a modern, more effective framework that enables the regulation of the **marketing of asparagus for processing**—such as canning, freezing, drying, or treating with chemicals—produced in Ontario. The Order aims to ensure fair market practices, support producers, and stabilize prices through structured marketing and financial mechanisms.

### **2. Legal Authority**
- The Order is made under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which grants the government authority to regulate the marketing of agricultural products.
- It operates within the broader framework of the **Farm Products Marketing Act**, which establishes a system for managing the marketing of farm products, including setting prices, collecting levies, and creating reserves.

### **3. Key Definitions**
The Order provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (Loi) |
| **Asparagus** | Asparagus produced in Ontario (asperge) |
| **Board** | The *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario*, established under the Act |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act |
| **Plan** | Any marketing plan for asparagus established or amended over time, along with any regulations made to implement it |
| **Processing** | Includes canning, dehydrating, drying, freezing, or processing with sugar, sulfur dioxide, or other chemicals (transformation) |
| **Producer** | A person who, on **May 1st** of any year, is either:<br>• The beneficial owner of land where asparagus is grown, or<br>• The tenant of such land if the land is rented to them on that date |

These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in identifying who is subject to the regulations and what constitutes "marketing for processing."

### **4. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board and the Board**
Both the **Commodity Board** and the **Farm Products Marketing Board** are granted broad authority to regulate the marketing of asparagus in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Ontario)

This includes the power to:
- Issue **orders or regulations**
- Apply these powers to **persons and property located within Ontario**
- Exercise **all or any powers** that they would have under the Act and the marketing plan **for local marketing within Ontario**

This means the boards can apply the same rules—such as pricing, quotas, or collection of fees—to both domestic and export markets, ensuring consistency and fairness.

---

### **5. Key Powers of the Commodity Board (Specific to Interprovincial and Export Trade)**
The Commodity Board is specifically empowered to:

#### a) **Fix, Impose, and Collect Levies or Charges**
- It can establish **levies or charges** on producers and marketers of asparagus in Ontario involved in:
  - Production
  - Marketing (including export and interprovincial sales)

#### b) **Classify Producers into Groups**
- Producers are grouped based on factors such as:
  - Size of operation
  - Type of production
  - Geographic location
- Different groups may be subject to **different levy amounts** depending on their characteristics.

#### c) **Use Levies and Charges for Specific Purposes**
The collected funds may be used for:
- Creating **reserves** (funds set aside for future use)
- Covering **operating expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of asparagus
- **Equalizing or adjusting payments** among producers based on actual revenues from sales

This mechanism helps prevent market volatility and ensures that producers who may have had poor sales in a given year are compensated, while those with strong sales contribute to shared financial stability.

---

### **6. Significance and Implications**
This Order represents a significant step in the development of a **cooperative, market-stabilizing system** for Ontario’s asparagus industry. Key implications include:

- **Stability in pricing and market access**: By regulating interprovincial and export sales, the Order helps prevent price crashes or surges due to market fluctuations.
- **Fair distribution of financial burdens and benefits**: Group-based levies ensure that producers are not all treated equally, allowing for differentiated financial responsibility.
- **Financial resilience**: The ability to create reserves and adjust payments ensures that producers are protected during downturns.
- **Support for processing industries**: Since the Order specifically covers processing (e.g., freezing, canning), it supports value-added production, which increases profitability and reduces waste.

---

### **7. Effective Date and Citation**
- The Order was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, Volume 101, No. 11, on **June 14, 1967**.
- It may be cited as: **The Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order** (SOR/67-263)

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order* is a targeted regulatory instrument designed to modernize and strengthen the marketing of asparagus in Ontario. By revoking an older, less flexible order and replacing it with a more structured and equitable system, the government enables:

- Better control over interprovincial and export markets  
- Fairer financial treatment of producers  
- Sustainable development of processing industries  
- Protection against market instability  

This regulation remains a foundational piece of policy in Ontario’s agricultural marketing framework, particularly for perishable, value-sensitive crops like asparagus.

**Note**: While this Order is specific to asparagus, its structure reflects broader principles used in the regulation of other agricultural commodities under Ontario’s Farm Products Marketing Act.
