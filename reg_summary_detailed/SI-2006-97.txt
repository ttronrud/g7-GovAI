Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the provided regulation:

**Regulation Summary:**

- **Issuing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.  
  This indicates that the regulation is a formal government decision, approved at the highest level of the federal executive branch, and reflects a policy or financial authorization endorsed by the federal government.

- **Responsible Minister:** The Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities is designated as the authority responsible for executing the agreement. This ministerial role implies that the decision falls under the portfolio of transportation, infrastructure development, and community services, suggesting the agreement is related to infrastructure or transportation projects.

- **Parties to the Agreement:**  
  - The federal government (represented by the Minister)  
  - Harbourfront Corporation (1990), a publicly recognized entity established in 1990, likely a not-for-profit or public-private development corporation responsible for managing and developing waterfront areas, cultural spaces, or community facilities in a specific region (such as Toronto, given the name "Harbourfront").

- **Nature of the Agreement:** A *contribution agreement*.  
  This means the federal government will provide financial support (a contribution) to Harbourfront Corporation. The term "contribution" is typically used in public sector funding contexts and may include grants, subsidies, or direct financial support for specific projects, infrastructure development, or community initiatives.

- **Financial Amount:** The total contribution is not to exceed **$4 million**.  
  This establishes a clear cap on the funding, indicating fiscal responsibility and budgetary constraints. The amount is set as a maximum, not a guaranteed sum, allowing flexibility depending on project needs or funding outcomes.

- **Fiscal Year:** The agreement applies to the fiscal year ending on **March 31, 2007**.  
  This defines the time period during which the financial support is authorized and expected to be utilized. It is a one-year funding cycle, which is typical for short-term or project-based funding arrangements.

- **Purpose Implied (Inferred):** While not explicitly stated, the context of Harbourfront Corporation and the ministerial portfolio suggests the funding is likely intended to support:  
  - Urban development or revitalization of waterfront areas  
  - Community infrastructure or public space improvements  
  - Cultural or recreational facilities (e.g., parks, museums, public plazas)  
  - Transportation-related infrastructure (e.g., pedestrian access, public transit integration)

- **Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
  The regulation formally authorizes the Minister to enter into the agreement, providing legal standing and enabling the necessary administrative steps. It does not specify the exact project, deliverables, or performance criteria, which would typically be included in the actual agreement.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation authorizes the federal government to provide up to $4 million in financial support to Harbourfront Corporation for a project or initiative related to waterfront or community development during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. The funding is conditional upon the Minister's discretion and is governed by the terms of a contribution agreement, reflecting a strategic investment in public infrastructure and community spaces under the jurisdiction of transportation and infrastructure policy.

**Note:** The regulation is dated prior to 2007 and may be part of a historical or archival record. As such, it does not reflect current policies or funding mechanisms.
