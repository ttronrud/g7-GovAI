### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation provides for a **tax remission** (i.e., a refund or offset of tax paid) to the **Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC)**. The remission is intended to compensate the CEC for the additional excise tax it paid during a specific period, which was not fully offset by the exemptions it was entitled to under international treaty provisions.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Commission**  
   Refers to the *Commission for Environmental Cooperation*, established under **Article 8(1)** of the *North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC)*.  
   - The NAAEC was signed on **September 14, 1993**, and came into force on **January 1, 1994**.  
   - The CEC is a trilateral environmental body involving the **Government of Canada**, the **United States of America**, and the **Government of Mexico**.  
   - Its mandate includes promoting environmental protection and cooperation among the three nations through joint initiatives, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms.

2. **Tax**  
   Refers specifically to the excise tax imposed under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.  
   - This tax applies to certain goods and services, and in this context, it is levied on the CEC, likely as a form of government fee or levy related to its operations.

### **Core Provision: Tax Remission**

The regulation grants a **remission of excise tax** to the Commission, calculated as follows:

> **Remission Amount =**  
> *(Amount of excise tax actually paid by the Commission during the period from September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997)*  
> **minus**  
> *(The amount of excise tax that would have been payable if the Commission had been granted the full exemptions under Article II of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations)*

In simpler terms:
- The CEC paid excise tax during the period **September 4, 1994 – September 22, 1997**.
- Under international law, specifically the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, certain international organizations (like the CEC) are entitled to exemptions from certain taxes.
- However, the CEC did not receive full tax exemptions during this period due to the specific tax regime in Canada.
- Therefore, the government is remitting to the CEC the **excess tax paid** over what it would have paid **if those exemptions had been fully applied**.

### **Significance and Rationale**

1. **Public Interest Justification**  
   The Governor General in Council makes this decision **in the public interest**, recognizing that the CEC plays a vital role in environmental cooperation among Canada, the U.S., and Mexico.  
   - Environmental protection is a key public good, and supporting the CEC helps achieve cross-border environmental goals.

2. **Alignment with International Law**  
   The remission is based on the **privileges and immunities** granted to international organizations under the *United Nations Convention*.  
   - Article II of the Convention allows certain international bodies to be exempt from certain taxes, including excise taxes, to ensure their operational independence and effectiveness.

3. **Financial Fairness**  
   The regulation corrects a financial imbalance by acknowledging that the CEC, as a multilateral environmental body, should not be burdened with excise taxes that are not justified under international law.  
   - The remission ensures that the CEC is not financially disadvantaged due to a gap between its actual tax liability and its legally entitled exemption.

### **Temporal Scope**

- The remission applies to the **tax paid during the period from September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997**.  
- This specific timeframe likely corresponds to the operational phase of the CEC when it began its activities and when the tax obligations were first assessed.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- The authority to issue this remission stems from **subsection 23(2)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which allows the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to make remissions of tax when it is in the public interest.
- This provision provides flexibility in managing government finances in response to public policy or international obligations.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted fiscal adjustment that:
- Recognizes the importance of the **Commission for Environmental Cooperation** in regional environmental governance.
- Corrects a financial overcharge by remitting excise tax based on the difference between what was actually paid and what would have been paid under the applicable international tax exemptions.
- Balances fiscal responsibility with the public interest in supporting international environmental cooperation.

It reflects a pragmatic approach to international treaty obligations and demonstrates how Canadian tax policy can support multilateral environmental efforts through targeted financial relief.

**Note:** This remission is not a general tax reduction or refund but a **specific, calculated adjustment** for a defined period and entity, based on a legal and policy rationale grounded in international law and public interest.
