- The Governor in Council, acting with the advice of the **Privy Council**, declares that:
  > *"The Convention came into force on December 28, 1989."*

- This declaration is not merely symbolic; it has **binding legal effect** under Canadian law. Once a treaty enters into force, it becomes enforceable and governs the tax treatment of individuals and entities from both countries.

### **5. Scope and Application**

- The Convention applies to:
  - **Income tax** (including income from employment, business, investments, pensions, and other sources).
  - The **avoidance of double taxation**—that is, preventing individuals or companies from being taxed twice on the same income in both Canada and Zambia.
  - The **prevention of fiscal evasion**—ensuring that tax avoidance schemes or illegal tax practices are not exploited to reduce tax liability.

- It establishes rules for:
  - **Tax credit or exemption** for income taxed in one country (e.g., a Canadian resident earning income in Zambia).
  - **Residence and source rules** for determining where income is taxable.
  - **Tax treaties to resolve disputes** and prevent tax avoidance through artificial structures.

### **6. Significance and Implications**

- **For Canadian Taxpayers and Businesses:**
  - Individuals or companies with income derived from Zambia (e.g., expatriates, investors, or business operations) can claim tax credits or exemptions in Canada for taxes paid in Zambia.
  - This reduces the risk of double taxation and enhances cross-border tax compliance.

- **For Zambia:**
  - The treaty ensures that Zambian taxpayers with income in Canada are not subject to double taxation and that Canada recognizes certain tax obligations.

- **For the Canadian Government:**
  - The treaty strengthens Canada’s international tax framework and promotes economic cooperation with Zambia.
  - It reflects Canada’s commitment to fair, transparent, and cooperative tax policies within the international community.
