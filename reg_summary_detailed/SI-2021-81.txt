**Summary:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister), establishes a formal transfer of powers, duties, and functions from the **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages** to the **Minister of State (Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario)**.

Specifically, the regulation provides that:

- The **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages** is no longer responsible for the governance, administration, or oversight of the **Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FEDAO)**.
- Instead, these responsibilities are **transferred** to the **Minister of State (Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario)**.
- This transfer includes all **powers, duties, and functions** previously held by the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages with respect to FEDAO.

**Background and Context:**

The Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FEDAO) was established as a federal agency to support economic development in the southern region of Ontario, particularly in areas such as small business development, workforce training, and regional economic planning. The transfer of responsibility reflects a strategic reorganization of federal ministerial portfolios to better align with regional economic development priorities.

This reorganization is grounded in the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (R.S., c. P-34), specifically **paragraph 2(a)(a)**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to transfer duties between ministers when it is in the public interest or for administrative efficiency.

**Key Implications:**

1. **Administrative Efficiency:**  
   The transfer enables the Minister of State for FEDAO to have direct and focused oversight of the agency, improving responsiveness to regional economic needs in southern Ontario.

2. **Clarified Accountability:**  
   The Minister of State (FEDAO) now bears full accountability for the agency’s operations, performance, and strategic direction.

3. **Continuity of Services:**  
   While the ministerial responsibility changes, the agency’s mandate and services remain unchanged—only the administrative oversight is transferred.

4. **Policy Alignment:**  
   This realignment supports a more targeted federal approach to regional economic development, with greater coordination between federal policy and provincial economic strategies in southern Ontario.

---

**Legal Authority:**

The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reassignment of ministerial functions to improve governance, efficiency, or effectiveness. This provision is designed to provide flexibility in the federal government’s structure without requiring new legislation.

---

**Effective Date:**

While not explicitly stated in the citation, such transfers are typically effective immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon formal notification. In practice, this transfer would have taken effect on or around the date of publication in the official gazette (likely shortly after the 2003 enactment).

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal government’s economic development framework. By transferring responsibility for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario from the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages to the Minister of State (FEDAO), the government enhances regional focus, streamlines decision-making, and ensures that economic development initiatives in southern Ontario are managed by a minister with direct regional accountability.
