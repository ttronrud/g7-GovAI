**Detailed Summary of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Police Enforcement) Regulations*, S.C. 1996, c. 19**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under subsection 55(2) of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA), establish specific exemptions and procedural guidelines for members of police forces and individuals acting under their direction when handling controlled substances during lawful law enforcement investigations. The primary objective is to **allow police personnel to lawfully possess, use, import, export, or produce certain controlled substances** during active investigations—without violating the CDSA—while ensuring accountability, transparency, and public safety.

The regulations provide a **balanced framework** that protects the integrity of the criminal justice system by permitting necessary investigative actions while clearly defining conditions under which such conduct is exempt from criminal liability.

A person is exempt if:
- They act **under the direction and control** of a qualified police officer (meeting conditions in paragraphs 3(a) and (b));

Certificates are issued to allow temporary exemption from criminal liability when handling substances that have been:

- The person is an active member or under the direction of one;
- Acting in the course of a particular investigation;
