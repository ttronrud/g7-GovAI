### **1. Revocation of Previous Order in Council**

The regulation begins by formally **revoking Order in Council P.C. 1987-1092**, issued on May 28, 1987. This prior order had previously established or regulated fees associated with registration under the *Industrial Design Act*. By revoking this order, the government removes the previous fee structure or rules that were in effect at the time.

This revocation is significant because it signals a change in policy or administrative approach—likely due to a shift in fee-setting authority, a review of cost-effectiveness, or a need to modernize the fee regime in alignment with current administrative or fiscal considerations.

### **2. Authorization to Prescribe Fees for Industrial Design Registration**

The key substantive provision of the regulation is the **authorization of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** to:

- **Prescribe, by order, a fee** to be paid by persons seeking registration under the *Industrial Design Act*.

This authority is granted **despite Section 26 of the Industrial Design Act**, which traditionally may have restricted or prohibited the Minister from setting fees in this manner. The fact that the regulation explicitly states "notwithstanding section 26" indicates a deliberate override of a statutory provision.

#### Key Implications of "Notwithstanding Section 26":
- Section 26 of the *Industrial Design Act* typically prohibits the Minister from imposing fees on registration, or may require fees to be set by law or under specific conditions.
- By allowing the Minister to prescribe fees *despite* this provision, the government is exercising **regulatory discretion** to introduce or adjust registration fees, likely to:
  - Generate revenue for the operation of the design registration system,
  - Ensure fair and equitable access to registration,
  - Reflect the administrative and operational costs of processing design applications,
  - Improve the efficiency and sustainability of the design office.

### **3. Scope of the Authorization**

The fee prescribed by the Minister will apply to:
- **Services related to registration** under the *Industrial Design Act*.
- This includes, but is not limited to, the filing of applications for industrial design protection, including the payment of processing fees or registration fees.

The Minister is empowered to:
- Set the amount of the fee,
- Adjust the fee in the future (subject to the same authority),
- Apply the fee to all persons (individuals, corporations, or other entities) seeking registration.

### **4. Legal Basis and Administrative Process**

The authority to issue such an order stems from:
- **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to authorize the Minister to prescribe fees for services under federal legislation, provided such fees are consistent with public policy and financial administration principles.

This provision enables the government to maintain flexibility in fee structures without requiring a full legislative amendment to the *Industrial Design Act*.

---

### **5. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of this regulation appear to be:
- To **modernize the fee structure** for industrial design registration, ensuring it reflects current administrative costs and market realities.
- To **provide clarity and consistency** in the fee system, replacing outdated or arbitrary fee levels.
- To **enhance the financial sustainability** of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), which administers the *Industrial Design Act*.
- To **align with broader government policy** on intellectual property and innovation support.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative shift in how fees for industrial design registration are managed in Canada. By revoking the prior fee order and authorizing the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to set fees *despite a statutory restriction*, the government demonstrates a willingness to adapt regulatory frameworks to meet evolving administrative and fiscal needs.

It underscores the importance of **flexibility in fee-setting** under federal administrative law, particularly when public policy objectives—such as supporting innovation and protecting intellectual property—require timely and responsive fee structures.

This authorization is a **temporary or interim measure** that allows the Minister to issue specific fee orders, which would then be subject to review and potential legislative amendment in the future.
