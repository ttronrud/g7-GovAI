The provided text consists solely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been repealed:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2013-173, s. 1]" — repeated seven times.

### Detailed Summary:

This entry signifies that a specific regulation (identified by section 1 of Statutory Instrument No. 2013-173) has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or abolished) by the Government of Canada through the *Statutory Instruments (SOR/2013-173)*, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on January 16, 2013.

- **SOR/2013-173** is the official designation of the Statutory Instrument that repealed the referenced regulation.
- **Section 1** of that instrument specifically identifies the regulation being repealed.
- The repetition of the same line seven times appears to be a formatting or typographical error in the original source, possibly due to a copy-paste issue or data duplication. It does not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed — rather, it reflects a single repeal action being listed multiple times.

### Key Points:
- The regulation in question is **no longer in force** as of the date of the repeal (January 16, 2013).
- The repeal was enacted to **remove outdated, redundant, or obsolete provisions** from the legal framework, often to streamline or modernize legislation.
- The repeal does not provide details about what the original regulation was, as that information is not included in the provided text. To understand the original content, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory notes accompanying SOR/2013-173.

### Conclusion:
The provided summary contains **no substantive content** about the original regulation being repealed. It only confirms that a regulation (specifically under section 1 of SOR/2013-173) has been formally repealed. The repeated entries are likely a technical error and do not add new information.

To obtain a detailed understanding of the original regulation and its purpose, further research into the full text of the repealed regulation or the explanatory documents accompanying SOR/2013-173 would be required.
