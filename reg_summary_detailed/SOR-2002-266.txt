### **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **1. Designation of a Provincial Office for Enforcement Notices**

Every trust or loan company that conducts business in a province must designate **one office** within that province for the purpose of serving enforcement notices under **subsection 448(3) of the TLC Act**.

- **Eligibility of Office**:  
  If the company has one or more branches in the province, the designated office **must be one of those branches**.  
  → This ensures that enforcement notices are served at a legitimate, physically accessible location within the province.

- **Timeline for Designation**:  
  The designation must be made **on or before the later of two dates**:
  1. The **last day of a three-month period** beginning on the day these regulations come into force.
  2. The **last day of a three-month period** beginning on the day the company starts carrying on business in that province.

  → This gives companies sufficient time to establish their presence and designate an office, while ensuring compliance does not occur too late after operations begin.

---

#### **2. Public Disclosure of Designated Office**

Once a company designates an office in a province, it is required to **publicize the name and address** of that office in the following two ways:

- **In the Canada Gazette, Part I**  
  → A national official publication used for government notices. This ensures broad visibility and official recognition.

- **In one or more newspapers of general circulation in the province**  
  → The publication must occur **at least once per week for four consecutive weeks**.  
  → This ensures local awareness and accessibility for the public and relevant authorities.

> **Note**: The public disclosure serves to inform individuals and stakeholders about where enforcement notices can be served, promoting transparency and accountability.

#### **3. Requirements for Changes to Designation**

If a company:
- Changes the designated office in a province, or  
- Changes the name or address of a previously designated office,

It must **publish a description of the change** in the **same manner** as required under subsection (1).

- The change must be publicly announced **within three months** of the change occurring.

> This ensures that any updates to the designated office are promptly communicated to the public and enforcement agencies, preventing service delays or confusion.

---

#### **4. Online Accessibility of Designated Offices**

Every company must:
- **Post and maintain** on its **primary Internet website** an **up-to-date list** of the names and addresses of all offices designated under these regulations.

- The list must be **current and accessible** to the public.

> This provision supports digital transparency and ensures that individuals can access information online, which is increasingly important in modern business and enforcement practices.

---

#### **5. Content Requirements for Enforcement Notices**

For enforcement notices issued under support orders or support provisions, the accompanying written statement must include **specific information** about the person required to make a payment:

1. **Full name** of the person who is required to make the payment.  
2. **Latest known address** of that person.  
3. **Either**:
   - The **social insurance number (SIN)** of the person, **or**
   - The **date of birth** of the person.

> This ensures that enforcement notices can be properly targeted and that the individual can be identified in a way that respects privacy while enabling accurate service and compliance.

> The requirement to include either SIN or date of birth helps prevent fraud and ensures that the correct individual is being notified, especially in cases involving support orders related to debts or financial obligations.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.

> This means the rules are immediately enforceable upon publication, providing timely implementation of the requirements.

The regulations aim to:

- **Ensure enforceability** of support orders and provisions by clearly defining where enforcement notices can be served.
