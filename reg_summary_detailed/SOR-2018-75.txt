*Issued by: Pork Nova Scotia (formerly the Pork Producers Marketing Board of Nova Scotia)*

---

### **Overview**

This regulation establishes a system of **marketing levies** that producers in Nova Scotia must pay when hogs are sold **interprovincially or exported**. The levies are designed to support the stability and sustainability of the provincial hog industry by contributing to marketing, research, and market development initiatives managed by the Commodity Board.

The Order sets out specific **levy amounts**, **definitions of hog categories**, **reporting obligations**, and **compliance timelines**.

---

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Contract Grower** | A person who raises hogs for a producer but does not own them. *Excluded from the levy obligation.* |
| **Cull Boar** | An uncastrated male hog that is no longer used for breeding and is marketed for slaughter. |
| **Cull Sow** | A female hog that is no longer used for breeding and is marketed for slaughter. |
| **Feeder Hog** | A hog that is at least 30 days old and is raised for further growth (i.e., for production, not immediate slaughter). |
| **Market Hog** | Any hog that is not a weanling, feeder hog, cull sow, stag, or cull boar. This includes hogs sold at various stages of maturity for market purposes. |
| **Producer** | A person who owns hogs bred or raised in Nova Scotia for commercial purposes, or whose hogs are produced or marketed in Nova Scotia. *Excludes processors and contract growers.* |
| **Stag** | A castrated male hog that has been used for breeding. |
| **Weanling** | A hog that is at least 10 days old but younger than 30 days old. |

| Hog Type | Levy Amount |
|---------|-------------|
| **Weanlings** | $0.25 per hog |
| **Stags, Cull Boars, Feeder Hogs, Market Hogs, Cull Sows** | $2.00 per hog |

### **Reporting Requirements**

Producers must comply with the following **quarterly reporting obligations**:

1. **Remit Levies**  
   - Producers must pay the levies specified above to the **Commodity Board** by the deadline set in **Column 2** of the Schedule.

2. **Submit Quarterly Reports**  
   - Each producer must submit a **quarterly report** to the Commodity Board detailing:
     - The **number of weanlings** sold
     - The **number of stags** sold
     - The **number of cull boars** sold
     - The **number of feeder hogs** sold
     - The **number of market hogs** sold
     - The **number of cull sows** sold  
   - These reports must be submitted for each **reporting period** listed in **Column 1** of the Schedule.

> *Reporting is mandatory and must be completed on time to avoid penalties or delays in levy processing.*

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (April 18, 2018).

---

### **Purpose and Implications**

- **Revenue Generation**: The levies generate funds for the Commodity Board to support industry-wide initiatives such as market research, price stability programs, and promotion of Nova Scotia pork.
- **Equity and Fairness**: The levy structure is designed to be proportional to the value and market stage of the hog. For example, weanlings are charged a lower levy due to their early stage, while breeding and mature hogs (like stags and cull sows) are charged a higher rate, reflecting their longer production cycle and greater market value.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement for detailed quarterly reporting ensures transparency in trade activity and helps the Commodity Board monitor market trends and industry performance.
- **Exclusion of Certain Participants**: Contract growers and processors are not required to pay levies or submit reports, which reflects a distinction between those who own hogs and those who manage them on behalf of others or process them.

---

### **Key Takeaways for Producers**

- **Must Pay**: $0.25 per weanling and $2.00 per other hog type sold outside Nova Scotia.
- **Must Report**: Quarterly, with data on all hog types sold in interprovincial or export markets.
- **Deadline Compliance**: Timely remittance and reporting are required to avoid administrative or financial penalties.
- **Exemptions Apply**: Contract growers and processors are not subject to this Order.

### **Conclusion**

The *Nova Scotia Hog Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* is a critical regulatory mechanism that ensures fair revenue collection from hog producers engaged in out-of-province or international trade. By clearly defining hog categories, setting tiered levies, and mandating transparent reporting, the Order supports the long-term viability and competitiveness of Nova Scotia’s pork sector while aligning with broader agricultural market development goals.

This regulation remains in force as of April 18, 2018, and continues to serve as a foundational tool for the management and sustainability of Nova Scotia’s hog industry.
