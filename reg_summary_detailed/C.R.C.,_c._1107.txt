**Detailed Summary of the N.H.A. Maximum Interest Rates Regulations**

---

### **Regulation Title**  
*The N.H.A. Maximum Interest Rates Regulations*  
These regulations establish the maximum annual interest rates that may be charged by lenders to borrowers who obtain loans under specific provisions of the **National Housing Act (Act)**.

---

### **Key Definitions and Terminology**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *National Housing Act*, which governs the provision of housing loans, particularly those aimed at promoting affordable housing and supporting low- and moderate-income individuals.

2. **Interest Period**  
   A three-month period that begins on one of the following dates:  
   - January 1  
   - April 1  
   - July 1  
   - October 1  
   This determines when the interest rate is applied and recalculated.

3. **Averaging Period**  
   A four-week period ending on one of the following dates:  
   - December 31  
   - March 31  
   - June 30  
   - September 30  
   This period is used to calculate the average yield on long-term Canadian government bonds, which influences the interest rate for loans made from July 1, 1969 onward.

4. **Long-Term Bonds of Canada**  
   Marketable bonds issued by the Government of Canada that:  
   - Are payable in Canadian currency  
   - Mature in **10 years or more**  
   These are used to determine the base yield for interest rate adjustments.

5. **Average Yield on Long-Term Bonds of Canada**  
   The **simple arithmetic mean** of the Wednesday closing mid-market yields (as published by the Bank of Canada) for all long-term Canadian government bonds during the averaging period.  
   - The yield is calculated to the **nearest 1/8 of a percent** (e.g., 3.125%).  
   - If the result is **exactly halfway** between two multiples of 1/8%, it is rounded **down** (to the lower value).

### **Interest Rate Structure by Loan Type and Timing**

#### **1. Loans Made Under Section 28 of the National Housing Act**

This section governs loans made under the provisions of section 28 of the Act (typically related to housing loans for individuals or families).

- **Loans made in the period ending June 30, 1969:**  
  Maximum interest rate = **9 3/8% per annum**  
  → This rate is **fixed** and does not depend on market conditions.

- **Loans made in an interest period beginning on or after July 1, 1969:**  
  Maximum interest rate = **2 1/4% + average yield on long-term bonds of Canada**  
  → The base rate is **2.25%**, plus the average yield calculated from the most recent four-week averaging period.  
  → The final rate is rounded to the **nearest 1/8 of a percent**.  
  → In cases of exact mid-point (e.g., 0.125%), the result is rounded **down**.

> **Purpose**: This structure links the interest rate to market conditions (via bond yields), ensuring that interest rates remain responsive to economic changes while providing a floor of 2.25% to protect borrowers.

---

#### **2. Loans Made Under Other Sections of the National Housing Act**

These loans are subject to **fixed maximum interest rates**, regardless of market conditions.

| Section(s) of the Act | Maximum Interest Rate | Calculation Method |
|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **15, 25, 43, 45.2, 47, or 51** | **17 1/2% per annum** | Computed **semi-annually** (i.e., twice a year), and **not in advance** |
| **27.5, 34.1, or 42** | **16% per annum** | Computed **semi-annually**, and **not in advance** |

> **Note**:  
> - "Computed semi-annually" means the interest is calculated every six months (e.g., June 30 and December 31), not applied in advance.  
> - "Not in advance" ensures that borrowers are not charged interest before the loan is disbursed or before the interest period begins. This protects borrowers from prepayment penalties or early interest charges.

> **Purpose**: These provisions ensure that certain types of housing loans—such as those for first-time homebuyers, specific housing programs, or subsidized lending—have a cap on interest to prevent excessive borrowing costs and promote affordability.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Affordability and Protection of Borrowers**  
   The regulations establish **maximum interest rates** to protect low- and moderate-income borrowers from predatory or excessively high interest charges, especially in housing loans.

2. **Market Responsiveness (Post-July 1969)**  
   After June 30, 1969, the interest rate for section 28 loans is tied to the performance of long-term Canadian government bonds. This ensures that interest rates reflect broader economic conditions (e.g., inflation, interest rate trends), while maintaining a floor of 2.25%.

3. **Fixed Caps for Specific Loan Types**  
   Certain loan types (e.g., under sections 15, 25, etc.) have fixed caps (17.5% or 16%) to ensure stability and predictability in lending, particularly for programs with public or social housing goals.

4. **Transparency and Consistency**  
   - The use of **standardized averaging periods** and **clear definitions** (e.g., mid-market yields, rounding rules) ensures consistency and fairness in rate determination.  
   - The Bank of Canada’s published yields provide an objective, transparent benchmark.

5. **Anti-Prepayment and Fairness Provisions**  
   The requirement that interest be **computed semi-annually and not in advance** prevents lenders from charging interest before the loan is disbursed or before the interest period begins—enhancing borrower protection.

### **Summary Table**

| Loan Type / Section | Interest Rate | Timing / Calculation | Notes |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| Section 28, loans before July 1, 1969 | 9 3/8% (9.375%) | Annual, not in advance | Fixed rate |
| Section 28, loans on or after July 1, 1969 | 2 1/4% + average yield on long-term bonds | Semi-annual adjustment, based on 4-week averaging period | Rounded to nearest 1/8%; rounded down if equidistant |
| Sections 15, 25, 43, 45.2, 47, 51 | 17 1/2% (17.5%) | Semi-annually, not in advance | Fixed cap |
| Sections 27.5, 34.1, 42 | 16% | Semi-annually, not in advance | Fixed cap |

### **Historical and Policy Context**

- These regulations were introduced in **1969** as part of a broader effort to stabilize housing finance and ensure affordability during a period of economic transition.
- The shift from a fixed rate (9.375%) to a market-linked rate (2.25% + bond yield) reflects a move toward **economic responsiveness** while maintaining borrower protection.
- The use of **Canadian government bonds** as a benchmark ensures that the rate is tied to domestic financial stability, rather than international markets.

### **Conclusion**

The *N.H.A. Maximum Interest Rates Regulations* provide a structured, fair, and transparent framework for setting maximum interest rates on housing loans under the National Housing Act. By combining **fixed caps** for certain loan types with a **market-responsive mechanism** for others, the regulations balance the need for financial sustainability with the imperative to protect vulnerable borrowers from excessive interest charges. The rules are designed to be clear, consistent, and grounded in objective financial data, ensuring accountability and equity in housing finance policy.

> **Note**: These regulations are now historical in nature and may not be in effect today. They reflect policy decisions from the mid-1960s to 1970s and may have been superseded by more modern interest rate frameworks or updated legislation. However, they remain a key reference for understanding the evolution of housing finance regulation in Canada.
