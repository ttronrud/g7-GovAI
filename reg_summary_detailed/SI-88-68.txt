**Regulation Summary:**

**Title and Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the Treasury Board, has authorized the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to prescribe, by order, the fees to be charged for certain services related to the issuance of documents by the Office of the Registrar General of Canada.

**Legal Basis:**  
This authorization is made under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (the federal government's formal executive authority) to delegate the power to set fees for administrative services when such fees are required for the operation of federal institutions or services. Specifically, paragraph 13(b) allows for the establishment of fees for services provided by the federal government, including those involving the issuance of official documents.

**Scope of the Regulation:**  
The regulation grants the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs the authority to issue **a fee order** that specifies the fees payable by individuals or entities for services provided by the **Office of the Registrar General of Canada**. These services typically include the issuance of official documents such as:

- Birth certificates  
- Death certificates  
- Marriage certificates  
- Citizenship certificates  
- Other statutory or administrative documents issued under the authority of the Registrar General  

The Minister may determine the fees based on factors such as:

- The type of document being issued  
- The method of service (e.g., in person, by mail, online)  
- The complexity or cost of processing  
- The need to ensure the financial sustainability of the Office of the Registrar General  

**Purpose and Rationale:**  
The primary objectives of this regulation are:

1. **Financial Sustainability:** To ensure the Office of the Registrar General can operate efficiently and maintain the quality and security of document issuance services.  
2. **Transparency and Accountability:** To establish clear, publicly known fees for services, promoting transparency in government pricing.  
3. **Cost Recovery:** To allow the government to recover the actual administrative and operational costs associated with issuing official documents.  
4. **Consistency and Fairness:** To ensure that fees are consistent and fair across all individuals and organizations seeking services, without discrimination.  

**Implementation Process:**  
- The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs will issue a **formal order** setting out the specific fees.  
- This order will be published in the Canada Gazette and made publicly available to ensure transparency.  
- The order may be amended or revoked in the future, subject to the same authority and process.  
- The fees will be enforceable and binding on all persons seeking services from the Office of the Registrar General.  

**Stakeholder Impact:**  
- Individuals and organizations (e.g., citizens, legal representatives, institutions) who request official documents will be required to pay the prescribed fees.  
- The regulation ensures that the fees are not arbitrary or discriminatory and are aligned with government financial administration standards.  

**Review and Oversight:**  
While the regulation grants broad authority to the Minister, it operates under the oversight of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. The fees may be subject to periodic review to ensure they remain appropriate, equitable, and in line with inflation, operational costs, and public expectations.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a clear, legally grounded mechanism for the government to set and manage fees for official document issuance services through the Office of the Registrar General of Canada. It ensures that the services remain financially viable while maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability in the public sector.
