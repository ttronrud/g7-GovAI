**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Fondation québécoise du cancer Inc. Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Origin of the Order**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (*R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) to make orders for the remission of customs duties. The order is specifically tailored to a single case involving a mobile medical clinic.

---

**2. Name and Citation of the Order**  
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Fondation québécoise du cancer Inc. Remission Order"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a formal, legally binding instrument within Canadian customs law.

---

**3. Subject Matter of the Remission**  
The order grants a **full remission** of customs duties that were **paid or payable** under **Part I of the Customs Tariff** on a specific piece of equipment:  
- A **1991 36-foot DYNACOACH Mobile Clinic**  
- Imported into Canada  
- Acquired by **Fondation québécoise du cancer Inc.** (the Quebec Cancer Foundation)

This remission applies only to the duties that would have been levied under the standard customs tariff provisions for such a mobile clinic, and not to any other taxes or charges.

---

**4. Conditions for the Remission**  
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

**Condition 1: Timely Claim Submission**  
- A claim for remission must be formally submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date on which the mobile clinic was "accounted for" under **section 32 of the Customs Act**.  
- "Accounted for" refers to the official date when the importation of the goods was recorded in the customs system, typically when the goods were cleared for entry into Canada.

**Condition 2: Non-Disposal of the Mobile Clinic**  
- The mobile clinic **must not be sold or otherwise disposed of** (e.g., transferred, leased, donated, or otherwise removed from the Foundation’s possession) **within one year** of the date it was accounted for under section 32 of the Customs Act.  
- This condition ensures that the imported asset remains in use for its original, charitable purpose and is not commercialized or removed from the public benefit.

---

**5. Purpose and Rationale**  
The primary objective of this remission is to **support public health initiatives** by enabling a non-profit organization—specifically, the Quebec Cancer Foundation—to acquire and operate a mobile clinic without the financial burden of customs duties. Such clinics serve vital roles in providing cancer screening, diagnostics, and treatment access to underserved or rural populations.  

This targeted remission reflects a broader principle in Canadian customs policy: **flexibility in duty treatment for items used in charitable, medical, or public health services**, especially when they are imported for social benefit rather than commercial gain.

---

**6. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The order is **specific and limited in scope**—applicable only to this one import and to this one organization.  
- It does not establish a general rule for future imports of mobile clinics or similar equipment.  
- It operates within the framework of **section 3 of the Customs Act**, which governs the conditions under which remissions may be granted.  
- The two-year claim window ensures accountability and timely administrative review, while the one-year non-disposal requirement protects the public interest in the continued use of the asset for its intended purpose.

It serves as a model for future remissions in similar public health or charitable contexts.
