**Detailed Summary of the Indian Economic Development Guarantee Order (SOR/72-247, SOR/74-502)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Indian Economic Development Guarantee Order* (commonly referred to as the "Guarantee Order") was introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and the Treasury Board, under **Vote L53b of the Appropriation Act No. 1, 1970**. It serves to **revise and replace** the earlier *Indian Economic Development Regulations* (Order in Council P.C. 1972-1498), which had been in place since 1972 and were amended over time.

This Order establishes a formal framework for **government-backed loan guarantees** to support the economic development of Indigenous peoples in Canada. It defines eligibility criteria, sets strict conditions for loan guarantees, establishes limits on risk exposure, and outlines procedures for claims, security, defaults, and reporting.

The Order may be cited as the *Indian Economic Development Guarantee Order*.

## **Financial Limits and Risk Controls**

### 1. **Single Loan Limit**  
- The Minister **cannot guarantee a loan exceeding $100,000** without prior approval from the **Minister of Finance**.

### 2. **Aggregate Limit (Total Exposure)**  
The Minister shall **not guarantee a loan** if, in total, the sum of the following exceeds **$500,000**:

- Principal amount of the guaranteed loan  
- Outstanding and undisbursed amounts of all other guaranteed loans under this Order  
- Outstanding and undisbursed amounts of all direct loans under Vote L53b  
- Grants, contributions, or other payments made by the Minister for Indian economic development  
- Outstanding and undisbursed amounts of loans/grants/incentives under the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion  
- All loans, grants, or development incentives made by any federal department, Crown corporation, or agency to or for the benefit of the applicant or business enterprise  

> **Exception**: If the total exceeds $500,000, the Minister may proceed **only with the approval of the Treasury Board**.

### 3. **Certification Requirement**  
If a guarantee is issued **without Treasury Board approval**, the Minister must **certify in writing** that the aggregate exposure does not exceed $500,000.

---

## **Loss Protection and Risk Sharing**

### 1. **Loss Coverage (Non-Indian Borrowers)**  
If a guaranteed loan is made **to a non-Indian, non-band, or non-Indigenous-controlled entity**, the Minister will **not guarantee more than 90% of any loss** sustained by the bank.

> This ensures that banks bear at least 10% of the risk when lending to non-Indigenous entities.

---

## **Security Requirements**

Every guaranteed loan must be secured by **one or more of the following**:

- Promissory note  
- Security under Section 88 of the *Bank Act*  
- Assignment of book debts  
- Chattel mortgage or commercial pledge  
- Mortgage or hypothecation on real property  
- Assignment of rights under an agreement for sale  
- Any other security deemed appropriate by the Minister  

> Banks must **maintain the security throughout the term** of the loan in accordance with normal banking practices.

---

## **Security Release Restrictions**

A bank **cannot release** the security taken for a guaranteed loan unless:

- The Minister **approves the release**, **or**
- The Minister of Finance originally approved the loan — in which case **both the Minister and the Minister of Finance must approve** the release.

---

## **Loan Term Modifications (Repayment Adjustments)**

### For **non-line-of-credit loans**:
If a borrower is in default or at risk of default, the bank may revise terms **with borrower consent**, including:

- Adjusting repayment periods (but **no less than annually**)  
- Extending repayment period, **provided**:
  - Extension does **not exceed one year** from original due date (without Minister approval)  
  - Extension does **not exceed 15 years** from date of guarantee approval (without Minister and Minister of Finance approval)  
  - Extension requires **Minister of Finance approval** if originally approved

### For **line-of-credit loans**:
Revisions may be made with borrower consent, **but**:

- No extension of expiry date  
- No revision of interest rate or security requirements  
- **Both Minister and Minister of Finance approval required** for any change

> These provisions ensure that modifications are tightly controlled and do not undermine the financial stability of the guarantee program.

## **Claim for Loss and Payment Process**

A bank may file a claim for loss **not less than 90 days after the entire balance becomes due and repayable**. The claim must include:

1. Unpaid principal amount  
2. Uncollected legal costs and taxes incurred in collecting the debt  
3. Earned interest:
   - At **full rate** for **180 days** after the balance becomes due, plus any justified additional period (beyond bank’s control)  
   - At **half the interest rate** thereafter  
4. Actual legal fees, disbursements, and other costs incurred in collection or protection of the Minister’s interest (only to the extent taxed or allowed by the Deputy Minister of Justice)  
5. Any other disbursements (only if approved by the Minister)

> "Loan terms" include any agreement, such as a promissory note, entered into between the bank and borrower.

### **Approval of Claims**
- A valid claim must be **approved within 60 days** of submission.  
- Payment is made **forthwith** unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon.

> **Exception**: The Minister is **not obligated to accept a claim** unless satisfied that the steps required under Section 12 (e.g., reporting of default) have been taken.

---

## **Assignment of Rights Upon Payment**

After the Minister pays a loss, the bank **must immediately execute an assignment** to the Minister of:

- All rights and powers in respect of the loan  
- Any judgment obtained in relation to the loan  
- Any security taken for repayment  

> This ensures that the government fully assumes ownership of the claim and security interests.

---

## **Partially Guaranteed Loans**

### 1. **If Minister Instructs Bank Not to Realize on Security**  
If a loan is **only partially guaranteed**, and the Minister orders the bank **not to realize on its security**, the Minister becomes **liable for the total loss** as if the loan had been fully guaranteed.

> The bank must then assign all rights in the loan upon payment.

### 2. **If Bank Cannot Realize on Security**  
If the bank cannot recover through security, it may submit a claim for the **estimated net loss**, mutually agreed upon with the Minister.

> Upon payment, the bank may either:
- Assign all rights to the Minister, or  
- Continue taking reasonable steps to realize on the security

### 3. **Recovery of Funds After Payment**  
If funds are recovered from assets or other sources **after** a claim is paid, the recovery is **divided between the Minister and the bank** in proportion to their respective shares of the net loss.

> This ensures shared benefit from recovery, reflecting the risk-sharing structure.

---

## **Default and Repayment Trigger**

If a borrower defaults on any term of the guaranteed loan, the bank must **notify the Minister within 30 days**.

> At the option of the bank and the Minister, the **entire outstanding balance becomes immediately repayable**.

---

## **Collection and Realization Steps**

Upon a loan becoming repayable, the bank must take such steps as it deems necessary, including:

- Collecting the balance through legal action or otherwise  
- Obtaining additional security  
- Realizing on existing security (
