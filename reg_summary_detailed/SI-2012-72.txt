### **Detailed Summary of the Personal Health Information Custodians in Newfoundland and Labrador Exemption Order**

#### **1. Background and Purpose**
This regulation is an **exemption order** issued under the authority of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*, specifically under **paragraph 26(2)(b)**. It establishes a legal exemption for certain organizations in **Newfoundland and Labrador** from the general provisions of PIPEDA—particularly **Part 1**—when they handle **personal health information**.

The key purpose of this Order is to **ensure that health-related information is managed in accordance with the Personal Health Information Act (PHI Act), SNL 2008, c P-7.01**, which is designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal health information in the healthcare context.

#### **2. Legal Basis**
- The Order is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 26(2)(b) of PIPEDA**, which allows for exemptions from Part 1 of PIPEDA when:
  - The personal information is governed by a **provincial law** that is **substantially similar** to PIPEDA’s privacy framework.
  - The law applies to **personal health information custodians** operating in the province.

#### **3. Key Provision: Exemption from PIPEDA**
- **Any personal health information custodian** that is subject to the **Personal Health Information Act (PHI Act)** in Newfoundland and Labrador is **exempt from the application of Part 1 of PIPEDA**.
- This exemption specifically applies to:
  - The **collection**
  - The **use**
  - The **disclosure**  
  of **personal health information** that occurs **within the province of Newfoundland and Labrador**.

#### **4. Scope of the Exemption**
- The exemption is **limited in scope** and only applies to:
  - Entities that are **personal health information custodians** as defined in the PHI Act.
  - Activities involving **personal health information** (e.g., medical records, diagnoses, treatment plans, lab results).
- The exemption does **not extend** to other types of personal information or to activities outside the health sector.
- The exemption is **not a blanket immunity**—it only applies where the PHI Act is in force and applicable.

#### **5. Substantive Similarity Between Laws**
- The regulation notes that the **PHI Act (SNL 2008, c P-7.01)** is **substantially similar** to **Part 1 of PIPEDA**.
- This similarity includes:
  - Principles of privacy and consent
  - Requirements for accountability and transparency
  - Provisions on access, disclosure, and data security
- This similarity is a **critical legal justification** for the exemption, as it demonstrates that the provincial law already provides adequate privacy protections in the health context.

#### **6. Applicability and Jurisdiction**
- The exemption applies **only in Newfoundland and Labrador**.
- It does not apply to:
  - Health information handled outside the province
  - Entities not registered or operating under the PHI Act
  - Personal information not related to health

#### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the *Statutes of Newfoundland and Labrador*.
- This means that once officially published and registered, the exemption becomes effective immediately, allowing health information custodians to operate under the provincial law rather than PIPEDA for health-related data.

#### **8. Implications and Significance**
- This Order **reinforces provincial jurisdiction** over health data privacy, allowing Newfoundland and Labrador to maintain its own privacy standards tailored to the healthcare environment.
- It **reduces regulatory burden** on health providers, hospitals, clinics, and other health-related institutions by eliminating the need to comply with PIPEDA’s more general and broad privacy rules.
- It ensures **consistency** with provincial health privacy laws while maintaining compliance with federal privacy principles where applicable (e.g., under other parts of PIPEDA or in cross-border data transfers).

#### **9. Exceptions and Limitations**
- The exemption does **not apply** to:
  - Health information that is shared outside the province or with federal institutions (where federal laws may apply).
  - Situations where the federal government or another jurisdiction requires compliance with PIPEDA.
- The exemption may be subject to **future review** or amendment based on changes in privacy standards or legislation.

### **Conclusion**
This **Personal Health Information Custodians in Newfoundland and Labrador Exemption Order** is a targeted, legally sound measure that:
- Exempts health-related organizations in the province from Part 1 of PIPEDA,
- Recognizes the adequacy and relevance of the provincial *Personal Health Information Act*,
- Supports the development of a privacy framework that is both effective and appropriate to the healthcare sector.

It reflects a **principle of regulatory proportionality**, ensuring that privacy protections are neither overly burdensome nor redundant in the health context.

**Note**: The reference to *S.C. 2000, c. 5* appears to be a typographical or contextual error in the original text. This likely refers to the **original version of PIPEDA**, which received Royal Assent in 2000 (S.C. 2000, c. 5), but is not directly relevant to the content of this specific exemption order. It may have been included by mistake or for historical context.

✅ **Final Summary in One Sentence**:
> The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, has issued an exemption under PIPEDA allowing all personal health information custodians in Newfoundland and Labrador to operate under the provincial Personal Health Information Act instead of Part 1 of PIPEDA, for the collection, use, and disclosure of health information within the province, effective upon registration.
