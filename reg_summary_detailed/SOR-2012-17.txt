**Detailed Summary of General Import Permit No. 80 — Carbon Steel**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
This General Import Permit (GIP) is issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** under two key provisions of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA):

- **Subsection 8(1.1)a** – Authorizes the issuance of general import permits for specific goods.
- **Section 10b** – Grants the Minister the power to issue permits for goods that are not subject to strict export controls but require regulatory oversight due to national security, economic, or strategic considerations.

The permit is governed by:
- **S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 108(1)** – Original enabling provision.
- **S.C. 2006, c. 13, s. 113** – Amending provision that reinforces permit authority.
- **R.S., c. E-19** – The Export and Import Permits Act.

**Date of Issuance:** February 20, 2012  
**Issuing Authority:** Government of Canada, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (now part of Global Affairs Canada).

### **2. Scope of the Permit**
**Permit Number:** GIP80 — Carbon Steel  
**Applicable Goods:** Any carbon steel products that are listed in **Item 80 of the Import Control List**.

> This means that any resident of Canada may legally import **carbon steel goods** (in any form) without requiring a specific import permit, as long as the goods fall under this general permit.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
- **Country of Melt and Pour:**  
  This is a critical definition used in determining the origin of the steel. It refers to:
  - The country where the **raw steel** is first produced in a **liquid state** in a steel-making furnace.
  - Then, it is **poured into its first solid state**, which may be:
    - A **semi-finished product** (e.g., slab, billet, or ingot), or
    - A **finished steel mill product** (e.g., sheet, bar, beam).
  
  This is distinct from the "country of origin" (which may refer to where the final product is assembled or processed).

### **4. Import Obligations for Residents of Canada**
Any Canadian resident importing goods under this permit must comply with the following requirements:

#### **(a) Accounting Requirement**
- If the imported goods are subject to **accounting under Section 32 of the Customs Act**, the importer must:
  - Include the statement **"GIP80"** or **"LGI80"** (where "LGI" stands for "Listed General Import") in the prescribed accounting form.
  - This ensures traceability and transparency in the movement of goods under the permit.

#### **(b) Record Retention and Availability**
Importers must retain and make available specific documents and records for **six years** after the year of import. These include:
1. Name and address of the importer or consignee  
2. Proof of Canadian residency  
3. Date of entry into Canada  
4. Quantity of goods (in kilograms)  
5. Country from which goods are imported  
6. Country of origin of goods  
7. Shipping document showing **freight and other transportation costs separately**  
8. Tariff classification (as per the *List of Tariff Provisions* in the schedule to the *Customs Tariff*)  
9. Import value in **Canadian dollars**  
10. Detailed description of the goods  
11. **Country of melt and pour** (required under the permit)

> These records are essential for customs audits, compliance checks, and origin verification.

#### **(c) Compliance with Inspection Requests**
- Within **10 days** of receiving a written request from the **Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD)**, the importer must:
  - Provide all relevant documents and records for the specified import period.
- At **all reasonable times**, the importer must:

  - Provide **all reasonable assistance** to facilitate inspections.

#### **(d) Timely Submission for Determinations**
- Must provide documents and records to the Department within the time frame specified by the Department to support determinations on:
  - Country of origin
  - Country of melt and pour
  - Import value
  - Quantity of imported carbon steel products

#### **(e) Disclosure at Time of Import**
- At the time of entry into Canada, the importer must **specify the country of melt and pour** in the form and manner established by the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**.

### **5. Exemptions from Certain Provisions**
Two important exemptions apply:

#### **Exemption from Section 2 and Paragraph 3(d) of the Accounting Regulations**
- **Section 2** and **paragraph 3(d)** of the *Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations* do **not apply** to a **CSA importer** (defined in section 2 of the regulations) when goods are released under **paragraph 32(2)(b)** of the *Customs Act*.

> This means that importers who are subject to the "CSA (Canadian Standards Association)" or similar compliance frameworks may be exempt from certain accounting and reporting obligations when goods are released under specific customs procedures (e.g., under a simplified release regime).

#### **Exemption from Paragraph 3(d) (for certain types of carbon steel products)**
Paragraph 3(d) of the regulations — which typically requires detailed accounting and reporting — **does not apply** if the imported goods are:
- Cold-formed or cold-finished angles, shapes, or sections  
- Welded angles, shapes, or sections  
- Switch blades, crossing frogs, point rods, or other railway/tramway track components  
- Structural components such as:
  - Structures, structural plates, rods, angles, shapes, sections, tubes, or similar  
- Stranded wire, ropes, cables (non-electrically insulated)  
- Barbed wires or fencing wires  
- Wire nails, tacks, pins, staples, or similar items  

> These goods are **exempt from full accounting and reporting obligations** under this permit, provided they meet the above categories and are valued at or below certain thresholds.

#### **Value Threshold Exemption**
- If the **total duty value** of the imported goods does **not exceed $5,000 CAD**, the importer is **exempt from the full accounting requirements** under paragraph 3(d), regardless of product type.

### **6. Purpose and Strategic Rationale**
This General Import Permit serves several key regulatory and economic functions:

- **Facilitates Trade:** Enables Canadian businesses to import carbon steel products without needing individual permits, streamlining trade for essential industrial materials.
- **Ensures Traceability:** Requires detailed documentation to track the **origin of raw materials** (specifically, the country of melt and pour), which supports:
  - Supply chain transparency
  - National security assessments
  - Compliance with international trade agreements
- **Supports Regulatory Oversight:** Allows the Department of Foreign Affairs and the CBSA to monitor the flow of strategic materials and verify compliance with Canadian trade policies.
- **Protects Against Misuse:** The requirement to disclose country of melt and pour helps prevent the use of foreign steel in sensitive applications (e.g., defense, infrastructure) without proper oversight.
