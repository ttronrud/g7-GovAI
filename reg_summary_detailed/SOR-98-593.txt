The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2008-50, s. 6]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **Regulation SOR/2008-50, section 6**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  This means the regulation no longer exists or is no longer in force. It has been formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent legislative or regulatory action.

- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  **SOR/2008-50** (Supplemental to the Regulations of the Government of Canada, 2008, No. 50)  
  This is a statutory instrument that amends or removes certain provisions from existing regulations. In this case, **Section 6** of SOR/2008-50 specifically repeals a prior regulation.

- **Section 6 of SOR/2008-50**:  
  While the exact text of the repealed regulation is not provided, Section 6 of SOR/2008-50 would have contained the legal language that formally cancels or replaces an earlier rule. The repealing section typically includes:
  - The name or reference of the regulation being repealed
  - The effective date of repeal
  - A statement of intent (e.g., to modernize, simplify, or align with new policy)

- **Implications of Repeal**:
  - Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures established by the repealed regulation are no longer enforceable.
  - Entities or individuals previously governed by that regulation must now comply with the current, updated, or alternative regulatory framework.
  - The repeal may reflect changes in policy, administrative efficiency, or alignment with broader legislative reforms.

- **Why Was It Repealed?**  
  Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation no longer applies to current practices)
  - Inconsistency with newer laws or policies
  - Duplication or overlap with other regulations
  - Improved clarity or efficiency through consolidation

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced is **no longer in effect**. It was officially repealed by **Section 6 of SOR/2008-50**, which was published in the Canada Gazette and became effective on the date specified in that regulation. As such, **no further legal or administrative action is required under this repealed provision**. Legal or regulatory practitioners should consult the current version of the relevant regulation or the official government database (such as CanLII or the Canada Gazette) to determine the current applicable rules.

> **Note**: Without the original text of the repealed regulation, a full summary of its content cannot be provided. To understand the substance of what was repealed, one would need to consult the prior version of the regulation before SOR/2008-50. However, the status — being repealed — is clearly established.
