**Detailed Summary of the Senate Sessional Allowance (Deductions for Non-attendance) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Senate Sessional Allowance (Deductions for Non-attendance) Regulations were enacted by the Senate of Canada on June 9, 1998, pursuant to **Section 59 of the Parliament of Canada Act**. This section grants the Senate the authority to make regulations concerning the administration of its sessional allowances, including provisions related to attendance and financial deductions.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish a clear and enforceable mechanism for deducting amounts from a senator’s sessional allowance when they fail to attend Senate sittings. This measure aims to encourage regular attendance and ensure that senators fulfill their duties as members of the legislative body.

**Key Provision:**  
Under the regulations, the deduction from a senator’s sessional allowance for each day of non-attendance is increased to **$250 per day** for every sitting day beyond **twenty-one** days of absence.  

- A senator’s sessional allowance is subject to a daily deduction under **subsection 57(1) of the Parliament of Canada Act**.  
- Prior to this regulation, the amount deducted for non-attendance may have been lower or subject to different thresholds.  
- The new rule applies only to days when the senator fails to attend a sitting of the Senate after the initial twenty-one days of absence.  
- The $250 deduction is applied **per day** of non-attendance beyond the first twenty-one days of absence.  
  - For example, if a senator misses 25 sitting days, the first 21 days are not subject to deduction, but the remaining 4 days (25 – 21) would each incur a $250 deduction, resulting in a total deduction of $1,000 (4 × $250).

**Effective Date:**  
These regulations came into force on **July 1, 1998**. This means that the new deduction rate of $250 per day for non-attendance beyond twenty-one days of absence became applicable to all senators from that date onward.

**Implications and Context:**  
- The regulation reflects a policy shift toward greater accountability and participation in Senate proceedings.  
- It serves as a financial incentive for senators to attend regular sessions, thereby supporting the effective functioning of the Senate.  
- The threshold of twenty-one days suggests a reasonable allowance for occasional absences due to personal or medical reasons, while imposing a financial penalty for prolonged absence.  
- The amount of $250 per day is significant and indicates a strong emphasis on attendance, though it may also be subject to review in light of changing circumstances or senatorial responsibilities.

**Conclusion:**  
The Senate Sessional Allowance (Deductions for Non-attendance) Regulations of 1998 introduce a more stringent financial penalty for senators who fail to attend Senate sittings, with a $250 daily deduction applied to each day of absence beyond twenty-one days. These regulations were enacted to promote regular participation in legislative activities and ensure that senators remain actively engaged in the operations of the Senate. They took effect on July 1, 1998, and remain a component of the financial framework governing senatorial conduct and attendance.
