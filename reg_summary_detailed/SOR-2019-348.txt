**Detailed Summary of the *Circumstances for Excluding Periods from Time Limits Regulations* (S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 10)**  
*Issued by the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER), Calgary, November 25, 2019*

---

### **Overview**

The *Circumstances for Excluding Periods from Time Limits Regulations* are a set of rules established under sections 216, 291.1, and 312.1 of the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (the "Act"). These regulations provide specific circumstances under which certain time limits imposed on applicants by the CER may be excluded from the calculation of deadlines—particularly in relation to reporting requirements, application processing, and authorization decisions.

These exclusions are intended to ensure fairness and practicality in regulatory processes, allowing for reasonable extensions when applicants face unforeseen challenges such as insufficient data or outstanding financial obligations.

The regulations came into force on **December 2, 2019**, following the enactment of the *Impact Assessment Act* and the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (S.C. 2019, c. 28), and apply to a range of regulatory procedures involving pipeline and power line projects.

### **Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined for clarity and application throughout the regulations:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act*.
- **Applicant**: Any person or entity that has submitted:
  - A certificate application under subsection 182(1) of the Act (e.g., for pipeline operations);
  - An order application under subsection 214(1) of the Act (e.g., for operational changes);
  - A certificate application under subsection 262(1) of the Act (e.g., for interprovincial or international power lines);
  - An authorization application under subsection 298(1) of the Act (e.g., for proposed work or activities).
- **Commission**: Refers to the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER), as defined in section 26 of the Act.

## **Core Provisions: When Can Time Limits Be Excluded?**

The regulations outline **three distinct circumstances** under which periods may be excluded from time limits. These are divided into two main categories based on the type of application or proceeding.

---

### **1. Exclusion of Time Limits in Reporting and Order Proceedings (Sections 183 and 214 of the Act)**

For applications related to:
- Submission of a **report under subsection 183(1)** (e.g., regarding pipeline design, construction, or operation changes), or
- The issuance of an **order under subsection 214(1)** (e.g., for operational or safety modifications),

a period may be excluded if **any of the following conditions apply**:

#### **(a) Written Request by the Applicant**
- The applicant must submit a **formal written request** to the Commission seeking to exclude a period from the time limit.
- This request must be clearly directed at the specific time limit tied to the report or order.

> *Purpose*: Allows applicants to formally justify delays and seek relief from strict deadlines.

#### **(b) Insufficient Information for Assessment**
- If the applicant has undertaken **studies or collected information** about a change in:
  - Design, construction, or operation of a pipeline,
  - And the resulting effects of that change,
- And the Commission determines that **there is insufficient information available** to properly assess the report or make an order,
- Then the Commission may exclude the time period during which the information was being gathered.

> *Purpose*: Prevents the Commission from making decisions based on incomplete or inadequate data. It recognizes that gathering technical data can take time and may not be feasible within strict deadlines.

#### **(c) Failure to Pay Fees, Levies, or Charges**
- If the applicant has **not paid**:
  - Fees, levies, or charges under **section 87 of the Act**, or
  - Any interest due on those fees under regulations made under subsection 87(1),
- Then the time limit may be excluded.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that applicants who are financially non-compliant do not face undue pressure to meet deadlines while still in arrears. It promotes financial accountability without penalizing applicants who are actively working on compliance.

### **2. Exclusion of Time Limits in Certificate and Authorization Proceedings (Sections 262 and 298 of the Act)**

For applications related to:
- A **certificate under subsection 262(1)** (e.g., for interprovincial or international power lines), or
- An **authorization under subsection 298(1)** (e.g., for proposed work or activities),

a period may be excluded if **any of the following conditions apply**:

#### **(a) Written Request by the Applicant**
- The applicant must submit a **formal written request** to the Commission for the exclusion of a period from the time limit related to the certificate or authorization application.

> *Purpose*: Same as in reporting/order cases — provides a formal mechanism for applicants to explain delays.

#### **(b) Insufficient Information for Decision-Making**
- If the applicant has conducted **studies or collected information** about:
  - A change in the design, construction, or operation of an **international or interprovincial power line** (under subsection 262(1)), or
  - A **proposed work or activity** (under subsection 298(1)),
- And the Commission determines that **there is insufficient information** to issue the certificate or authorization,
- Then the time period required for data collection may be excluded.

> *Purpose*: Recognizes the complexity of assessing power line impacts and the need for thorough environmental, technical, or safety evaluations. Prevents rushed or flawed decisions due to data gaps.

#### **(c) Failure to Pay Fees, Levies, or Charges**
- If the applicant has **not paid** fees, levies, or charges under section 87 of the Act, or any interest due under regulations under subsection 87(1),
- Then the time limit may be excluded.

> *Purpose*: Financial compliance is a prerequisite for fair regulatory processing. This provision ensures that applicants are not penalized for non-payment while still progressing through the application process.

## **General Principles and Implications**

### **Flexibility and Fairness**
- The regulations introduce **flexibility** into the regulatory timeline by allowing exclusions in cases of:
  - Genuine data collection challenges,
  - Financial non-compliance,
  - Formal requests for extension.
- This supports **practical decision-making** by the Commission and prevents unjust delays or denials due to unforeseen circumstances.

### **Accountability and Compliance**
- The requirement for **written requests** ensures transparency and accountability. Applicants must clearly articulate their reasons for seeking an extension.
- The **financial obligation** clause ties time limits to compliance with fees — a mechanism to ensure that applicants take responsibility for their regulatory costs.

### **Data-Driven Decision-Making**
- The inclusion of "insufficient information" as a valid reason for exclusion emphasizes the importance of **technical accuracy and completeness** in regulatory decisions. It protects both the public interest and the integrity of the CER’s assessment process.

---

## **Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The regulations come into force on **December 2, 2019**, which is the date the *Canadian Energy Regulator Act* (S.C. 2019, c. 28) came into effect.
- If the regulations are **registered later than December 2, 2019**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> *Note*: This ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely and consistent manner with the broader legislative framework.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Circumstances for Excluding Periods from Time Limits Regulations* serve as a critical tool for balancing **regulatory efficiency** with **practical realities** in energy project development. By allowing for the exclusion of time periods in specific, well-defined circumstances—such as data collection delays or unpaid fees—the CER ensures that:

- Decision-making is based on sufficient and reliable information,
- Applicants are not unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond their control,
- Financial obligations are recognized as part of the regulatory process,
- And the overall integrity of the approval and reporting processes is maintained.

These provisions reflect a modern, responsive, and equitable approach to energy regulation in Canada.
