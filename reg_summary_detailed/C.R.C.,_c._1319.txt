- **Customs duties** (including import duty)
- **Consumption or sales tax** (under the Excise Tax Act)

on the following categories of goods:

1. **Printed matter**

---

### **2. Legal Basis**

The exemption is granted under:
- The **Customs Tariff**  
- The **Excise Tax Act (Part XIII)**

This means the exemption applies to both **import duties** and **domestic sales/consumption taxes** on the specified goods.

### **3. Conditions for Exemption**

#### **A. For Imported Goods (Customs Duty Exemption)**

To qualify for exemption upon import, the **customs entry (B.1 form)** must bear a certificate that clearly states one of the following:

1. **The importer is a senior executive officer of UNESCO**, or  
2. **The importer is a duly authorized agent of UNESCO**, and  
   - The printed matter, publications, or articles have been **bona fide printed, published, or issued** by or on behalf of UNESCO, **or**  
   - The articles and materials are intended to be used **exclusively in the production** of printed matter or official publications of UNESCO.

> **Key Point:** The certificate must be clearly visible on the face of the customs entry. Without it, the exemption does not apply.

#### **B. For Purchased Goods (Sales Tax Exemption)**

When goods are **purchased in Canada** (not imported), the exemption from **sales tax** applies **only if**:

- The purchaser is either:
  - A **senior executive officer** of UNESCO, or  
  - A **duly authorized agent** of UNESCO,  
- And the purchaser includes a **certificate signed by them** stating that:
  - The transaction is to be paid **from the funds of UNESCO**, and  
  - The exemption is **properly allowable** under this Order.

> **Key Point:** The certificate must be **included with the purchase order** and signed by the responsible officer or agent. It must explicitly confirm the source of funds and the legitimacy of the exemption.

---

### **4. Exempted Activities**

The exemption applies to:
- **Production of printed matter and official publications**  
- **Free distribution** of such materials  
- **Sales** (if the proceeds are used to support UNESCO operations)

This means that even if the goods are sold, the exemption applies **as long as the proceeds are used by or for UNESCO**, and the goods are part of its official activities.

---

### **5. Compliance and Enforcement**

- The exemption is **conditional** and **subject to strict compliance** with the certificate requirements.
- The **certificate must be genuine, signed, and clearly stated**.
- Authorities in Canada (e.g., Customs and Revenue Canada) may verify the authenticity of the certificate and the legitimacy of the organization’s involvement.
- Any failure to provide the required certificate or to demonstrate bona fide use will result in **non-exemption** and potential taxation.

---

### **6. Significance and Purpose**

This Order was established in the context of **post-World War II international cooperation**, recognizing UNESCO’s role in promoting:
- Education  
- Science  
- Culture  
- International understanding

By exempting its printed materials and production-related supplies from import and sales taxes, Canada supports UNESCO’s mission by:
- Reducing financial barriers to international cultural and educational exchange  
- Encouraging the free flow of knowledge and information  
- Promoting multilateral cooperation through reduced administrative and fiscal burdens

---

### **Conclusion**

The **UNESCO Remission Order** is a targeted regulatory provision that allows **full tax exemption** for certain goods used in the production and distribution of UNESCO materials when imported or purchased in Canada. It is **not a general exemption** but is strictly limited to:
- Goods directly related to UNESCO’s official publications and production
- Transactions conducted by authorized officials or agents
- Documentation (certificates) that confirm the legitimacy and purpose of the transaction

This Order remains a **historical and policy-based tool** to support international organizations in fulfilling their educational and cultural missions without undue fiscal burdens.
