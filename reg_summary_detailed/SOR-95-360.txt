**Detailed Summary of the "Printed Material for Foreign Carriers Remission Order, 1995"**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Context**

This regulation was issued under the authority of **section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (*R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*), which empowers the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to make orders relating to the remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of customs duties and excise taxes on specific goods.

The purpose of this Order is to **grant a remission of excise tax** on certain printed materials imported into Canada by foreign airlines, specifically for use in promoting and operating their air services. This measure aims to ensure **fair competition** between Canadian and foreign airlines by providing a level playing field—particularly in areas where foreign carriers enjoy similar privileges in their home countries.

### **4. Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies to the **excise tax imposed under Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** on printed materials imported into Canada **by or on behalf of a foreign carrier** for **exclusive use in promoting and operating air services**.

#### **Eligible Printed Materials (as listed in the schedule)**

The following categories of printed material are included:

- **Promotional and informational materials**:
  - Folders, brochures, advertising calendars, maps, posters, tour shells, displays  
  - Window transparencies (decals), signs, placards  
  - Unframed photographs  

- **Operational and pricing documents**:
  - Price lists, tariffs, bulletins, manuals, tariff publications  
  - Time tables  
  - Ticket forms, miscellaneous charge orders, air waybills  

- **Baggage and cargo labeling**:
  - Baggage tags, tapes, and labels  
  - Cargo tags, tapes, and labels  

- **Administrative and communication tools**:
  - Printed blank forms, envelopes, postcards, letterheads

### **5. Key Condition for Remission**

The remission is **conditional** on the following requirement:

> At the time of importation, the **country of registration of the foreign carrier must grant a similar privilege to Canadian carriers**.

#### **What does "similar privilege" mean?**

This condition ensures **reciprocity**. For example:
- If a U.S. airline is allowed to distribute promotional materials in Canada, then Canadian airlines must be allowed to do the same in the U.S.
- This prevents Canada from granting a tax advantage to foreign carriers without ensuring that Canadian carriers receive equivalent benefits in their home markets.

This provision is designed to **promote fair trade practices** and **prevent unfair competitive advantages** in the aviation sector.

---

### **6. Purpose and Policy Rationale**

- **Fair Competition**: By allowing foreign carriers to import promotional materials tax-free (under reciprocal conditions), the government ensures that Canadian carriers are not at a disadvantage when competing in international markets.
  
- **Reciprocity Principle**: The rule enforces symmetry—foreign carriers receive tax relief only if Canadian carriers receive equivalent treatment in their home countries.

- **Support for Airline Operations**: The materials are essential for marketing, customer service, and operational efficiency. Exempting them from excise tax reduces operational costs for foreign airlines.

- **Alignment with International Practices**: The policy reflects a broader international trend of recognizing the need for equitable treatment in cross-border aviation services.

---

### **7. Legal and Financial Implications**

- **Tax Relief**: The excise tax imposed under **Division III of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** (which covers excise taxes on printed materials) is **waived** for qualifying imports.
- **Customs Duty**: While the regulation specifically addresses excise tax, it does not mention customs duties. Therefore, customs duties may still apply, unless otherwise specified.
- **Compliance Requirement**: Importers must ensure that:
  - The materials are imported **for air service promotion and operation**.
  - The foreign carrier is registered abroad.
  - The home country of the carrier grants **equivalent privileges** to Canadian carriers.

---

### **8. Exclusions and Limitations**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Materials used for non-airline purposes.
  - Materials sold for commercial resale or profit.
  - Materials imported for personal or non-promotional use.

- The remission **does not extend** to Canadian carriers or to materials imported by Canadian airlines.

- The exemption is **not automatic**—it depends on verification of reciprocity at the time of importation.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The responsibility for ensuring compliance lies with:
  - **Customs and Revenue Canada** (for import documentation and verification).
  - **The Minister of Finance** (for oversight and interpretation of the reciprocity requirement).

- Importers must provide documentation proving:
  - The nature of the printed material.
  - The purpose of importation (promotion/operation of air services).
  - The foreign carrier's registration.
  - Evidence that the country of registration grants similar privileges to Canadian carriers.

---

### **10. Historical and Contextual Background**

- This Order was introduced in **1995** during a period of increased international air travel and competition in the aviation sector.
- It reflects Canada’s efforts to balance **economic competitiveness** with **protectionist concerns** in international trade.
- It is part of a broader regulatory framework under the **Excise Tax Act** and the **Customs Tariff**, which govern the taxation and movement of goods.

### **Conclusion**

The *Printed Material for Foreign Carriers Remission Order, 1995* is a targeted, reciprocal tax exemption designed to:

✅ Support the operational and promotional needs of foreign airlines in Canada  
✅ Ensure fair competition by enforcing reciprocity with Canadian carriers  
✅ Maintain compliance with international trade principles  

It operates under strict conditions—particularly the requirement that foreign carriers’ home countries offer equivalent privileges to Canadian carriers—ensuring that the exemption is not used as a tool for unfair advantage.

This regulation remains a key example of how Canadian tax policy can promote international fairness in service industries while maintaining fiscal discipline.
