The regulation you have provided is a formal government notice issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically referencing the recognition and acknowledgment of a scientific assessment by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Notice of Receipt of COSEWIC Assessment under Section 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act

**Source:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment

**Key Provision:**  
The regulation acknowledges the receipt of a scientific assessment conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) regarding specific species listed in the annexed schedule. This assessment was prepared in accordance with subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA).

---

**Background and Context:**

- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) was enacted in 2002 to protect wildlife species at risk of extinction in Canada.
- Under Section 23(1) of SARA, the Minister of the Environment is required to consider a scientific assessment from COSEWIC when determining whether a species should be listed as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern."
- COSEWIC is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species and providing recommendations to the federal government on their conservation status.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

This regulation serves as an official notification that the federal government has received and recognized the COSEWIC assessment for a specific list of species. It is not a decision to list or delist a species, but rather a procedural step that confirms the government has reviewed and accepted the scientific evaluation.

---

**Key Elements:**

1. **Acknowledgment of Assessment:**  
   The government formally acknowledges receipt of the COSEWIC assessment, which includes scientific data, population trends, threats, and habitat information for the species in the annexed schedule.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The assessment is required under subsection 23(1) of SARA, which mandates that the Minister of the Environment consider COSEWIC’s status assessments when making decisions about species at risk.

3. **Annexed Schedule:**  
   The regulation references a schedule (not included in the excerpt) that lists the specific species subject to the assessment. These species are typically those that have been evaluated by COSEWIC for potential listing under SARA.

4. **Procedural Role:**  
   This step is part of the formal process leading to potential listing or reclassification of species. After receiving the assessment, the Minister may proceed with a formal listing decision, which may result in the species being added to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk*.

5. **Scientific Integrity:**  
   The regulation underscores the importance of relying on independent, peer-reviewed scientific input (from COSEWIC) in conservation decisions, ensuring that policy is grounded in evidence.

---

**Implications:**

- The acknowledgment of the assessment initiates the next phase of the SARA process, which may include public consultation, further study, and a final listing decision.
- It signals government commitment to science-based conservation and transparency in species management.
- It may lead to the implementation of recovery strategies, habitat protection measures, or other conservation actions under SARA.

**Note on Timing:**  
This regulation was issued in 2002, during the early years of SARA’s implementation. It reflects the foundational role of COSEWIC in shaping Canada’s species conservation policy.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and formal acknowledgment by the Government of Canada that it has received and accepted a scientifically sound assessment of the status of certain wildlife species from COSEWIC. It marks a critical step in the process of determining whether these species are at risk and require federal protection under the *Species at Risk Act*. While it does not itself list the species, it is a necessary precursor to any formal designation or conservation action.

This summary reflects the legal, procedural, and scientific significance of the regulation within the framework of Canada’s wildlife conservation policy.
