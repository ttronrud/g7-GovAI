## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Canada–United Kingdom Social Security Proclamation (1995)**

### 🔹 **Proclamation Background and Legal Authority**

This document is a formal **Proclamation issued by the Governor General of Canada**, on **November 20, 1995**, under the authority of the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet), following the approval of the **Consolidated Arrangements on Social Security** between Canada and the United Kingdom.

- **Legal Basis**: The proclamation is grounded in **Order in Council P.C. 1995-139**, which declared that the Consolidated Arrangements would enter into force once all necessary conditions were met.
- **Parliamentary Process**: The Order was laid before Parliament on **February 15, 1995**. No motion to revoke it was introduced before the 20th sitting day. Therefore, by **subsection 42(2) of the Old Age Security Act**, it came into force on the **30th sitting day**, which was **April 3, 1995**.
- However, the **actual effective date** of the arrangements was later confirmed through **ratification exchanges on September 29, 1995**, which specified that the arrangements would take effect on **December 1, 1995**.
- The final proclamation (P.C. 1995-1827) issued on **October 31, 1995**, officially **gives notice** that the Consolidated Arrangements are now in force as of **December 1, 1995**.

> ✅ **Key Point**: Although the Order came into force in April 1995, the **operational date** of the new social security arrangements is **December 1, 1995**.

### 🔹 **Key Objective of the Arrangements**

The primary goal of this Proclamation is to:

- **Replace outdated bilateral agreements** (the "former exchanges of letters") governing social security benefits between Canada and the UK.
- **Establish a modern, unified framework** for the mutual recognition and calculation of social security benefits (such as retirement pensions, unemployment benefits, and child benefits).
- **Ensure fairness and consistency** in how residency, work history, and contribution records are treated across borders.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The **former exchanges of letters** (from 1959, 1961, 1973, and 1977) **cease to have effect on December 1, 1995**, **except** for claims approved under those arrangements **before that date**.
