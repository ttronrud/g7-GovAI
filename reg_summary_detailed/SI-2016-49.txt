The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Issuing Authority:**  
   The Order is made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment. This reflects the constitutional and administrative structure of Canadian federal legislation, where the Governor General (as the representative of the Crown) issues Orders in Council based on ministerial recommendations.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The Order is grounded in **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA). This subsection requires that the Minister of the Environment, upon receiving assessments from the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), may designate species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" based on those scientific assessments.

3. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   The primary purpose of this Order is to **acknowledge receipt** of the scientific assessments conducted by COSEWIC for specific species listed in the annexed schedule. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of wildlife species based on criteria such as population size, distribution, threats, and trends.

4. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species at risk in Canada. Its evaluations are critical in informing federal policy and conservation decisions under SARA. This Order recognizes that COSEWIC has completed and submitted its formal assessments for the species in question.

5. **Content of the Annexed Schedule:**  
   The Order references a schedule (not included in the text) that lists the specific species for which COSEWIC assessments have been completed. These species are then formally recognized as being under review or at risk, and their status may be used to trigger further actions under SARA, such as development of recovery strategies, habitat protection, or legal protections.

6. **Timing and Effect:**  
   The Order is effective upon its making. The acknowledgment of receipt of these assessments marks a key procedural step in the SARA process. It establishes that the federal government has formally received and accepted the scientific basis for designating certain species as at risk, which may lead to the next phase of action—such as listing the species under SARA and implementing conservation measures.

7. **Implications:**  
   - The Order initiates or confirms the pathway toward formal listing of species under SARA.  
   - It provides legal authority for the Minister to proceed with designating species as endangered, threatened, or special concern.  
   - It supports transparency and accountability by documenting the scientific foundation of conservation decisions.  
   - It ensures that conservation actions are based on up-to-date, peer-reviewed scientific data.

**Context and Significance:**

This Order is part of Canada’s ongoing effort to protect biodiversity and prevent species extinction. By formally recognizing COSEWIC assessments, the federal government demonstrates its commitment to science-based conservation policy. It also underscores the importance of intergovernmental and scientific collaboration in environmental governance.

Such orders are typically followed by further regulatory steps, including:
- The formal listing of species under SARA.
- The development of recovery strategies and action plans.
- The implementation of measures to protect habitats and reduce threats.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a procedural but essential step in Canada’s species at risk protection framework. It confirms that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific assessments of specific wildlife species from COSEWIC, thereby laying the groundwork for potential formal designation under the *Species at Risk Act*. It reflects the integration of science and policy in environmental protection and highlights Canada’s commitment to conserving its biodiversity.
