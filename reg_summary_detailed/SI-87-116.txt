### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for the remission, the following **conditions must be met**:

   An application for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date the domestic spirits are destroyed.

2. **Nature of the Spirits**  
   The spirits must be **unfit for human consumption**. This implies they are unsafe, spoiled, contaminated, or otherwise unsuitable for drinking.

3. **Quantification Requirement**  
   The application must clearly specify the **quantity** of spirits for which remission is sought.  
   - This quantity must be determined by the **distiller** under the **supervision of an excise officer**.  
   - Ensures accuracy, accountability, and compliance with official standards.

4. **Approved Destruction Method**  
   The destruction of the spirits must occur in a manner **approved by the Minister**.  
   - This ensures that the disposal is safe, environmentally sound, and compliant with public health and safety regulations.  
   - Examples may include incineration, rendering, or other approved methods.

5. **Supporting Evidence**

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The Order is authorized under **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on ministerial advice) to make regulations related to the administration of excise duties.
- The regulation is grounded in **section 135 of the Excise Act**, which provides the legal basis for the destruction of unfit spirits and the potential for duty remission.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council makes this order **"in the public interest"**, indicating that:
- It supports responsible alcohol production and distribution.
- It prevents unnecessary financial burdens on producers when products are unsalable due to quality or safety issues.

### **Key Implications and Practical Effects**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Financial Relief** | Distillers and agencies avoid paying excise duty on spirits destroyed due to unfitness. |
| **Compliance Requirements** | Strict documentation and oversight required (e.g., excise officer supervision, evidence of unfit condition). |
| **Time Limit** | Applications must be filed within **two years** of destruction—failure to do so results in loss of entitlement. |
| **Provincial Involvement** | Provincial agencies (agencies) are included in the scope, meaning they may also be eligible if they destroy spirits under provincial authority. |
| **Exclusions** | Beer and malt liquor are explicitly excluded from the definition of domestic spirits. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Domestic Spirits Destroyed Remission Order** is a targeted fiscal regulation designed to:
- Provide **financial relief** to distillers and provincial agencies when spirits are destroyed due to being unfit for human consumption,
- Ensure **transparency, accountability, and safety** through strict procedural requirements,
- Promote **public health and environmental responsibility** by mandating approved destruction methods.

It reflects a balanced approach—supporting industry operations while maintaining regulatory oversight and public interest safeguards.

**Note:** While this regulation was issued in the 1980s, its principles may still be relevant today, especially in the context of quality control, waste management, and excise policy. Modern applications would likely involve updated standards for "unfitness" (e.g., contamination, microbial growth) and digital record-keeping.
