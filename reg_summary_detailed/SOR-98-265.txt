**Detailed Summary of Regulation: General Export Permit No. 38 – CWC Toxic Chemical and Precursor Mixtures**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Regulatory Basis**: This permit is issued under **subsection 7(1.1)a of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**.
- **Issuing Authority**: The **Minister of Foreign Affairs** of Canada.
- **Date of Issuance**: April 23, 1998.

### **2. Purpose of the Permit**
The purpose of **General Export Permit No. 38 (GEP-38)** is to authorize the **export of specific mixtures containing CWC (Chemical Weapons Convention) toxic chemicals and precursors**, subject to strict conditions and limitations.

---

### **3. Definitions**
Key terms used in the permit are defined as follows:
- **CWC toxic chemicals and precursors**: Refers to goods listed in **Group 7 of the Schedule to the Export Control List** and specifically described in **items 7-3.3 to 7-3.6 of the Guide**.
  - The *Guide* provides detailed descriptions and classifications of substances under the Export Control List.
  - These substances are categorized as **toxic chemicals or precursors** that could be used in the development of chemical weapons, thus requiring controlled export.
- **Export Controls Division (ECD)**: The Canadian government body responsible for administering export controls. It is part of the **Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFIT)**.
- **Guide**: Has the same meaning as defined in **Section 1 of the Export Control List**, which serves as a reference document for identifying and classifying controlled items.

### **4. Scope of Authorization**
This permit authorizes Canadian residents to export **mixtures of CWC toxic chemicals and precursors**, but **only under the following conditions**:

#### ✅ Permitted Exports:
- **Mixtures containing less than 10% by weight** of any CWC toxic chemical or precursor listed in:
  - **Item 7-3.3** of the Guide  
  - **Item 7-3.4** of the Guide  
- **Mixtures containing less than 25% by weight** of any CWC toxic chemical or precursor listed in:
  - **Item 7-3.5** of the Guide  
  - **Item 7-3.6** of the Guide  

> Note: The percentage thresholds differ based on the specific item in the Guide, reflecting varying levels of risk or sensitivity.

#### ❌ Prohibited Exports:
- **No exports are allowed to:**
  - Countries listed on the **Area Control List (ACL)** — these are designated countries or regions deemed high-risk due to proliferation concerns.
  - **Iraq** or **North Korea** — both of which are subject to international sanctions and restrictions due to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

### **5. Conditions of the Permit**
The permit includes several mandatory compliance requirements:

#### (a) Recordkeeping Requirement
- The **exporter must retain all documentation** related to each export made under this permit at their **place of business or residence**.
- These records must be kept for a period of **six years** after the date of export.

#### (b) Availability to Authorities
- The exporter must be able to **provide the documents upon request** to an officer of the **Export Controls Division (ECD)**.

#### (c) Reporting Requirement (Customs Act)
- If the mixture of CWC toxic chemicals and precursors is required to be reported under the **Customs Act**, the exporter must:
  - Insert the phrase **“GEP-38”** or **“LGE-38”** (depending on language — "GEP" = General Export Permit; "LGE" = Liste Générale d’Exportation) in the appropriate field of the prescribed form.

> This ensures traceability and transparency in international trade involving sensitive chemicals.

### **6. Effective Date**
- The permit **comes into force on April 23, 1998**, the date of issuance.

---

### **7. Strategic Context and Policy Rationale**
- This permit reflects Canada’s commitment to:
  - **Complying with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**, which bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.
  - **Preventing the proliferation** of toxic chemicals and their precursors to states or entities that could misuse them for illicit or weapons-related purposes.
- By setting **specific concentration thresholds** (10% and 25%), the permit balances legitimate industrial or research needs with the need to prevent the flow of materials that could be used in chemical weapon programs.
- The exclusion of **Iraq and North Korea** aligns with international non-proliferation policies and sanctions imposed due to past or ongoing violations of arms control regimes.

### **Conclusion**
General Export Permit No. 38 is a targeted, risk-based authorization that enables the lawful export of certain low-concentration mixtures of CWC-related toxic chemicals and precursors. It operates within a broader framework of international non-proliferation obligations, ensuring that Canada maintains strict controls over materials that could contribute to chemical weapons development. The permit strikes a balance between facilitating legitimate trade and safeguarding global security through clear thresholds, prohibitions, and compliance obligations.

This regulation remains a key tool in Canada’s export control policy, particularly in the context of chemical weapons proliferation and international arms control.
