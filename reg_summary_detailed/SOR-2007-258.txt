## **Eligible Financial Contracts – Prescribed Types**

Under subsection 22.1(2) of the *Winding-up and Restructuring Act*, the following financial agreements are explicitly recognized as **eligible financial contracts**:

### **(a) Derivatives Agreements**
- Must either:
  - Trade on a **futures or options exchange or board**, or
  - Be subject to **recurrent dealings** in derivatives markets (including OTC markets for securities or commodities)

> *This ensures that only actively traded or market-standardized derivatives are eligible*, which supports transparency and liquidity in restructuring processes.

---

### **(b) Agreements to Borrow or Lend Securities or Commodities**
- Includes:
  - Agreements to transfer securities or commodities
  - Repayment options: with **other securities**, **commodities**, **cash**, or **cash equivalents**

> *Purpose:* To capture common financing arrangements where assets are temporarily lent or borrowed, especially in corporate restructuring or asset management contexts.

---

### **(c) Clearing or Settlement Agreements**
- Agreements to:
  - Clear or settle securities, futures, options, or derivatives transactions

> *Relevance:* These are essential for ensuring smooth and legally enforceable settlement of financial obligations during insolvency proceedings.

---

### **(d) Deposit or Delegation of Securities**
- Agreements where a party acts as a **depository** for securities

> *Example:* A custodian bank holding shares on behalf of a client.

> *Purpose:* To ensure that custody arrangements are recognized as binding financial obligations under restructuring laws.

---

### **(e) Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, or Buy-Sellback Agreements**
- With respect to **securities or commodities**

> *These are common in short-term financing and are often used in trading and margin operations.*

> *Note:* These are considered eligible even if they are structured as "repo" transactions.

---

### **(f) Margin Loans**
- Only those that are in respect of:
  - A **securities account** or
  - A **futures account**
  - And are maintained by a **financial intermediary**

> *Exclusion:* Margin loans not tied to such accounts are not eligible.

> *Rationale:* To prevent inclusion of speculative or non-standard lending arrangements.

---

### **(g) Master Agreements**
- A master agreement is eligible **if it governs**:
  - Any agreement listed in paragraphs (a) to (e), or
  - A master agreement itself (i.e., a master agreement governing other agreements)

> *Example:* A master netting agreement that covers multiple derivative contracts.

> *Purpose:* To streamline and consolidate obligations in restructuring, especially when multiple derivative contracts are involved.

---

### **(h) Guarantees, Indemnities, or Reimbursement Obligations**
- Any obligation to:
  - Guarantee, indemnify, or reimburse liabilities under any agreement listed in (a) to (g)

> *Purpose:* To ensure that collateral arrangements—especially those involving credit support—are recognized as part of the financial obligations under restructuring.

---

## **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Clarity and Scope**:  
   The regulations define a clear, structured list of financial instruments that are eligible to be included in insolvency or restructuring proceedings under the *Winding-up and Restructuring Act*. This helps courts and insolvency professionals determine which obligations are enforceable and can be restructured.

2. **Market-Based Eligibility**:  
   The requirement that derivatives trade on regulated markets or involve recurrent dealings ensures that only **liquid, transparent, and market-recognized instruments** are included. This reduces risk and enhances predictability in restructuring.

3. **Inclusion of Common Financial Instruments**:  
   The regulations cover standard instruments used in financial markets—such as repos, swaps, futures, and margin loans—ensuring that real-world financial practices are reflected in legal frameworks.

4. **Interconnection of Agreements**:  
   The inclusion of **master agreements** and **collateral arrangements** recognizes that financial obligations often exist in complex, interlinked networks. This allows for more efficient handling of multiple obligations during restructuring.

5. **Focus on Financial Intermediaries**:  
   By defining who qualifies as a financial intermediary, the regulations ensure that only entities with established roles in financial markets are involved in the custody, settlement, and lending of assets.

## **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **For Insolvency Proceedings**:  
  These regulations allow creditors and restructuring administrators to identify which financial contracts are legally binding and can be included in restructuring plans, asset swaps, or debt settlements.

- **For Financial Institutions**:  
  Banks, brokers, and clearing agencies must ensure that their contracts with clients (especially derivative and lending arrangements) are properly classified under these rules to avoid unintended exclusion or misclassification.

- **For Courts and Regulators**:  
  The clear definitions provide a consistent legal framework for determining the enforceability and treatment of financial obligations during corporate insolvency or restructuring.

- **For Market Participants**:  
  The regulations promote transparency and legal certainty by recognizing standard, market-based financial instruments, which helps maintain confidence in financial markets during periods of distress.

## **Conclusion**

The *Eligible Financial Contract Regulations* under the *Winding-up and Restructuring Act* serve a critical function in modern insolvency law by **defining which financial instruments are legally recognized as eligible** for inclusion in restructuring and winding-up processes. By focusing on **market-traded, transparent, and commonly used financial arrangements**, the regulations enhance legal clarity, promote fairness, and support effective financial restructuring—particularly in complex environments involving derivatives, securities lending, and intercompany guarantees.

They represent a significant step toward aligning Canadian insolvency law with global financial market practices, ensuring that restructuring is both practical and legally sound.
