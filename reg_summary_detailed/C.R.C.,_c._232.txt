**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Pedigreed Seed Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled the **Prince Edward Island Pedigreed Seed Order** and may be cited as such.  
- It serves as a legal instrument that establishes the framework for the regulation, marketing, and financial management of *pedigreed seed* in Prince Edward Island (PEI).

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order defines several core terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Prince Edward Island* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal authority for the Commodity Board to regulate the marketing of pedigreed seed.
  
- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Pedigreed Seed Commodity Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation). This body is established under the Act and is responsible for overseeing the marketing and economic management of pedigreed seed in PEI.

- **Pedigreed seed**: Defined as seed that is:
  - Produced within Prince Edward Island.
  - Meets the standards set out in the *Seeds Act* and any associated regulations made under that Act.
  - Marketed in accordance with those standards.
  - This ensures quality, traceability, and consistency in seed production and sale.

- **Plan**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Pedigreed Seed Commodity Marketing Plan* (Plan). This is a strategic document established and periodically amended under the Act. It outlines the goals, policies, and operational procedures for the marketing and distribution of pedigreed seed, including pricing, market access, and financial mechanisms.

### **3. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Trade**

- The Commodity Board is explicitly authorized to regulate the **marketing of pedigreed seed in interprovincial trade (sales to other provinces)** and **export trade (sales outside Canada)**.
- This authority extends to the same powers it holds for **local marketing within Prince Edward Island**, including:
  - Setting standards,
  - Managing market access,
  - Enforcing compliance,
  - Administering pricing and quality controls.

> This means the Board has the same regulatory tools and powers for out-of-province and international sales as it does for domestic sales, ensuring consistency and fairness across all markets.

---

### **4. Revocation of Previous Provision**

- A prior provision in the Order (specifically, the section previously cited as "Revoked, SOR/80-90") has been **cancelled or repealed**.  
- This indicates a revision in policy or administrative structure, likely to modernize or streamline the regulatory framework.

---

### **5. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**

This is a key financial provision of the Order. The Commodity Board is empowered to:

- **Make orders** (formal decisions) to:
  - Fix,
  - Impose,
  - Collect **levies or charges** from individuals or businesses engaged in:
    - The **production** of pedigreed seed,
    - The **marketing** of pedigreed seed,
    - And who are located within Prince Edward Island.

- The Board may **classify producers or marketers into different groups** (e.g., based on crop type, scale of operation, region, or production volume).

- Each group may be assigned a **different levy or charge**, allowing for differentiated financial responsibilities based on economic or operational factors.

> This classification system enables equitable and targeted financial planning across the seed industry.

---

### **6. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (financial buffers for future market needs or downturns),
- **Payment of operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, marketing, research, quality control),
- **Covering losses** arising from:
  - The sale or disposal of pedigreed seed (e.g., due to market failure, poor demand, or price drops),
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers:
  - The Board may redistribute funds to ensure that producers who realize lower returns from sales are compensated,
  - This helps promote **economic equity** and **stability** across the industry.

> This financial mechanism supports both the economic viability of the seed sector and the fair distribution of market outcomes.

---

### **7. Purpose and Significance**

This regulation serves several critical functions:

- **Market Stability**: By regulating interprovincial and export trade, it ensures consistent quality and fair competition.
- **Financial Sustainability**: The levy system provides a stable source of funding for the Commodity Board to support the industry.
- **Equity Among Producers**: The equalization mechanism helps mitigate risks and income disparities among small and large producers.
- **Compliance with Legal Framework**: The Order operates within the broader legal structure of the *Natural Products Marketing Act* and the *Seeds Act*, ensuring alignment with provincial agricultural policies.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Prince Edward Island Pedigreed Seed Order* establishes a comprehensive regulatory and financial framework for the marketing of pedigreed seed in PEI. It empowers the Commodity Board to manage both domestic and international markets effectively, while ensuring fair financial practices through targeted levies and income equalization. By linking economic outcomes to producer support, the Order promotes long-term sustainability, equity, and quality in PEI’s seed industry.
