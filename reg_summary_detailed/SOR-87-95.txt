### **Overview**

The *Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc. Regulations* are a set of government regulations enacted under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, based on recommendations from the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** and approved by the **Treasury Board**. These regulations were established under specific appropriation acts—**Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1a of Appropriation Act No. 1, 1980–81**, and **Vote 1e of Appropriation Act No. 4, 1981–82**—to provide financial insurance coverage for loans made to *Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc.* (VPSI), a Canadian shipbuilding company.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **ensure the continued operation of VPSI** until the completion of the *Henry Larson 1200 Series Icebreaker*, a significant maritime project, by providing a safety net for private lenders who finance the company’s operations.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**. This ministerial role was responsible for overseeing regional industrial development, including support for key industries like shipbuilding.

2. **Private Lender**  
   Defined as any lender (or its assignee) that is **not**:
   - The Government of Canada,
   - The government of any province of Canada,
   - An agency of any such government or a company effectively controlled by such a government or its agency,
   - A municipal corporation.

   This definition ensures that only **non-governmental, private financial institutions or individuals** are eligible to participate in the insurance scheme.

3. **Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc. (VPSI)**  
   A company incorporated under British Columbia law with its head office in **Vancouver, BC**. It is the beneficiary of the insurance and the entity whose operations are being supported through the loan insurance mechanism.

### **Core Purpose and Scope**

The regulations establish a **government-backed insurance program** for private loans extended to VPSI. The insurance is designed to:

- Enable VPSI to **continue operations** during the construction phase of the *Henry Larson 1200 Series Icebreaker*,
- Provide **financial protection** to private lenders who might otherwise face significant risk if the project fails or is delayed,
- Stabilize investment in critical infrastructure projects by reducing the risk associated with financing shipbuilding ventures.

### **Insurance Coverage Terms and Conditions**

#### **1. Coverage Amount**
- The insurance provided by the Minister is **limited to 100% of any loss** that may occur up to a **maximum cap of CAD 13 million**.
- This means:
  - If a private lender suffers a loss due to non-repayment or default on a loan to VPSI, the Minister will cover up to 100% of that loss.
  - However, the total payout cannot exceed **CAD 13 million**, regardless of the actual loss incurred.

#### **2. Insurance Trigger**
- The insurance applies **only to loans made by private lenders** to VPSI for the purpose of enabling the company to continue operations until the completion of the *Henry Larson 1200 Series Icebreaker*.

#### **3. Insurance Fee**
- Private lenders must pay an **annual fee** to the Minister to maintain insurance coverage.
- The fee is:
  - **0.5% per annum**,
  - Calculated as **half of one percent** of the **total amount of insurance currently in force**.
- Payments are made **semi-annually in advance** (i.e., before the period begins), ensuring predictable revenue for the government.

#### **4. Repayment Limitation**
- When a private lender demands repayment of a loan insured under these regulations, the Minister’s obligation is **limited to the lesser of two amounts**:
  1. The **amount of insurance in force on the date of demand**, and  
  2. **100% of the actual loss** incurred by the private lender.

> This means the Minister will not pay more than the insurance coverage amount available at the time of demand, nor will it exceed the actual financial loss suffered by the lender.

#### **5. Reduction of Insurance Coverage**
- A private lender may **request a reduction** in the amount of insurance coverage in force.
- This provision gives lenders flexibility to adjust their exposure based on changing financial conditions or risk assessments.

### **Legal and Administrative Framework**

- The regulations are **cited as the "Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc. Regulations"**.
- They are **binding legal instruments** that govern the relationship between the Minister, private lenders, and VPSI.
- The program operates under **federal fiscal authority**, as authorized by the Appropriation Acts, indicating that the government is using public funds to support private investment in a key industrial project.

### **Policy Rationale and Implications**

1. **Economic Development Objective**  
   The regulations support regional industrial expansion in British Columbia by helping to sustain a major shipbuilding enterprise, which contributes to employment, technological development, and national maritime capability.

2. **Risk Mitigation for Private Capital**  
   By offering insurance up to CAD 13 million, the government reduces the risk for private lenders, thereby encouraging investment in long-term, capital-intensive projects like icebreaker construction.

3. **Limited Government Exposure**  
   The cap of CAD 13 million ensures that the government’s financial exposure remains bounded, protecting public funds from unlimited liability.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   The requirement for semi-annual advance payments and the cap on payout ensure that the program is financially sustainable and transparent.

5. **Exclusion of Government Entities**  
   The definition of "private lender" excludes government bodies and their affiliated entities, reinforcing the program’s focus on **private-sector financing**.

### **Conclusion**

The *Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc. Regulations* represent a targeted, risk-managed financial intervention by the Canadian government to support a critical industrial project. By providing **limited insurance coverage** (up to CAD 13 million) for private loans to VPSI, the regulations:

- Enable continued operations of the shipyard,
- Protect private investors from financial loss,
- Promote economic stability in the shipbuilding sector,
- Operate within clear financial and administrative boundaries.

This regulatory framework exemplifies how governments can use insurance mechanisms to stimulate private investment in strategic infrastructure projects while maintaining fiscal responsibility and risk control.

**Note**: These regulations are historical in nature and were enacted in the early 1980s. They reflect the industrial policy priorities of that era, particularly in supporting regional industries and key infrastructure projects. Modern equivalents may now exist under different frameworks (e.g., federal industrial development programs or loan guarantees).
