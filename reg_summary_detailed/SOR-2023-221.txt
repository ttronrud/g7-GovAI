**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Atlantic Mud-piddock (Barnea truncata) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, a federal Canadian law enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which aims to prevent the extinction of wildlife species at risk and to promote their recovery. Specifically, the regulation is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA.

- **Section 58(1)** of SARA provides that the critical habitat of a listed species must be identified and protected to ensure the survival and recovery of the species.
- **Section 58(4)** authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFOD) to make an Order specifying the critical habitat of a species listed under SARA.
- **Section 58(5)** requires that the Order be based on a recovery strategy that has been formally adopted and included in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*.

**2. Species at Risk**

The species in question is the **Atlantic Mud-piddock (*Barnea truncata*)**, a benthic marine invertebrate commonly found in intertidal and subtidal sandy or muddy environments along the Atlantic coast of Canada.

- The species is officially listed as **"Threatened"** in **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act*.
- This listing reflects concerns about population decline due to habitat loss, degradation, and other environmental pressures.

---

**3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**

- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Atlantic Mud-piddock was developed and approved, identifying the specific geographic areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- This recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is the official, publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track species at risk and their associated recovery plans and designations.
- The critical habitat identified in this strategy is now legally recognized and serves as the basis for this Order.

---

**4. Key Provision of the Order**

- The Order **formally designates and specifies the critical habitat** of *Barnea truncata* as defined in the recovery strategy.
- It explicitly confirms that **no portion of the designated critical habitat lies within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.
  
> **Note on subsection 58(2)b**: This provision of SARA excludes certain areas (e.g., areas that are not suitable for the species or are subject to specific exemptions) from being designated as critical habitat. The fact that no portion of the habitat falls within such excluded areas means the entire identified habitat is eligible and protected under the Act.

This exclusion is significant because it ensures that the critical habitat is fully protected under SARA without being overridden by exceptions or exemptions.

---

**5. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- The Order is **binding and enforceable** under the *Species at Risk Act*.
- It establishes legal protection for the identified areas of critical habitat, meaning that any activities that could result in the destruction, disruption, or degradation of these areas require **prior ministerial approval** or are otherwise prohibited unless justified under specific exemptions.
- The designation ensures that federal agencies and developers must consider the impact of their actions on the species’ habitat during planning, permitting, and project development.

---

**6. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official journal of federal laws).
- Registration occurs after the Order is published and formally adopted by the government, ensuring transparency and public access to the legal designation.

---

**7. Purpose and Significance**

- This Order is a key step in the **protection and recovery** of the Atlantic Mud-piddock.
- By legally defining and protecting its critical habitat, the government ensures that:
  - The species has access to essential environmental conditions (such as suitable substrate, water quality, and stability).
  - Habitat degradation from human activities (e.g., coastal development, dredging, or pollution) is minimized.
  - The recovery strategy can be effectively implemented and monitored.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Atlantic Mud-piddock (Barnea truncata) Order* is a legally binding instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* that formally identifies and protects the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of this threatened marine species. It is grounded in a scientifically sound recovery strategy, complies with all statutory requirements, and ensures that no protected area falls under excluded provisions. The Order strengthens conservation efforts and supports long-term biodiversity goals in Canada’s marine ecosystems.
