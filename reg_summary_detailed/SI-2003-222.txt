**Summary of the Transfer:**

On December 12, 2003, the Government of Canada formally transferred control and supervision of specific components of the **Treasury Board Secretariat** to the newly established **Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMA)**.

This transfer was part of a broader restructuring initiative aimed at improving the efficiency, accountability, and effectiveness of human resources (HR) management within the federal public service.

---

**Scope of the Transfer:**

The following units and divisions of the **Human Resources Management Office (HRMO)** within the Treasury Board Secretariat were transferred:

- All functions and responsibilities of the HRMO, **excluding** the following divisions and branches:

  1. **Labour Relations and Compensation Operations Division**  
     → *Retained within the Treasury Board Secretariat*  
     → This division handles labour relations, workplace disputes, and compensation matters involving public servants.

  2. **Risk Management (Human Resources) Division**  
     → *Retained within the Treasury Board Secretariat*  
     → Manages HR-related risk assessments, compliance, and internal controls.

  3. **Pensions and Benefits Division**  
     → *Retained within the Treasury Board Secretariat*  
     → Oversees pension plans, benefits administration, and retirement services for public servants.

  4. **Compensation Planning Division**  
     → *Retained within the Treasury Board Secretariat*  
     → Responsible for salary structures, pay equity, and compensation policy development.

  5. **Official Languages Branch**  
     → *Retained within the Treasury Board Secretariat*

**What Was Transferred:**

The **core HR management functions** of the Treasury Board Secretariat — specifically those related to:

- Recruitment and hiring
- Performance management
- Training and development
- Workforce planning
- Pay equity and compensation policy (excluding the Compensation Planning Division, which remains with Treasury Board)
- Employee relations (excluding Labour Relations and Compensation Operations)
- HR policy development and implementation
- Organizational development and workforce strategy

These functions were moved to the **Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMA)** to create a more focused, specialized, and independent body dedicated to HR management across the federal public service.

---

**Purpose and Rationale:**

The transfer was designed to:

- Improve the strategic focus of HR management by removing it from the broader administrative functions of the Treasury Board Secretariat.
- Enhance accountability and responsiveness in human resource decision-making.
- Strengthen HR policy development and implementation through a dedicated agency.
- Align with modern public service reform goals emphasizing performance, transparency, and employee well-being.
- Support the broader vision of a more agile, results-oriented, and employee-centered public service.

---

**Significance:**

This regulation marked a significant structural shift in the governance of federal human resources. It represented a move toward **specialization and institutional separation**, where HR functions were no longer embedded within the general administrative operations of the Treasury Board Secretariat.

The establishment of the PSHRMA allowed for greater expertise, innovation, and oversight in managing the federal workforce — while preserving key oversight and compliance functions (such as ethics, pensions, and official languages) within the Treasury Board Secretariat.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation effectively reorganized federal human resources governance by transferring the core HR management functions of the Treasury Board Secretariat to the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada, effective December 12, 2003. The transfer was carefully scoped to exclude critical areas such as labour relations, pensions, benefits, official languages, ethics, and integrity — which were retained to maintain continuity and oversight in those essential domains.

The move reflected a strategic effort to modernize and professionalize public service human resources management in Canada.
