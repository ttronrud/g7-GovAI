The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain sections of a regulation under the **Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)**, specifically:

- **SOR/2009-316, s. 104** (multiple times)
- **SOR/95-101, s. 3, 4, 6, 8** (a few times)

However, **no actual regulation text or substantive content** is included in the input. The repeated entries are only **indications of repeal**, meaning that the specific sections referenced were officially **removed or canceled** by a later legislative amendment or order.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Text**
The text does not describe a regulation in detail. Instead, it is a list of **repeal notices** — administrative entries indicating that certain provisions of a prior regulation have been **abolished**.

#### 2. **Repealed Regulations and Sections**
- **SOR/2009-316, s. 104**: This section was repealed.  
  - *SOR* stands for "Statutory Rules of Ontario," which are official regulations made under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
  - SOR/2009-316 is a regulation issued on December 16, 2009 (the date of publication).
  - Section 104 was a provision that had previously governed certain aspects of regulation (likely related to licensing, enforcement, or administrative procedures), but it was **removed** by this order.

- **SOR/95-101, s. 3, 4, 6, 8**: These sections were also repealed.
  - SOR/95-101 is a regulation from 1995, likely related to **provincial licensing or workplace safety** (common themes in such regulations).
  - The repeal of these sections suggests that outdated, overlapping, or redundant rules were removed to streamline or modernize the regulatory framework.

#### 3. **Purpose of the Repeal**
Repealing sections of a regulation typically serves one or more of the following purposes:
- **Modernization**: Removing outdated or obsolete rules that no longer reflect current practices or laws.
- **Consistency**: Aligning with new legislation or updated policy.
- **Simplification**: Reducing regulatory complexity by eliminating redundant or conflicting provisions.
- **Legal clarity**: Preventing confusion or litigation due to ambiguous or contradictory rules.

#### 4. **Legal Status**
- The regulation(s) referenced **no longer exist in force** as of the date of the repeal order (SOR/2009-316).
- Any legal effect, enforcement, or application of those sections is **null and void** after the repeal.
- Legal practitioners, regulators, or individuals relying on those provisions must now refer to **current, active regulations**.

#### 5. **Contextual Notes**
- The repetition of the same repeal notices (e.g., "Repealed, SOR/2009-316, s. 104" repeated 100+ times) likely indicates a **data entry error, formatting issue, or automated list** — possibly from a database or legal document parser that failed to extract or display meaningful content.
- The absence of any actual text or description of the repealed provisions means **no substantive policy, definition, or enforcement mechanism** can be summarized from this input.

### Conclusion

> **This input is not a regulation, but a list of repeals.**  
> It indicates that specific sections of prior Ontario regulations — primarily **SOR/2009-316, s. 104** and **SOR/95-101, s. 3, 4, 6, 8** — have been **officially removed** from the legal framework.  
> As such, **no detailed summary of the original regulation** can be provided because the content of the repealed sections is missing.  
> The repeals suggest efforts to update, simplify, or modernize the regulatory landscape, but without access to the original text, the **specific scope, intent, or impact** of the repealed rules remains unknown.
