Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

---

# **Reduction in the Release of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) – Petroleum Sector Regulations (2017)**  
*Under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*

---

## **I. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

### **1.1 Legal Basis**
These regulations were established under **subsection 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, which allows the Governor in Council to make regulations to reduce the release of hazardous substances into the environment, particularly when such releases threaten human health or the environment.

The regulations were proposed on **May 27, 2017**, and published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, giving stakeholders a formal opportunity to:
- Submit comments,
- File a **notice of objection**, which would trigger a **board of review** to assess the proposed rules.

### **1.2 Consultation Process**
- The **National Advisory Committee** was consulted under **section 6c** of CEPA 1999, as required by subsection 93(3).
- The Governor in Council concluded, pursuant to subsection 93(4), that the proposed regulations **do not conflict** with other federal environmental laws and provide **sufficient protection** to human health and the environment.

Thus, the regulations were finalized and enacted on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health**, under **section 286.1d** of CEPA 1999.

## **II. Scope and Applicability**

### **2.1 Who Is Covered?**
The regulations apply to **facilities that produce liquid petroleum products** through distillation or processing of:
- Crude oil or bitumen,
- Mixtures of crude oil/bitumen and other hydrocarbons,
- Partially refined feedstocks derived from crude oil or bitumen.

Additionally, the regulations apply to **petrochemical facilities** that are **operated in an integrated way** with a petroleum-producing facility and share **at least one operator**.

> **Definition of “Adjacent” Facilities**:  
> Facilities separated by a railway track or road are considered “adjacent” for regulatory purposes.

### **2.2 Exclusions**
The following equipment components are **exempt from inventory listing and inspection requirements**:
- Equipment normally operated at **internal pressure ≤ 5 kPa below ambient**,
- Equipment located **underground**,
- **Seal-less pumps** (e.g., canned-motor, diaphragm pumps),
- **Bellows seal valves**,
- **Diaphragm valves**,
- **Storage vessels**,
- **Oil-water separators**,
- **Minor assemblies** (see below).

> *Note: Minor assemblies are defined as components made up of up to 25 other equipment components, connected together, contacting the same fluid, and with a diameter <1.875 cm.*

## **III. Key Requirements for Operators**

### **3.1 Leak Detection and Repair (LDR) Program**
Every operator must establish and maintain a **Leak Detection and Repair (LDR) Program** that includes:

| Requirement | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Inventory of Equipment Components** | Must be maintained and updated annually. |
| **Leak Detection Instruments** | Must be operated, maintained, and calibrated according to strict EPA standards. |
| **Inspections** | Conducted at least 3 times per year for most components. |
| **Recordkeeping** | Detailed records must be kept and retained for at least 5 years. |
| **Training** | Inspectors must complete training within 12 months prior to first inspection. |

---

## **IV. Equipment Component Inventory Requirements**

### **4.1 What Must Be Listed?**
All equipment components **except the exempted ones** must be included in the inventory.

### **4.2 Required Information in Inventory**
For each listed component, the inventory must include:
- Identification number,
- Type (from Schedule 1),
- Process unit location,
- Location within the process unit,
- Designation **“unsafe to inspect”** if inspection would expose individuals to immediate danger.

### **4.3 Designation of “Difficult to Inspect” (Before 2027)**
Before **January 1, 2027**, any equipment component located **more than 2 meters above a permanent support surface** must be designated as **“difficult to inspect”**.

> This designation triggers **annual inspection** (not 3 times per year), to ensure compliance with accessibility and safety standards.

### **4.4 Inventory Update Frequency**
The inventory must be updated **only once per calendar year**, **before the first inspection** of that year.

---

## **V. Leak Detection Instruments: Technical Standards**

### **5.1 Portable Monitoring Instruments (Porous or Active)**
Must meet **EPA Method 21** (for VOC leak detection), with modifications:

| Requirement | Details |
|----------|--------|
| **Sample Flow Rate** | Must be between **0.2 and 1.2 L/min** (vs. original EPA Method 21 requirement). |
| **Calibration** | Must be performed daily using **methane (FID)** or **isobutylene (PID)** as reference compounds. |
| **Response Factor** | If the response factor of the fluid is <1, it **cannot be applied** to inspection readings. |
| **Calibration Precision & Response Time** | Must pass a **precision test** and have a **response time ≤ 5 seconds**. |
| **Calibration Method** | Internal detector count must be assigned to known gas concentration (not adjusted via meter readout). |
| **Daily Drift Assessment** | Required at the end of each day of use (per US EPA 40 CFR §60.485a(b)(2)). |

> *Note: Instruments must be maintained per manufacturer’s specifications.*

---

### **5.2 Optical Gas-Imaging (OGI) Instruments**
Must meet:
- **EPA 40 CFR §60.18(h)(7)(i)(1)**,
- Be operated and maintained per manufacturer’s instructions,
- Be **checked daily** before first use (per §60.18(h)(7)(i)(2)(i)–(v)),
