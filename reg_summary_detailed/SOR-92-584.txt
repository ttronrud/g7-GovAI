### **Detailed Summary of the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 1992**

---

#### **Background and Context**

This regulation, known as the *Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 1992*, was enacted by the Government of Canada on **October 9, 1992**, in response to a proposed U.S. policy measure that was expected to significantly impact Canadian trade and commercial relations with Cuba.

The key trigger for this order was **Section 1706(a)(1)** of the **National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993**, which was passed by the U.S. Congress on **October 5, 1992**. This section proposed amendments to the **Cuban Assets Control Regulations (31 C.F.R. § 515.559)**—a U.S. regulatory framework that restricts U.S. persons from engaging in certain trade or financial transactions with Cuba.

Canada viewed this U.S. measure as potentially **adversely affecting significant Canadian economic interests**, particularly in trade and commerce involving Canadian businesses operating in whole or in part in Canada. It also raised concerns about **infringement of Canadian sovereignty**, as the U.S. regulation would impose extraterritorial controls on Canadian entities and individuals engaged in commerce with Cuba.

#### **Legal Basis**

The Order is grounded in **Section 5 of the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (FEAMA)**, which empowers the **Attorney General of Canada**, with the concurrence of the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, to:

- **Revoke** existing foreign extraterritorial measures orders when a U.S. measure is likely to harm Canadian trade or sovereignty, and  
- **Make a new order** to protect Canadian interests by requiring notification and prohibiting compliance with such U.S. measures.

This Order specifically revokes the earlier *Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order (1990)* (SOR/90-751), which had been in force since October 1990, and replaces it with a more targeted and updated regulation applicable to the 1993 U.S. proposal.

#### **Key Provisions of the Order**

##### **1. Definition of Key Terms**

- **Canadian Corporation**:  
  Any corporation registered or incorporated under Canadian or provincial law that carries on business in whole or in part within Canada.

- **Extraterritorial Measure of the United States**:  
  This is broadly defined to include:
  - The **Cuban Assets Control Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 515)**, as amended or replaced over time, and  
  - Any other U.S. law, regulation, directive, policy, ruling, or communication (whether legislative, executive, administrative, judicial, or quasi-judicial) that:
    - Has a purpose similar to the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, and  
    - Is likely to **prevent, impede, or reduce trade or commerce between Canada and Cuba**.

> This broad definition ensures that even non-regulatory actions (e.g., executive directives or policy statements) that could restrict Canadian-Cuban trade are covered.

- **Trade or Commerce Between Canada and Cuba**:  
  Includes:
  - The free exchange of goods and services,  
  - Between Canadian nationals, corporations, or government institutions and Cuban counterparts, and  
  - Canadian entities that are **designated or treated as Cuban nationals or corporations** under a U.S. extraterritorial measure (e.g., "specially designated national" status).

> This definition explicitly includes cases where Canadian entities are indirectly restricted due to U.S. designations.

##### **2. Mandatory Notification Requirement**

Every **Canadian corporation** and every **director or officer** of such a corporation must:

- **Immediately notify** the **Attorney General of Canada** of any communication from a person in a position to influence corporate policy regarding a U.S. extraterritorial measure affecting trade with Cuba.

**Who must give notice?**  
- Directors, officers, or employees who are in a position to influence corporate decisions.

**How is notice given?**  
- By an **authorized agent** of the corporation (if the individual is not directly responsible for giving the notice).

**Content of the Notice (must include):**
1. Name(s) and capacity(ies) of the person(s) giving the notice (or the agent on whose behalf it is given);  
2. Name(s) and capacity(ies) of the source(s) of the communication;  
3. Full text of the communication (or, if not written, a clear summary of its purport);  
4. Date(s) when the communication was received;  
5. Duration for which the communication is intended to be effective.

> The notice must be sent by **registered mail** to the Attorney General in Ottawa.

##### **3. Prohibition on Compliance**

No Canadian corporation or individual in a position of authority (e.g., director, officer, manager, employee) may:

- **Comply with** any U.S. extraterritorial measure (including the Cuban Assets Control Regulations) or  
- **Comply with any directive, instruction, or policy communication** received from a person who can influence corporate policy,  
in respect of **any trade or commerce between Canada and Cuba**.

> This prohibition applies **regardless of whether compliance is the sole purpose** of the action. Even if a business decision is made for other reasons, if it involves compliance with a U.S. measure restricting trade with Cuba, it is prohibited.

---

##### **4. Scope and Application**

- The provisions apply to **all acts or omissions** that constitute compliance with a U.S. extraterritorial measure or a related communication.
- The prohibition is not limited to direct financial transactions but extends to any activity in trade or commerce with Cuba.

---

#### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **To protect Canadian economic interests** by preventing Canadian businesses from being forced into compliance with U.S. sanctions that restrict trade with Cuba.
2. **To preserve Canadian sovereignty** by ensuring that Canadian entities are not subject to foreign extraterritorial legal or regulatory controls without Canadian consent or review.
3. **To provide early warning** through mandatory reporting so that Canadian authorities can monitor, assess, and respond to potential U.S. policy actions that could disrupt Canadian-Cuban trade.
4. **To uphold Canada’s autonomy** in managing its international trade relationships, particularly in areas involving non-U.S. jurisdictions.

---

#### **Significance and Implications**

- This Order reflects Canada’s **assertion of national sovereignty** in the face of U.S. extraterritorial regulations.
- It establishes a **legal framework** that allows Canadian businesses to operate freely in trade with Cuba without being bound by U.S. sanctions, even if those sanctions are based on U.S. domestic law.
- It sets a precedent for how Canada may respond to future U.S. extraterritorial measures affecting Canadian trade with other countries.
- It underscores Canada’s commitment to **non-intervention** in the internal affairs of other nations while protecting its own economic and commercial interests.

#### **Comparison with the 1990 Order**

| Feature | Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (U.S.) Order, 1990 | Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (U.S.) Order, 1992 |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trigger** | General U.S. extraterritorial measures | Specific U.S. proposal under 1993 NDAA (Section 1706) |
| **Scope** | Broad, general extraterritorial measures | Focused on Cuban Assets Control Regulations and trade with Cuba |
| **Notification** | Less detailed requirements | Clear, structured format for notice |
| **Prohibition** | General prohibition on compliance | Explicit, comprehensive ban on compliance with U.S. measures |

#### **Conclusion**

The *Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 1992* is a significant piece of Canadian regulatory policy that demonstrates the country’s ability to **protect its economic and legal sovereignty** in the face of foreign extraterritorial laws. By requiring mandatory notification and prohibiting compliance with U.S. measures that restrict trade with Cuba, Canada ensures that its businesses can operate freely in international commerce without being subject to U.S. sanctions.

This Order remains a **key reference** in Canadian foreign policy and trade law, particularly in cases involving U.S. sanctions and extraterritorial reach. It continues to serve as a model for how other jurisdictions may respond to similar foreign regulatory overreach.
