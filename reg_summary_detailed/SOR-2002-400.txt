**Detailed Summary of the CCRFTA Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 49.3(1)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the power to establish aggregate quantity limits on specific goods that are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under a free trade agreement.

The regulation is specifically tied to the **Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement (CCRFTA)** and is implemented under the **Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 37)**. This statutory framework enables Canada to manage and regulate the importation of certain goods from Costa Rica under the terms of the free trade agreement.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this **Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order** is to impose a **maximum aggregate quantity limit** on specific sugar-related goods imported from Costa Rica that are entitled to the **Costa Rica Tariff** (a preferential tariff rate under the CCRFTA). 

This measure is designed to:
- Prevent over-reliance on sugar imports from Costa Rica,
- Protect domestic sugar producers and markets,
- Ensure that the benefits of the free trade agreement are used in a balanced and sustainable manner,
- Maintain Canada’s trade policy objectives and economic stability.

**3. Scope of the Tariff Items Affected**  
The regulation applies to goods falling under the following **Harmonized System (HS) tariff item numbers**:

- 1701.91.90  
- 1701.99.90  
- 1702.90.11  
- 1702.90.12  
- 1702.90.13  
- 1702.90.14  
- 1702.90.15  
- 1702.90.16  
- 1702.90.17  
- 1702.90.18  
- 1702.90.89  

These HS codes generally cover **sugar and sugar products**, including:
- Raw sugar  
- Refined sugar  
- Sugar syrups and molasses  
- Sugar used in processed foods or industrial applications  

The goods must be **entitled to the Costa Rica Tariff**, meaning they are being imported under the preferential tariff regime established by the CCRFTA.

**4. Aggregate Quantity Limit**  
The regulation establishes a **maximum total quantity** (i.e., an aggregate limit) of these sugar-related goods that may be imported from Costa Rica during a specified period.  

- The **aggregate quantity limit** is set out in **column 2 of the schedule** attached to the regulation.  
- The **period** during which this limit applies is specified in **column 1 of the schedule**.  

For example, the schedule may state:
- Period: January 1, 2003 – December 31, 2003  
- Aggregate Quantity Limit: 100,000 metric tons  

This means that the total quantity of eligible sugar goods imported from Costa Rica during that period cannot exceed the specified amount. Any importation exceeding this limit would be subject to non-preferential tariff treatment or other restrictions.

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the date that **Section 37 of the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2001, c. 28)** comes into force.  

This ensures that the regulation is activated in coordination with the broader implementation of the CCRFTA, providing legal and administrative consistency in the application of preferential tariff rules.

**6. Legal and Administrative Notes**  
- **Reference to Prior Statutes**: The regulation references **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which may relate to earlier provisions or administrative frameworks for implementing free trade agreements.  
- **Note on Enforcement**: As of **November 1, 2002**, this regulation was in force (as noted in SI/2002-146 – a Statutory Instrument issued to update or confirm enforcement status). This indicates that the regulation has been formally adopted and is actively administered by Canadian customs authorities.  
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: Customs authorities are responsible for monitoring imports and verifying that the aggregate quantity limit is not exceeded. Any violation may result in the denial of preferential tariff treatment or imposition of regular duties.

---

**7. Key Implications**  
- **For Importers**: Importers must carefully track and report their total sugar imports from Costa Rica to ensure compliance with the aggregate limit. Exceeding the limit may result in the loss of preferential tariff status.  
- **For Costa Rica**: The limit may affect the volume and value of sugar exports to Canada, potentially influencing trade negotiations or future adjustments to the agreement.  
- **For Canadian Policy**: The regulation reflects a balance between promoting trade with Costa Rica and protecting domestic markets from potential market distortions due to large-scale sugar imports.

---

**Conclusion**  
This **Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order** is a targeted regulatory measure under the CCRFTA framework. It establishes a cap on the total volume of specific sugar goods that can be imported from Costa Rica under the preferential Costa Rica Tariff during a defined period. By doing so, it ensures equitable and sustainable trade benefits under the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement while safeguarding domestic economic interests. The regulation is legally grounded, clearly defined, and implemented in alignment with the broader objectives of the free trade agreement.
