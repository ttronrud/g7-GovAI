Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation — a **Proclamation issued by the Governor in Council** under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* — which formally declares the **draft representation order for federal electoral districts in Canada** for the period following the 2001 census.

## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation: Electoral Boundaries Readjustment (Canada, 2003)**

### 🔹 **1. Legal Authority and Context**

- **Issuing Body**: The Governor in Council of Canada (acting on the advice of the Privy Council).
- **Proclamation Number**: P.C. 2003-1294
- **Date of Proclamation**: August 25, 2003
- **Legal Basis**: Section 25 of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (E-3 of the Revised Statutes Canada, 1985, as amended).
- **Purpose**: To officially adopt and implement a draft representation order for federal electoral districts across Canada, based on population data from the 2001 decennial census.

> **Key Provision (Section 25)**:  
> The Governor in Council must declare a draft representation order into force **within five days** of receiving it from the Chief Electoral Officer. Once declared, the order becomes effective on the **first dissolution of Parliament that occurs at least one year after the proclamation date**. This ensures a delay between the finalization of boundaries and the next federal election, allowing time for public notice and potential appeals.
