**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Order Granting Remission of Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods*  
(Referenced as: S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j); and S.C. 1997, c. 36)

### **Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes a framework for the **remission (i.e., refund or cancellation)** of the **surtax** imposed on the importation of certain steel goods. The surtax was originally introduced under the *Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods*, which was enacted to address concerns related to the impact of steel imports on domestic industries.

This specific Order allows for a **partial or full refund** of the surtax paid by importers, under certain conditions, to provide relief where the goods fall within specific categories that were either explicitly included or excluded from the original surtax application.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Scope of Remission**
Remission of the surtax (or any portion thereof) is granted for the following goods:

- **Goods described in paragraphs 1(c) to (i) of the schedule** to the original *Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods*.
- **Goods that are expressly excluded from item 2 of the schedule** to that original Order.

> *Note:* The original Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36) likely defined specific steel products subject to surtax, with some exclusions. This regulation applies to those goods that were either:
> - Explicitly listed in the "c" to "i" categories (which may represent certain types of steel products like flat-rolled steel, structural steel, etc.), or
> - Excluded from the broader category in item 2 of the schedule (which may have been a general category of steel goods).

Thus, remission applies only to **specific, defined categories** of steel goods—not all steel imports.

#### **2. Conditions for Remission**

Two key conditions must be met for a claim of remission to be valid:

1. **No Prior Relief Claimed**  
   The importer must not have previously received any claim for relief (refund or offset) of the surtax (or part of it) under the *Customs Tariff* in respect of those same goods.  
   > This ensures that the remission is not double-claimed and prevents abuse of the relief mechanism.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   The importer must file a formal claim for remission with the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** **within two years** of the date of importation of the goods.  
   > This establishes a clear time limit for claiming relief, promoting timely administration and accountability.

---

#### **3. Regulatory Authority and Process**

- The Order is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is enacted under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff**, which authorizes the government to make such remission orders in specific circumstances.
- The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette), not on a fixed date.

---

### **Key Implications and Considerations**

- **Targeted Relief**: The remission is not universal. It applies only to specific steel goods as defined in the schedule, and only where they meet the exclusion or inclusion criteria.
- **Importers Must Act Promptly**: The two-year deadline for claiming remission is strict. Failure to file within this period results in forfeiture of the right to claim remission.
- **No Double Relief**: The regulation prevents importers from claiming surtax relief more than once for the same goods, ensuring fiscal integrity.
- **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**: Although the Minister of Finance is involved in the initial recommendation, the actual administrative handling of remission claims is managed by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness—possibly due to the historical role of that department in managing industrial and emergency-related regulations.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted, time-bound, and conditionally available refund mechanism** for importers of specific steel goods that were subject to a surtax. It balances the need to support domestic industries with the requirement to maintain fiscal discipline and prevent abuse of the relief system. Importers must ensure that their goods qualify under the schedule, that no prior relief was claimed, and that they submit a claim to the appropriate minister within two years of importation to be eligible for remission.

This Order reflects a practical and administratively sound approach to managing the economic impact of import surtaxes while maintaining compliance and transparency in customs and trade policy.
